50 First Dates," Love some Spam and Reese's peanut butter cups
","50 First Dates finds Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore returning to form with another great pairing. These two seem to have tremendous chemistry and they don't have to work at it too much. Sandler carries the movie quite well and seems to be enjoying himself. I was glad to see Sean Astin do a comedic performance after the drama that was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And Rob Schneider steals every scene he is in.(When he put the joint in the crack of his ass, I almost fell off the couch) My mother even enjoyed this movie and she isn't usually a fan of Sandler's high school humor. But this movie mixes enough low-brow with sweet,sentimental moments to create a fun movie that feels so refreshing. I give it a 7 out of 10 and would have given it an 8 if she had gotten her memory back or had at least been on the track to doing so. *Look for the Happy Gilmore reference*",Null,0,0,6 July 2004
Spider-Man 2," 'Spins a Web Any Size, Catches Thieves Just Like Flies'
","Spider-man 2 opened today and I was elated as my local multiplex had a showing at 11 in the morning. I rushed to get there and I wasn't surprised at the multitude of people there. Spider-man 2 has been hyped for a while and this movie lived up to its top billing. By far. The film picks up 2 years after the first one left off as Peter is in college and working as a pizza delivery boy, but failing miserable at both thanks to his 'extracurricular activities'. Mary Jane is in school and doing quite well for herself as an actress. Harry has taken over the Osborne corporation from his deceased father and is also hell-bent on avenging his father's death. The story moves quickly,but not too fast as to take away from plot development. Peter meets Dr. Octavius,a scientist whom Peter is writing a paper on, through Harry. Dr. Octavius is working on an experiment with fusion and has a horrible accident which leaves him with 4 metal limbs causing him to work for evil. But Spider-man isn't so anxious to stop him, as Peter gives up being the web slinger to live a normal life. That's all I'll say without giving away the WHOLE movie, but that's a good outline. I found Spider-man 2 to be absolutely delightful and even better than its predecessor. No movie this year has mixed humor,action,drama,and heart felt emotion like this film. What really helps is all of the original cast is back, even though Tobey Maguire almost backed out due to an injury. The scene stealer in this film is J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson. His character is given much more screen time and has some really funny lines. Just like the first, this movie has re-watch value and that is a major plus. It also sets up the 3rd installment in the series without giving away too much. All in all, it's a wonderful film that everyone should see be it young or old. This is why we go to the movies.",8,0,0,30 June 2004
The Bourne Identity," First Rate Thriller, Get Bourne!
","I'm not usually a fan of action movies, but I do enjoy ones like this one that have a motive and some suspense to it as opposed to all the standard blowing crap up just for cool special effects. The Bourne Identity is well-crafted and the scenery is absolutely beautiful. Matt Damon gives his finest performance to date as Jason Bourne, a man who washes up on a boat at sea and has no clue who he is. However, he begins to discover some of his 'previous' life and learns that he was a CIA trained assassin. However,his mission that he was supposed to carry out was a failure and now the CIA is after him at any means possible so they can cover their own asses. Chris Cooper does a fine job as the mastermind trying to bring Bourne down, and he helps the movie have such an eerie feel to it. This movie gets an 8 out of 10 for me for being different and the chase scenes are intense. The scene at Maria's friend's house was awesome, what with the one on one hunt and all. The sequel looks to be action-packed as well. I didn't even know these movies were based on a set of books, even though now they are on my must read list.",Null,0,1,22 July 2004
Saw," Glad That I Have Now Seen Saw
","Saw is a wonderfully crafted thriller by a first-time director. Think what you will about the plot,acting,etc but fact of the matter is, I watched this movie to be entertained and Saw does just that. While not the horror gore fest it was made out to be, it does have some nice creepy moments(the puppet) and a terrific ending that literally left my jaw dropping when it occurred. Nice to see Cary Elwes back in a lead role as it seems he's been gone for a decade now. Bravo to a low-budget film that is worth every minute of the 100 minutes of running time. The tricks of the game are fun to watch and the whole movie has a dark setting which adds to the effect of what you are seeing. Go rent Saw and see it for yourself.",8,0,0,16 February 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," His News Is Bigger Than Your News!
","Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy is the perfect retro movie that Starsky and Hutch aimed to be earlier this year. Some of the laughs for me were the sight gags involving the clothes,the hair,and the insane amount of smoking. Will Farrell once again, like him or loathe him and it's easy to fell both in this film,turns in another great comedic performance that solidifies his status as a leading man in Hollywood. Burgundy is the lead anchor at Channel 4 News in San Diego and is terrified when, of all things, a woman(Christina Applegate)named Veronica Corningstone is hired at the station to be a field reporter. Burgundy and his posse, consisting of Brian Fantana(played by Paul Rudd who I found to be absolutely hilarious as it was a nice change of pace from his normal good guy roles), Champ Kind(David Koechner), and Brick Tamland(Steve Carrell who once again steals the scenes as he did in Bruce Almighty) set out to destroy Miss Corningstone. Their plans are thwarted however when Burgundy falls madly in love with her. What ensues next is pure hilarity. Anchorman lets you know from the get-go that it is pure farce and nothing to take seriously. Just 91 minutes of extreme fun and silliness. Nice touch to see fellow 'Frat Pack' members Vince Vaughn,Ben Stiller,Jack Black,and Luke Wilson as well as Tim Robbins turn up in a Gangs of New York themed street fight between rival stations. But the movie starts and ends with Farrell, who while being the biggest jerk in the movie, actually makes you root for him when he's down on his luck. I give it a 7 out of 10. Thanks for reading my review and 'Stay Classy!'",7,0,0,9 July 2004
The Terminal," I am unacceptable
","The Terminal marks the 3rd time Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have worked together and I think this is their best effort. Basically Hanks plays an immigrant named Victor, who is on his way to New York when he is told at JFK Airport that he cannot leave the premises because his country is in a war. Victor stays in the airport and is under constant supervision by the head of security(played well by Stanley Tucci). While there, he begins living in Gate 67 and starts to speak the English language. After a while, Victor meets a flight attendant named Amelia(played well by Catherine-Zeta Jones),and they bump into each other every time she returns from a flight. As their friendship develops, they talk about Napoleon and history books that are metaphors for their own lives. Amelia reveals that she is cursed in relationships and doesn't want to hurt Victor. Victor also gets a job at the airport and befriends all the employees who were suspicious of him. Victor has a big reason for wanting to go to New York and it really is a nice one. Spielberg allows Hanks' character to develop with each and every passing minute of the film and Hanks nails it with another dynamic performance. Tucci is tailor-made for his role and Zeta-Jones does the best she can with her limited screen time. At 128 minutes, the movie tends to wear down a little and could have had 20 minutes shaved off, but the film does well regardless. The Terminal is a nice find in the summer season and is a fresh change from all the mindless,loud,popcorn flicks. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,1,20 June 2004
Sin City," Welcome to Sin City(Population: Fading Fast)
","I had never read Frank Miller's short stories, nor anything else pertaining to Sin City, so I went into the theater tonight with a clear mind. And I think it helped. I loved it because it was all so new to me and if were familiar with his works, then I would have critiqued and pointed out every meticulous detail that differed from the comics. This really felt like an honest-to-God comic book coming to life what with the narration and black and white(save for a few colors) settings. This film featured a huge ensemble cast and each one brought something different to the table. My favorite performance was Mickey Rourke as Marv and I had no idea that was him underneath the make-up. Jessica Alba,Bruce Willis,Michael Madsen,Elijah Wood,Benicio Del Toro,Rosario Dawson(so damn hot!) all fit in nicely. I will not spoil anything because there is too much to cover but the basic premise is Marv looking for the killer of a prostitute named Goldie that had befriended him. There is a lot of violence in this film, but nothing over the top that would be considered controversial. 3 separate stories intertwine to make up an interesting and fresh movie. Destined to become a cult classic and a sequel would be hard-pressed not to be made.",7,0,1,2 April 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Get Bourne Again!
","The Bourne Supremacy is that rare sequel that more than holds its own to the original, as well as a being a standout film in an already over-saturated summer season. Matt Damon once again turns in a stellar performance as Jason Bourne, who struggles daily with the memories of his time as an ex-CIA trained assassin. After living a free life for the last 2 years, he is set up to take the fall for 2 agents' deaths in Berlin. So once again it's up to he and Marie to stay one step ahead of them. This movie features 2 well put together car chase scenes and the action is breath-taking. I especially liked the expanded role of Brian Cox's character. He was convincing and chilling in his scenes and Joan Allen is a fresh face following in the footsteps of Chris Cooper in The Bourne Identity. The fact that it was raining tonight helped set the mood for me as I got in the theater. I'm not going to get into whether I think it was better or worse than the first one. I'm just going to say if you liked The Bourne Identity at all then you owe it to yourself to check this one out. If you don't then Bourne will bring this fight to your doorstep..lol",7,0,1,25 July 2004
Dodgeball," An 80's movie released in 2004
","Walking into the theater to see Dodgeball, my expectations were that it would make me laugh and that is exactly what it delivered. This movie features 2 members of the Frat Pack in the form of Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. Vaughn plays Peter LaFleur, the owner of Average Joe's Gym. It is a run-down facility and its members fit the loser bill quite nicely. Stiller plays White Goodman, the owner and operator of Globo Gym, which is a state-of-the-art health center run by snobs and chiseled goons. Basically LaFleur is in debt with the bank and he has 30 days to pay off the 50,000 dollars or else he loses the gym to Goodman. Stiller's off-screen wife Christine Taylor plays Kate Veach, who is the accountant from the bank in charge of handling the settlement. LaFleur and the guys decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas which guarantees a 50,000 dollar payoff to the winner. Goodman enter Globo Gym in the same tournament to thwart their chances. After rejecting Goodman's advances, Kate decides to join Average Joe's team and turns out to be a secret weapon. That is all the storyline you need to know. Rip Torn plays Patches Hoolahan, an old dodgeball player who decides to 'train' the Average Joe team. His methods are a bit unorthodox to say the least, as they involve dodging wrenches and oncoming cars. Once the film gets to the dodgeball action, it is filled with crotch shots and blistering body shots. Throw in a little romance between Vaughn and Taylor and you've got yourself a classic 80's style movie. Stiller is hilarious as the testosterone-charged Goodman and his facial expressions had me laughing the whole time. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are a nice touch as the commentators at the tournament and William Shatner,David Hasselhoff, and Chuck Norris provide pleasing cameos. Hollywood doesn't make many movies like this anymore and it's a shame because this one works on most levels.P.S. Remember: Dodge,Duck,Dip,Dive,Dodge!!!",Null,0,0,20 June 2004
