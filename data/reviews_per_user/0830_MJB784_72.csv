Insidious: Chapter 2," Well done
","I found it even scarier than the first. It also answers questions that were left unanswered in the first movie, which made me think that parts of the first weren't explained. So now I might find the first movie even better! I feel like watching the first again!",8,0,0,21 May 2018
Love and Death," My favorite of his starring roles
","I have always been a fan of Woody Allen. He has great sense of comic timing and his jokes are literal, fast, creative and most importantly timeless. My choice for his best joke after joke comedy is Love and Death. Part of it's appeal is that it takes places in revolutionary times, which makes it ageless already. Also, it deals with the two biggest subjects in life: Love and Death. Done as a spoof of the time it's set, the movie has the feel of Mel Brooks, but the timing of Woody Allen. I wouldn't call this his absolute best movie, but I will say it's his best comedy.",9,0,0,23 May 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," It needed another rewrite
","It had some suspense and excitement, but John Goodman's character isn't explained very well. He kidnaps this woman he accidentally crashed into and chains her at first in a shelter with another person who isn't written well either and goes back and forth from being a bad guy and good guy. The shelter is because of a contamination and alien invasion, but it also deals with a possible murder that isn't explained well.",6,0,0,22 May 2018
War Dogs," Interesting and well made movie
",War Dogs dealt with the dangers of arms dealing and illegal packaging and repackaging of ammo and guns and how money has ruined them (plus drugs).,7,0,0,21 May 2018
Iron Man 3," In the middle
","The action scenes were very cool, but the story didn't make much sense and there were way too many characters and stories crammed together. It was better than the second, but not as good as the first.",6,0,1,21 May 2018
It," As scary as I thought
",I was not prepared for most of the scares because they weren't in the miniseries. I had no idea about the scene in the library with the fat kid or the bully who went looking for him in the sewer or the house the kids entered. Those moments weren't in the miniseries.,8,1,3,21 May 2018
Hereditary," Words escape me
","It's about this family who has a history of tragic deaths and when the grandma died, things keep turning from bad to worse for the family. The title refers to how the family members die of unusual circumstances. Hereditary had interesting subplots and ideas that didn't add up. I don't know why it's said to be a horror classic. I didn't think it was that good. Visually well made, but the story doesn't make sense. I couldn't tell if parts of it were supposed to be scary. The ending when we find out what happens to the last remaining family member is irrelevant to the rest of the movie. The lady who had a seance to resurrect her grandson doesn't make sense when she is shown in photos of Leigh the main character's grandmother. Also, the bird that flew into the window and died shocked all the characters except Charlie. Why? Did she have special powers to do that? She also cut the bird's head off. Is that a premonition of her death? Besides, why would the mom recreate the death of her daughter as a miniature? Who wants to relive that?",6,5,11,9 June 2018
Train to Busan," Scary and clever.
","I thought it was good. I usually don't like zombie movies because their stupid, but this was a good one. This one character was stupid where he selfishly threw other people to the zombies so he can escape even though he turned into one after falling on the tracks. I also think that the father of the girl should have just thrown him off the train instead of being so kind to him and then get bitten on the hand. He should've survived with his daughter.",7,3,6,4 July 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I wish I could agree
","I was disappointed with Rogue One because it was slow and too much talk. The visuals were very well done, but it had almost no interesting characters except K -2SO and the blind warrior. I thought the ending was the best part. The last act. I didn't remember most of the characters and when she found her father and he died, she didn't seem that concerned and neither did I. I didn't know much about the father or Jynn. I didn't get to know most of the characters.",6,1,1,22 May 2018
Captain Marvel," I was confused
","Hi. I saw Captain Marvel yesterday and thought it was ok. It had some good action scenes and visuals, but no explanation of her past or why she's called Captain Marvel. I also don't know most of the characters in terms of how they know her. They didn't have much personality. We don't know how she became a pilot or why she helped the mom raise the daughter other than them not having a father.",5,5,9,17 March 2019
World War Z," Not that good
","World War Z didn't get me involved in the characters and the tone was off. It didn't know if it wanted to be an action movie or a horror movie so it ended up being a little of both with some scenes being unclear. It had some good action here and there, but it opened with the zombies too quickly and there wasn't much information of how the virus started. It's hard for me to enjoy a movie with constant action and uninteresting characters. I would like it to have cool action scenes, just not as frantically. I guess if the characters were interesting I would've liked it.",5,1,4,21 May 2018
Zootopia," Not much happens
","While the animation was colorful as expected and I liked it at first, the story wanders as the main case the characters solve is more complicated and less interesting as it went along. Too bad because I enjoyed the first half hour or so.",6,0,4,21 May 2018
Us," I am kind of split on the movie
","It was very well made, but the story doesn't explain as much as it should. It had good scares, but I don't know where the evil look-a-likes came from. They didn't explain much of a twist that was hinted at in the beginning even though it led to a couple answers, but left a few more questions that weren't solved. It seemed like he had a lot of ideas and didn't know how to put it together. I felt similar with Get Out. Though it does set up a sequel.",6,7,12,24 March 2019
127 Hours," Be prepared
",The true story of the guy who was trapped in between a rock and a hard place (literally). It's now my choice for the best movie of 2010. Very realistic and frightening. Truly powerful film making that really makes you happy to be alive and realize that anything is possible when it comes to survival.,9,0,2,21 May 2018
L.A. Confidential," The most perfect cops and robbers movie
","L.A. Confidential opens with a pitch-perfect voice over narration by Danny DeVito, continues by showcasing the colorful, golden streets of L.A. in the mid 50's with terrific attention to detail in buildings, cars, hairstyle, costumes, interiors, etc., then continues with a terrific story that involves three policemen with very different backgrounds that are all involved in the same case. The case is the Night Owl Cafe murders where a giant bloodbath seems to have happened inside the cafe. One is in it because his partner was one of the dead bodies, another because he took the call and was first on the scene after the murders happened, the last because a blonde bombshell who has information is part of the other officer's case with this sleazy hitman who turns women into prostitutes. In addition, there's a love triangle between the blonde, the hard hitting cop who's partner was murdered and the young rookie cop who took the call. It all fits together like a watch. Like a jigsaw puzzle. It just works on all details.",10,1,1,23 May 2018
Deadpool 2," I don't like these Deadpool movies
","This story doesn't make sense. It starts out with Deadpool blowing himself up and recapping the death of his girlfriend, then he wants to join the X-Men then he has his own team called X-Force which mostly die except for the girl and Deadpool. Then, the bad guy Cable is from the future and is part of the team and then there's this villian Juggernaut. This has too much going on.",5,1,3,27 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," This is like an Alfred Hitchcock Western
","Hateful Eight was very good. Very creative and manipulative in its storytelling without being cheated. The first half was good, the second half was great! I will admit that some of the first act dragged, which is why I don't think it's a great movie, but maybe a second viewing will change my mind now that I know the twists. It was part western (good half) part murder mystery (great half). This is his best blend of writing and directing since Pulp Fiction, but his best written only since From Dusk Till Dawn and his best only directed since his part of Sin City.",8,0,1,21 May 2018
Moana," A cute cartoon
","It was a very colorful and well written Disney cartoon. I'll admit that I didn't find the songs very memorable, but it dealt with restoring a curse made by a demigod named Maui and how the daughter of a family sets out to stop the curse.",7,0,1,21 May 2018
The Town," Spoiler!
","One weakness is, how could the girl not know that the guy kidnapped her when they're going out if the voice is the same? Also, why would he go out with her? The chase scenes were good, but then at the same time, I didn't find them very memorable. I don't remember them now.",6,0,2,22 May 2018
Doctor Strange," Disappointed
","It mostly bored me with unemotional characters and too much talk. It had a few cool fights, but I don't understand the logic in Doctor Strange needing to be a superhero. He was just a surgeon and traveled around the globe to get better treatment after his accident, but the person he came to see knew realms of other worlds and gave him powers just for the sake of being a superhero. Usually superheroes discover their alter ego on their own.",5,0,1,21 May 2018
Interstellar," Good, but not great
","Well, it did go on too long, but I enjoyed the relationships of the fathers and daughters displayed and the black hole he was experiencing that showed various time lines of his past in a sort of rubix cube overhead shot. It dragged on the one ice planet that makes them age by 7 years every hour. I also didn't think it had an ending. It kind of stopped.",7,2,2,21 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," There's a few too many stories
","Ok. I just saw Rise of Skywalker. Artistically, it was very well made and exciting with some laughs and cool action scenes, but the story was confusing. Which of Rey's parents is Palpatine's child? When did Leia learn using a lightsaber and save one for Rey? How did Ben Solo die after kissing Rey? How did Palpatine come back from the dead? What ship was Chewbacca on if he didn't die? Where did the black quicksand come from? Why would Rey say she's a Skywalker if she isn't?",6,2,8,20 December 2019
American Sniper," Clint Eastwood's best war movie
","It was extremely powerful and violent, but also entertaining because of its many realistic and stylish film techniques. The action scenes were frighteningly real and the use of sand and dirt swirling around the final combat scenes was art.",8,20,28,21 May 2018
Glory," Best movie of 1989
","A powerful and meaningful story about the segregation of African American soldiers fighting the Civil War alongside Caucasian soldiers seen through the eyes of Col. Robert Shaw. The action scenes are very realistic and powerful and so are the performances. It really surprises me that this war movie wasn't nominated Best Picture (although Morgan Freeman's other movie and Best Picture Winner Driving Miss Daisy is still a terrific movie), with strong accuracy in costumes, set design, props, choreography, etc.",9,0,0,27 May 2018
Lion," Not that good
","It was ok. Since its a true story, I know it's sad what he went through, but we don't know much about the other characters. The adopted parents didn't seem very interesting. I think this story is more powerful if it was on the news than in a movie. It was about this lost son trying to find his mother in India for over 20 years. Though what happened in his life was sad, there isn't much story. It just goes in circles till he finds his mom.",5,0,4,21 May 2018
Forrest Gump," One of my favorite movies
","I really don't think you're looking carefully at Forrest Gump. Every scene plays like the most important part of the movie. He gets smarter and smarter from listening to his mom and Jenny. The feather symbolizes his life since he floats through life accidentally and realized that at Jenny's gravestone when he said 'I don't know if Momma was right or Lt. Dan. I don't know if we all have a destiny or if we're all floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it's both. Maybe both things are happening at the same time.' It's also a movie of many genres ranging from comedy, drama, political, action, adventure, musical, etc. I loved everything about it because of the concept that one person can accomplish so many things.",10,0,1,21 May 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Are we having a good time?
","I really wanted to like it because the musical scenes were very well done, but the dramatic parts were flat. Mercury is the only character we get to know. The other members of the band have no personality and neither does his girlfriend who says she's pregnant when she never looked pregnant or to who she was with. The manager was blah and so was the record producer played by Mike Meyers. They threw a Wayne's World reference when he says teenagers will be banging their head in the car for Bohemian Rhapsody. The real guy Myers plays wouldn't have said that. We don't really know how they banded together except to say they're outsiders. We don't know when Mercury got aids or from who. As a musical experience, it was very good. The rest was boring and didn't explain much.",6,0,0,9 March 2019
The Revenant," I almost liked it
","I was slightly disappointed. It was visually cool, but the story wanders sometimes and becomes repetitive and boring. I didn't get to know most of the characters. I don't mind if there's not much dialogue in an action picture or horror movie, but it wasn't as action filled as I hoped. It had some action. I would've liked it more if I got more involved in the story, but the pacing dragged. Leo was really good in it.",6,2,2,26 May 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best action movie with guns
","Better than the first Terminator. The action scenes are on par, but the visual effects are obviously superior and so is the makeup. Technically, this is a perfectly made movie on every aspect of film making. It's script is strong, but not perfect like the original. The timeline is confused as to what year the present scenes take place (1994 or 1995?) and there are few questions about the story that aren't answered, but other than that, flawless movie making.",9,0,2,23 May 2018
We're the Millers," One of 2013's better movies
","I just saw We're the Millers and it was hysterical! Funniest film I've seen all year! After months of comedies this year that didn't have many laughs (Internship, The Heat) here was a winner!",8,0,2,21 May 2018
Dunkirk," Visually it was well done, but emotionally I was bored.
","I agree that Dunkirk was a visual experience, but the characters were just standing around shooting. I don't even know their names. I wanted to enjoy Dunkirk because Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors working today, but he needed a different screenwriter. The pacing was slow. Well made, but that's all.",6,0,2,22 May 2018
The Conjuring 2," I enjoyed The Conjuring 2
","I liked it more than the Conjuring, but I think I'll see the first again because I have a feeling I didn't like it for deja vu of seeing this done too many times. While some of the sequel was predictable, the pacing and some plot twists weren't.",7,1,2,22 May 2018
Aladdin," These remakes of Disney cartoons just isn't working
",I rented the new Aladdin and it was very blah. The leads felt like stage actors and so was the set design and it was way too long for no reason. The two leads were boring. They had no personality. Will Smith was just being himself. It was over 30 minutes longer. There was no comedy in it. Iago and Abu had no personality and hardly did anything. The magic carpet was the only cgi that worked smoothly. I liked the ocean landscape though.,5,3,4,26 September 2019
Insidious," Very good
","I really loved how it flipped the haunted house concept where it isn't the house specifically that's haunted, but the demons from the other world. It was a real 'BOO!!' fest, where characters were appearing and disappearing throughout the house. A good old fashioned horror movie like The Others or Poltergeist.",8,0,0,21 May 2018
The Incredibles," A fitting title
","Though not based on an actual superhero series, The Incredibles is a fascinating, action packed, animated movie from Disney that features all the elements of a superhero movie in a unique way. For starters, the lead villain is ingenious: A #1 fan of the main character, Bob Parr, turned criminal mastermind! The relation with Bob and his family members are honest and quite hilarious at times. It's action scenes feel like a bunch of spectacular conclusions of other action movies one after the other without seeming predictable or unnecessary. In fact, the action advances the story rather than replaces it. Though Finding Nemo is still my favorite Pixar cartoon, this is my second favorite and is worth of being considered an action movie just as much as it's considered a Disney classic!",9,0,0,23 May 2018
A Quiet Place," Well done
",It was good. I would've liked to know more about the creatures and how long they've been on earth. It was still scary and with interesting situations. Did anyone know the actor playing the father is also the director and married to Emily Blunt?,7,4,7,22 May 2018
Coco," Hoped it would be better
","I wanted to like Coco because visually it was very well made, but it went on too long and had too many stories. I also didn't find most of the characters memorable. It should've been called Miguel since it was really about him. It also didn't make sense how he traveled to the undead. It was by petals, but I thought it was a dream until Coco visited the afterlife. Also, Hector the father could've told Miguel sooner that he was Coco's father. It seemed uneven.",6,2,7,27 May 2018
1917," I liked it, but you don't get to know most of the characters or a clear location.
",The action scenes and sense of being there were good. The use of making ditches for the soldiers and the after effect of the war footage was very visually well done. I thought the camera angles were smooth and you're right they didn't have many cuts. They filmed interesting tracking shots. I also enjoyed the piles of dirt with various soldiers sticking out in various ways. They must've had fun designing that. The camera angles didn't seem shaky cam. They either used a smooth digital camera or mounted it on rails like the do for some action movies.,7,1,3,14 January 2020
Big Hero 6," I was frustrated with the tone
","First of all, it was extremely uneven where it kept changing the story every few minutes and became a different movie and secondly, the tones were equally changing from serious to action packed to light-hearted and silly. The story was about this boy who loves going to 'Bot Fights' for money and gambling because he graduated school at 13 years old. Then he visits his brother's current college and see his brother's invention: An inflatable robot known to heal named 'Baymax'. Then there's a fire in the building and the brother goes to rescue a teacher--inevitably killing him in the fire, but somehow the robot survives and becomes the boy's only friend until the deceased brother's friends become his friend and they band together to become superheroes. The title refers to the friends, the kid and the robot as crime fighters. None of that was in the trailers. I was certain the title was the name of the robot. They should have promoted all the characters of the title on the poster and trailers and re-written this uneven mess. It felt very un-Disney and more like Dreamworks crossed with Anime.",5,1,1,21 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It doesn't follow the reverse character structure
","It was good, but went on too long with a few too many characters. Yoda didn't need to be in it. It did have good action scenes and laughs. It didn't follow the pattern of the series since it doesn't reverse order from when the characters appear. The Korean girl and the bad guy with the sideburns didn't go anywhere either. Nor did Leia's concussion cure very quickly.",7,1,8,22 May 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," It reminded me of too many movies.
","Guardians of the Galaxy had some cool action scenes and laughs, but felt too familiar to other superhero movies and space movies. I didn't care for the story or most of the characters except Groot and the raccoon. Although, they still felt like comic sidekicks like other movies. The story was the same repetitive concept of a device that it used to destroy the world and gets stolen from the villains like the evil ring in LOTR. It didn't feel like it's own superhero movie. When I watch those kinds of movies, I usually love them because they feel like their own story/world, but this felt like all of those movies combined.",6,2,4,21 May 2018
The Imitation Game," Good
","It was interesting how he was overly intelligent with codes and patterns and was able to break various codes involving the war with England and Germany. I liked it, but not loved it. It was sometimes boring. I enjoyed the life of the main character more than the spy story.",7,0,0,22 May 2018
Jurassic World," I wasn't that impressed
","It had some cool action scenes, but the characters were mostly boring and the pacing sometimes dragged. The dinosaurs looked more real than the third movie, but I didn't care very much for the human characters. They didn't seem that shocked under the circumstances of the dinosaurs attacking and there was too much scientific talk. It was easier to process the conversations in the first movie and the characters had more personality.",6,0,0,21 May 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not as good as the first
","I thought it was kind of disappointing. Some of the action scenes were fun, but it had too many additional superheroes and the story was typical for a Sci fi movie: Robots invading and destroying Earth. I wanted to like it, but the first had more action and laughs and was paced better. Some of this dragged. It had some cool stuff, but the original had a more interesting story because the superheroes hadn't met before, so those interactions were unpredictable and fun. This seemed too familiar. No, it was similar to other Sci fi movies like Matrix and Terminator where robots are destroying mankind. It continues the first, but Nick Fury is given nothing to do, Thor acts more 'normal' I guess, it had a few big action scenes, but not as many as the first. It had more superheroes though.",6,0,0,21 May 2018
Singin' in the Rain," My favorite musical
","Nearly every top ten of the greatest movies ever made includes Singin in the Rain. The reasons are obvious. It's irresistible fun from beginning to end. The choreography is timeless. The songs are memorable. The jokes are hilarious. The characters are expressive and energetic. Part of the fun in watching Singin in the Rain is that some of the movie is the making of movies during the beginning of the sound age in the late 20's. It's a movie that's so hard to dislike, you have to be very miserable or boring to not find any joy in the picture.",10,1,1,23 May 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," My favorite movie of the decade
","The movie takes place the weekend of Valentine's Day and is about a man who's getting the memories of his girlfriend erased through an operation, but is having second thoughts in the middle of the erasing, but he can't wake up. A movie where anything is possible.",9,0,0,22 May 2018
Once Upon a Time in America," It's wonderful!
","It's a great mobster movie. It's about the life of this gangster through his childhood and adulthood including him imagining his future through a dream state of inhaling opium. I have a feeling that all the scenes taken place before his opium smoking intro were real and he was hallucinating the scenes when he has grey hair. For one explanation, the phone kept ringing as a sign that something is off. He's slowly heading into the dream world from the opium. The story is told through memory and dreams and how the two begin and end similarly. For every time a scene ends, a similar image begins. It's 3 hours and 49 minutes, but doesn't feel long.",9,2,3,29 May 2018
La La Land," I wish I would've liked La La Land
","It was artistically very well made, but not much else. It doesn't go anywhere or have any memorable songs. It's about two people who first hate each other on the freeway and later like each other after bumping into one another, but for no reason. They have no chemistry and it's repetitive that she's getting auditions and he wants a singing career, but what do they have together?",6,0,1,21 May 2018
Sinister," It was fun while it lasted
","I just saw Sinister. It started out similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Insidious, but got better and scarier as it went along. It became more unpredictable. It wasn't a great movie. It wasn't as scary as Exorcism of Emily Rose from the same director.",7,0,0,26 March 2019
Don't Breathe," Really interesting
","It had an intriguing story that started out so-so, but had more twists and suspense later on. It was more mysterious than scary, but adds up better as it goes along. No classic, but good.",7,0,1,22 May 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Not necessary
",I was very disappointed. It was too slow and serious with phony dancing and unemotional characters who don't read the lines in the form of a sentence or lyric very well. They're pausing and acting so laid back at the emotions in the movie. The best parts were the scenes that didn't copy the far superior cartoon.,5,0,0,21 May 2018
The Shape of Water," An interesting shape
","It was good, but I didn't love it since some of it dragged. They didn't explain how the amphibian was used as a weapon from the Soviets. In fact, the political aspects dragged, but the relationship with the creature and girl were very well done and it had some very good visuals. It tried to cover a few too many subplots and some of the pacing dragged, but beautifully filmed. I don't think it's Del Toro' s best.",7,2,5,21 May 2018
Psycho," My favorite Hitchcock movie
","No list of favorite movies is complete without something from Alfred Hitchcock. I keep changing my mind on my favorite of his. Vertigo was one for a while, then I switched to Strangers on a Train, but the pieces add up best in Psycho. If someone has never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie and would like to know why he's so important to cinema, here's a perfect introduction. The music by Bernard Herrmann is one of the most famous songs in the history of music. The scenes are memorable both in what they're about and how they're filmed. The casting is pitch perfect. The story adds up all the way through. The trade marks of Hitchcock are everywhere in this, especially the 'twist ending', which he invented and never fails to shock me when I watch the picture due to it's realism.",10,0,0,23 May 2018
The Witch," Confusing
","I just watched it and found it very confusing. Who exactly was the witch and why was this family constantly tormented throughout? It was visually well-made, but confusing.",5,0,1,21 May 2018
Sausage Party," Dumb
","Sausage Party was disappointing. It wasn't that funny and mostly boring. The animation was very well done, but this was mostly unpleasant and not about much. It's like Secret Life of Pets or Toy Story, but boring and filthy. It was the filthiest cartoon I've seen since South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.",5,0,2,21 May 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," It was almost great
","I thought it was a masterpiece until literally the last scene where I question why it would end that way. The scene before when I was certain it ended would have been a perfect ending and an equal to District 9 or the first two Terminators. I'm sure there's an alternate ending on dvd/blu ray even though the second to last sequence felt like an ending. Edge of Tomorrow is like a video game with intelligence. He dies, but learns how to defeat the enemy until the next location like when your character is on different levels of a video game. This is probably the best movie I've seen this year and certainly my favorite this summer! The story for Edge of Tomorrow sounds like a cross between Groundhog Day and Terminator. It's about a soldier that's thrown into this time loop where he dies and comes back battling robots every time. I would love to see it again and own this, but that final scene annoyed me.",8,0,1,21 May 2018
Whiplash," It was wonderful!
","The story pulls you in right from the start and builds with lots of intensity and moments or humor. The story deals with this drummer who is offered by the music teacher to join his band and even though he agrees, the band leader is an overly hostile tough-as-nails guy who realizes he might have met his match in terms of who's more demanding. Very exciting and well paced.",9,0,0,21 May 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," It was a thumbs up, but too long
","I saw Wolf of Wall Street and that was quite funny for a Scorsese movie. It was good, but a little repetitive and long. I loved when he was having trouble getting to the car after taking all those pills. I also loved that Martin Scorsese had a clip of Family Matters in the movie!",7,1,1,22 May 2018
Finding Dory," My review as Dory
","I just saw a movie today! What did I see? Remember! Remember! Oh! I saw Finding Dory today! I liked it, but not as much as Finding Nemo because Dory didn't always remember she was lost or why which made her story less interesting and the ending climax seemed forced. It does have laughs and heart touching scenes, but Finding Nemo had more of both and stronger supporting characters. Oh, I saw Finding Dory today. I liked it, but not loved it. The original is still my favorite Pixar cartoon. That was a more exciting story...wait, what was I talking about?",7,0,1,21 May 2018
Arrival," Anyone understood it?
","Did you understand the movie Arrival? I thought she was having flashbacks of her daughter, but it turns out they were premonitions and the husband/father is Jeremy Renner's character which makes me wonder why she married him if she knew in the future they would be divorced? Unless they were never married? Then again, the two aliens predicted a war over 3000 years later and Amy Adams' character being an important part of that which wasn't explained well. I found it confusing. Visually well made.",6,1,3,21 May 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," It doesn't really go anywhere
","Ok, I first enjoyed the concept of a has been actor who's struggling to get his career back by acting, writing and directing a stage play, but there wasn't much to it. It had some interesting supporting characters and his hallucinations of his superhero character Birdman were my favorite parts, but it felt redundant after awhile and had too many endings.",6,0,0,22 May 2018
The Conjuring," Occasionally scary
","As a horror movie, it had some scares, but as a story, it wasn't that surprising. Though it is based on a true story and I love haunted house movies, these kinds of films have lost their surprise. It seemed like a cross between Insidious (directed by James Wan also) and Sinister. Insidious also dealt with demonic possession (in fact, one old lady that was also a ghost in Conjuring looked like the same one in Insidious) and Sinister, which also deals with demonic possession, features the characters moving into a house that was previously haunted already and those that enter are in danger. So basically, there weren't many surprises, but I wish we knew more about the ghosts. We don't know the names of these demons or where they came from (other than Hell) and some of the ghosts appear in one scene and have nothing to do with the movie. As a horror fan, it does have scares, but I think they should have a new approach to the haunted house genre. I still say The Others was the best of the haunted house movies (though I haven't seen Amityville Horror). Overall, I guess if you haven't seen the two horror movies I've mentioned, it would be scarier. So I'm on the fence with this one.",6,1,1,21 May 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I would be surprised if anyone understood this
","The action scenes were very cool, but it didn't make sense. There were way too many villains and stories. It had an awesome opening action that takes place 18 months before the rest of the movie without having anything to do with it. There were too many endings and too much of too much. I still haven't enjoyed a Zack Snyder movie.",6,1,4,21 May 2018
Monsters University," Better than the original
","I loved it! I didn't even like the original because it was too slow and emotional. This had big laughs, fast pace and emotion without feeling boring. The energy and tone was what I thought the original would be. I wasn't expecting the first to be so slow and serious.",8,2,2,22 May 2018
Jojo Rabbit," This could have been funnier or a short film instead of feature length.
","I really wanted to like it because it started out very funny and clever with this boy who is in this training camp for kids who learn how to be Nazis and he's wimpier than the other kids. The boy's closest friend is an imaginary Adolf Hitler who offers some very funny sight gags, but that was the first act and there isn't very much different or fun in the other two acts. It does deal with the boy having humanity and realizing that Jews aren't bad, but it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.",6,0,1,19 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fun while it lasted
","It was good, but I wasn't as thrilled as most people were. Visually, it was very well made and the action scenes were cool, but the pacing could've been faster. Star Wars is usually known for fast action scenes. The story was interesting and so were the twists. So it was a good time, nothing more.",7,2,16,21 May 2018
Godzilla," A realistic Godzilla movie
",Very suspenseful and exciting! This was the Godzilla movie I was waiting for and hoping for even though it has a few draggy scenes and the ending is a little weak because it leads the door open for a possible sequel!,7,0,1,21 May 2018
Deadpool," Not that funny
","You know, I wanted to like Deadpool because the action scenes were cool, but I wasn't laughing because his jokes weren't funny and he kept interrupting his own movie! It was like Mystery Science Theater 3000 or his own audio commentary! I can understand that being funny in Wayne's World, but that had better jokes and weren't superheroes. If you want to see Deadpool, rent the Dirty Harry sequel The Dead Pool.",6,1,3,21 May 2018
Braveheart," My favorite action movie
","The greatest action movie I've ever seen! All the action you can ask for with a running time of three hours! It has the coolest action scenes I've ever seen! It all plays like it's really happening and the story is powerful about this one person who made a difference to get a country of his own. It's all the more incredible because there's no use of CGI during the battle scenes. It's all natural and as real as possible with wonderful use of jump cuts for startling effect. This is all the more amazing because Mel Gibson is not only the star, but the director and the movie seems like it's in the hands of a professional film maker, like the work of Akira Kurosawa in his samurai days. One of my top ten favorite movies!",10,3,6,22 May 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Frustrating
","Oh I really wanted to like it, but the action scenes, while cool sometimes, were repetitive and too fast. It wasn't about much of anything and felt too fast and had too many villains at random where it was hard to follow. Visually stunning, but emotionally overwhelming.",6,2,7,21 May 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," A powerful war movie
","Hacksaw Ridge is the best war movie since American Sniper and one of the greatest war movies I've ever seen! Probably the best I've seen this year. A true definition of greatness with strong style (the war footage) and involving story. This is of course the most recent of my favorite action movies. Also directed by Mel Gibson, but not featuring him, Hacksaw Ridge is as brutal and powerful in WWII as Braveheart was in it's depicting of Scotland being a country of it's own. With many powerful death scenes and attention to detail in it's recreation of the 40's as well as various makeups and stunt coordination through it's many battle scenes, Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful, haunting war movie that shows the tragedy and danger of war, but also hope in an unlikely hero who is a medic on the battlefield and also savior without firing a single shot!",9,1,1,21 May 2018
Sully," One of the best movies of 2016
","So I saw Sully and found it very well done. It had really cool reenactments of the airplane crash both as sorrow for the passengers and as special effects recreating the crash. It also was very well paced. I would've liked to know Sully's family more and it didn't have an ending. It just stopped, but was mostly very entertaining.",8,1,1,21 May 2018
