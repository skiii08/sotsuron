","If this movie doesn't scare you, you've obviously never:a.) been camping b.) spent any time in the woods, or a rural area, at night c.) left whatever city it is you live in d.) had any personal experience, as a child, with the Boogeyman.I'm a cynical, jaded old fart. This movie scared the hell outta me, and very little scares me. Many things move me, but little frightens me. See this flick, be willing to suspend your disbelief.",10,1,2,30 July 1999
