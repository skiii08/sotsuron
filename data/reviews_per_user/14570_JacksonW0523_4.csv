Blade Runner 2049," Definitely lives up to the original
","This is how a sequel should be made. It was a very risky thing to do making a sequel to what seemed like a perfect movie but they pulled it off. The world of Blade Runner still feels fresh. The main character and his character development is just as complex as the first movie. It tops it off with more action than the first one and the action scenes were good, the end fight had me at the edge of my seat and had me thinking was the main character going to survive. The cast was great and the writing subverts expectation.",8,1,2,10 May 2020
Captain Marvel," Just an okay movie not awful though
","Definitely the worst MCU movie as of yet. Brie Larson's acting was bland. Though some defended her saying that's her character, she suppresses her emotions but that doesn't excuse the bad acting. Some actors can pull of the stoic look much better. Sam Jackson was doing his best, he's Sam Jackson he's good in almost everything he does. This character, Carol doesn't really have anything compelling about her. The plot of her trying to remember her past is not engaging. The fight scenes were mediocre and some were anti-climatic but for the most part enjoyable. They gender swapped this character which is ridiculous. The way Fury lost his eye was just as ridiculous. They were trying to sell this movie on the 'Girl Power' and tried so hard to make a strong female character instead of a strong well written character that happens to be female. The good things about this movie were the special effects, the makeup and the kree commando team were cool.",6,2,3,30 March 2020
The Transporter," fun enjoyable popcorn flick
","This is the type of movie you can turn your brain off and watch it. It's what you expect from an action movie, you don't watch it as if it had deep plot. The fight scenes were really well done. There was a scene where they fought on top of slippery oil which was really enjoyable. The car chase sequences were cool too but I was hoping there were more car stunts. Jason Statham was good as the cool, calm and methodical action hero.",7,0,0,3 April 2020
Blade Runner," Not really my type of film but I can appreciate its art
",First of the visuals and cinematography is amazing for its time. The world that this film sets up feels real. The set the design is great. It's like a future with advanced technology but still feels gloomy. Kind of like the dump that was New York City back in the 70s but in the future. This movie had a great theme and it's complex but it might take a couple viewings to see it. I went into this thinking it was a sci-fi action film but it isn't. So not really my taste but I still found it quite enjoyable.,7,0,0,10 May 2020
