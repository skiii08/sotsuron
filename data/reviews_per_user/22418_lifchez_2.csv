Ali," It's a shame Will Smith did so great for such an awful film
","My wife and I walked out of this film after the first hour... probably a good thing since we've since heard that the second half is even worse than the first. Let it be known, Will Smith did a great job looking, talking and acting like Ali. However, the film could've been much better made. We went in to see a movie about Muhammed Ali, Cassius Clay, the Black Superman. What we saw for an hour seemed more like a biography of Sam Cooke and Malcolm X with a large emphasis on the Islamic faith. Nothing about Cassius Clay as a child (maybe to explain his reason for wanting to fight and change his name?). Nothing about his being an Olympic gold medalist. We did get to see a bit of training and a fight with Sonny Liston where it seemed there was some funny business (this unfortunately was never explained... it apparently just sort of happened and then faded away). The movie jumped from plot to plot, never really giving us any indication of where it was headed or why we were watching it. Therefore, we stopped. My advice, if you'd like to really learn about The Champ, would be to find a good book about Ali. Maybe someone could recommend one to the makers of this film.",1,2,5,6 January 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 3rd funniest of all time?
","I'm sorry but I found more to laugh at watching Battlefield Earth!!! This movie was just NOT FUNNY. Seeing it ranked so high on the '100 funniest movies' list, my wife and I figured it must be a Peter Sellers laugh-fest. Imagine our disappointment when we discovered we couldn't have been more wrong. 45 minutes into the movie, we literally looked at each other and said 'this is a comedy, right?' 15 minutes later I fell asleep (that shows how boring the movie was) so it wasn't until the next day that I finally found 2 things to laugh at:1) The scene with Sellers looking for spare change and the subsequent shooting of the Coca-Cola machine.2) The bit with Dr. Strangelove referring to the president as 'Der Fuehrer' and his hand continually attempting to raise in the style of a nazi salute.Those of you who have seen this movie know what I'm referring to. Those who have not... I would not advise spending an hour and a half to see these two gags.Seeing this movie has verified my serious doubts about the list of the so-called '100 funniest movies.' Do yourself a favor... if you want to see a good comedy, ask a trusted friend to recommend a good one.",2,21,52,15 May 2001
