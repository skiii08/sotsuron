The Ring," So many holes in plot--
","Good effects, lacking substance and credibilityPossible Spoilers--I don't understand, someone explain to me. Where did the child come from? Just what was wrong with her?Why did the little boy keep knowing things that were going to happen? Why did you see different things on the film as you saw people watching the tape later? Such as the girl climbing out of the well? Why did the girl's mother have on clothes from another time period when she was killing the girl? What significance did the fly have that the journalist picked off of the screen when she was watching the tape? How could a dead person make a tape and call you on the phone? Why use the phone? Did she have a phone in the well? How did the teenagers who all died from 'watching' the film know that when the caller said 7 days, the caller meant they would all die in 7 days?If you knew four people had died from watching a tape exactly 7 days from the day they had watched it, would you rush to watch it? Why not call in some help?? Why did the journalist not take a picture of the deadbeat dad after he watched the film? See if he was blurry too?? Why leave a tape so 'dangerous' around, convenient for your kid to watch? (hope mom was better with her X rated tapes) Who was lurking around in the foyer when the journalist and the deadbeat dad were in the farmhouse AFTER the old man had fried? In the sequal will the killer movie now be in DVD?? LMAOHey I'm surprised I didn't DIE after watching this film, just from remorse for wasting my time.Some eerie video effects, the hint of the possiblity of a truely scary story, tied together far too loosely.Sorry, gotta get me with a good story as well as good effects...
Even sorrier that the mass public is eating it up. I have had a hard time finding a good movie lately, and now I know why. If we applaud such ill thought out plotlines, that is what we will get. Why take the time to design a truely believable plotline, when you can churn them out faster if the plotline is not to be worried with?When have we last had a movie of the calibre of Shawshank Redemption, Sling Blade, Forest Gump, Babe, Pulp Fiction, or Blair Witch? For the last year, I rent em, I take em back, usually shaking my head and saying, what the hell was all that about??I'm sorry guys, but we gotta demand more for our movie $$$'s.",3,0,1,5 March 2003
