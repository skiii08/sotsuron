Lucky Number Slevin," Nothing particular novel, but just barely enjoyable enough
","The DVD case reads that by taking the best parts of Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects, you end up with Lucky Number Slevin. Rather, LNS wishes that it had the natural assurance of either of these films, but instead ends up feeling slightly forced. The twist wasn't particularly surprising nor very clever or well crafted and its explanation drove on. It was fun to see Morgan Freeman playing a character on the darker side, but the only performance that really stood out for me was Lucy Liu's effortless turn (perhaps because I had just recently watched her completely stoic in Kill Bill vol 1) as the girl next door. There are comparisons made constantly to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which is a far superior film, and I would urge you to check that film out if you enjoyed this one. Both films possess a sort of sheen and a je ne sais quoi sense of 'coolness', but Kiss' script is far wittier and its performances overall much stronger. In short, this is worth a rent perhaps, but don't expect too much.",4,0,3,6 November 2006
Juno," a smart, believable little film
","Having just seen this film Christmas eve, to what I thought was a surprisingly packed theatre, I feel quite satisfied. I had heard some mixed chatter heading in, although it was mostly positive, and the film did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed the intro, but after the credits I felt that it did lag for about 15 minutes. A few of the initial exchanges between juno and her friend felt strange and forced, but overall it laid a solid groundwork for introducing us to Ellen Page's Juno. And it must be said that Ellen Page is excellent. I had only seen her briefly in the throwaway X3 previously, and she thoroughly impressed me here. Her performance is certainly what anchors the film. This isn't a typical 'teen' movie, nothing over the top happens, it isn't absolutely riotous (though it is quite funny). It is, if nothing else, very real. And this all centers on Page's utter believability. She is witty and confident and quirky and unique, but also acts very much her age, and is vulnerable as well.The other standout performance is the always excellent Jason Bateman. He certainly has a feel for comedy, but he plays it rather understated here to great effect. The subtlety of his reactions both around his wife, and then the effect Juno has on him, were impressive. I was certainly hoping to see him and Micheal Cera together in a scene once again, but was left disappointed.I would definitely recommend this film. It is being compared to Garden State and Little Miss Sunshine by many people, and I would have to agree that all three films possess at least some of the same characteristics. Jason Reitman has gone 2 for 2, having followed up the effective Thank You For Smoking, with this excellent sophomore effort. It's definitely worth checking out, especially when confronted with the relatively terrible film selection at present.8/10",8,5,11,24 December 2007
Cloverfield," sneak peek early screen
","I attended an early screening 1/10/08 at Michigan State University. I've spoilerized in case anyone doesn't want to know anything about the film, but I will try to stay away from anything that'll be too overt.Simply put, the film is an amazingly visceral experience. It's studio logo, production logo, film. No credits whatsoever, which just adds to the overall immediacy of it. If you've been following it to any degree whatsoever, you know that it's shot entirely with hand-held cameras. The characters also run. A lot. So immediately, I think this will be a love hate experience. My own reaction to it was that it again, added to the immersion, and I didn't find it to be really distracting at all. Many people I saw it with said they couldn't even watch the screen at times, so buyer beware. It also will anger those who need all the details, and need to have every loose end tied up (or even a majority of them). The entire film is the tape found after the events of the film are over. That's it. There is no set up, and no hold-your-hand-for-you resolution (or really, much of one at all). It's unconventional, and I enjoyed the ending TREMENDOUSLY. I definitely have to applaud the decision to not simply make a cookie cutter action film that is easy to watch. I think it will be interesting to watch how it does at the box office though.After that...I feel like there isn't much that can be said about the acting, and that should be a credit to it. It absolutely feels like you are experiencing this with the characters, who feel more or less exactly like real people. After leaving the theater I was on edge for a good deal of time, as I tried to shake that level of immersion. The film is also surprisingly humorous, and I would say that our crowd laughed more than they screamed (although the screams were definitely there).Cloverfield definitely will not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you're already excited about it, I have no doubt that you'll be satisfied. It was a relatively unique experience, and again I want to applaud the decision to make it in that manner.Definitely recommended: 8/10",8,506,826,10 January 2008
Saw III," god awful
","seriously? seriously???? Can anyone actually have enjoyed this absolute abomination of a film? I thought the first saw was DECENT at best, with acting that rivaled the best 9th grade media productions, but this is just embarrassing. It plays like it was edited by a rabid 10th grader on crack. And after two prior films that have proved they can make money, it still looks like it was made for about seven dollars. The 'plot twists'...are you serious? It calls for a complete suspension of reason, and then tries to act like it's morally and intellectually superior to every other horror film ever made. The sophomore philosophy major college dropouts who wrote this should be banned from making a film ever again. I found myself looking around the room for ANYTHING to distract me from how god awful this movie was. Stay far, far away. Really, though, when our taste has fallen so far that even when we seek cheap, easy thrills we turn to such dryvel as this...what hope is there?",1,4,7,15 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Flawed, but absolutely entertaining
","This is a deeply flawed movie. Let us open with that, and get it out of the way. The fanboyism and rampant insanity that led it to be ranked #1 for a time has died down a bit, and it has fallen to #4 at the moment. This is still absurd. If anyone here thinks this is the 4th best movie they have ever seen, they need a serious lesson in what great film is. Nevertheless. This film is solid. Going into it, the buzz over Heath's performance was what really buoyed it, and surprisingly he did not disappoint. I honestly believe that, at present time, he deserves a best supporting actor nomination. His performance was epic and tremendous, and a testament to Ledger's skill as an actor. The script by the Nolan bros. also deserves credit here. But it is not without debits as well. The movie open sluggishly, and the ending positively reeks of melodrama. Morgan Freeman is here simply to fulfill contractual obligations. There are a plethora of plot holes easily overlooked by the casual observer. and at the end of the day, this is fine. the film works well as an action movie, and even as a moderate character study. But it aims incredibly high, and though it at times soars, it ultimately falls a bit flat, regardless of whatever hype it has built up. Ledger is undoubtedly an 'unstoppable force', but this film is hardly an 'immovable object.' B-.",7,3,7,16 November 2008
The Fountain," A moving treatise on life and death
","Aronofsky's thoughts on the nature of life and death certainly do not disappoint. I'm shocked, however, that the studio chose to release this film on thanksgiving weekend to little fanfare, where it will almost certainly get slaughtered. At any rate, the film is great and flirts with being tremendous. Matthew Libatique's cinematography never fails to be anything less than breathtaking, and it certainly is here. There are striking, majestic images, and the film truly does look amazing. The film uses silence to great effect, but when Clint Mansell's score does show up, it is fitting and powerful as well. Jackman's performance I thought was strong, and is certainly light years away from his turn as Wolverine in X-men. After seeing the film I can't really imagine Brad Pitt playing this part, as he was originally intended to. That being said, this certainly isn't a movie for everyone, and is probably less accessible than either Pi or Requiem. For those who might not quite 'get it', the following is my interpretation of the film, with **SPOILERS**. The film's theme, at it's very heart, is that holding desperately onto life can lead only to death, while accepting death as a form of life and creation, can make life come alive. There are three story lines, the only one that may really be 'real' is the one in the present, but it doesn't matter much as they all end up saying the same thing. In the present, Jackman's wife Izzy has brain cancer and is on her way out, and he is a doctor studying cancer treatments, desperately trying to find one that will save her. All through their interaction in the present, he is obsessed with holding onto her, with finding a way to make her live. He ignores things that she says in conversation, focusing only on the things that he think may allow her to live. He is absolutely terrified about her impending doom. At one point while he is in a hospital room with her, he even exclaims 'I just want to be with you!' and her reply to this is 'You ARE with me, right now!' But his obsession with finding some way to prolong her life blinds him to most everything else (one notable scene illustrating this is when he walks down the road to a completely silent audio track, even as ambulances drive by with sirens flashing), even to his remaining time with her. What leads to his eventual liberation is what Izzy found so fascinating, and even wrote her story on, the Mayan mythology. Their creation story contains the 'first man' who sacrificed himself in order to create the world. It is a common theme throughout all mythology across all cultures, life out of death. There cannot be life without death. We come from the earth, our bodies are built out of it, and when we die we return to it so that new forms can be created. Stars are formed from accumulations of gases and dust, and when they explode with unbelievable grandeur, they spew these components out into the void, where they will form new stars. Izzy was able to find peace in this notion, that her life and death were part of the great mystery of life, and she was able to identify with this great cosmic energy that pervades everything. Jackman's character cannot accept this, and he decries death as a disease, which he will work to cure. But in the end, this is fruitless. Man cannot live forever, and what's more, even if it WERE possible, it would serve only to rob life of its meaning. He realizes this, as in the final chapter of Izzy's book, he has the conquistador taste the sap of the tree, and he then immediately returns to the earth. In this sense he can 'live forever', but not in the way that he had hoped as his consciousness perishes. In the future (which to me seemed like a generalization of the present storyline, i.e. the tree of life dying wasn't JUST Izzy dying, but represented life in general) the Jackman character laughs when, after the tree has died, he realizes that he too will finally perish. As the star explodes, we see him rise upwards, identifying with the fact that he will die, and thus transcending it, even AS he dies. And the tree of life blooms, again, life out of death. I would like to quote one of my friends who I think summed the concept up brilliantly: 'these things point the way to reveling in and revering the passions we experience in life. In the spirit of these revels, we are engaged, connected, conscious, and wholly (and holy-ly) participating in the moment rather than scheming on how we can prolong, guard, or perpetually keep the moment, all for ourselves (eternal exclusivity being the province of ego), never allowing change to transmute these pinnacles of human-ness we are fortunate enough to find ourselves experiencing. In the words of another wise teacher, 'Love is the middle way between attachment and detachment.' If we are living from, in, and with love, where will we find the need to hold on, to form an attachment, when we are surrounded, enveloped, and fully part of an energy that is exponentially more powerful?' and thus, why should we be afraid of death. This is why Jackman goes back, and chooses to spend time with his wife, choosing to life his life NOW. This is, in the end, all that we can do, and by recognizing that we WILL die, and identifying with that, EVERY moment that we DO have, necessarily becomes so important, becomes truly alive.Definitely check this film out, and if you enjoy it, spread the word. Pi and Requiem signaled the arrival of a major talent in Aronofsky, but after The Fountain I positively cannot wait to see what he does next.",10,2,4,22 November 2006
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," The D rock forever
","I am a HUGE D fan, and have been since the original sketches aired on HBO. If you haven't seen those, go right now and pick up a copy of The Complete Masterworks by Tenacious D, which also has an amazing live show on it, and as a package is pretty much worth 4 times what you pay for it. That aside, I was stoked to see that this movie was finally being released, and lo and behold at Michigan State they held a free sneak peek, which I just returned from. Overall, it was a bit uneven, but still rocked pretty hard. The cameos by Stiller and Robbins were both great, and Dave Grohl as Satan was awesome. A few of the shots are set up exactly like shots in the original sketches, and fans of the original will constantly be going 'ah!'. I was particularly pleased that they brought back the nightclub host, and Lee. The songs were pretty sweet as well, though you only get abridged versions of many of them and I am still waiting to hear the full album. From what I've just heard from the film, they aren't nearly as good as the original batch though (and the history of tenacious d, an old song, makes a couple of appearances). Jack Black is kinetic and basically lights up the screen, this has always been true and is never more true then when he has KG at his side. They definitely put on a great show here, and it's well worth your time to check out, and if you're a D fan then you really have no choice. As long as you're not easily offended, it's impossible to not love the D. Tongue-in-cheek lyrics aside, its clear they really do have an amazing love for rock, and they are more than capable of convincing anyone of it (and giving you a rockin good time along the way).",7,1,3,14 November 2006
