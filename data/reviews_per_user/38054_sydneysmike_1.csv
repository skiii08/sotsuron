Minority Report," The year's best
","I just saw Minority Report last night, it stands next to Blade Runner as the best sci-fi film ever made. Tom Cruise keeps getting better with each performance. This is Steven Speilberg's best film since Schindler's List. It has to be seen on the big screen for full impact so don't miss it!",9,0,0,31 July 2002
