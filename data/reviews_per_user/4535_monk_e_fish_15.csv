Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny yet disappointing movie of hilarious TV creation
","When Sacha Baron Cohen's original genius comic creation Ali G made it to the big screen in Ali G Indahouse, not only was the film a complete misfire, taking away the aspects that made the character so funny in the first place and dumping him into a dire low rent comedy movie plot, it was also part of a symptom that the character may be getting old and too familiar, well used and well known. Baron Cohen's solution over the following years was to add new characters and transplant his interviews that make people look ridiculous shtick to America, the home of people making themselves look ridiculous. Of those new innovations, definitely the best was the introduction of Borat, the culturally naive, racist, misogynist journalist from the major potassium exporting former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, always dressed in the same grey suit and clipboard. In transferring his second character from TV to movies, Baron Cohen seems to have learnt some of the lessons from his first movie and kept aspects of what made the TV show great however, like his Staines based wigga predecessor, Borat does lose something in the transition, and not just the disappointing absence of the formerly ubiquitous clipboard. The film is a strange mishmash of short sketches of the style of his TV appearances designed to appear in his documentary 'moviefilm' Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and a sort of plot in which our hero travels across America in order to marry Pamela Anderson. The trouble is, only the first half of this provides the comedy gold, the other seems contrived and doesn't quite work. The reason that Borat is so funny is in the way that he relates to real people and their reactions to him, how people try and be accommodating to his strange ways until he pushes them too far or how his extremely bigoted views encourage others to open up with their own disturbingly inappropriate ideas. The film does have some very funny scenes of this variety. One particularly standout moment has Borat attending a rodeo in one of the deep south hard-line redneck states. After being told that he should shave his moustache as it makes him look too much like a Muslim by one of the rodeo organisers, Borat proceeds to tell the crowd how he supports their country's 'war of terror' and has them cheering how he hopes George Bush drinks the blood of every Iraqi man, woman and child, before launching into a hilarious Kazakh national anthem to the tune of the American one. It is here that the film comes close to capturing the brilliance of TV show moments like Borat's 'Throw the Jew Down the Well, Then My Country Can Be Free' song and it is all in the crowd's changing reactions from suspicion, to mindless applause to anger that much of the comedy lies. Another great moment, albeit recycled from the TV version (and already adapted from Borat's early British TV appearances to the American show) is the scene with the etiquette consultant and dining club in which Borat is unsure of how to deal with the toilet. It manages to combine social satire with fratboy style gross out humour to great effect. The end of this scene features Borat calling up a prostitute and inviting her up to the dining club which provides some great reactions from the conservative diners. However, the fact that the prostitute is obviously an actress lessens the effect and this is a problem that runs through the film. The demands of the film having a plot means that there are a number of scenes that just seem very contrived, such as when Borat hitches a lift with a camper van full of drunk American students, and therefore have none of the spontaneous real people's reactions that are truly hilarious. Having said that, some quality comedy is drawn from the bear that Borat and his producer acquire for protection such as an obviously contrived but still amusing scene where the bear scares some children after ice cream. Another problem is that the Pamela Anderson quest plot line seems a little clichéd and uninspired resulting in Borat's road trip across America not actually doing what many audience members might have hoped and truly exploring the bizarre prejudices of middle Americans. Meanwhile, the scenes of Borat's home town in Kazakhstan while having amusing moments like his triumph over his neighbour (iPod minis are for girls) remove some of the charm of his fish out of water moments in the Western world and the authenticity of the character, formerly a convincing former Soviet republic TV reporter reduced to unreal stereotyping. Of course, Baron Cohen remains a skilled comic creator and actor and his dedication to the role remains impressive as he remains in character no matter what the situation and delivers a performance of occasionally surprising nuances, while the film itself is one that will undoubtedly make you laugh hard for most of the way through but, looking back on it, most people may get a sense of missed opportunity, that there were moments when a genuine classic movie could have been about to come out. Rumours currently persist that there is a bidding war going on for a new film adaptation of Baron Cohen's third character, gay fashion journalist Bruno, a newer character and therefore one who may have more material left than Ali G or Borat. Let's hope that given the marked improvement from Ali G Indahouse to Borat, it will be third time's the charm for Baron Cohen on the big screen. ***",7,2,6,7 November 2006
Hot Fuzz," It's no Shaun but it's pretty great
","Everybody loves zombies, not that many people love the police, and this is the problem with Hot Fuzz, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's latest. The constant film references don't inspire the same feelings of fond reminiscence that their earlier love letter to George Romero achieved. Quite frankly, a love letter to Michael Bay is not going to appeal on the same level. Furthermore, while the going nowhere lives of 20 somethings Tim, Daisy and Mike and, later, Shaun and Ed, were something that everyone could relate to even when faced with a zombie invasion, London supercop Nicholas Angel offers little to empathise with, meaning the early scenes suffer. Even the film's dazzling cast and cameos cause problems in these early stages, spotting an A-list actress behind the forensic mask as Angel's ex-girlfriend is entertaining but Bill Nighy, in particular, so excellent in Shaun of the Dead, is criminally underused. In fact, Hot Fuzz seems a bit over bloated in general, while Shaun was taut and tightly plotted, effectively gripping all the way through, Fuzz seems to run for a bit too long. Having got the complaints out of the way, it only comes now to say that Hot Fuzz is a hilariously entertaining film with a number of memorably great moments. Once you get beyond the fact that it is in no sense perfect and is, and could never be, as good as Shaun of the Dead, you will be in for a great night of fun. While most publicity and reviews have dwelt on the film as a British parody of the Bay-Bruckheimer style of action film-making, this is only really true of the final twenty minutes and even then it is hardly a balls-out action fest. If you're looking for a great Bruckheimer parody then look no further than Team America. For the most part, Hot Fuzz instead comes across as an episode of Midsomer Murders directed by Sam Raimi. Fortunately, this turns out to be quite a brilliant move as it manages to make the central portion of the movie into a silly, bloody murder mystery, playing brilliantly on the creepiness of small communities (The Wicker Man's Edward Woodward even appears as the meddling, petty head of the local neighbourhood watch). Hot Fuzz does nothing to tone down the gore of the boy's previous effort, either, with some truly entertaining deaths including one in which a local journalist is impaled by a spike from the church spire at the village fête. Yes, all the rural England clichés are intact and that is part of the joy of the film, that despite all of the Bad Boys references it is a resolutely British film and, like Shaun, much of it centres on the pub building once again to a shoot-out there. Meanwhile, quite possibly the finest of the film's many mixtures of cringeworthy rural life and big American movies involves no horror or action staple but is instead a horribly accurate am dram production of Romeo and Juliet, that's Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet complete with Juliet's angel wings, neon crucifixes and a musical performance of The Cardigans' Love Fool. Woodward is not the only high profile actor populating this small village with ex-Bond Timothy Dalton giving a delightfully fruity performance as the sinister manager of the local Somerfield. Meanwhile, the police force, composed of respected film actors and British comedy stars provide amusing support. In particular Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the detectives who really don't want to do any detecting, their matching looks down to their facial hair is funny in itself and provides a great moment with a top lip covered in the head of a pint ('You've got a moustache', 'I know'). In their sarcastic treatment of Angel's supercop eagerness, they also get to deliver the film's finest line. Of course, the film really revolves around the central pairing of Pegg and Nick Frost's PC Danny Butterman, the bumbling, naive and faintly childish son of Jim Broadbent's Inspector. After years of these best friends playing on screen best friends, here comes a film where they do not know each other at the start. Of course, the mismatched partners are quickly given the opportunity to slip into their old chemistry. This allows a little more humanity into Pegg's character as Angel lets up a bit in the face of Butterman's endearingly puppy dog enthusiasm ('What made you want to be a policeman?', 'Officer', 'What made you want to be a policeman, officer?'). Their pairing not just generating great dialogue but physical and visual comedy like their hamfisted attempts to catch a swan and the through garden chase that sees Butterman not quite capable of replicating Angel's athletic fence jumping technique. Frost is the film's heart and soul, his enthusiasm for action pictures and desire to be like the heroes in them is both charming and exasperating ('Have you ever fired two guns while jumping through the air?', 'Have you ever fired one gun while jumping through the air?', 'Is it true that there's a point on a man's head where if you shoot it, it will blow up?'), working especially well when he perceives Angel as like those heroes and tries to induct him into the ways of buddy cop action movies. Naturally, in the end the 'shit gets real' and the film descends into car chases and shoot outs as promised on all the posters and trailers, frankly there are a little too many of these although the Somerfield shoot-out and the final moments in the model village are both great. Even though it's not Shaun of the Dead, you should certainly leave the cinema with a smile on your face and will no doubt be quoting for weeks afterwards. And quite rightly so, 'You wanna be a big cop in a small town? F*ck off to the model village!' may be the best line you'll hear all year. ****",8,1,3,27 March 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Unpredictable and exciting
","At one point in the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film, At World's End, one very minor returning character remarks of our returning hero Jack Sparrow: 'Do you think he plans it all out or just makes it up as he goes along?' The same could easily be said of Pirates writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. Once more, with At World's End, we are faced with a plot that, like its central character, is completely unpredictable, swinging one way and then the other. Naturally, this is both the great charm of the Pirates franchise and of the roguish anti-hero himself but also its achilles heel. For every unexpected twist, there is a sequence of incredibly confusing double crosses that simply bog the plot down. One thing is for certain with the third Pirates film. This is no ordinary Disney summer blockbuster, Elliot and Rossio, along with director Gore Verbinski and uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, make some bold and surprising choices in the plot. The film opens on a mass hanging of men, women and even children known to be pirates or associates of pirates. This sets a tone that manages to be genuinely dark while still providing the light touch of the previous films. Meanwhile, Elliot, Rossio and Verbinski have no qualms about killing off some quite significant characters from the earlier films. One, in particular, has very little part to play in At World's End but manages a notably affecting final scene as our heroes attempt to return from their rescue of Jack, confined to Davy Jones' Locker.Indeed, the first third of At World's End, the rescue of Jack, could have made an excellent movie in itself as it is the sequence in which the film is at its most visually inventive and spectacular. Once again, Pirates of the Caribbean benefits from quite excellent production design, cinematography and computer effects. While the resurrected Barbossa sails the Black Pearl's former crew on a junk from Singapore through icy seas and giant waterfalls, Jack is going slowly insane. The scenes of Jack in the locker are over disappointingly briefly as they offer particularly weird fantasies, from the Pearl isolated in a desert crewed by multiple Jacks to the wonderfully strange pebble crabs. Meanwhile, Geoffrey Rush is a delight, back as Barbossa and gleefully chewing the scenery and almost stealing the movie from Johnny Depp. Less evil but possibly more mad than his Curse of the Black Pearl incarnation, Barbossa is the perfect person to lead the crew to losing themselves in the land of the dead, cackling brilliantly as the ship spills over the huge waterfall. Meanwhile, his bickering with Jack as they both attempt to take control of the Pearl is brilliant.The final battle is equally amazing, providing a spectacle like nothing you've ever seen before as the Black Pearl battles Davy Jones' fish people crew on the Flying Dutchman. The CGI effects are seamless here, even as tentacles and water fly everywhere it looks perfectly real. The sequence is exhilarating and packed with action all over, Jack fighting Davy Jones atop the Dutchman's mast for the chest is a stand out moment. However, the centre piece is the impromptu wedding held in the very brief pauses between the violent action. This scene has everything, genuinely exhilarating action mixed with the breezy comedy of the whole series, Rush presiding over things superbly as Barbossa and Orlando Bloom's Will and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth finally showing the spark and chemistry that Knightley had with Depp in the last film. There are even more twists and turns as the grand battle sequence ends in a distinctly surprising but clever way.This is not to say that At World's End is a classic from beginning to end. Those who had problems with Dead Man's Chest's messy and sometimes confusing plot will find little to counter their complaints here. The central portion is a confusing mess of double and triple crosses as it is impossible to follow the very allegiances and motivations of the central characters. This all builds up to a scene where the various pirate lords gather to squabble and debate and vote. While it is nice that every time the pirates attempt to get together and unite against a common enemy they end up squabbling and brawling, this becomes a little tiresome and has none of the fun of the bar brawl in Dead Man's Chest. However, one good moment does come in Keith Richards' surprisingly competent and charismatic performance.Bloom and Knightley have come in for some unwarranted flak for their earlier performances but here they do occasionally struggle with the material. Knightley is unable to convincingly pull off the rousing speech she is given before the final battle while Bloom, always perfectly cast as the moral straight man hero Will, hasn't the talent or the range to cope with Will's turning to darker and more confused motivations. However, the chemistry they have discovered between them allows you to forgive these blips because you are finally routing for Will and Elizabeth to be together, resulting in an ending that proves genuinely romantic in a very unexpected way, their final scene also providing a very un-Disney not very subtle suggestion of sex.While the ending leaves things open for a Pirates 4, this story would appear to tie things up nicely for Will and Elizabeth. Certainly, the possibly excessive imagination on show here implies Elliot and Rossio have enough left in them for a few more pirate adventures. Probably, it would be better for future instalments of the series to be individual stand alone stories rather than back-to-back sequels, however, taking Dead Man's Chest and At World's End as a whole, what we are left with is one grand, ambitious, long, hubristic, messy, beautiful, funny, exciting, confusing, unexpected, spectacular and, above all, supremely entertaining story. ****",8,4,7,24 July 2007
Spider-Man 3," Does whatever a $250 million budget can
","With Spider-Man 2, Sam Raimi basically set the benchmark by which all superhero blockbusters are judged, exciting, funny, action packed, spectacular, with characters that you care about and a great villain, it is virtually everything you could want from this kind of movie. Naturally, this means that expectation has been incredibly high for the third and final, for Raimi at least, instalment of this super series. Unfortunately, by his own high standards, it is hard to consider Raimi's third Spider-Man to be anything other than a disappointment. That is not to say that it lacks moments of spectacle and pure summer blockbuster fun, not to mention the odd moment of genuine emotion, but it certainly does not hold together as a film and swings quite wildly from the sublime to the ridiculous.That Raimi has stated pretty strongly that this will be his last Spider-Man feature even if the series continues, as it almost certainly will, is just the problem here. The film feels a lot like Raimi getting all of his good ideas in wherever he can, packing what is really two movies worth of quality material into one not only damages that material, giving it no room to breathe, but also sullies that excellent work Raimi did in the first two films to set this one up.With each villain given limited screen time, they have poorly fleshed out backstories. Thomas Haden Church is a very watchable actor but even he can't sell Flint Marko's clunky sick child plot or the awkward insertion of his story into Peter Parker's own history, something that heavily undermines moments from the first film, meanwhile his actual transformation into the Sandman comes in a rather ridiculous moment in which he literally stumbles into some unexplained scientific testing site. Secondary villain Venom fares little better and the director's dislike of his villain is clear in how underused Venom is here. Indeed, in trying to juggle multiple plot lines, the film has a tendency of just losing them and then picking them up much later. With all these extra characters and plot lines, the film really does feel quite long in places despite only being about ten minutes longer than its predecessor.So, the movie is deeply flawed, but this is not to say that it doesn't have multiple strong points at the same time. In his third Spidey film, Tobey Maguire is perfectly comfortable in the role and having great fun with it, nicely reflecting the newfound self confidence and pride with which Peter Parker begins this movie. His turn to the 'dark' side is very entertaining. Critics of the film have derided the emo hair, eyeliner, finger clicking, jazz dancing sequence as not a convincing turn to evil and laughable but that is rather the point. The sequence is pure Raimi, every bit as silly and entertaining as the Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head montage from Spider-Man 2. Indeed, it is pleasing to know that in all the pre-release hype about its dark edge, Raimi hasn't lost his light touch with Spider-Man and the film is still very funny in places with J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson act still stealing scenes and the inevitable Bruce Campbell cameo his best yet, playing a French waiter whose accent is only marginally more ridiculous than his moustache.Raimi has always handled the soap opera relationship stuff well and that continues here with inevitable difficulties entering Peter and MJ's relationship, leading to a new love triangle with Goblin's son Harry Osborne.Ah yes, the third of the film's triumvirate of villains and Spidey 3's one unequivocal strength. With a couple of films behind him, Harry actually has sufficient backstory and motivation to give his clashes with Spider-Man that extra edge. Meanwhile, James Franco, such a promising star in TV's Freaks and Geeks all those years ago, finally has something to really sink his teeth into and he seems to relish bringing out both Harry's charming side and his vindictive one. Even the slightly ridiculous amnesia plot works well, allowing Harry some moments of genuine bonding with Peter that highlights the tragedy of the way their relationship has gone. Of course, Harry at last gets the chance at some proper superpowers and a chance to have a real go at Spider-Man, or rather at Peter, because their clashes play out while our protagonist is not in his Spidey persona which just makes them extra effective. The first is a very cool looking action sequence which showcases the much better New Goblin costume and a great moment in which Peter does his wall climbing thing on a wall tumbling to the ground, their second is a down and dirty scrap that ends with the dark Peter in his one moment of genuine nastiness.Indeed, Spider-Man 3, even while it doesn't quite match the train sequence in Spider-Man 2, does deliver on some explosively entertaining action sequences. While the Sandman's transformation is poorly introduced, the moment that the sand comes together again to form a man is a triumph of special effects as is the scene in which Spidey sheds his Venom suit and it latches onto Brock.A film of poor plotting but great moments, then, rather than the final triumph some would have hoped for after Spidey 2, Spider-Man 3 is a flawed but entertaining slice of summer blockbuster fun. ***",6,0,1,22 May 2007
The Prestige," Magic movie
","Christopher Nolan is a director who seems preoccupied by the human mind and psychological troubles. Each of his dark, thriller type movies has focused on one such a thing, fear, insomnia, memory, stalking. As befits the subject matter, The Prestige is a slippery kind of film, full of disguise (the array of false beards used by the two central magicians is quite dazzling) twists and turns and revelations. Like his breakthrough masterpiece Memento, Nolan uses a non-linear time scheme to great effect in disguising where the plot is going and where it has come from. As in Memento, the time of the scene is shown through the character's physical scarrings (Leonard Shelby's facial scars here become Robert Angier's limp) that suggest an earlier mental scarring not yet revealed in the film. Drawing an obvious parallel with his own profession, performance is also a central theme of the film for Nolan. Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier (AKA The Great Danton) is a consummate performer, a showman who is able to pull in huge theatre crowds while rival Alfred Borden shies from the limelight and from dressing up his tricks and thus often finds himself playing to small rooms of people. Angier is driven by performance so much that even 'Robert Angier' is as much of a persona as 'The Great Danton'. He needs the acclaim of his audience, this is what defines him as a character. Jackman's charisma as a leading man has never been in doubt since he strapped on the claws and sideburns of Wolverine and this charisma is perfectly used for his stage performances as Danton, expertly selling the tricks. Meanwhile, as the obsessive Angier, Jackman brings a great range from the pain and anger after the death of his wife to the dangerous obsession and desire to discover the secret to his rival's trick. Even despite the cruel and slightly mentally disturbed things that Angier does, Jackman maintains the audience's sympathy for the most part and this is to his great credit. In his second feature with Nolan, after the superb Batman Begins, Christian Bale delivers an equally impressive performance as Borden, an intense, brooding but brilliant man who is able to spot the secret to Angier's and others' tricks with ease while they cannot see his. Borden has a similarly obsessive dedication but it is to creating the perfect trick, he lives his life purely for this and not for the audience acclaim like Angier. This sets up an interesting dichotomy in the motivations of the character that is reflected in their later actions. Bale and Nolan do bring some lighter moments for the serious Borden in his happy relationship with his wife and child. Seeing Borden as a happy family man brings the sympathy back round to him. With such attention on the leads, the supporting cast have less to do. Scarlett Johansson's role does not extend far beyond looking amazing in the saucy magician's assistant costumes. Meanwhile, the presence of David Bowie as enigmatic electricity manipulator Tesla is more of a distraction than a strong piece of casting, despite Bowie's obvious cool factor. However, the venerable Michael Caine gives a great weight to the character of Cutter, Angier's mentor who creates the mechanics of his tricks and tries to persuade him from the path of obsession. Caine is the heart and soul of the film, its moral compass and it is another superb performance of warmth, dignity and regret that suggest the great man is only getting better with age. No film is quite perfect and one minor flaw comes with the fact that with performances this good, the script doesn't need to say some of the things that it does. Writing with his brother Jonathon again, as in Memento, Nolan here has a slight tendency to overuse voice-over through the device of the magicians reading each other's diaries. The diaries may be a strong literary device in the source novel but are less cinematic. With Jackman conveying so much emotion wordlessly simply in his below stage bows when he wishes to be above, in front of the audience, there is no need to have his diary tell us this is how he felt. However, in general, the Nolans construct a strong script that provides a good balance between the lead characters and has a great momentum towards its strange climax. The twist in this film is not one that completely pulls the rug out from under you, that nobody will see coming, as this is often quite a lazy way of ending a movie with no relation to what has come before. Instead, Nolan threads the film with subtle references to what is really happening so that the film rewards paying close attention. Like the best magic tricks, it is not the outcome that amazes, it is the execution of it and even if you guess what the outcome is to be, there are still a couple of surprises waiting for you. Visually, Nolan brings up a number of stylish, arresting images of duplication, repetition and duality and objects that seemed just visually interesting earlier in the film gain in significance as the film progresses. The opening shots of a huge number of top hats in a forest or the cages full of pairs of canaries are prime examples of this. They are at first just a nice image, later the objects gain a significance and finally, the symbolism of the image has implications for the themes of the movie. The Prestige is, simply, a true prestige picture. An expert piece of film-making on virtually every level. What is more, five films in, it confirms Brit Nolan's place as one of the finest directors of his generation.",9,3,6,14 November 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Lose yourself in the labyrinth
","Having admirably juggled Hollywood and Spanish language pictures in the past, Guillermo Del Toro returns with a film that is both incredibly imaginative and unreal yet deeply moving on a most human level. It is to Del Toro's great credit that both the film's two worlds are not only convincing in their own right but are seamlessly and intelligently blended together, a cleverly edited and very stylish early sequence has Ofelia trying to calm her kicking unborn brother with a story as the camera pans down to show the baby's foetus and then across to the beautiful flower in a field of thorns from Ofelia's story and then follows the insect-like fairy back into the room with Ofelia and her mother. The special effects and editing here are superb and this mixing of reality and story gains the appearance of happening in a single tracking shot. As would be expected from the director of Hellboy, the art direction and design in the fantasy scenes is amazing. The finest such sequence comes courtesy of the Pale Man, a figure who has dominated all the pre-publicity for the film and yet, sat totally still at a table with a great feast and his eyeballs on a plate beside him, he cuts a brilliantly disturbing and strange figure the like of which we have never seen; and that is before he gets up, inserts the eyeballs into the palm of his hands and staggers after the terrified Ofelia. The faun, meanwhile, is no friendly, bumbling Mr. Tumnus, but an imposing, sinister figure who we are never entirely sure is worthy of our trust. He is also a creature that appears truly to be a part of nature, seeming to emerge from the rocks of his labyrinth when he first appears, when he describes himself as the mountains and the earth and the woods, he really looks like it. The majority of the film, however, occurs not in the fantasy world of the labyrinth but the very real world of the house of Captain Vidal. Played with great skill by Sergi Lopez, the captain is a terrific and yet very real kind of evil, a man who wants everything to be perfectly ordered and is pained by the notion of anything not being just as he desires it. Even his brutal torture method must follow a set pattern and script each time. Vidal's love of rigorous routine is further displayed in the classic Del Toro motif of clockwork as the captain is seen constantly winding his watch, a reminder also that he lives perpetually in the shadow of his father, a military hero whose watch stopped at the exact time of his death, a symbol to show his son how a great man dies. This, of course, raises another significant point about Vidal. He is, essentially, a small man, a man who is dedicated to following orders (the wrongness of blindly following orders is a further anti-Fascist theme of the film, contrasting the doctor's remarks on Vidal's never questioning attitude to Ofelia's reactions to the faun wanting her to do whatever he says). In the small world of the film he may seem like the great evil but he is just a small part of a rotting society. As the hiding rebels say, they may get rid of Vidal but Franco can always send another in his place. The real world of Pan's Labyrinth is a dark one, not just in the grim, gruesome violence dealt out by Captain Vidal but in the sense of being trapped here and, as voiced by Ofelia's mother, the feeling that this difficulty is the way that the world is. There is little wonder, therefore, that Ofelia retreats into the fantasy world offered by the faun. Del Toro leaves his audience in doubt as to whether this world is real or a product of Ofelia's troubled imagination, giving suggestions either way in the course of the film. With her stack of story books and the way she instantly perceives the strange insect creature as a fairy, Del Toro certainly gives his heroine an imagination he can relate to. While the usage of another book, blank until she fills it with her touch, as Ofelia's link her fantasy world tasks suggests the director's love of the power of stories. Real or otherwise, Ofelia sees her tasks as an escape from the imposing world of Vidal's house. She feels isolated, alone and misunderstood with her mother ill and in bed, her new stepfather unconcerned and no other children, so she jumps at the chance to prove herself to the faun. When he leaves after her failure to follow the rules she is broken and when he gives her one last chance it gives her new life. Del Toro's real strength in this film is not the visual creativity he normally brings as a director but the human emotional impact that he creates here as a writer. Ofelia, in a brilliant, charming and winning performance from young Ivana Baquero, is a heroine who really engages the audience's sympathies. Creative, resourceful and brave, she is a likable character whose feelings of being lost and alone among this dark, grown up world anybody who has been a child can relate to in some way. The fact that Baquero's performance shows her as obviously scared and yet managing to conquer her fears and go forward to complete her tasks, especially evident in the toad scene, makes Ofelia believable and yet heroic and Pan's Labyrinth more than just a dark fairy tale for adults. It is a powerful emotional piece and the final scenes will bring a tear to your eye. A film that deserves to be seen by everyone not just the small audiences that normally frequent subtitled pictures, Pan's Labyrinth is not just Del Toro's finest film but the finest film by any director this year.",10,6,13,14 December 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Another Part Three Anti-Climax for this Summer
","Let's get the big question out of the way first. At no point in The Bourne Ultimatum does the eponymous amnesiac assassin offer anything that could remotely be construed as an ultimatum.Of course, by this, third film in the lucrative franchise, the plot is so far removed from Robert Ludlum's trashy page turners that there is really little similarity beyond the title. While this is not, in itself, a bad thing, it does highlight the essential flaw with The Bourne Ultimatum that sets it beneath the quality of its predecessors. While in the original Bourne Identity, director Doug Liman was able to craft a more compelling plot by building around the central kernel of Ludlum's premise, something Ultimatum director Paul Greengrass continued in the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, this film seems curiously bereft of any driving force, giving the plot that much needed momentum in between some, admittedly very exciting, set piece moments.With Identity, the fact that the film suffered many re-writes and re-shoots probably served to strengthen the final product, here that same troubled production is a sign of a film with no strong drive to the plot. Although Greengrass does a strong job of tying Ultimatum directly in with Supremacy with the opening scene beginning straight after that film's crunchingly brutal car chase and the course of this film taking us through from there to a point where it meets up with Supremacy's New York set final scene, how it gets there is much less interesting and gripping than the previous films would have you expect. Meanwhile, the actual final confrontation is extremely anti-climactic with Albert Finney miscast and underused as the scientist responsible for programming Bourne as an assassin. The final revelations are such that they add nothing and tell you no detail you had not already assumed. There are at least some more intelligent and complex roles for David Strathairn and Joan Allen as the senior CIA operatives tracking down Bourne while disagreeing over their methods and Bourne's motives. These two are the only characters in the film that feel real and their interplay is a high point implying that there is a much better film in there that Greengrass could have made.Much has been made of how the revitalised James Bond of Casino Royale owes a lot to Bourne's earlier outings and, if this is the case, then it is also apparent that Ultimatum owes a debt to Bond in some of its lesser parts. The film's plot is little more than a series of action sequences in exotic foreign locales, strung together by clichés and conventions and an excess of mobile phone usage. Where Casino Royale at least had flawed and vulnerable central characters to anchor the padding in between these sequences (something of a rarity in a Bond picture), in The Bourne Ultimatum it is hard to find sympathy with any of the central figures.Most importantly, the character of Jason Bourne himself is no longer one who excites any empathy from the audience. Identity threw us straight in with Bourne's confusion and paranoia as the relentless pace of the plot forced him to run for his life while seeking his identity. Here, Bourne's motivations appear confused and thus so is the flow of the plot. Meanwhile, the character himself, now he is aware of his past as a trained killer, is completely cold with Matt Damon's usual inscrutability as an actor allowing us no window into his thoughts and feelings. Sometimes this inscrutable quality is an asset but in a film so anchored on the one character, with the support cast mostly ciphers used to further the plot (Julia Stiles, in particular, returns only to be lumbered with a completely two dimensional role assisting Bourne's progress), having no access to his motivations makes him seem much less complex. This problem is further compounded by Bourne's complete lack of vulnerability in action moments. Where Identity and Supremacy set the character up as a more real alternative to the old school of invincible one man army action heroes, in Ultimatum, he leaps across buildings, survives bomb explosions, incredibly destructive car crashes and multi-storey falls. Unlike in the first two films, you are never convinced that Bourne is in real peril. Something that causes Greengrass to insert Stiles and Paddy Considine, unusually awkward in his performance as a Guardian journalist, into the big sequences in order to keep suspense as we can believe there is a danger for them, rather than Bourne.Fortunately, Greengrass is still pretty capable of handling the action, although those given motion sickness by Supremacy's jittery hand held camera work will not be happy to see it return here. The sequence set inside a crowded Waterloo Station as Bourne attempts to get Considine's journalist to safety, guiding him on his phone away from the many operatives, is a classic spy movie moment with Greengrass expertly handling the tension and panic. Meanwhile, a chase across rooftops and a bloody, violent fight using fists and anything that comes to hand, a book being the standout, in a rundown Morocco apartment, is everything for which the Bourne series has become justifiably well regarded.Something of an anti-climax, The Bourne Ultimatum delivers a decently impressive turn your brain in at the door film of action thrills, but ultimately fails in being the promised intelligent thriller that could have wrapped up this strong trilogy in classic style. ***",6,1,4,20 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," Effective and disturbing horror sequel
","Five years ago 28 Days Later revitalised the zombie genre. The gap between that film and this should be enough to convince that this is no cheap rushed cash-in sequel. However, with writer Alex Garland, director Danny Boyle and star Cillian Murphy all off making the superb Sunshine, 28 Weeks Later comes from an entirely different team. Fortunately, Garland and Boyle as executive producers have seen fit to hire a director who can bring his own interesting vision to the project, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose debut film Intacto was a stylish and unusual thriller.While it has always been made very clear to us that the Infected are not zombies in the conventional sense, it is hard to view this film and its predecessor outside the zombie genre, especially as, wittingly or otherwise, 28 Weeks Later features aspects of some earlier zombie classics. The clashing ideologies of a medical (find a cure for it) or military (wipe them all out) solution is not only a development of the final third of the first film, but also of Romero's excellent Day of the Dead. Meanwhile the end of the film seems to be a Euro version of the final moments of Lucio Fulci's Zombie Flesh Eaters, after all you can only do zombies and London landmarks for so long.Indeed, the opening prologue, set during the time of the first infection, is like a Night of the Living Dead influenced zombie picture in miniature, a disparate group of survivors holed up in a remote, rural house with the Infected outside. It also happens to be the finest opening sequence in any horror film you're likely to see any time soon. It starts admirably restrained, starting with just the central couple, Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack, looking for food in the dark house, before revealing that there are others with them, and beginning to show the tensions in the group, tantalisingly setting up relationships that the movie doesn't have time to explore as their peace is quickly shattered by a banging on the door and soon the peace is completely shattered by a chaotic moment in which Carlyle makes the selfish choice to preserve his own life at all costs.Unfortunately, although for the most part the film retains this breakneck pace, it doesn't always maintain this quality. That is not to say that there isn't plenty of interesting things going on here, just that for all Fresnadillo's efforts, the characters are not well enough drawn to be those we care about. In the first film, we viewed the world through the eyes of Murphy's Jim and shared his confusion and fear at the deserted London and the sudden arrival of the Infected, here there is no such audience substitute. For the most part, however, the film is packed with enough great moments to save it from these poorly developed characters.Although it takes a little while to get going after the skip forward 28 weeks, when Britain, or rather the Isle of Dogs, is being repopulated, Fresnadillo and his co-writers' idea for how the infection returns and begins to spread again is an interesting one that raises some new ideas. Some of his ideas and techniques work very well were others do not so much. The fast running infected shot with shaky hand held cameras become a little annoying as it proves hard to keep track of what is happening and they do not have the unsettling quality of the old slow moving zombies, meanwhile his decision to view scenes through the eyes of an Infected character and to give one of the Infected this extra depth and ability seems ill suited to the genre where the menace comes from the facelessly identical evil of the whole group.Never the less, other moments are brilliantly effective. As an outsider and a foreigner, Fresnadillo brings a new eye to the first film's disturbing moments of deserted London streets and landmarks and, in setting the whole film in the capital this time, is able to cover more sides to the city, all of them chilling, abandoned and damaged environments. The presence of the US military provides a further interesting threat as well as a very effective if unsubtle critique of the current global situation reminiscent of Romero at his best. One superb sequence features the American snipers unable to deal with the panic caused as the Infected maraud among the civilians desperate to escape. They are given the order to simply shoot down everybody down there. It is a brilliantly realised moment of convincing confusion, panic and desperation.Fresnadillo also provides two absolute standout horror movie sequences that will be well remembered for a long time by those who see this movie. The first is the already infamous helicopter sequence, a brilliantly gory moment in which a slightly out of control helicopter decapitates and slices limbs off a whole crowd of Infected resulting in a massive pool of blood and severed body parts. The second is more atmospheric, set in a dark tube station, Rose Byrne's Scarlet guides the two children down the dark staircase, helping them to avoid the corpses on the ground with the night vision on her rifle's sight.The end is rather abrupt and involves a brand new London landmark that surely does not fit with the chronology of the series. Despite this fact, and the lack of characters you care for, 28 Weeks Later is an effective little horror of many fine moments and a worthy sequel to the earlier film. ****",7,1,2,22 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Bittersweet funny ensemble road movie
","America is a country obsessed with success. The constant desire to be number one, the best of the best is what fuels the national image. It is a world of constant competition where everybody wants to be a winner, or in the words of Nietzsche obsessed teen Dwayne, 'life is one f**king beauty contest after another'. Little Miss Sunshine gives us the Hoover family, the embodiment of the disappointment that comes from chasing this American Dream of success but ultimately failing on every level. The obsession with winning permeates all through the film, from minor details like the rossettes pinned to the Hoover's pinboard and their relatives inability to take Olive to the beauty pageant because their horses are competing in 'nationals' through to each character's desire to be the best. Motivational speaker Richard (Greg Kinnear) is desperate to spread his message of not being a loser, of bringing out the winner within to the extent that he constantly pushes this on his family even while he is clearly himself a loser in his inability to sell his ideas. Uncle Frank defines himself as being the country's preeminent Proust scholar and when his rival is given a genius grant above him, it drives him to attempt suicide. Meanwhile, little Olive is only able to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant as runner up in her regional competition after the winner was disqualified. This is a family who come off worse in everything they try and that is what makes them likable losers in this weird success obsessed America. As Tolstoy said 'all happy families are alike, unhappy families are unhappy in different ways.' Of course, there are no greater clichés in American independent cinema than the dysfunctional family and the road movie and Little Miss Sunshine doesn't escape from falling into a lot of these. The scenes of the van breaking down are funny but we've been there so many times before. However, it is an expertly made film which is more bitter than bittersweet up until the hilarious and genuinely heartwarming finale at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant itself, a sort of grotesque parody of adult beauty pageants (the smarmy MC of the show is particularly bad) and an event so weird and disturbing it's hard to believe it actually exists. Music video directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton give the film a bright but faded colour scheme that seems to reflect the character's high ambitions and their failures. In particular there is a strong recurring usage of yellow, from the Hoover's falling apart VW van to Dwayne's 'Jesus Was Wrong' T-shirt. What really lifts this picture above the pack, though, is the performances and the genuinely touching relationships that develop between these disparate characters who individually may seem clichéd dysfunctional family archetypes. Much of the laughs early on are generated by Alan Arkin's foul mouthed, drug taking grandpa but his mentoring and coaching of Olive is as touching as it is strange. Similarly, the way Frank's relationship with mute Dwayne gives them both someone to understand them is well done with the 'high school's your prime suffering years' speech particularly affecting. Steve Carell excels in his role as the gay, suicidal Proust expert, displaying a talent for deadpan sarcasm and a genuine sense of suffering and depression untapped in his previous performances in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. Special praise must also be given for young Abigail Breslin as Olive, the cheerfully optimistic yet insecure girl with the enormous glasses whose unlikely dream holds the whole family together. Resting such a weight of the movie on the shoulders of a child is often a big mistake but Breslin is adorably cute but also gives a surprisingly subtle performance with an impressive range. She brings out the best in the other characters, the ice cream in the diner scene being particularly good. It is undoubtedly one of the best child acting performances in a long time. While not being anything particularly new, Little Miss Sunshine is an entertaining, funny and well performed little picture about being one of life's losers and will certainly brighten up your day to see it. ****",8,1,3,7 November 2006
The Lives of Others," Stylish and intelligent character study
","At the start of the 21st century, German cinema is again drawing audience attention as a new generation of directors and filmmakers are starting to make films that deal directly with the dark days of the country's 20th century history. So far Goodbye Lenin and Downfall have both gained significant critical acclaim and not insignificant audience figures the world over, however the Oscar winning The Lives of Others is definitely the pick of the bunch.A quality piece of cinema for anyone, The Lives of Others is particularly impressive in coming from a first time writer-director, the wonderfully named Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Von Donnersmarck manages to combine a social comment on the dying days of the German Democratic Republic with an insightful character study and genuinely tense surveillance thriller. Von Donnersmarck does a fine job of bringing a sense of the bleak, grey quality of East Germany in the 1980s, expertly conveyed through the character of dedicated Stasi investigator Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler is the ultimate grey man, fading completely in the background even in some of his own movie, living a life of meticulous routine. In focusing the film on how Wiesler learns to appreciate a new view of the world in living vicariously through the artist couple he is listening in on, playwright Georg Dreyman and his leading lady Christa-Maria Sieland, von Donnersmarck is able to make a wider point about how the era of perestroika and glasnost came about through the ordinary people waking up to the life they could have more than changing views of their leaders.The film also is an interesting and very real portrait of life in the security service that spied on virtually everyone and the atmosphere of fear this creates. Some of the film's finest scenes are those that revolve around the Stasi offices, combining the mundanity of lectures and office life with the chilling situation of having to watch everything you say and think. The opening of the film is a great moment, cross cutting Wiesler interrogating a suspect with him playing the tape of the interrogation to a class of young wannabe Stasi operatives as Wiesler demonstrates how to break down a suspect and the signs that he is lying. A particularly fine moment comes in forcing the suspect to sit on his sweaty palmed hands and then removing the seat he has been sat on in order to have something for dogs to sniff him out in future. Another fine moment has Wiesler and his superior listening in on a group of younger co-workers in the Stasi cafeteria telling an insulting joke about Erich Honecker, the GDR's head of state , the character who tells it is not seen again in the film until the end when he is seen demoted to steaming open envelopes. These nice little details are what really make The Lives of Others seem to exist in a very banal, real world making the disturbing levels of surveillance even more chilling. In general, The Lives of Others is better at creating a human face to these Stasi characters than it is at making its dissident artists likable. Wiesler's superior, Anton Grubitz, is a self centred figure concerned largely with career advancement, however von Donnersmarck's writing and a strong performance from Ulrich Tukur manage to give him a sense of being a decent ordinary character who happens to work for a shady secret service. Dreyman and Sieland, however, come across as pretentious and self absorbed and one of the film's major weaknesses is that it never truly makes you care what happens to these two and this damages the effectiveness of the humanising of Wiesler as he observes them.However, an exceptional performance from Ulrich Muhe manages to bypass this trouble as he makes Wiesler's transformation both realistic and compelling. Unlike the likes of Grubitz, it is clear that Wiesler really believes in what he is doing and is truly dedicated to the cause of what he terms 'socialism' and has a professionalism other characters lack. However, he is a man utterly subsumed by his profession to the point where he appears to have little identity of his own, something well established by scenes of his monotonous home life. Von Donnersmarck, rarely for a first time writer director, does not over-write excessive levels of explanatory dialogue, relying on his leading man to bring a power to wordless scenes where Muhe shows in the smallest details Wiesler's emotional arc. There are some great moments as Wiesler begins to live vicariously through the more free living couple, the tear in his eye as he listens to the music they play or the moment in which he finally enters their apartment and is able to see all the objects he has only been able to picture in his head while listening in. The film does eventually not quite know how to wrap things up with multiple endings and epilogues of 'two years later' and then another 'two years later', however the final moments are a sentimental, bittersweet scene which rounds off the film nicely while the shots of East Berlin in the 90s show a certain ambiguity to the end of the GDR, still grey and bleak only now the walls are covered in graffiti, a sign that people have more freedom but that life as a whole has not improved that much. The Lives of Others is an intelligent and gripping character study and one shows that we could be hearing a lot more from the name Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, which can only be a good thing as it is an excellent name. *****",9,1,2,22 May 2007
Transformers," Not Much More Than Meets the Eye
","While other summer blockbusters like Spider-Man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean have struggled due to confusing plots and the constant necessity to become 'darker', Transformers' simplistic plot and ability not to take its ridiculous premise seriously are both a great strength and weakness, making the movie lighthearted fun but never injecting a real sense of danger. However, it is not this so much as the multiple plot strands that causes the problem. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as the American soldiers first attacked by the Decepticons who survive, discover how to kill them and help lead the fight back, are two dimensional excuses for all manner of dated flag waving action movie clichés of the worst kind, something Bay has been much guilty of before. Duhamel's character is so desperate to be reunited with his wife and newborn baby that he talks about little else, their final moments back together against a sunset backdrop is as bad as anything director Michael Bay did with Pearl Harbour.Even major actors like Jon Voigt and John Turturro do not fare well with the material. Turturro is particularly bad, providing so-called comic relief as the head of a shady government organisation who know more about the Transformers than they are letting on. Turturro's mugging and gurning belongs in a straight up parody, and not a good one at that, a sort of poor man's Men in Black, and it is a shame to see the man who was Barton Fink reduced to this.Fortunately, at the centre of all this, is one plot line that really does work. In the role of likeably nerdy, awkward teen Sam Witwicky, Shia LaBeouf completely proves himself to all the doubters unsure about whether he is entirely deserving of his star in the making, next big thing hype. Unlike the army captain, defence secretary or computer genius, Sam is an ordinary character it is easy to empathise with and LaBeouf plays him with great charm as he attempts to win the hot girl, Megan Fox's amply chested but under developed character wise car expert Mikaela, and deal with the fact that his new car seems to have a mind of its own. LaBeouf is also the one actor who really throws himself into the role, striking just the right balance of light comedy and thrills that suggest his casting in the next Indiana Jones film will be perfect. He manages to convince in interactions with the attractive but wooden Fox as much as with the computer generated robots (indeed LaBeouf's Sam is the only human character to have any consistent interplay with the robot characters). Furthermore, it is in LaBeouf's scenes that the comedy side of the movie becomes genuinely laugh out loud amusing, whether it is Sam's panic as the Autobots wreck his parent's pristinely kept lawn (a nice nod to the ridiculousness of the premise comes as the robots turn back into trucks and cars, still looking conspicuously out of place on the lawn, 'That's not hiding' Sam complains) or his interplay with his parents ('Sam's Happy Time'!).But what of those robots in disguise themselves, the real reason for anyone to see this movie? The special effects in Transformers are, quite simply, amazing with incredible levels of detail to every character. Whether in close up or standing in the distance, the robots never look anything less than solid, three dimensional presences interacting with the landscape and people around them with completely seamless integration. Appropriately enough, it is the actual transformation scenes that will cause the real wow factor within the audience as they will truly believe they are watching trucks and planes whirr and click into place as they change into giant robots. One particularly spectacular sequence features a chase along a busy highway in which the chasing Decepticons transform into their robot forms in the midst of the action. The design of the robots is very impressive (and a sequence involving a vending machine transformer shows the visual effects designers having a lot of fun with it), although the pointy, angular and all metallic Decepticons fare less well than the Autobots whose complex and detailed design is matched with big, clear blocks of colour.The actual fight sequences and battles are occasionally prone to Bay's tendency for too much camera movement and too rapid cuts so it is sometimes difficult to see what is going on, however they remain very impressive spectacles. However, the dialogue in the big smackdown between big bosses Optimus Prime and Megatron is so bad that it would seem better if the fight was completely dialogue free (Megatron: Humans don't deserve to live. Prime: They deserve to choose for themselves. - What's that even supposed to mean?) and, while visually impressive, the robot-on-robot violence is difficult to care about when there are no well developed characters. Of the Transformers, only Bumblebee, who gets to spend a lot of time interacting with LaBeouf's Sam, actually displays any real character. This becomes so much the case that the death of one of the Autobots, a major character in Transformers history, becomes a moment devoid of any emotional impact with Bay and co clearly hoping to trade on the affection fans have for the character rather than giving him any personality within the film.A mess of clichés and plot holes saved by LaBeouf's performance and amazing CGI effects, Transformers makes for enjoyably disposable entertainment, delivering just what you would expect from a Bay directed, Spielberg produced summer action blockbuster based on a toy range, but little more. Unsubtle in the extreme, whether with action or comedy, turn up looking to turn off your brain and enjoy some spectacular moments and occasional humour and you will have a great time, just don't think about it too much. ***",6,1,4,2 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Solid entry into the Potter canon but no masterpiece
","Given its long, sprawling, complex plot, The Order of the Phoenix has often been regarded as both the least enjoyable and the hardest to adapt on film of any of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Bearing this in mind, the producers' decision to eschew any established or safe film directors in favour of David Yates, a man whose career thus far rests on well regarded, serious political dramas on TV, is a bold but potentially disastrous choice as director.So, does Yates pull it off? Well, yes and no. The Potter series' jumping from director to director makes for some interesting differences in style and quality and on the whole Yates comes off quite well against the competition. For a man stepping up from TV to film, Yates does an admirable job with some of the grander sequences and set pieces, especially the final confrontation in the Ministry of Magic, and there is certainly a serious. grown up undercurrent to events that was completely absent from the early bright, fluffy Christopher Columbus pictures. However, Yates equally does not manage to imbue his film with a real sense of magic and wonder, or the constant threat evident in Alfonso Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban, easily the finest of the series so far. While the only strong evidence that this is Potter from the man who brought you State of Play lies in the repeated montages of newspaper headlines and a plot strand concerning media campaigns and government spin, this is, in fact, a relatively minor part to the film.Yates' film begins strongly, anchoring the sinister in the everyday as we see Harry in a very ordinary playground bullied by his unpleasant cousin and his cronies, things soon take a dark magical turn with the appearance of a soul sucking dementor in an underpass, so successfully threatening in Prisoner of Azkaban. Yates handles this with impressive disturbing effect, however it turns out to be the last time in the movie the audience really fear for the characters' safety. Back at Hogwart's, we are on fairly familiar ground and it is largely business as usual, even if the removal of another visually spectacular but rather tedious Quidditch game does provide a refreshing change. Rowling's plot is not focused enough on the threat of the returned dark lord Voldemort to give the plot any drive and seem like anything more than an episodic series of public school trials and tribulations.Of course, this is where Yates is able to reveal his secret weapon, Imelda Staunton, perfectly cast as Dolores Umbridge, a nicely different type of villain, all twin sets, pink and china plates with cats, her cheery demeanour hides a chilling intensity of purpose and narrow mindedness. Staunton gives one of the best performances of any of the illustriously starry cast in the whole series as she inflicts her reign of moral repression on the school through a series of proclamations hung on every available space on the wall. Unfortunately, although her bullying of the pupils, reaching a height with a strong sequence in which Harry is punished by writing lines with a magic pen that cuts the words into his hand, is effective as it is only just removed from how ordinary people view their teachers anyway, she does not provide a major threat and is rather quickly brushed aside to make way for the climax of the plot.Meanwhile, Staunton's performance means that the rest of the cast exist rather in her shadow, many of the big names showing up more through contractual obligation than a need to add anything to the plot. Alan Rickman as the sinister Snape remains underused, while Gary Oldman, no longer the fearsome and dangerous Prisoner of Azkaban, is stuck with a series of unimpressive sentimental moments and Helena Bonham Carter, as his witch relative Bellatrix Lestrange, another new addition to the cast, has barely anything to add. As for the young leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint once again improve a little on the previous film whilst still not really giving three dimensional performances. Although Evanna Lynch provides an impressively odd turn as creepily not all there Luna Lovegood.One actor that does make the best of limited screen time is Ralph Fiennes, back again as the evil Voldemort. Fiennes has a great presence in the movie, needing little more than a strange crook of the neck to appear a threat. Meanwhile, his cowled and masked Death Eaters are equally sinister. Once the movie finally arrives at its finale with Voldemort having lured Harry and friends to a vast hall of crystal balls in the Ministry and our heroes are attacked by the dark figures, the film finally gets going but it has spent a little too long in getting there. The finale is spectacular even though Oldman's final moments are just a little confusing and anti-climactic.In all, Yates does a solid job of adapting this difficult book, cutting down the plot to a manageable length, although he is a little over-reliant on montage, and throwing in some big moments. He has shown enough to justify his return for film six, The Half Blood Prince, however he will have to prove himself capable then of providing more than a superficial film with a greater sense of peril. The Potter films have always been more impressive when viewed as a series, when the true achievement of this grand scheme is obvious and the familiarity of Hogwart's becomes part of the appeal, and Order of the Phoenix is one of the better films in the series, however on its own it is certainly no masterpiece. ***",6,1,3,17 September 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Captivating portrayal of brutal but charming dictator
","Hollywood is a place that loves a fad, even more it loves a surefire winner. Ever since films like The Constant Gardener and Hotel Rwanda, not to mention Tsotsi, won both critical and awards success last year, films highlighting social and political issues in Africa, past and present, have been the fashion for serious, awards hungry filmmakers. With Babel and Blood Diamond yet to come, The Last King of Scotland is the first of this year's big awards contenders to look at Africa and, on the strength of its showing here, is already in a strong position to at least win something. If the current climate of Hollywood producers desiring African stories has enabled Kevin MacDonald to make this adaptation of Giles Foden's novel about Idi Amin and his fictional Scottish doctor then this can only be a good thing as MacDonald has crafted a gripping thriller. Rather than show the effects of Amin's brutal and destructive regime on the ordinary people of 1970s Uganda, The Last King of Scotland focuses instead on the relationship between Amin and doctor Nicholas Garrigan and this decision is both the film's greatest strength and its one significant weakness. MacDonald is best known for his acclaimed documentary work on films like Touching the Void and One Day in September and yet here he chooses to avoid attempting the true life story option to tell a story removed from the suffering of the ordinary people. Indeed, the film's closing use of actual footage of Amin telling us what happened next seems strangely artificial. Thus, the film does not function in an entirely satisfactory way if its intentions are to draw attention to the horrors of the regime for Ugandan people. However, this focus on the two characters does allow for a fascinating character study of a megalomaniac as seen by one of the people closest to him and for two very strong central performances from Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy. McAvoy's Garrigan being cut off from what is really happening in the country at large goes some way to explaining why he remains loyal to Amin. There is also a clever usage of the British diplomat predicting how the regime will turn out and later trying to tell Garrigan what is really happening being a smarmily obnoxious upper class Englishman (played with great unpleasantness by Simon McBurney) who is such a dislikable person that we do not want to think he is right and neither does Garrigan. McAvoy plays Garrigan with just the right amount of laddish wide boy charm, managing to seduce almost all the women he meets including Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington in small but significant roles, and untraveled naivety to make him likable even while accepting the friendship of a dictator. Garrigan clearly is a bit of a berk sometimes but he is obviously seduced by the combination of living the high life and the promise that he could have the power to do something significant. Of course, the other reason he is happy to accept Amin's friendship is the character of Amin himself. Forest Whitaker's captivating performance gives great depth and range in a way films do not usually allow bloody minded dictators to make Amin truly a compelling and fascinating character. In the early scenes when he is making speeches and inviting Garrigan to become his personal physician, we can easily see why Garrigan is swayed by him. His charisma is unquestionable and he has a good humour and infectious laugh. It is only very gradually that Amin lets Garrigan and therefore the film's audience get more glimpses into the real him as his paranoia threatens all those around him. That infectious laugh becomes threatening, like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas you never know whether it is a laugh of genuine mirth or madness and there is always a sense with Whitaker's performance that Amin could easily slip from one to the other at the slightest nudge. In the final scenes, Garrigan tells Amin that he's a child and that's what makes him so scary. It's a very apt description of a man who wields power with an arbitrary petulance, meaning Garrigan must increasingly act cautiously around him even as he tries to get away from Uganda as the truth begins to come out and he sees images of what Amin's regime has done. There is one particularly disturbing moment late on of a horribly mutilated body that means a lot to Garrigan. However, even in the final scenes, Amin is capable of turning on the charm, making his moments of evil more disturbing. A final hostage situation, MacDonald building on what he learnt making One Day in September, has Amin moving from charming the world's press to torturing his victim in the other room. Of all the torture scenes there have been on screen in recent months, this is the most harrowing. Taking its cue from Fernando Meirelles' strong work on The Constant Gardener, the film is shot with a rich colour palate and soundtracked with African rhythms, although MacDonald manages to conjure up an impressively 1970s feel, not just visually but in this style of issues film/thriller crossover. Once it gets going in the second half, the pace is relentless and the thriller aspect is gripping as Garrigan's desperation to escape gets him caught up in plots to assassinate the dictator, leading to the violent conclusion. A top notch thriller with two excellent leads, The Last King of Scotland should practically guarantee Forest Whitaker that Oscar for providing a glimpse behind the mask of a powerful madman. ****",8,0,2,7 February 2007
Casino Royale," A new lease of life for Bond
","Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with a little help from Crash's Paul Haggis) have gone literally right back to the drawing board with this one by adapting writer Ian Fleming's very first Bond novel. So, what we get here is an origin story, stripped of the usual gadgets and excess, a film that shows how Bond became the character we know and explores just what it takes to be that character. The opening pre-credits scene is like nothing you have ever seen in a Bond movie before. Filmed in stark black and white we see Bond confront an MI6 traitor with flashbacks to his first kill, a crunchingly brutal fight in a toilet. This really is a radical departure, a Bond who is clearly in pain when he gets hit and who is clearly quite emotionally moved by the brutal pain he inflicts. Back in the present, he dispatches the traitor with a harsh coldness that indicates how the job has already begun to sap some of his humanity. It's a great scene that promises a harsh and dirty hit-man thriller and leads, via a clever use of the famous iris intro, into an opening credits sequence with great retro style and not a gyrating female silhouette in sight. After the credits, we are back in conventional Bond territory with a dramatic, stunt filled chase and fight sequence as our hero tries to capture a terrorist bomb maker. Thrilling though this scene is in moments, this is also where Casino Royale's problems seem to kick in. In adapting Fleming's thin novella with its limited numbers of characters and locations, Purvis and Wade decide to add in a wider plot of more conventional James Bond action moments that don't exactly sit right with the other parts. There are times when it feels like a film that wants to have its cake and eat it, that there are two very different films here awkwardly stuck together. Fortunately, both of these two films are pretty enjoyable. The action part containing some classic Bond moments in suitably beautiful, exotic settings like the Bahamas and Montenegro, in particular the opening chase involving parkour expert Sebastien Foucan leaping around cranes and scaffolding on a building site. It looks great but there is also a real sense of danger. In his second Bond picture after revitalising the series once before with the excellent post-Cold War Goldeneye, director Martin Campbell brings a visceral painful quality to the fights and stunts. Each punch and fall is loudly and sickeningly soundtracked to give a real feeling of pain while Bond seems to be scrambling just to hold on and stay alive in moments like the airport sequence, stunts more reminiscent of the seat of your pants Indiana Jones style than the invulnerable Roger Moore. However, despite the undoubted enjoyment in these action moments, the real quality of this film is in the central Casino Royale scenes and there is a certain shame in the filmmakers having not stuck to their guns and made a smaller, more intimate and stylishly retro spy thriller like this. Campbell has an impressive ability to draw out the tension in the card game while keeping the intervals between play packed with intrigue and bursts of tough action. The intimacy of the poker game allows for the film to truly explore a close confrontation between Bond and villain Le Chiffre, an impressively inscrutable Mads Mikkelsen, sporting a classic Bond villain scar and some creepy tears of blood. This section, and the film as a whole, really kicks into gear with the first introduction of the girl, Eva Green's Vesper Lynd, on a train across Europe engaging in some dinner table banter with Bond reminiscent of the glamour and spark of Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint in North by Northwest. While the film's other girls are more the clichéd Bond girl eye candy, Vesper is a real match for Bond. With a strong, convincing performance from Green, the French actress delivering an impressive cut glass English accent, Vesper is smart, sassy and easily the sexiest accountant ever on film. She is a strong woman but not in the sense of Halle Berry's cartoonish Jinx in the last film, a male action stereotype grafted onto a female character. Vesper gives as good as she gets but is still a feminine character and is actually bothered by what Bond does for a living which makes a refreshing change, the scene where she breaks down in the shower after witnessing, and playing a part in, a particularly brutal killing is a level of emotional intensity and realism that we do not expect from a Bond film. Green as Vesper is easily one of the best Bond girls in any film in the series. Of course, the real strength of Casino Royale is in Bond himself, the character having greater depth and range and strongly played by Daniel Craig dispelling all the initial doubts about his casting. While Craig's emotional coldness is often a problem in his other films, it perfectly fits the callous aspect of Bond's character but Craig is also able to turn on the charm if needs be. The film cleverly plays with a few of the character's conventions, having him win a gorgeous 1960s Aston Martin in an early poker game and being not remotely bothered whether his Martini is shaken or stirred after ordering a drink in a flustered moment. Craig brings a combination of being the first Bond to be really in pain physically and emotionally and being the first to truly convince as someone who can do what he does. His impressive musculature is obvious and its clear that here is a man who could take you out, while he obviously has no trouble with a gun either. It will be interesting to see where Bond goes from here and whether the producers stick to this bold new direction or quickly revert to the old clichés as in the Brosnan years.",7,2,4,22 November 2006
300," Visually dazzling but very shallow
","You get the impression that, were they able to take time from their busy schedule of brutal training and massive slaughter, the Spartans would enjoy Frank Miller's vision of their most legendary moment, the last stand of 300 Spartan warriors against the vast Persian army at Thermopylae. Cinema going audiences were introduced to Miller's world view in the phenomenally successful if insubstantial Sin City and little has changed here despite the dramatic change of scenery from dark shadowy Basin City to the bright cornfields of ancient Sparta. In fact, the classical world setting allows for an even more extreme version of Miller's preoccupations, tough, physical, brutal men, beautiful women and loathsome, deformed, depraved and ugly villains. This certainly tallies with the philosophy of a proto-fascist people who prized strength and physical prowess above all else exposed and abandoned any child to display the slightest deformity and trained their children in the ways of violent combat from a young age. Director Zack Snyder, already hard at work appeasing the fanboys for his next adaptation of a beloved comic book property, Alan Moore's Watchmen, stays very close to the source material, not just Miller's graphic novel but also the histories of Herodotus, the original chronicler of the Battle of Thermopylae and Miller's major source. Of course, Herodotus makes little mention of the Spartans fighting in leather codpieces rather than armour (a curious decision on the part of the filmmakers which just looks ridiculous in places), or the Persians bringing giants, war rhinos and goat headed minstrels, but these are mere trappings, the storyline of the course of the battle, the tactics, each wave of assault and the Spartans betrayal, all draw directly on historical sources. Indeed, even the dialogue quotes the mythic speech given in early histories to the Spartans such as the famous comeback to the Persian threat to blot out the sun with their arrows, 'then we will fight in the shade' and the Spartans final epitaph'. In their desire to tell their story of Spartan heroics, however, Miller and Snyder do sideline the role played by other Greek states at Thermopylae and the Persian Wars as a whole, reducing them to a group of unskilled and cowardly Arcadians. The lack of an accurate portrayal of various Greek states is pretty irrelevant in itself but it does highlight a wider issue, namely whether we really need Miller's authentically Spartan version of this story. The Spartan philosophy is perhaps a little simple and superficial to make an interesting and complex film. Sparta is a soldier state and it is difficult to relate to their code of honour in which they must return from battle with their shield or on it, such a desire for war and honour scuppered the earlier Troy as modern audiences struggled to grasp these ancient motivations. While the Persian enemies are faceless villains, literally in the case of the masked ninja style Immortals, the Spartan soldiers fare little better. The 300, a group of hardass Scots for the most part, are two dimensional clichés (the ageing captain who has seen many years of service with his king and friend, and the captain's eager, callow young son being obvious examples) devoid of any emotional arc, in fact it is often difficult to discern much emotion at all in them. Gerard Butler as Leonidas, the Spartans' pointy bearded King, at least gets a little more opportunity for moments of complexity, such as in his relationship with his wife Lena Headey, the film's most deep character and one developed greatly from Miller's original, but spends much of the film shouting in his curious accent, his natural Scottish slipping through quite often. The script is appallingly clunky in places, curiously mixing the grandstanding posturing of classical heroes with the laddish banter of modern war films. As is often the case with comic book dialogue, the actors sometimes struggle to say it with any realism and conviction, Dominic West as the Spartan senator in league with the Persians being particularly poor. Fortunately, Snyder's directing is considerably better than his writing and 300's visual style creates a unique and beautiful epic (despite a slight excess of sub-Gladiator scenes of golden cornfields). Like it's predecessor Sin City, 300 uses real actors in front of computer generated backdrops to recreate the style of the graphic novel and any shot of the film could be a brilliantly realised rendition of a frame of graphic novel or even a painting. For once, the dumb audience in an action movie cliché of wanting to cut through the boring talky bits to get straight to the blood and violence is true here as when people are not talking this film really takes off. Moments like the wreck of the Persian fleet in a storm or the Spartans in their crimson cloaks rolling the Immortals off their shields and hacking them down or athletically throwing their spears are stunning looking. Some of the violence including decapitations and the removal of legs is very impressive. Meanwhile, the first assault as the Persians crash against the shields of the Spartan phalanx is as exciting and visceral a realisation of the loud, violent confusion of classical warfare as in any epic. However, these moments are too few and far between and the superficiality of the film is too apparent when the excitement of battle is not going on around the uninteresting characters. It would be possible to greatly enjoy the film in a beer fuelled testosterone heavy group of other men and certainly fans of Sin City and Miller's work in general will love it, but 300 is a silly and shallow film whose exciting visuals don't make up for its many faults. Yes, Spartans may love this film but many 21st century viewers may be left a little cold and possibly even bored.",5,3,7,28 March 2007
