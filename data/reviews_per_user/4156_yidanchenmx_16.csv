Source Code," Umm
","This is a 'traversing' movie, which uses a mature film language to tell the future and the past, the first space (world) and the second space (world), and the consciousness of the human brain after the death of the body Possibility, at the same time, I want to introduce the current four-dimensional space of our world. Bacteria let it continue to live in the first dimension. It may also be 'happiness'. Does Zifeiyu know how to be happy? , Plane, the third dimension is pure solid, and the fourth dimension adds 'time'. Even if I ca n't read Stephen Hawking 's brief history of time, Duncan Jones has at least seen it. Time is only a metaphor in the movie. In one place, the watch is gone, the watch is stopped, 8 minutes go back and back, and the countdown to life. And so on, Duncan is very smart, really very cunning and smart, because he knows that the big concept of time is also the concept of too Difficult to explain and unable to quantify, it is better to let the mindless people resonate and associate from the heart.",8,0,0,24 March 2020
Catch Me If You Can," Love it
","This film is not to deify the criminal behavior of the real character Frank, but to convey a criminal back to the theme of shore redemption. But the comedic flavor of the entire film balances the seriousness of the subject. Therefore, it is the focus of this film to seize the charm of the characters walking in the edge of the law and the edge of reality in the film.",9,0,0,17 March 2020
It," Not bad
","I've never watched the original version before, and I would say that it is a good movie. The scary scene perfectly fit the story and make this movie complete.",8,0,0,16 March 2020
Mulan," My favorite Disney animation movie
","As an Asian, I cannot be more excited about this movie and the effort that all the crew and cast put in to make this movie as close as to Chinese culture. It was the first time that Asian, especially Asian women, have a chance to show their strength to the world, that Asian women do not follow the stereotype of tiny, skinny, lowliness, and pavid. Plus the sprit of protecting the country as protecting the family is an important element of Chinese culture, which you might not find in anywhere else in the world.",10,0,0,14 March 2020
The Hunger Games," Jennifer Lawrence is awesome
","I love the performance of every character, and they perfectly fit the description in books. But I have to say I like Gale more than Pete.",10,2,4,16 March 2020
Ted," Review
","The story tells the story of a teddy bear. Technically, from the very beginning of the movie, I started to wonder a question: how to be credible?
A teddy bear is full of character and can talk. So how did the story begin?
Fortunately, the story started well. On Christmas Eve, the child got a bear, and the bear could talk. After experiencing the media's buzz, such a bear began to become sparse and ordinary, the days were as sparse, and the taste became even heavier.
Fortunately, I didn't see a story about Toy Story 3.",6,1,1,31 March 2020
Gone Girl," Great movie
","Love this ending so much. Originally I had been thinking about how this story would end. I always imagined that either of them would kill the other. What I did not expect was that the ending would be peaceful and joyful. David Vinci threw a black humorous joke to the world, and the seemingly happy ending could almost put this film into the category of 'horror film'.
But anyway, I am still insidious to believe that this is the truth of marriage.",8,0,0,18 March 2020
Insidious," Review
","The whole film is pretty good, there are a few scary scenes that suddenly appear, but none of them make a loud volume on purpose, so it looks very comfortable. It was not until the last 5 minutes that I felt horror from my heart. What the closest people ca n't believe, that 's a terrible thing",7,0,0,23 March 2020
Room," Little thoughts
","For Jack, who was born in a room, the room is the whole of the world, so it can extend infinitely from all directions. This world is not good or bad because there is no comparison. The outside world does not mean anything more. On the contrary, it is only possible. Is less secure. For Joey, does going out mean that she wants the freedom, why in the room she and Jack depend on each other, and live to go out, waiting until she really goes out, but with the freedom she yearns to return, but ca n't Adapt to suicide.",10,1,2,18 March 2020
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Typical movie about dream
","How many people will be like the main character every day repeatedly cycle the day-to-day, perhaps you are a bad opportunity to make you impulsive, to pursue your heart that buried long-buried dream. In this film to 'life' as the main line, implied the meaning of the pun, on the one hand to save 'Life' company, on the other hand, to save the protagonist's 'Life.' That buried the truth of the photo makes the main character from a love YY boring middle-aged person into a constant search, to challenge the limits of life, the search, and finally found that 'Life' is not in a very distant place, on the contrary, 'Life' is in your side, in every person with infinite potential of the white and unsightly body. Coupled with the film Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas endless beauty and music perfect lying together, the beauty is really moving.",7,0,0,19 March 2020

","Simba in the movie is like us. One day, I will leave my parents, and go out alone. I may encounter bad people during the journey, and I may encounter various setbacks, but we may also encounter ourselves. Lifetime partner, lifetime confidant, lifetime lover. So we do n't need to be afraid for the future, because our lives are created by ourselves",7,0,1,20 March 2020
Hero," Can't get enough from it
","The world must be divided for a long time, and for a long time, there must be bloodshed and sacrifice for each division and merger. Heroes are the symbol of justice and the hope of the country. Behind every kill is a hero. I don't think Wuming was moved by the 'world' of Can Jian, but by the spirit of Qin Shihuang",8,0,0,29 March 2020
Coco," Touching
","The film's discussion of death mainly rests on the inextricable bond between the living and the dead. Since the story itself happened on the night of the Day of the Dead, the living person greeted the dead in a cheerful way, and mourning became part of the carnival. Therefore, the tone of the film is not dark and negative, but it has sadness and nostalgia inseparable from death. Among the two temperaments, 'Looking for a Dream' should be the least laughable part of Pixar's work, but it is also bright and light. The highlights of the film return to the characteristics that a good movie should have, that is, a group of flesh-and-blood characters, a convincing twist and turn story, and the strong emotions that erupt in it.",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Avatar," Love the theme
","Always respect the nature and life. The best way to fix the relationship is not to let someone else scare of you, but to understand each other instead. Violence will only lead to meaningless death and injury. Acceptance may be the highest recognition to every single one.",9,0,0,14 March 2020

Ice Age," Like it
","A movie I watched a long time ago, and now I remember that the squirrel that impressed me the most was the ancient squirrel, the troublemaker, and I really liked it. The story of the Mammoth family makes me feel the warmth of my family. No matter what kind of environment they are in, no matter what difficulties they encounter, the family is always our strongest backing and the most comfortable harbor. This film is well made, suitable for all ages, children can be friends with cute animals, and adults can experience a deeper meaning from the animation. In short, it is an excellent animated film that is worth the time to watch. I hope the animated film can It is getting better and better, so that more human bodies can appreciate the charm of animation.",8,1,1,28 March 2020
