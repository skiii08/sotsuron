The King's Speech," Great Movie!
","How does one make a movie out of a serious speech impediment? When one has the director chops of Tom Hopper, the writing skills of David Siedler and the brilliant acting of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush along with a star-studded supporting cast, that's how.This is a character driven story as the plot is slender. But it still keeps you on the edge of your seat even though the outcome is known. I remember my father talking about the awful speech impediment of George VI and wondering how he ever overcame it and was it a ghost speaker he had on those fiery war era radio broadcasts. Well, now we all know.The movie is captivating and subtle, full of tender moments and unexpected comedic jolts.The future king's character is captured perfectly by Colin Firth, a man full of self-doubt and psychologically damaged from an early age. His speech therapist uses extremely unconventional tools to assist him in overcoming his handicap.I will not lay down spoilers due to the delicacy of the plot. If I have any reservation it is in the open show of affection displayed by the king for his wife and daughters in front of others. Kissing the queen, lifting the daughters. To anyone who has read anything about George VI, this was not in his nature at all, he was a very private, shy person. but that is a tiny whinge in a review of a film that was so utterly splendid in execution and casting.The supporting cast includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi. Jennifer Ehle (who starred with Colin Firth in the wondrous version of Pride & Prejudice) and Guy Pearce, all of whom are flawless.Oscars? Definitely. 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,31 December 2010
Black Swan," How Many Clichés?
","Well, I lost track. Seriously. I am still astonished at the high rating it had here at IMDb (which rarely lets me down) as that is what encouraged me to go.Natalie Portman, whether the white swan or black swan, is an expressionless member of the chorus selected by the choreographer to play the lead in Swan Lake. Inexplicably, I might add, when there are far more talented dancers around her.She is a one-note swan. Her facial expression never varies from sad, purse-mouthed and leaky eyed. I got so tired of looking at her face and it is shown just about all the time. To top it off, I felt absolutely no connection with any other character as the movie wound excruciatingly along on its hopeless execrable way to nowhere.The lack of script is a serious flaw: but the graphic detail of what she does do is laid out: she vomits, she slashes herself, she lives with her mother, she has lesbian sex - sorta, but she has no background, no character, apart from mommy's girl, no friends, no interactions with others apart from the briefest of convos about ballet. The mother is completely cardboard - with matching dialogue - 'I gave up my career for you, poor me'.This comes across as a horror movie with an unnecessary disgust factor aiming for the roof. I covered my eyes many times. Not in fear but in a kind of shame that a movie could be this bad. It is not even a good ballet movie, the dance sequences are choppy compounded by the uneven hand of the director everywhere.When the audience started to laugh about 1/3 of the way through, I knew it was all hopeless. I joined in, that's how appallingly bad it all was. In the final scene, the laugh meter topped out. It is that unbelievable and unintentionally comedic.1 out of 10 from me as minuses are not allowed.Avoid.",1,418,733,15 January 2011
Walk the Line," A great surprise!
","I did not go willingly to see this, it was a toss-up between 'Syriana' and 'Walk the Line' and WTL won and I'm so glad. This is mainly a feel good effort from James Mangold and many of the warts of Johnny Cash are depicted, some in great detail: nothing is spared in the depiction of his first marriage and how selfish and neglectful his behaviour was towards his wife and daughters mainly through his use and abuse of drugs and alcohol. This is all stuff that was common knowledge. However, the underlayers to this were a brother who was accidentally killed and a father who blamed Johnny for being the son who was spared when his brother was so much more superior. Johnny's father has his own demons. What truly brings magic to the screen are the performance of the two leads and their surprisingly incredible voices. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give their all and capture the spirits of Johnny and June Cash so extraordinarily well it is almost surreal. Bravo to all, well done! 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,19 January 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Dark, bleak, hopeless look at addiction
","There is not one bright spot in this movie, it is extremely depressing.  It shows the spiralling downward of different addictions told through the stories of a mother and son. the director really knows his job here, this must have been a very difficult movie to film, at times you feel the 'jonesing' of the addicts looking for their next fix, hit, pill, this is how well it is done. The effects of speed, the infamous diet pill, is captured in a short spellbinding scene that must have taken forever to film. Ellen Burstyn had her Oscar stolen from her by the drones who voted for Julia.  In her performance here she is amazing, down to her walking, talking and electric shock therapy reactions through her slide to insanity. The other leads excel as well, particularly Jennifer Connolly, looking at the end like a ghost of her former self. It clearly depicts the hell of addiction - the love affair with the drug of choice takes over one's life so that all else is forgotten and the true degradation of the spirit begins.  Not since 'Leaving Las Vegas' and 'The Lost weekend' and 'Days of Wine & Roses' has this been so well done. This director is going places. I have it a 7 out of 10 as the beginning is slow and took a while to engage me and also for the absolutely no hope of redemption depicted, even by a minor character.",Null,0,0,21 June 2001
Deja Vu," I don't condemn the whole movie.....
","Parts of it were truly truly excellent. I'm a fan of Denzel and love his low-key approach to these meaty roles he snags. And here he doesn't disappoint. The movie had me from the beginning right up to the four-day delay relay of New Orleans. the technology was fascinating and believable and I'm a fan of good sci-fi along with anyone else.However and it is a huge however, once the movie slipped into time travel it literally blew up and totally lost me.Great trouble was taken by the director and the script writer to keep the interesting clues consistent in both the past and the present and kudos for that.But it was alarming that the major plot hole of only sending a note of warning back in time once only and then to the wrong man who gets himself killed as a result. Puh-leese. And then I kept re-working the script - in my head - to more coherence.I found the scene of the mad smashemup Hummer ride inserted strictly for the young teenage boys of the audience, it was like a video game, innocent tiny passenger cars were totalled willy-nilly with no one to ponder the carnage of bodies that would result. On to the next. The fixation of Doug (the Denzel role) on a dead woman was almost pornographic at times and reminiscent to me of 'Laura'. But all the knots were neatly untied in Laura.And here? The time warped Doug dies, the ferry is saved, and in true Hollow-Wood fashion the new and improved Doug sallies forth to embrace the teary heroine.Serious movie let down from a quite auspicious beginning. Almost like two movies put through a blender. Badly. 6 out of 10. A shame. There was a superb suspense thriller in there somewhere waiting to get out. Everyone ignored it.",6,2,4,30 April 2007
Lifeboat," Tallulah, dahling
","The star of this wonderful movie is definitely the larger than life Bankhead who plays her outrageous self and slowly gets humanized over the course of the film. Ladies, there are some very sexy scenes in this movie. It is a shame she did not make more.  Alfred at his best and most under-rated. Dynmaite cast who keep our attention all through it.  In the days of non-computerized special affects this is remarkably believable. I would rate it one of Hitch's best, even on a 4th viewing.",Null,8,11,3 July 2000
In Bruges," A huge disappointment!
","I was looking forward to this, being a huge fan of Martin McDonagh and Colin Farrell AND Brendan Gleeson.Bruges is a character in the film too, a beautiful Bruges, canals, cathedrals and lovely cobblestones. Lit beautifully by Eigil Bryld.But all of this was not enough to sustain the beginning of a pretty good story line to the end. It just got murkier and murkier along the way until I just didn't know what kind of movie it was trying to be. Drama? Comedy? Noir? Slash? One of my hated clichés in ANY movie is the corpse that just won't die. You know the type, shot, knifed, thrown from high building, bleeding copiously in all directions but the damn thing keeps spewing out advice or death-beddy bon mots while climbing messily to great heights gushing and smearing blood everywhere. Without spoilers, this film had a surfeit of such clichés. I groaned again and again. And again.Colin and Brendan, playing hit men Ken and Ray, shine in a slowly developing relationship that is foisted upon them by their boss. There are some funny bits. One gets invested in the characters. A few twists and turns to the plot follow. Not all successful.Ralph Fiennes, for once, is a little over the top as the head of the hit organization. He was Ralph visibly acting.Brendan was brilliant and deserves an award for his performance. What this man can do with a shrug or an eyebrow is magical.But overall, I was disappointed. 6 out of 10.",6,6,17,8 March 2008
Memento," A movie that places you right in the middle of it....
","I found this an extraordinary film on the level of involvement and frustration that it managed to extract from me.  I started out feeling detached. Then with more and more flashbacks and a feeling of uncertainty in whereabouts in the story I and the protaganist were, it captured me. I developed enormous sympathy for Leonard, a guy who is aware of his short term memory loss and has come to a point where he accepts it.  We are never sure of the other characters in the story, Leonard's notes and tattoos on his body gives us the basic clues as to who is to be trusted and significant data that are important to the script, like a former client of his who had the same condition of memory loss that Leonard has.  There is no easy resolution in this movie, if you like your movies all tied up neatly at the end this is not for you.  Rather, it lingers with you long after the movie is over, like an endless loop.  Leonard never has a resolution to the discombobulated jigsaw puzzle his life has become.  Bravo, all.  8 out of 10.",Null,0,1,5 May 2002
Bloody Sunday," Riveting Docudrama
","This film has the feel of a real documentary.  Odd jerky camera angles and closeups. I found it totally engrossing from beginning to end and had more of an understanding of what happened on that awful Sunday 30 years ago the after effects of which are still being felt in the North of Ireland.  What starts out as a peaceful march under the leadership of the Protestant MP of the area quickly turns into a scene of carnage as the paramilitaries fire on the unarmed marchers who are defenceless against the fusilade of bullets. It is sickening what results from this and the inquiry, which was originally blanketed in lies and conspiracy and whitewashed to protect the guilty has now being reinstigated and hopefully the truth of that dreadful day will emerge. At times I had to remind myself that is was actors on screen, it is powerful acting. Kudos to all on the excellence.  8 out of 10.",8,6,14,26 October 2002
Pirate Radio," A showcase for some great music.
","Anyone looking for a plot or decent script should write their own.I saw this under the title 'Good Morning England' in Paris last night and it reminded me somewhat of 'Across the Universe' another film based on its fabulous sound track.It is a Good Old Boys type of film with women delegated to minor paper thin caricatures of sex-starved sixties rock fans, devoid of motivation or depth. One particular scene is particularly yucky as it involves one of the main characters, an innocent, plotting to secretly rape a woman.The pirate station resembled nothing of what was prevalent on the air waves in my teen years and the boat was far too heavily populated. But it was a great premise for a film and the cast looks as if it is having a ball. Philip Seymour Hoffman, always appearing as if he was one day overdue for a good hosing down, is marvellous, as is Bill Nighy - can any other actor do understated elegance like he can? - in the role of the Radio Station's owner, living, of course, on the ship. None of these characters have any domestic or home lives and we know next to nothing about them. Thin as onion skin characterizations. Emma Thompson is terrific (and uncredited) and barely recognizable in a key role, as is Kenneth Branagh overplaying an overblown heavy.Go for the music only and suspend any expectation of a good story. The ending signals from two miles away but everyone is having such a rollicking good time that it is hard not to laugh and share their glee. Be sure to stay till after the credits have rolled.7 out of 10, the sound track is a must buy.",7,26,48,10 June 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Bittersweet love story
","A great movie set in the sixties that tells the tale of the love that dares not speak its name and joins other movies of this daring calibre, 'Victim' made in the actual sixties comes to mind.Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar gives a performance of a lifetime, understated and agonized. One can't help feeling sympathetic for the tortured soul he becomes, denying himself the happiness he can only find with Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhall.The movie follows the story of the straight lives they create, with wives and children, but always the loss of each other underlines their existence apart, they live for the times they can have their annual fishing holiday together. This is not so much the story of gay love but of love that is denied its full expression, for whatever the reason, and how the subsequent lives led are stunted and incomplete.Beautifully filmed in Alberta and stellar performances from the cast. 8 out of 10.",8,7,10,31 January 2006
Home Alone," An insult both for a child and adult viewer.
","I had never seen this and got the opportunity recently when the child in my life begged to rent it as she had heard wonderful things about it.I expected fluff, a simplistic plot and two hours of enduring the smarmy child actor Macauley Culkin. Not too bad a trade off so that the child would enjoy a movie she wanted to see.Oh dear. Halfway through it I looked at her and said what would you rate this one out of 10? 5, was the response. We are expected to believe that an 8 year old who cannot tie his own shoelaces comes up with incredible booby traps for some burglars who want to rob the house (rigging lines between trees, heating up door knobs to name very few out of many). One with a master's in engineering would not be able to figure out most of them.But the very worst features were these dim-bulb parents who sit in first class while their children go unsupervised in economy on a flight to Paris (9 hours, people!)who cannot fire up a brain cell between them in Paris to get the police, Children's Aid, emergency services (they never have friends and relatives in Hollywoodland)to go to the house and get the child.How hard is it to count your children when you have only three??? The child has not been streetproofed and does not know to call 911 either. And on and on.It is one of the most appalling movies I have ever seen. At the end the child and I agreed, 4 out of 10.The old man (Roberts Blossom) was sweet and Catherine O'Hara, whom I normally admire, is right up there with horror moms of all time.",4,13,39,8 February 2004
Insomnia," Not as good as 'Memento'
","Actually, not close to 'Memento' at all. I liked Al's performance, weary and with a week's worth of luggage underneath each eyeball, but Al, we need to do something with your hair. I found my concentration on Al's hair spoiled the movie for me. For one, it varied in colour a lot, salt and pepper, then more salt, then back to jet black, then teetering to a brownish red. And the hair pieces were another story, moving around his forehead in various degrees of thickness but mostly good matches for his vari-coloured hair. And he is getting a bit long in the tooth to believe the sprinting runs and underwater near-drowning scenes he has. The scenery was stunning. Hilary's performance was great as she slowly starts to understand what is really going on. Martin Donovan did not creep me out for once. The plot was great but suffered from the old cliches of senseless chasing and lots of shooting. It should have been more intellectual in concept but I guess we have to please the masses. And nobody can do weirdly awful like Robin Williams. What a gifted performer both in this and in One Hour Photo. 6 out of 10. Not as good as I expected and I would love to see the Norwegian film on which it is based.",7,0,0,8 June 2003
Juno," A breath of fresh air!
","I am so delighted I went out and saw this film after catching so many - in my opinion - truly awful films this season. My faith is restored.The film follows a tried and true formula but whirls and spins it into something so delightful that one is left awestruck by the confluence of talent that made it all happen. A teenager gets pregnant and has to deal with the pregnancy. She is a bright and witty young woman and is nobody's fool. She marks out her own path for this pregnancy.Juno MacGuff (played by Oscar worthy Ellen Page),is the 16-year-old who gets pregnant following an experimental sexual encounter (initiated by her) with her best friend and high school track star Paulie Bleeker (played by Michael Cera).After flirting with the idea of an abortion, Juno decides on having the baby and giving it up for adoption to a couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) that have advertised in the local Pennysaver free paper. The scene where she breaks the news to her parents Mac MacGuff (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom (Allison Janney) just about brought down the house in the show I attended. Thanks to the brilliance of the script (By Diablo Cody) 'Juno' is a stream of witticisms from beginning to end and the supporting cast are flawless in executing them.I found the underlying themes all coming to a satisfying fruition at the end. Every thread tied beautifully. There are many true emotional moments in the film and you are never quite sure where it is going. I was so glad it wasn't flawed by a hokey Hollywood ending.But it all belongs to Ellen Page in the end. Her brilliance as an actor is confirmed for once and for all. She is in just about every scene and plays Juno as a sharp, sassy, intelligent and decisive young woman. She is quick, smart and competent and everyone knows it. Great musical score also.Highly recommended. 9 out of 10.",9,2,7,3 February 2008
Milk," Brilliant Portrayal by Sean Penn
","And Gus Van Sant is to be commended on his remarkable direction.I'm one who saw the documentary on Harvey Milk several years ago and it has stayed with me. I didn't expect this film to enhance my experience of the documentary, but it did, much to my surprise.Penn's performance is nothing short of stunning. He literally channels Harvey, by gesture and speech but most of all by the ever present smile. Harvey, as portrayed in the original documentary had a boundless joie de vivre and an irrepressible sense of self and a conviction of his own role in making history. Sean nails this.The film uses a series of short and sharp vignettes to tell the story of Harvey's life after his 40th birthday, his attempts to get election three times and his relationships.If there was any fault to find in the film it was in the occasional continuity lapses (one involving a dog that was severe enough to jerk me out of the film) and the sometimes irritating camera angles and muffled sound quality. Another was the dearth of visible homosexual women who were quite prominent in this era of the seventies.But on the whole, I found Harvey's romantic love stories believable and his personal charm captivating.Kudos to Sean Penn particularly and to the supporting cast of Josh Brolin, as the possibly closeted and mentally ill Dan White. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also great but James Franco is a knockout as the one, great, romantic love interest at the root of Harvey's life. 8 out of 10. Sean well deserves his Oscar nomination.",8,1,5,30 January 2009
Hotel Rwanda," Incredible Film
","The action in this film takes place in 1994, when war exploded between two tribes in Rwanda - the Hutus and the Tutsis. This film tells the story of what happened, focussing on Paul Rusesabagina, (played by Don Cheadle) the manager of a four-star hotel in the capital city owned by Belgians (who caused the tribal problems to begin with but that is another story). He and his friend, the UN commander Oliver played by Nick Nolte, assisted over a thousand Tutsi refugees by first of all hiding them in the hotel and then through mounting tension and bloodshed whisking them outside the war area to safety.The film reminded me of Schindler's List and had the same powerful effect. Much like the book on which it was based (I believe)- Romeo Dallaire's 'Shake Hands with the Devil.' The character of Oliver is loosely based on Colonel Dallaire - and a film should be made about him too, he is given short shrift in this movie.It is about the nobility of the human character when faced with incredible acts of evil and horror. Particularly when the world turns its back, as it is still doing on Africa. Some horrors are just too huge (the Holocaust, the Irish famine, Rwanda) to be comprehended. The tsunami is about all we can manage. The rest we know in hindsight, as in this movie and others like it.This nobility of character is never more exemplified than by Don Cheadle in this movie. His acting has to be seen, he just nails the character of Paul, the hotel manager who knows all the tricks of diplomacy, graft and bribery in the book.The depiction of the actual horror in Rwanda is fairly discreet and leaves much to the imagination it is rendered through radio broadcasts and one haunting scene of a road fading into the horizon covered in the hacked bodies of women and children. There were many heroes in Rwanda, the orphanage managers, the nuns, the UN peacekeepers defying orders not to shoot, but we observe it all through the eyes of Paul, his day to day wrestling with the sheer challenge of feeding and hiding over 1000 people in his hotel.The movie ends on an uplifting note, a surprise, much like 'Schindler's List'. It is still with me, which is always the sign of a great movie. Don Cheadle should get the Oscar. He is simply stunning.The one word that strikes me about the Pauls and the Oskars of this world is that they were noble, an old-fashioned word. We cannot apply that word to too many but it is something to which we should all aspire. 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,16 February 2005
Crash," Fabulous!
","This is what cinema is all about, a movie that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go even long after the movie is over. Hats off to Paul Haggis who wrote and directed (and who also did such a marvellous writing job on 'Million Dollar Baby')it and with the help of Don Cheadle, who is one of the stars and producers, raised the funds for it and exercised artistic control all the way. And what a way. The characters are fully realized, multi-dimensional. One feels one knows a character (a white racist cop turns out to have a seriously ill father that he nurtures and cares for so tenderly)and then another dimension is added, the same cop risks his life to rescue a black woman from a blazing car crash. One never knows where the stories are going, down even to the very ending there are more surprises in store. In someone else's hands this could have been a wreck of a movie, the extremely racist dialogue would have been softened and blurred. But not here. I found it breathtaking that so many story lines were crammed into the movie,(and yes, there are some metaphoric levels as well which really work and some truly lovely magical moments) but the characters are engaging and real. A faultless cast who give of their very best, Tony Danza, for example, excels in a very tiny role, but he is only one talent of so many. Everyone shines in this and it is difficult to single any one out. In real life racism is all around us, vocalized often in the safety of homes, more often as a reaction to the unexpected: an accident, an imagined rip-off. This movie dares to go where no movie has gone before. 8 out of 10. Bravo and brava to all.",8,0,4,6 September 2005
The Polar Express," $9.00 wasted
","I bought this one for the child in my life and we watched it together tonight. This one breaks all the boundaries of what a child's movie should be about. I could not find a moral lesson if there was one for it feeds into the materialistic wants of the season which is exactly what Christmas has come to mean to many of us. Believe in your presents, folks, it is all, it is everything. I couldn't find a story anywhere and the beginning has to be one of the creepiest ever. This weird conductor wheedling children on to a train. Right, when every child that is streetproofed would run and scream loudly if such a conductor even beckoned from a distance. The computer animation is extraordinary but wears out quickly as the characters are so downright odd. Huge eyes, dark lips and unemotional and eerily plastic hair. Ugh. Frightening scenes of heads exploding, trains out of control with children screaming in terror, a nazi-like Santa Claus surrounded by mini-Nazis all doing and running frantically, only stopping to sing a Christmas version of 'Hail to the Chief' as he emerges from his hibernation. Singing and dancing out of nowhere with no purpose, a funny old odd fellow sitting with a fire on the roof of the train drinking his sockwater. A travesty. Avoid. 3 out of 10.",3,3,6,27 January 2006
Capote," Incredible film
","I've been a fan of Truman Capote from way back, introduced to him first by 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' and culminating in the groundbreaking work of his non-fiction novel 'In Cold Blood' which had me captivated from the first page to the last. Throughout the years since the publication of that book, 1965, I could be wrong on the date, to 1985 when Truman died of alcoholism, I always enjoyed his guest appearances on all the talk shows. He was quick-witted, caustic and nobody's fool.I've just come from seeing Phillip Seymour Hoffman starring in a movie about a few years in the life of Capote while he was working on 'In Cold Blood' and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that his performance sent chills through me. It is as if Capote has taken over Hoffman's mind and body, more of a channeling than a performance. He lives walks, talks and breathes as if he is Truman Capote. The film is beautifully made, the sepia, almost b & w tones at times, brings us back to the late fifties/early sixties when all the action took place. Bennett Miller, who is still under forty, does an admirable job in directing such marvelous actors as the above-mentioned Hoffman, and also Catherine Keener and Chris Cooper to mention just a few of the outstanding cast.On the surface the story is straightforward wherein Capote writes an article (a preamble to the eventual novel) for the New Yorker magazine about a dreadful multiple homicide in the town of Hokum in Kansas. A whole family is murdered in their beds for a pitiful few dollars by a pair of thugs who hear the farmer has a large stash hidden away.Through his riveting powers of persuasion (in spite of his lisp and his feyness) Capote gains access to just about everybody involved in this homicide, the detective, the friends and finally the perpetrators themselves, who are behind bars.He goes behind the scenes and into the psyches of all involved and puts the story together.Much in the movie is left open for speculation, principally the relationship between Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) and Capote. Harper Lee is the conscience of Capote. She is the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' another fine book and movie and has been lifelong friends with him. She gently calls him to task for his self-centredness but most of the time behaves like a very indulgent older sister.The movie's focus is on the interviews conducted by Capote on Perry Smith, digging ever deeper into Perry's mind and emotions. The peripherals show Capote entertaining, ad wonderful nauseum, cocktail party sycophants and some slices of his relationship with Jack Dunphy. Up to its horrific climax, a series of insinuating, troublesome, ethical questions would not let me go. (1) In view of the cold-blooded nature of the crime how does one feel about capital punishment? (2) Was Capote in love with Smith and vice versa? (3) Is it ethically OK to lie continuously to a murderer on death row to get your story? (4) Should there be a more humane way of dealing with criminals who come from bleak, oppressive and abusive childhoods? And on.Capote, in a memorable quote says at one point that he and Smith were raised in the same house, the only difference was that he went out the front door while Smith went out the back door.Why do some make it on the sunny side of the street while others hide in the alleys coming from the same type of background. Will we ever know?An unforgettable film. This is what movies are all about. Oscar material. Philip: you have to get the Oscar nod for this.10 out of 10. Stunning on every level.",10,4,8,29 October 2005
Lost in Translation," Bill Murray is brilliant in this.
","His performance under Sofia's direction is so incredibly nuanced and understated it is hard to believe that he is acting. The story is well written by Sofia and we feel the connection of the two protagonists as they find themselves alone in the same hotel in Tokyo.  Tokyo is another character in the movie, all bright advertising, buildings as far as the eye can see, a lot of noise and video terminals and endless crowding both of traffic and people. Charlotte and Bob are lost in all senses of the word, lost in their lives, lost in themselves, and get to know each other in the brief intense way of strangers - through short sentences and a lot of glances. What makes it so lovely is that there is no sex and no real resolution.  8 out of 10, a remarkable movie experience.",8,0,0,26 October 2003
Empire of the Sun," Extraordinary performance from Christian Bale
","I had put off watching this until recently, I do not know why, I had not read reviews and for some reason imagined it to be a movie about a young Japanese prince(!!).I was captivated by the performance of Christian Bale as a privileged young boy named Jim Graham, growing up in Shanghai, very far removed from the poverty and despair all around him. When war breaks out, this changes him forever and hence the story.After some harrowing experiences he winds up in a prisoner of war camp where he befriends some interesting characters and quickly adapts to a life of conniving and subterfuge to survive.The transformation of Jim is beautifully captured, Steven Spielberg is a gifted director of child actors and gets a maximum performance always.I was enthralled from beginning to end, young Jim was forever changed by his experiences and this change is portrayed starkly here when he is finally reunited with his parents.8 out of 10 for equally impressive performances from John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson, but Christian Bale's performance deserved an Oscar.",8,119,147,31 May 2004
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl stooped pretty low in this
","And she's the best thing in it too, by a long shot. She was the only reason I watched it, and stopped it and watched it and stopped it, you get the picture, shame there wasn't a picture to see.Ann Hathaway, Penelope Cruz, Paz Vega, were these triplets separated at birth? Totally interchangeable as actresses down to the simplistic dialogue and the pat script of innocent lost in the big bad cities of the world, interchangeable too.Andy, the part that Ann Hathaway 'plays' is supposed to be a recent graduate of journalism school but not once did she give the impression of having mastered the English language. 'Kinda' was a word she used a lot, the rest of her words had less letters.The demand for suspension of disbelief was just too much of a burden for this poor viewer to bear. This was a fashion industry running under Lucifer himself. I have worked for some demanding and/or demeaning and/or overbearing bosses but there is always the big option of leaving.This type of scripting only works in grand opera, broad strokes, stagey gestures, over-reactions but not in a slim little movie like this.Humanity was occasionally injected into the limp, flaccid script but it was too little and too threadbare. No fleshing out of characters whatsoever - they were all cardboard. What an incredible waste of money.Save yours.Avoid.",1,22,41,4 January 2007

Frances McDormand plays the police chief, Marge Gunderson,  and plays her to perfection down to the flat Scandinavian accent sprinkled with 'Ya's'. William H. Macey plays the sleazeball car salesman who is in trouble with GMAC for getting loans on vehicles for which he has no serial numbers. He comes up with the ingenious scheme of having his wife kidnapped for a ransom from his fatherinlaw who is very wealthy and treats his son-in-law as an incompetent. the story takes off from there, twisting and turning in incredible but believable directions, victims dropping like flies. At the core of the movie is pregnant Marge and her painter husband Norm, secure in their domestic bliss.  Marge goes out to solve this multiple homicide fiasco, Norm stays home and paints ducks for a postage stamp competition. Some of the scenes are to be seen to be believed and we are shocked out of complacency at times with some pretty graphic violence, and Marge gets her man in the end and does not hesitate to philosophize in the police car at him.  A 9 out of 10. Do not miss this one. In my personal top 100 best of all time.",9,0,0,10 November 2002
The Aviator," A bowl of oatmeal
","And I'll explain that - it is like every flake of Howard Hughes's life was tossed into a bowl and regurgitated haphazardly. For one, his OCD is shown in extremis through parts of the film (he lives naked, surrounded by tissues and bottles of his own urine) and yet he is able to drag himself together and appear coherently in front of a Senate hearing.Yes, I would buy there were tiny signs of his disorder early in his life, but it was not full blown until the last decade.I didn't like Leonardo in the part, he is too much of a one-note actor to handle the complexity, sexiness, power and drive of the Hughes character. DiCaprio is too slight in every way. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn needed a more tenacious grip on her character, her accent and mannerisms were too inconsistent, but then again she was playing off the anorexic performance of DiCaprio.The time-lines were completely out of whack, one example: Katharine leaving Howard for Spencer? No.Ava Gardiner was seriously miscast as well, if anyone has caught her in one of her incredible film performances you will know what I mean, she is woefully ill-served here.Some of these larger than life heroes need a story that will reflect their magnetism and the reality of their lives and with more care taken to the details that are often anachronistic and irritating in attempts such as these. (Example being the opening mommy hygiene scene which is used to back-story his OCD, please, we're not quite that gullible!!) A shame. Some of the bigger scenes are truly wonderful, the scene within the Cocoanut Grove being one of them, the busy backlots and the CGI scenes of the flights being a few more. Also the music was captivating. And marvellous cinematography. Howard was poorly served here. Perhaps the casting of a George Clooney type might have helped. We needed to see the power and complexity. 7 out of 10 for such a big attempt to diminish such a huge character.",7,2,4,11 December 2006
Bird Box," A Huge Disappointment
","Note to self: Don't pay too much attention to hype. The hype is written by Netflix employees.The Plot:If you look up at the sky you will kill yourself. That's it. That's all.Sandra Bullock manages to have a baby simultaneously in a shelter with another pregnant woman (that always happens, right?) and then heads off up a river to a 'safe' place she hears about with 2 nameless five year olds . All blindfolded and facing rapids and the birds in a shoebox. Sandra wears full make up and screams an awful lot. Everyone around her dies along the way.Blindfolds? To protect from monsters?

Radio," Sweet movie
","Not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart.I read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered. I felt Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike Sean Penn's drooling fool portrayal in 'I am Sam.'The fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming. Sports are taken seriously in small town high school America (and elsewhere, I suspect) and I felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true, at least for me.The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under Radio's loving and open ways. Very well done to all. 7 out of 10.Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!",7,23,35,3 April 2004
Cast Away," A stellar performance
","If Tom Hanks does not get an Oscar for his performance, I will be completely shocked. This film has so much going for it, the cinematography (breathtaking), the silent struggles of Hanks on the island, marking off the days in solitude, his efforts to survive and his deliberations about not wanting to, Tom Hanks conveys so much with expression and gesture and minimal dialogue.  I was completely caught up. The only feeling of letdown was in the ending, it appeared as if the writer did not know where to take it.  The 4 years away must have spiritually transformed and indelibly changed Tom Hanks, but there is no accommodation for this.  This is unfortunate, as an otherwise stunning movie left me feeling ripped off. I gave it 8 out of 10 for the 90% that was incredible.",8,0,0,25 December 2000
Trouble with the Curve," A Major League Letdown
","I can't remember who recommended this film and I didn't read reviews prior to purchase. It was on sale at Amazon and that should have told me something but I relied on the friend who had recommended it and thought it might be a hidden treasure, one to savour.The topics covered in the film were vast and rumbled all the way from a weeping widower some 30 years after at a grave-site singing 'you are my sunshine' to a sudden reveal of an attempted molestation of a small child who was 6 at the time. Said grown-up child (Amy Adams) has no recollection of the molestation but can recite every baseball statistic known to man like an encyclopedia. Alrightee then, a few contrivances there, Mr. Randy Brown. But then we move on to the black and white characters so beloved of Hollywoodland. The evil favoured scout's pick, the handsome peanut seller whom you know is going to feature as a winner. At some point, not too late you hope. Oops, try the last scene.I got extraordinarily tired of all the clichés, too numerous to mention here. Dance scenes, bar scenes, swim scenes.And the hurried ending. Unexplained plot points - returning of stomped-off lover (Justin Timberlake) without any reason, peanut boy now going to be a major baseball player after ONE tryout, clichéd cardboard lawyers and team managers and public firings of staff members. Yeah, that always happens. No one worries about unfair dismissal lawsuits in movies like this.Clint left retirement to do this film, imagining it, I'm sure, to be Million Dollar Baby redux.Erm, no. Sorry Clint. 4 out of 10. Amy gave it her all. Clint rolled out Gran Torino for another viewing of a crotchety curmudgeon. And Justin? He ran the emotional gamut from A-B in fine style.",4,5,7,7 January 2014
Little Miss Sunshine," One of the best of 2006
","This is one little treasure of a movie whose total cost was about the same as the make-up budget for any blockbuster out there. It rings not a false note from start to finish, the cast meshes like they have lived together for years and the road trip busts all the hollywoodizations of all the movie road-trips we have taken.Newcomer Abigail Breslin is amazing in a part where she is on screen most of the time and has to run the full gamut of emotions. Her strong desire to take part in a contest many hundred miles from home drives the plot.If a family could be called 'Dysfunction Junction' this one is it. From Alan Arkin, who plays the role of the heroin junkie grandfather (he insists the time to do drugs is when you're old and not young, as then you need them!)and curses and swears incessantly, to Paul Dano who plays the son - most of the time wordlessly, all the way to Toni Collette who is at the end of her rope as the mother to this barely together family.Greg Kinnear plays the put-upon manic father beautifully (my way or the highway) and Steve Carell is remarkable in a very difficult role as a suicidal professor. Delicious surprising dialogue and you can't ever tell where it is going. Subtle putdowns of the entire beauty contest phenomenon in the states and the contest itself is enough to make you want to throw up, these tiny little girls dressed as hookers.So many laughs and true emotional moments - more than I could count. Finally, in this decade a real family that resonates and a breathtaking ending. Yes!9 out of 10 and I would see it again.",9,1,4,8 September 2006
North by Northwest," An almost perfect thriller
","Non-stop suspense, action and humour.  I gave this a 9 out of 10. Cary is at his best here and should have had an Oscar (hard to believe that that particular year it went to one note Charlton Heston!).  I would have loved to have seen Grace Kelly portray the Kendall role, she would have delivered the ice Eve Marie Saint tried and did not quite succeed in pulling off. All the support bits are great - I recognise so many stock players from this movie.  I have never seen it on the big screen and would love to, the Mount Rushmore sequence, the U.N., the train, the coast, and of course the crop-dusting scenes would look so much better on full screen.  James Mason is great and also Martin Landau in his first role.  Quite daring for 1959 in its implied sexuality - though I understand that one of Eve's lines on the train was dubbed over as being too risque - she apparently says 'I never make love on an empty stomach' and that is dubbed to 'I don't discuss making love....' one for the trivia books. Up there with 'Rear Window' as my favourite Hitchcocks.",9,1,2,28 November 2000
Doctor Zhivago," Another downgrade in the passing of time.
","I saw this again yesterday and was so disappointed. I wondered what had grabbed me before. I remembered Julie Christie luminous in white fur, Omar Sharif's Golden Retriever eyes, the ice palace, the poetry and this powerful unstoppable romance.  This time, I felt it dragging. It just did not hold up to my memory of it at all. Perhaps some movies we are not meant to revisit, their memory is so much more powerful than their now dreary repetition.Warning - ***minor spoilers***The great romance now falls a little flat on a third viewing.  Geraldine Chaplin, the long suffering wife, is too saintly by far. Rod Steiger's change of heart is too slick and makes no sense. and the ending is so laughable, this whole monumental film boils down to a guy with a heart condition running along a street after a woman he thinks is Lara. And then he dies. We only hear a stanza of the supposedly powerful Lara poems.Yes the ice palace is wonderful, an awesome spectacle.  6 out of 10.  A disappointment.",6,6,16,28 December 2003
Silver Linings Playbook," A clichéd, unbelievable and insulting mess.
","A family member adored it and I was prepared to do the same. Oh dear. OK My likes? Jennifer Lawrence. The soundtrack. I've downloaded a few of the pieces played in the film. My dislikes? Let me count. No let me recap:All sense of reality, common sense, mental illness and human behaviour were tossed out the window.Bipolar is curable if an out of control mentally ill man, just released from a state hospital with a restraining order on him meets an equally mentally unstable hot girl - yes, girl, she appears to be twenty years younger than him. The Token Black Man is crazy too and comes and goes at will from the same mental institution despite being under surveillance, tee-hee, sloppy security much? TBM has no purpose in the film other than admire white man's mother's cooking and yuk it up with OCD white dad. And then, whatever job done, TBM disappears from film.There are no trials for the dance competition. Anyone can enter without prior sighting, regardless of who they are or even if they can dance at all. A friendly local cop monitors all the outbursts of Crazy White Man (CWM), dropping by the house, appearing at the movie theatre while completely ignoring the fight at the football game or the harassment of the principal at the schoolDad is a proud undercover bookie, wagering the entire family fortune on juju bets and parlays and no one stops him. Breezy mom never worries at all about the insane behaviours of her son and husband they reprise Archie and Edith Bunker in a number.And the ending, so predictable and clichéd and just cringe-worthy. But hey! Instant cure for bi-polar - meet a hot young chick and learn how to dance.I'm familiar with the mental illnesses portrayed in this film and frankly their depiction is an insult.Silver lining? The only one around here is the vanished silver from my pocket for paying $$ for this pitiful film.",Null,3,6,12 January 2014
No Country for Old Men," Gallons and gallons of blood
","Not to mention bloated dead bodies of dogs and humans and a 'man who wouldn't die'.'No Country for Old Men' has Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh, a monstrous motive-less killer (unless you count the money, but how does he know about it?) He slides in and out of scenes, you are always chilled but like the clichéd train-wreck victims you see reeling on the side of the road, he never engages you, you never speculate on what made him this way, he is simply a nerveless, passionless cypher.Actually the clichés were too many to count in this truly, truly disappointing effort from the Coen brothers. A police officer turns his back on the monster and is promptly dispatched and of course the monster manages to squeeze bloodily out of his own handcuffs. H'mm. The instrument used to kill by Chigurh is some kind of stun gun with an oxygen tank. Surely to God he could get hands on a gun with a silencer and not have to lug this tank around like some deranged Fred Munster? There is so much blood, the only conclusion I could make was that this was the whole point, raise the barf meter with everyone, show acres of gratuitous violence to draw in the desirable adbash demographic and forget any kind of plot. A slasher film for the pseudo-sophisticated.The movie grabs you early and you think, as you survey a field full of fallen felons (they were involved in a drug heist) discovered by an officer played by Josh Brolin, that this movie is going to unwind a great mystery. You settle in for the denouement.Poor you. You are sidetracked by an absolutely meaningless sub-plot involving Woody Harrelson (another grisly ending) and by Tommy Lee Jones who was left without any relevant script and wanders cynically in and out of scenes, delivering tired old witticisms as a sheriff. We can count the ways and days of tired old cynical sheriffs. I was waiting for 'life is just a box of chocolates and Chigurh the hardboiled candy'. It would have improved things.I was baffled as to the narrative. Was there one? Why didn't I get it? Was this movie, in spite of the barrels of blood, too deep for me? I was asking myself these questions long before it was over.Was this movie reaching for pretension or was it truly in the stratum of the intellectual elite? Coin toss answer.For me, it seemed fitting that there was no ending to this. No plot should equal a no ending. The beast didn't die and went on his stumbling way. All the good guys died, apart from aforementioned slow-drawl sheriff, who is now retired.Zero artistic merit, zero plot. I gave it a 1 to bring down the over-rating. I still like Tommy, Josh gave a great perforance but I'm going to be really leery of future Coen efforts.",1,125,217,26 January 2008
The Chorus," La Petite Bon-Bon
","This award winning French film is a frothy little confection. Short on plot (what plot?)or indeed on just about everything else too, it nevertheless took me on a wonderful trip with its music. Gerard Jugnot(and does anybody else out there think he's a dead ringer for Bob Hoskins?)shines as the inspired music teacher, a beautiful performance. There's little to the script or the other characters who are all drawn in the black and white mode so beloved of Hollywood,i.e. the headmaster: bad, the injured old caretaker: a saint. A few throwaway lines about the headmaster's daughters goes nowhere, ***minor spoiler***as does the taking of Papinot (aren't there, like, laws about such things?)from the school.***end of spoiler***. We have seen all of this in other movies, often done better but the music transports as does the cinematography which is highly evocative of the era. So a 7 out of 10 for those.",7,5,8,9 September 2005
The Pianist," Riveting, brilliant and not to be missed.
","I saw this film about 6 weeks ago but neglected to comment due to time constraints. When it was over I turned to my companions and said  'Adrien Brody just has to get an Oscar for this'. His performance has to be one of the best ever captured on film. You are just there with him in his tortured existence hiding from the Nazis. This movie captures all of it -  the claustrophobia of the walled commune, the desolate, terrifying railway stations and the desperate rebellion of the Poles against the Nazis when they held out for so long. Nothing is banging you over the head, it is all laid out so beautifully - the elegant middle class existence before the Nazis, then the harrowing work (if you were lucky), the cruelties, the hell that was Warsaw then. Roman Polanski has made a masterpiece and Adrien Brody is truly gifted and one to be watched. Extraordinary. 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,9 April 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Breathtaking, extraordinary, one of the very best.
","Just saw this and was overwhelmed with all facets: its direction, stars, cinematography, special effects and subtlety. I was reminded of fairytales told to me as a child, complicated fables with characters who were brave and foolhardy but who accomplished great deeds.  Here in a China of indeterminate time, the women are strong and fierce and are trained as warriors, sometimes surreptitiously, in spite of the male dominated society. The story involves a sword, Green Destiny, which has wonderful powers and strength, a la Excalibur. The special effects alone are so well done it is worth seeing for just these.  I watched the director's cut also to see how they had accomplished this, as it is obviously not digitally.  The actors had to take a lot of risks with harnesses and gliding over such enormous distances. I rarely 'feel' the magic of a movie, but this one with its wonderful love stories of equality and understated sensuality has every other movie of the year just about licked.  A 9 out of 10. Bravo to all involved in it.",8,0,0,23 June 2001
Gone Girl," Terrible movie on every level
","I read the book and enjoyed it and was curious about the movie.I found the movie to be so stiff as to appear paralyzed - not helped one iota by the wooden performance of Ben Affleck. As the old saying goes - he ran the gamut of emotions from A-B. I didn't care a whit about him, he was the man we were all told to avoid - unfaithful, whiny and dishonest when we were teenagers. Add a chronically peeved face throughout and you have it.Rosamund Pike did her best and NPH vied up there with BA for the stiffest acting job ever.The script didn't help, the only believable performance was from Boney the cop who rang true.The plot fell apart on far too many levels to account for here. The video cams at Desi's house only ran at convenient times, Amy's blood was not cleaned up at the hospital, etc.Awful. 1/10",1,4,10,5 June 2015
The Lives of Others," Outstandingly great movie
","I wonder why there has been so little written and publicized about this movie. This should be seen in every country and its merits trumpeted from the skies.It starts off slowly and the locale is the former East Germany, inhabited by 16 million people who are being spied upon relentlessly by their secret police. In this very real world of the Berlin Wall, there are many Stasi, 90,000, overseeing the populace, aided and abetted by hundreds of thousands of informants. Many of these snitches were blackmailed or other pressures exerted (threats to children and loved ones) and a few obliged voluntarily.What is truly amazing is that this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial debut, and he maintains a masterful hand throughout and keeps the story and the tension rolling from the first scene of interrogation which is filmed back and forth between a tape educating new Stasi as to interview techniques and to the actual cell itself where it was recorded.The movie circles around three main characters and there is a wider circle of the powerful who pull the puppet strings for a variety of reasons which become clear as the movie unfolds.First is Georg Dreyman, a playwright on the verge of celebrating his 40th birthday. Sebastian Koch, a tall,handsome actor dressed in writerly rumple, shares an apartment with his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and exists within the strictures of the state-sponsored theatre. He is a decent man, and tries to win support for his blacklisted friends.For reasons that become quite clear, Dreyman falls under suspicion and the whole sophisticated Stasi spying system comes into play in the era of 1984. His whole apartment is bugged and every sound is monitored.The man in charge of all this is Captain Gerd Wiesler,(Ulrich Mühe). Ulrich's performance is nothing short of stunning. He starts as an almost robotic presence, dressed in gray, he almost disappears into every scene he's in. But one detects a clear intelligence in his bright eyes, the only part of him that's alive. Captain Wiesler lives in a non-descript arborited apartment, much like himself. He squeezes his food onto a plate from a tube.But the captain starts to awaken slowly as he listens surreptitiously on the state of the art equipment secreted in the attic of Dreyman's building. He starts to fall in love with the couple and then pressure from above is brought to bear on him to dig for the dirt in Dreyman's life.And he is in a dilemma now, as he is drawn further and further into the life of Dreman and his girlfriend.I won't throw spoilers down. Suffice to say is that the story is enthralling right down to the very last frame. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable and the world of East Germany meticulously drawn with the viewer respected enough to find his or her own emotional path through the plot.The ending is truly one of a kind. So right and true that I was left nodding, it was the only one possible.A must see, I will sing the praises of this film to all I know. 10 out of 10 from me. Right up there in my top 50 of all time. I find it so disappointing that these movies don't get wider release AND compete for an Oscar in the best picture of the year and not just for best foreign film. Now there's a heretical thought!",10,341,374,8 March 2007
Across the Universe," All the are senses fully engaged
","in this most extraordinary film. It is hard to single out any of its stars for special praise,as it was basically an ensemble piece with everyone using their own singing voices and spinning new interpretations of the old Beatle classics.Julie Taymor took my breath away with the chances she takes. Here she combines the broadness of opera, the teasing reminiscent feeling of the sixties, the artistic sensibilities of the era and lush sequences that enhance the plot threads and move it forward. It is one of those movies that can have you laughing out loud one minutes and crying the next.And I did found it relevant to today, even though I was exposed to the Beatles very early in their careers prior to their being discovered by 'North America' and I have always been passionate about their music.Indeed some of the scenes amazed me by their sheer genius, the recruitment office, the Vietnam jungle, the psychedelic circus, the ward in the hospital, etc.I won't single out any of the actors for particular praise, suffice to say is that the company was amazing.But I will single out Julie Taymor who goes where no one else ventures and takes such honest to goodness joy in the performances she extracts from her entire cast and crew.Brava! 9 out of 10.",Null,0,1,17 February 2008
Gran Torino," How do I cliché thee? Let me count the ways.
","I'll say this: Clint Eastwood tries very hard in this movie. Unfortunately, he labours under a poorly developed script with tissue paper thin characters.Right from the beginning of the movie - his wife's funeral, when Clint coughed I thought, oh no, surely not that old chestnut in a CE movie, oh please, he's going to die in a hail of bullets at the end of the movie so he won't have to die alone, sick with his lungs leaking.And sure enough.....It's not all bad, I didn't hate it like some reviewers here, but there are lots of buts.I just don't get what some reviewers say about his family. Here was this unbearable old codger criticising everything, even his granddaughter's clothes, and they are expected to love him? Come on! I felt utter sympathy for the sons every time they made an awkward call to the miserable old b. Even on his birthday when they tried to be kind, he throws them out.He is utterly unlikable and a misogynistic racist to boot, hurling epithets left right and centre and banning people from even walking on his lawn.This plot started perhaps with A Christmas Carol, and continues on through countless films. The slow thawing of the stony old heart - but unfortunately never turned towards the people who deserve it. His sad and sorry sons.Time out: I took a few minutes to speculate on what kind of woman would marry such an awful man. AND how she would tolerate his treating her children so poorly.Suffice to say is that Walt spots redemption through the Mhong family next door to him and promptly embraces it, along with the 12 year old family priest and then goes out Dirty Harry style in one of those signalled (from the first frame, cough) blazes.And oh that song from the dead man, written by him and son. How pathetic was that? Clint, you look awful good for your age and your career doesn't need this dreck. Get a good script next time. With emotional depth. Which was sadly lacking here.6 out of 10. Watchable. Once only.",6,5,9,19 December 2009
Meet Joe Black," Four Writers? Four Writers!
","And they couldn't get a script.Where does one begin when describing this extraordinarily inept and overlong (3 Hours!) travesty of a film? First of all let me count the flaws.1) **Spoiler** a man and a woman meet in a coffee shop (with great business of non-continuity with sugar and cream, first irritant, pay for a sober continuity person, movie-makers!)and they flirt and fall in love, Brad Pitt is delicious, anyone would fall in love with him. Then backward glances, never co-inciding as they walk away from each other, kersplash, poor old Brad buys it in a particularly outstanding road-kill by a truck. Bye Brad.(2)Death emerges to confront Anthony Hopkins in the shape of a resurrected Brad, no scars from the dreadful accident. Anthony Hopkins is the father of the woman in the coffee shop. **end of spoiler**(3)From here on in one has to deal with the most awful gaps in the scripts while people breathe and roll eyes. Claire Furlani takes the prize in this contest, anytime she is on screen she's rolling her eyes everywhere, up, down, sideways. Like she has dust in them.(4) Joe Black, Mr Death must have had all 4 writers working on his dialogue because it is extraordinarily inconsistent. Sometimes he's all wise and all knowing, next thing he doesn't know the taste of peanut butter or how to kiss or even make sense with these profound new-agey pronouncements.(5) What on earth does Claire (Susan)see in this shell of a man? he bears no resemblance to any conscious being and the lovemaking scene is so creepy, like Joe is making love to himself.(6)Which leaves us with the rest of the cast. Anthony plays Anthony yet again, he's always enjoyable. Jeff Tambor and Marcia Gay Harden save the whole movie from itself.Miscellaneous: The costs must have been astronomical, helicopters and estates and indoor swimming pools overlooking Manhattan skylines...and on. Great music, but 3 hours of my life were wasted. Now I'll go read the other reviews and see if anyone agrees with me. 3 out of 10 for Jeff and Marcia and the darling looks and suits of Brad.

The Illusionist," Beautiful visuals but fails to deliver..
","This is a very pretty movie and indeed for all intents and purposes it appears to be filmed in a different period. The colours are soft and faded much like going through a very old photo album ( the album of The Empress Elisabeth of Austria comes to mind). And indeed the story is reminiscent of 'Mayerling' and many others of that ilk.Authentic to a Vienna at the turn of the century with the Czech Republic standing in, the camera makes the most of some interesting angles and wondrous art direction. However both the plot and the dialogue fall far, far short of being satisfying.For one the actual dialogue is minimalist and for another highly anachronistic ('OK' used). Accents slip and fall and get up again to morph sideways into an unintentional Colonel Klinkishness that grates. Jessica Biel looks far too modern with botoxed trout-lips. Edward Norton does his best, this kind of role is made for him, but he is inadequately served with the anorexic script.The middle bogs down into tedium, there is no story arc to push it forward ***minor spoiler alert***the heroine has died*** and the illusions enter the realm of spirituality.Paul Giamatti works very hard in his role as the police inspector, tip of the hat to him and to Edward but Rufus Sewell just about chews the scenery out from under anyone who shares a scene with him.Very disappointing and I am completely shocked at the overall rating at IMDb. This theme has been overworked just about to death and it shows. 5 out of 10 for the cinematography amidst the predictability of the story.",5,8,11,25 January 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Leave the Inner Computer at Home
","Nothing computes in this movie, but my overall rating is for the mythical, magical feeling it generates. It is simply gorgeous to look at with little side trips to nowhere to titillate the senses - the man being struck by lightening seven times, the stay in Russia, the battle at sea.I didn't read the reviews, as the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story on which it is based is one of my favourites even though speculation has it that is was originally a story of Zelda's, his troubled wife.I'm glad I didn't, as it is one of those movies which either gets you or doesn't. It got me and most of the crowd that were in the theatre at the Saturday night showing I was at.The premise is weird but is underlaid at the outset with the premise of a backward clock invented by a father who lost his son in WW1, a man trying to make sense of his loss. Wishing to roll back time. So a man is born old but with the sensibilities of a baby.Along the way he is rejected by his father, mothered by a black woman, has a connection with a 10 year old child who later turns into the love of his life as their ages fall into synchronicity.The love story arc is predictable and haunting, scenes of Paris and New Orleans are CGI'd beautifully as is the spectacular dancing of the lead, Cate Blanchett.The two stars, Brad Pitt and Blanchett do an admirable job of portraying the star crossed lovers and the makeup artists will surely get an award for the work it must have taken to both age and youthify the two.Tilda Swinton as an older lover of Benjamin is outstanding, breathtaking in her performance. The story is of course predictable and as some pointed out Forrest Gumpish. But sometimes you just have to suspend the disbelief metre.The not compute thing? ****SPOILER ALERT****(1)Why on earth did he leave when he was 47 when the child was one and the mother was 43? He would have only been 29 when the child was fully raised? (2)Why didn't he know his mother was dead? (3)Why was his sister dropped from the plot and his life? (4)Why did his father look so young when he was meant to be dying at a good old age? (5)Why on earth did the child Daisy become attracted to an old man? (6)Why didn't Daisy have a relationship with her own daughter. ie. the daughter didn't know her mother was a famous dancer in her time? (7)Why did the youthifying of Benjamin seem to accelerate to the point that he looks 19 when his daughter is maybe 12? (8)Wasn't Caroline aware of her mother taking care of the child Benjamin for 5 YEARS? And many more, too long to list. ****END OF SPOILER ALERT****Overall: it engaged me with the story treated as mythical (hummingbird as leif motif)and based on love lost, regained and love lost again. Anyone looking for an exploration of the cult of aging and eternal youth will be sorely disappointed.And:Oscars will be given.8 out of 10",8,2,4,4 January 2009
Rules of Engagement," a 5 star cast with a 3 star script
","So much of this movie was so good and so much of it was cringemaking.  I mean, where do you get off in the Vietnam jungle under fire with a colour co-ordinated funky tied kerchief on your head instead of a regulation helmet ? The photography was splendid, some of the shots from the helicopters were awesome and the entire atmosphere of Kabul and the US embassy under fire was marvellously done. Poor Jackson had to labour with some awful lines, and the whole outcome of the plot and court case was ambiguous to say the least, a lot of plot holes. TL Jones' portrayal of a washed up alcoholic lawyer was excellent, but I was never clear on why some crucial evidence was destroyed and why. It would have felt more satisfying if the verdict had gone the other way than what was portrayed here, more believable, somehow. Friedkin's direction as portrayed in the DVD was dedicated and realistic.However,  I am always baffled when an army/military/marine movie portrays so many friendless, or just one-friend-in-the-whole-wide-world officers. Surely in all their years in service they would have picked up pals in the mess, the bridge club, the bar or the gym. Just solitary men with literally a whole army of companionship not availed of. Odd blokes, those military movie men. 7 out of 10 for the magnificent effort by all the hard working actors and director and raspberries for the script.",7,0,1,9 November 2001
Children of Men," A glint of hope in the dark abyss of the future.
","This film has created much controversy and is in the camp of you either hate it with a passion or love it to bits.Off the bat, I'm in the latter camp. This is a movie for grownups, no standard plot two by fours are issued at the door, no endless explications of the obvious.I've also read the book and would agree with Alfonso Cuarón in his decision to remove a lot of the Christian hype of the book but would disagree with his decision to make this development the infertility of women and not the zero-sperm production of the men of the future. (PD James based the novel in part on this startling new development in the male population in some countries of Europe).This is the bleak and hopeless world in England of 2027. The visuals are stunning and the mind is kept busy trying to process all the signs of a world gone mad with police and their guns and dogs on every corner. The tension is relentless down to the last bleak frame. Old signage and photographs point to the lead up to these forbidding times and omnipresent ads in buses and streets encourages one to to turn in neighbours to internment camps ('homeland security' reverberates a lot throughout) and also offers pills readily accessible to terminate one's own life if one wishes.The themes are many and as I'd pondered the book, I'll also be reflecting on this movie. For instance in a world where life is becoming extinct, life is not valued at all, cages of humans dominate every railroad station, identity cards are demanded at every turn. In one brief moment in the film (and it is the culmination of a long continuous shot which must go right up there as one of the best movie moments of all time)the warring stops for a fraction of time to honour the miracle of a child being born and then everyone continues the killing rampage, the baby forgotten.I loved the insertion of humour into the darkest of circumstances, the alcohol and pot ingested to lighten the load, the caring and sacrifice in the most vicious of times.Outstanding performances by a stellar cast, Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine,Pam Ferris and Claire-Hope Ashitey, who must have worked so hard to convey the realism of a world gone mad. Cinematography superb, down to the tiniest of details and the above mentioned 'long shot'.10 out of 10. Not to everyone's taste obviously, there is no middle ground on this movie.",10,9,17,13 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," No gratuitous sex but eye-averting violence
","Well it is nearly always one or the other isn't it. Mostly I don't care for Clint Eastwood, though he can be terrific - 'Play Misty for Me' being one example that comes to mind, but here he gives a performance that is completely believable, low-key and complex.Here he plays Frankie Dunn, an older boxing coach and manager of a tacky male-only boxing gym. He goes to daily Mass and argues with the parish priest about matters of faith, he learns Gaelic and he keeps an old boxer, his helper (who is the narrator of the movie)living in a small room off the gym floor. Frankie is buttoned down, does not show his emotion but we are given hints that life has been hard on him, relationships have been destroyed and broken.Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank)comes on the scene. She's a thirty-something hillbilly woman from southwest Missouri with a big dream which is nearly impossible to attain, she is too old, too broke and a woman to boot. But she inveigles her way into the gym and practically lives there, training incessantly.I will not spoil the outcome, it works its way into your heart without being melodramatic or over the top Hollywood.Hilary's performance is just as good as it was in 'boys Don't Cry', she seems to immerse herself in these one of a kind roles and you are literally stunned at what she can do with them. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Maggie.Morgan Freeman does a wonderful turn as Dunn's right-hand man, but it is Clint't direction and performance that puts the stamp of overall excellence on this movie. 8 out of 10.",8,3,5,16 February 2005
Garden State," Staggering directorial debut!
","I watched this on the recommendation of a friend and was blown away by the talent exhibited by Zach Braff in his first ever film in which he writes, directs and stars. I was caught by how well he depicted the life of a drugged out depressive, untouching and untouchable. Andrew Largeman, played by Braff, is a lost soul indeed, blamed for the paralysis of his mother years earlier in a freak accident and burdened with an unemotional, distant psychiatrist father, beautifully played by Ian Holm. Natalie Portman plays the love interest Sam, herself a little set back from the world and wrestling with her own demons. How these two connect is the crux of the story but along the way we meet the grave-digging (and robbing) Mark played by Peter Sarsgaard and many more interesting side stories and characters, too many to mention here.If there were any faults to find it would be in the quick recovery Andrew has from the huge amounts of prescribed drugs he ingests (he goes cold turkey from them, it seems) and in the unfortunate tacked on ending. The original ending, which felt better, must not have fared well in tester audiences. We do love our soppy endings. A lovely movie overall. I look forward to more from Meister Braff. 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,14 September 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," One of 2005's best!
","An extraordinary movie, made even better by the brilliant direction of George Clooney and the note perfect casting of David Straithern, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey, Jeff Daniels and Dianne Reeves. By now everyone knows the story of Edward R. Murrow going after Joseph McCarthy in the communist witch-hunting years in the 1950s. Intercut throughout is actual documentary footage of McCarthy. Making the film all the more believable is the wonderful use of black and white cinematography which captures the era (cigarettes just about everywhere, stiff hairdo's and shirts, ties and pin-stripe suits). It takes you right in to the in-your-face courage of Edward R. Murrow and his fearless attack on McCarthy which helped expedite the downfall of the latter. Would that we would have such courage in a major news-caster/reporter today. Faultless performances by all including Langella's depiction of William Paley, waffling on his support of Murrow. A must see. 9 out of 10.",9,4,8,21 January 2006

","This is thoroughly enjoyable. As an aside, I wonder if I can sort out the truths: Here they are: Turing was gay. And a mathematical, scientific genius.And he may not have killed himself.The untruths are legion: Joan Clark was plain and practical and would never have uttered the anachronistic bilge she spews here.Enigma was invented years before in Poland.Turing didn't have control over the Nazi plans of bombing sea lanes, etc. In fact he had no access to maps of such detail. Ever.And much, much more, far too long to list here.But in watching the brilliant Cumberbatch and his numerous sidekicks there is enormous admiration for great acting, excellent direction, good sets, and brilliant atmospheric cinematography.

","There was just so much to like here, a great idea and then the flaws started.  The middle drags so badly I thought is it ever going to pick up steam ? Poor Albert Finney's accent comes and goes with each scene change. Jessica Lange glows.  The love story shines - the scene in the daffodil field is wonderful. Ewan McGregor is awesome as the younger Bloom. The scene in the hospital room is a marvel.  However, the unevenness of the scenes and continuity stalls the story and the ending just whacks you over the head too harshly. I would have been more satisfied if the 'stories' had been left as a question mark, with perhaps only Will seeing the characters at the end. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,25 December 2003

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Choppy, jerking, head-spinning slop
","I wish I could get both my time and my money back. Jim Carrey is charming and hard working in this, hard working because the script certainly doesn't help him - it is paper thin. Parts of it even sound improvised. I got a small taste of chemistry between the two principals who are broadly drawn, very little depth. The attraction of opposites is inferred though not enough. Kate Winslet is a fine actress but here she is woefully miscast as colourful Clementine, the wild child who works at Barnes and Noble in what looks suspiciously like her underwear. No one knows what Joel does for a living, it would have been interesting to find out, he is so tamped down. I rather liked the character of Mary, played by Kristen Dunst, and felt a story around her would have captured my interest more. I guess the point was that chemistry will triumph over and over again even if the memories are dumped. But do we want our memories, no matter how painful, deleted? For aren't our memories all we really have? To shape and strengthen and even change us for the better. What am I doing? Re-working the pitiful script? A good cast wasted. Leave these plot contrivances behind, Charlie Kaufman, and move on to something fresh and new. You're beginning to sound like Little Sir Echo. 5 out of 10.",5,2,6,9 September 2005

He's far too old to be playing an action here but with the wig in place and a bit of plastic surgery on the face he passes for 60.The violence in the movie is unspeakable and we are asked to suspend disbelief over and over again. Even against machine guns and machetes. And Liam, all by his little old self kills 'em all. Every last one. And hangs off buildings to get into hotel rooms that every one else has easy access to.And he tortures readily, being ex-CIA. And drives in and out of impossible situations.Arabs and Albanians are all bad guys. Sex traffickers. Who speak English. As Liam does. To everyone.

Groundhog Day," A must see
","It seems to me to be an impossible task to add anything new to the rave reviews this film has received but I'll try.This was made ten years before 'Lost In Translation' and Bill Murray gets his true first chance to stretch his acting muscles and give us an extraordinary performance as Phil Connors, a careless, arrogant, egotistical weather man.Every year he sets out for Groundhog Day in Puxatawney, Pennsylvania, to catch his namesake coming up and casting a shadow (or not) for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil doesn't even bother to conceal his contempt for all that surrounds him, including his TV audience.Aye, but here's the rub. This year, Phil is destined to repeat this day over and over until he gets it right. Once it dawns on him that he is in an endless spin cycle of the same twenty four hours, he keeps experimenting with it, playing with it, even resorting to killing himself a few times, knowing that he will wake up again the following day and it will be Groundhog Day all over again.Bill brings an incredibly nuanced performance to the transformation of Phil. Andie McDowell (whom I normally despise and put her in the same one-note class as Mary Steenbergen, all hair and non-stop-come-hither eyes) as Rita, his producer who is completely turned off by Phil, plays well against him. But it is not about getting the girl at all.And this is where the movie aims for an incredible target, that of inner transformation for the sake of that transformation alone. In hands other than those of Harold Ramis (who has a small role in the movie also) this lofty ideal could have crashed and burned, but here it is extraordinary to see this egotistical man become of value to himself, tiny step by tiny step.He takes this endless eternity of the same day and starts to learn ice sculpture, piano playing, CPR, among other things. We don't have to see many of his attempts on screen and we are slowly made aware that he has befriended many in the town and is needed every day for aid and comfort and even life saving work.None of the points we observe are two by fours over the head. I would actually use the word 'Profound' about this film. There is much to mull over, how are we all spending our days, could we be of more value to those around us but more importantly to ourselves if we took the time to become aware.Inspiring on all levels, superlative in both its comic and romantic genius, this film is up there in my 100 best of all time. The message lingers. A must see. 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,17 October 2005
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Relentless and exhausting
","An extraordinary film, this brings the times of the Black & Tans and the ensuing civil war in Ireland ('The Troubles') to the screen in a fierce and credible movie.My family, in the past, were very much effected by the Black & Tans and stories were passed down of the atrocities they committed. Many of them were released from jail in England on condition they serve in this brutal force and they gladly availed themselves of the chance at freedom, with very little oversight into how they conducted themselves amongst the downtrodden and impoverished citizens of Ireland during that time. Ken Loach, along with his writer, Paul Laverty, do an admirable job of bringing this complexity to the screen.It also struck me that this was the right time to do it - on a few levels, most notably that Ireland has been, economically, hugely successful, with the past, for the most part now forgotten, and for another in light of the civil war following the invasion and oppression of Iraq. Cruelty begets cruelty.Cillian Murphy is amazing in his role of the young doctor Damien with Padraic Delaney playing his brother. But all the other bit parts excel, I've rarely seen such a cast of terrific and believable actors.The mood of the era is captured beautifully, mainly filmed in the wilds of West Cork and evoking the fragile times of that era when whole families were torn apart when The Treaty was signed - some wanting to continue the fight for full autonomy, others wanting to cease the battle and grab at the chance for peace. This was carefully crafted by all concerned, some of the dialogue would need subtitles, though I had no difficulty, and some of the scenes are gut wrenching in their realism. 8 out of 10.",8,1,7,18 March 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," Shrug
","I was dragged to this by the child in my life and was both entranced and bored.Entranced by the special effects and the animation.Bored by the insulting-even-to-5-year-olds script.At my age, I've seen and heard this awful dialogue since I was 5 in many, many movies, plays and books and it goes like this: Your parents will hate you but go against the old daddy-plan-for-your-life anyway. Even though Daddy could be reported to a child protection agency for telling you 'you are not my son'.Ignore all the bullies and people who condemn you for wanting to be different.If you do all of that, the girl will finally see you are magnificent and forget her own career path so she can cater to yours.All the bullies will make room at the table for you and cheer you on.And best of all Daddy now repents and tells you he loves you.The worst effect of this dreck, to my mind, is that it simplifies life down to a pat little sentence for the children who go to it in droves.Rebel and the whole world will come around to your way of thinking, daddy included.If only it were so.5 out of 10",5,12,38,15 May 2010

","I'm still in shock that Martin Scorsese (who had such a hungry look on his face all through the preambles) got an Oscar for this senseless, blood-filled, curse-filled, demeaning, poorly acted and executed effort. I saw the ratings on IMDb and thought (after I had sat through the painful time it took me to watch this dreadful dumbed down copy of the Japanese original - Internal Affairs) that this is a joke, right? It must be whole truckloads of families of the many involved in this shambles rating the movie on IMDb. Anyone with even a knuckle-dragging IQ couldn't, couldn't, couldn't, admire this effort.

Irish Mafia. Indeed. More like the court jester to Martin's king.And on. I could write pages and pages but what's the point. There was no character development, no bonding of the chief and the mole (a very basic part of the original plot) downright plagiarism in parts. I was constantly confused between the characters played by the ingratiating Leonardo DiCaprio and the smarmy Matt Damon. They look/act/behave/hairdyed the very same. The movie paying public shouldn't have to work so hard at character identification with each scene.A plot and better direction and a modicum of a screenplay would have helped.

Psycho," The delicious hair-raising terror of it all!
","As a teenage movie buff, three films profoundly affected me and this is one of them (the other two for the curious are 'War of the Worlds' which I saw at far too young an age, and 'Witness for the Prosecution' another Hitchcock effort with a completely unexpected gob-smacker of an ending).All three I have watched since, 'War of the Worlds', though still an impressive sci-fi, no longer terrifies me, 'Witness for the Prosecution' I've seen over and over and still put on my top 50 best films of all time and Psycho, well Psycho remains in a class all by itself. I am still gripped by the wonderful confluence of a great plot, marvelously acting, a superlative director and a score that enhances all of the above.No one needs details of the plot from me. Everyone knows the plot. I am a lifelong fan of the great Hitchcock so should mention I have a bias to all things Alfie. This remains one of his best and broke new ground when first released. Like the above-mentioned WFTP and 'The Exorcist', movies now had a new twist; you could not be admitted to the theatre after the movie had started.As one can imagine, this engendered great excitement for the cinema audiences. What would the ending be? What were all the blood and guts warnings all about ? We read stories of fans passing out in the theatres where Psycho was played. We could hardly wait. We could not even imagine in our fevered brains what Hitch had created and was going to wreak amongst us.We were not disappointed. Psycho embodied every horror we had ever let fester at the edges of our imaginations and then some. The shower scene had our hearts and minds freezing over and gripping each other in delicious icy horror. The slashings did not have to be shown, barest glimpses of corpses were revealed. There was nothing graphic on screen. The true terror resided in our imaginations and lingers there still. Many of us lock windows and doors in our own houses when taking a shower; many of us have never taken a shower again.Once in the seventies I saw the set where this was made, the old house on the hill, and the remains of the motel. Perhaps it is all gone now. What a thrill, to see where it all began, to walk in the footsteps of the great Alfred.This is a 10 out of 10 for the breakthrough into a new genre of film-making. Absolutely faultless, unforgettable and imminently re-watchable. In magnificent black and white. Leigh, Perkins and supporting cast flawless. Bravo to all.",10,0,3,29 October 2005
Crazy Heart," Had me at the First Guitar Riff....
","'Crazy Heart' is not to everyone's taste, the whole theme being done so often and so badly in some cases. However, Jeff Bridges is astonishing in it which was confirmed with his best actor Oscar win.Bridges immerses himself in the character of Bad Blake who trashes his once successful country music career by slowly drinking and smoking himself to death. He is barely hanging on at the beginning of the movie when he pulls into the parking lot of a bowling alley, empties his urine bottle and blearily surveys the scene.Bridges engages us at his unattractive best when he meets, Jean, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal a journalist who is embittered by men but in spite of herself gets drawn to the remnants of his charisma as she interviews him.The story is very slender and character driven but made utterly believable by the brilliant cast.I've always been a fan of Bridges, Gyllenhaal not so much. Her reliance on cute tics seem to be the same in all the movies I've seen her in. Bridges, on the other hand, brings something fresh to each role and here he doesn't disappoint as he shows us the last stages of alcoholism.There were several plot flaws to my mind. No mother in her right mind would have left her 4 year old son alone with an active alcoholic, twice. But this was needed for a major plot turning point but this viewer felt it was same old same old formula driven.Robert Duvall, who produced, gets his teeth into a bit of filler plot, not too successfully, and enchants himself, but not this viewer, with an a cappella version of a song that was meant to be 'deep' and relevant to the plot. A burp and forgiven by me due to the enormous talent of Bridges who kept me enthralled from beginning to end.Colin Farrell excelled in a role of first fiddle dancing around second fiddle and portraying, sometimes in a totally believable self-consciousness, an unutterable kindness to his mentor, Bridges.I'd see it again. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,18 June 2010
There Will Be Blood," Not as good as I expected
","***Spoilers are minor***I was keyed up for this film that is getting so much press and am a great admirer of Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father) but the whole effort left me dissatisfied and I will attempt to explain why.First of all the best parts: The cinematography was magnificent, vast swathes of barren land with primitive oil derricks being pumped by hand, old trains moving across the parched landscape, hasty tent-towns constructed, etc.I enjoyed the music, although periodically it seemed at odds with the script, which could have been intentional but occasionally, I was drawn away from the film by this. An underused Ciaran Hinds is in a sidekick role, beautifully played.The less than best:The oddly lifeless script and the persona of John Huston channelled by Daniel D-L in the part of Daniel Plainview. Paul Dano, playing the parts of two brothers, overacted to the point of irritation at times.There are no women in any kind of part in this movie and this results in a regrettable off balance. Surely the men had needs?There is virtually no plot but the drama is not character driven either. Daniel is narcissistic and avaricious from the outset and remaines unchanged at the end when he sets up his nemesis, Eli, to deny the existence of God. Earlier Daniel had been set up to get baptized and admit his wrongdoings towards his son. Payback. Shrug.Overall:There are touching scenes between father and son which are negated subsequently. At the end I had to admit to a feeling of total disengagement from the movie I had just seen. It is hard to care for such a completely narcissistic and greedy character as Daniel Plainview. Much will be made of the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, Oscar bells are sounding already, and while I found myself admiring his consummate skill as an actor, I was disenchanted with the material he was working with. 6 out of 10.",6,7,15,19 January 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Not as good as I expected for one reason.
","Forrest Whittaker is superb, absolutely incredible, in the role of the title, Idi Amin, absolute ruler of Uganda. The script is so-so. The appalling massacres and brutal reign of Idi Amin are downplayed. ( I know some of the survivors and their stories just hurt your heart).He was a dreadful, evil dictator and there is very little justice in the world when he was never made accountable for his horrendous crimes against humanity.The scenes of Africa and the affinity Idi felt for Scotland are beautifully (and humorously) captured.The area I had difficulty with was in the character of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, played by James McAvoy,who has the lead for all intents and purposes, as we perceive Idi Amin through his eyes. Yes, he is cute and slightly eccentric, but I felt absolutely no emotional engagement with him and that, for me was the fatal flaw. Yes, he is swept away into the moneyed world of Amin but there is no character development to make you care one way or the other.Even at the ending, which I won't reveal, I was left shrugging.

Stranger Than Fiction," Once again, inside this film was a truly great film
","What a disappointment! I was truly looking forward to this and prepared to absolutely love it. Ouch.A great cast assembled by a talented director, unusual location for its topic (Chicago) good music, innovative graphics, what could go wrong? Let me count the ways. There was stupendous potential in the whole premise. It could have been brought into a totally surreal level between writer's block and perhaps a diabolical controlling influence of the protagonist, along with an older female author falling in love perhaps with her younger hero. None of this transpired. Instead we get everybody just about woefully miscast. Linda Hunt wasted. Dustin Hoffman completely miscast as a literature professor and part-time life guard for the faculty (huh?). An unrecognizabe Tom Hulce in a tiny bit part, Queen Latifah as set decoration as her role made no sense whatsoever and should have wound up on the cutting room floor.How many times can one watch Will Ferrell brushing his teeth and tying his tie? Yeah, he's a compulsive counter, we get that from the on-screen graphics. But the knuckle-dragging audience needs at least eight planks on the head to alert them to this. And Maggie Gylenhall as an anarchist who mentions insignificant political matters but doesn't mention the Iraq war and she drops out of Harvard to get her arm covered in tattoos? Doesn't every decent anarchist worthy of the name?Cardboard thin characters in a transparent plot. No tension, no chemistry, no plot. I kept imagining what it could have been in the right hands and right cast and with a decent script that hasn't been done a thousand times, and better, before.

The Reader," Good Interpretation of the Book.
","And that must have been a challenge, as a narrator, who weaves the story, must have a different rendering on screen.The story is compelling, and takes place in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Stephen Daldry brings his fine directing skills to this complex story of human morality and frailty and its far reaching effects. Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, 'The Reader,' is the source and he had input into this screen treatment.David Kross, a newcomer, gives a wonderful performance as Michael when he gets involved with Hanna, played by Kate Winslet, after falling ill on the street. She offers him assistance. Their illicit affair blossoms when he gets well and goes to thank her for her help.Part of their connection is Michael's reading to her from an assortment of books that he brings.My only problem with this screen interpretation is the gratuitous sex between an underage male (legally a child) and his older lover (Hanna is in her mid thirties). There is far too much sex shown and not enough reading. I believe if this had been an older man shown with a fifteen year old girl there would have been more of a protest. Here their scenes are graphic and bordering on prurient.The awakening of Hanna takes place with the reading of these books and not so much the sexuality so I feel the emphasis was incorrect. Be that as it may, Michael is heartbroken when Hanna disappears. Years later, while he studies law, he goes to a trial and finds that an older Hanna is being tried for war crimes.This was a complex book and is a complex film which gives no simple answers. We cannot judge Hanna for there is a Hanna within all of us. Her empty lonely life was enriched with her exposure to literature for the first time. We understand her. We don't condone what she did as a guard but we can sympathize.Ralph Fiennes plays the grown-up Michael but with far less nuance than David Kross. I found it more than a little jolting when he appeared on screen. Ralph does pained very well indeed but his performance lacked spectrum and the emotional depth that Kross had.8 out of 10.

The Good Shepherd," Falls far short of a masterpiece
","Even though I'm pretty sure Robert De Niro thought he was making one. I have tremendous trouble with inconsistent characterizations and this movie is riddled with them.For one, the lead, Edward Wilson, played by one note Matt Damon (has anyone every given any thought to putting him in a movie with another one-noter like Helen Hunt - that would be a blast!)is a sensitive child who witnesses a horrific scene but goes on to star - as a woman, and well -in an operetta. That takes guts and a need for the limelight and a certain acting ability. However, this man is inveigled into becoming one of the first secret agents and a founder of the CIA. In total antithesis to the original set up.He is actively pursued by a fiery and beautiful Angelina Jolie, playing Clover - who gets that one shot and you're pregnant thang - whom he gun-shot marries, and then her character goes from fire to a compliant wet squid.Their son, who has that high-pitched voice and sensitivity to style ('you look so lovely, Mummy') that cues from miles away how he's going to turn out but hold hard here, you're wrong again, this chappie joins the Secret Service himself and goes to Africa to fall in love with a woman.Matt Damon, Dorian Grayishly, doesn't age at all through the course of about forty years so one has enormous difficulty placing him in responsible middle or elder age - even though the flashes of timeline on the screen sometimes help, though they go back and forth quite irritatingly, to present to past to past-past and back again. Befuddling.There are many bit parts and Russian and American double agents, Michael Gambon raises the level of the movie quite a few notches all by himself. Even Robert himself appears and well too. But many minor characters, due to underdevelopment, are confusing in the thin threads of plot.There is the mandatory love-that-got-away but what anyone sees in the monochromatic Edward Wilson beats me.The murky underworld of the CIA is fascinating, I believe there are strong homosexual components to it (in real life) but these are never addressed here even though the plot came quite close with the son and then backpedalled like mad.Totally unengaging and overly analytical. It is impossible to care about any of these characters in anything more than a superficial level. A documentary would have been far more entertaining. 6 out of 10.",6,3,4,14 April 2007
The Terminal," Low expectations sunk even lower and....
","let me count the ways.Continuity issues = I lost track, suitcase dropped on up escalator with all kinds of passengers surrounding it arrives at top with no passengers at all, wineglass levels, clothing, hair lines, visible doubles doing stunts, lights and cameras reflected off everything. And ninety eight more such piffles all gifted to the dim-bulb viewer by no less than Steven Spielberg who should crawl away in shame at having directed this travesty of a movie. Right up there on my Worst List of all time. Tom Hanks with an atrocious accent plus the added insult of losing and finding his Russki type English every sentence. But the plot takes all the raspberries. There was a plot. Something like this: non English speaking alien befriends one hundred people in airport who become his family, his fiancée, his employer, his chef and even an old Indian becomes, wait for it, his clown!! But hold hard here: we have the Hollywood bad guy in the shape of a customs officer/security police, whatever, who is evil incarnate and makes the guy's life hell on earth. See there's nothing else to do in a busy airport but persecute one man. All day. Every day. But don't forget the 100 friends and the by now ex-fiancée who bail our little bubble head out. Tom looks exhausted all through it, maybe he realized it could kill his career, hard to tell. Catherine slums around as a flight attendant who only gets home once a month (yeah, right)and reads Napoleon biographies for fun (yeah, right). We should all get our money back twice for having to sit through this appalling mess. The double indemnity clause. And BTW when does a country have the same name as its major city?? And just about every product on the planet was dropped in and promoted in this living hell. I'll stop now, I need to get a life outside this bilge I've just watched. 3 out of 10, for the set design only. Outstanding.",3,4,8,20 January 2006
The Queen," Flawless performances, splendid script
","Helen Mirren gives the performance of a lifetime in this film that depicts the months around the death of Diana 'the people's princess' 9 years ago and focuses mainly on the interaction between herself and the newly elected prime minister, Tony Blair, played almost eerily by Michael Sheen. Indeed the whole cast is flawless.The script is subtle and the cinematography spellbinding. The queen, with her regal waddle and her careening dogs, are captured to such a degree on screen that one is there, in that brief few months of time, as she vacillates as to what to do in the light of her public's adoration for the ex-wife of her son. Her instinct tells her to remove herself and her family to her estate in Scotland where her husband, Prince Philip, played by the reliable James Cromwell as a stiff twit, insists on taking Diana's young sons out for a spot of shooting helpless highland creatures to get their minds of their mother's death.This could all come off as crude caricature in the style of 'Spitting Image' but thanks to the remarkable director, Stephen Frears and a tight script by Peter Morgan, it brings out the humanity in all concerned.Alex Jennings, as Prince Charles, gives a wonderfully understated performance as the lost Crown Prince, distant from his mother, concerned for his motherless boys and adamant of his attendance on Diana in Paris against his mother's wishes. Sylvia Syms is a delightful surprise as a gin-soaked Queen Mother far removed from any compassion.It is made totally clear that the family had no time for Diana either in life or now in death and they want her buried in a hurry by the Spencer family so that they all can get on with their lives.The story of the Queen's about face on her decision is the bones of the film and it is riveting right to the end. A rare 10 out of 10 from me. I would see it again and probably again.",10,1,2,29 October 2006
Step Up," How many versions have I seen of this?
","And everything, just about everything is predictable. I volunteered to watch this, so we could all take a breath between riveting episodes of 'The Wire' and I must admit to having loads of fun with it, much to the annoyance of the child in my life who had given it a whole 6 on her 10 gauge. At the end of the watching, I had given it a 1. So we split the rating here. Some of the dance sequences are fun and skilled. But the awful awful awful script with the characters as thin as tissue paper and the death of one main character was signalled from two miles away. And on.This review said it best:'Non-story' ... Step UpAnother West Side Non-Story, scoring low on the raunch-o-meter. Jenna Dewan is the Wasp dance student at a Fame-style school who gets the hots, or rather the certificate-PG family-friendly tepids, for a tough guy with dancing skills from the wrong side of the tracks, played by Channing Tatum. These supposedly physical young people are evidently content with kissing and contain themselves as chastely as Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. For tweenie sleepovers only. I am long past being a tweenie and my sleepovers rarely involve movies. 2 out of 10 for the dancing. Poor Rachel Griffith taking on a job like this! EWWW!",2,1,2,17 February 2008
Casino Royale," Sometimes it's a good thing to reinvent the wheel.
","And this was fun, fun all the way. Daniel Craig is the sexiest Bond ever, a crystal-clear-blue-eyed, outwardly machismo guy, with an inward vulnerability and abs to die for.Standard Ian Fleming plot updated for 2006 with (surprise!) less of the gizmos and gear than prior Bonders,and more character development of the female lead, Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green.Everything was just about predictable from the get-go, some incredible stunt work on cranes and speedy switching of locations which makes seeing it in a wide screen theatre the best choice. The denouement in Venice is stunning, the collapse of an old building riveting.Craig brings an authenticity to the character not seen before on film, and I have seen quite a few of the prior Bond films albeit as a reluctant partner.The torture scenes are brutal, they would make even the most virile of male viewers whimper, the poker scenes were ho-hum, the baccarat called for in the original books disappears, the villain, played incredibly well by Mads Mikkelsen, is underwritten, not enough back-story to engage the viewer.I'm sure it is the beginning of a long and beautiful series, I'm glad it's attracting the full female audience quotient, I accompanied a 90 year old female who thoroughly enjoyed the afore-mentioned eyeful of Daniel Craig and the spectacular locations shots (Lake Como has never looked more lovely). 7 out of 10.",7,3,4,11 December 2006
Amélie," What is left to say about this glorious joy ride?
","I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.Paris is the backdrop and what a Paris, A Paris of La Boheme and the Merry Widow. Audrey is brilliant in the role of Amelie, projecting a true joie de vivre.The film is full of surprises in both plot and characters. I left the theatre feeling lighter. It is truly one of a kind, eccentric, unusual and uplifting. I will not say more on it as it would spoil the fun.I gave it a 10 out of 10 for something so completely out of the ordinary and so very unhollywood.",10,329,417,15 March 2002
Unbroken," Extraordinarily Flat in the Telling
","The story of Louis Zamperini, an inspiring journey of a delinquent turning into a Olympic contender, then a bombardier is rendered as flat as a pancake in the film Angelina Jolie's 'Unbroken.' The inspiring next 3/4 (the story after the war) is completely omitted, thus leaving us with an impression of male model with perfect hair and barely a beard after 45days without much sustenance on a raft taken in to custody by the Japanese in a POW camp and beaten, oh, every five minutes in film time. There is absolutely no character development, no horrific injuries shown, not much camaraderie between the campers, only the old trope of the evil, pathological POW commander focusing all his attention on the hero taken out for yet one more airing. It seems impossible given the content of the true story, death defying challenges, a conversion to God, etc. could be such a bore. But it was. 4 out of 10 for the cinematography. There's a great movie buried underneath this yet to be made.",4,2,3,25 April 2015
Contact," One of the best SF movies ever made
","And also a homage to the late great Carl Sagan.  I have seen this movie 3 times, the most recent being on DVD (more on that later).  I saw it originally on the big screen and it did not get the publicity it deserved. I then bought a copy of video to savour it again and was not disappointed. This is not a simplistic movie, the visuals are faultless and the clash of politics, religion and science very well done. As is the romance between the Reverend Palmer Joss (Played by Matthew McConaughy)and the atheistic Dr. Ellie Aroway (played by Jodie Foster). This issue of their sincerely held (but opposite) belief systems is never resolved but is left open. Ellie is a true scientist and even though some of the glory is withheld from her by a scheming ex-boss, somehow it all holds true, this sort of political jockeying happens and people do get away with it. The supporting cast is faultless and the special effects are incredible. Now the DVD - 'Special Edition'.  What a disappointment, mainly typewritten notes on a variety of topics, simplistic computer graphics of the sets and no interviews with the stars or even footage of Carl Sagan shown. No outtakes, deleted scenes or director commentary. A complete rip off. Keep your video. 9 out of 10 for the movie, a must-see.",9,20,36,12 July 2003
The Pursuit of Happyness," Artless Americana
","A nicely sanitized version of the real Chris Gardner story and it plays with an odd lifelessness, even though Will Smith, along with his charming little son, gives it his amiable best.The poverty laden underbelly of the U.S., for once, is graphically depicted and that was a plus. But the pursuit of happiness, as promised by Thomas Jefferson ends up, as it always does, in the corporate money-pot.The depiction of the marriage was too thin to have any impact, it was as if the script writers did not know what to do with this end of the plot so the gorgeous and capable Thandie Newton was given short shrift as a miserable little shrew who marches off quickly, sans son, for a better life.There are many shots of the studly, dark-suited Will heading across streets and up hills at a very graceful loping gallop. Many shots of him tucking his son into bed in various depressing hostels and cheap motels. Some touching moments between father and child played quite beautifully.But the whole of it is like a deceptive box of chocolates, all glistening paper and satin bows and inside all you get are these cheap chocolates and not the Belgians you expected.Disappointing. 5 out of 10.",5,1,2,1 May 2007
Goodfellas," One of Scorcese's Masterpieces
","'Goodfellas' is right up there with the best of Martin Scorcese. I recently hauled this out for a re-viewing and I was surprised at how totally up to date it felt. How relevant the plot was, how topical the story.And for a mafia movie of that era, how the women were brought front and centre and given a narrative voice - Karen Hill (played by Lorraine Bracco), the wife of the protagonist, Henry Hill (played by a riveting Ray Liotta) both get to tell their stories.The movie is based on a true story and the cast are awesome. At this later viewing I was particularly interested to see many of 'The Sopranos' cast, here making their debuts in a similar crime-family drama.The movie is astounding in that it brings complexity, a riveting script, brilliant relevant music (with actual stars performing their hits) and mind boggling tracking shots, the most difficult of all movie sequencing. Scorcese, or his ensemble, do not flinch from the complexity of this and afterwards, one wonders at how many takes were involved.We are drawn into the intimate life of a crime family, the gradual desensitizing to the horror of the life, driven by material greed at any cost, including the callous snuffing of lives.The large ensemble cast (both known and unknown and including both of Scorcese's parents in brilliant sidebits), the cinematography, editing and dialogue are all masterful.De Niro is at his charming best,Joe Pesci captivates as a psychotic, insecure 'made' man Lorraine Bracco is masterful in a fully developed role, Ray Liotta is marvellous in the way he depicts the reality of the hoodlum life, the juxta-positioning of sauce making against the back drop of victim burials. Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas and Kevin Corrigan all add to the over all engrossing engagement of the film.8 out of 10. Not to be missed.",8,4,8,17 February 2008
Cinderella Man," A Typical Holltywood Treatment
","Why the black and white bad guys and good guys. Very typical of the director Ron Howard, brought up in Hollywood himself so understandable.This story has been told so many times (I coulda been a contedah!) and this is one of the worst efforts.I do like Russell Crowe and here he's left with very little to work with apart from the reader's digest version of emotions - depressed, angry or cheerful. In that order over and over again.Renee, with her lovely old face, squeaks her way through. It's just me but I find her voice grating, like a 4 year old with laryngitis.A good guy without any flaws can be incredibly boring and a decent man (Max) portrayed as such a clown must be very hurtful for his family.I like the Toronto locations and I did like the documentary footage which was a plus on the DVD.5 out of 10. Forgettable.",5,1,4,4 October 2015
The Soloist," Too bad!
","I was totally enthralled with the book of the same name, culled from the columns of Steve Lopez of the Los Angeles Times. I was surprised when the making of the movie was announced, I wondered how on earth this would translate to a watchable and engaging film.Well I found out. I thought Peter Wright might better his work in 'Atonement' and give us a serious interpretation of the book.Some key elements of the book went missing along the way. Steve is on his second marriage for one and the loving parent of a small daughter. The fact that Steve brings Nathaniel home to meet his wife and daughter were hugely significant to me, to see this man of the streets interact with a child in a private home. A beautiful scene in the book. Absent completely from the screen. Instead we get an ex-marriage of some kind with Catherine Keener playing Catherine Keener, I'm not knocking the performance for she does it extremely well.There is the man in a vacuum role perfected so well by Robert Downey Jr.) and the music is sublime except when in an effort to fill in screen time not occupied by the transported faces of the stars, gets filled with the type of flashing graphics available on any download of RealPlayer.The thing is, I wasn't engaged with most of it, like I was with the book. I did engage with the homeless who portrayed themselves and wonderfully well but the humanitarian intent swallows it whole. 2 X 4s in movies are not a good thing.The flashbacks were oddly placed and irritating. And actually we could have done without them. The friendship is developed slowly, I really admired the way that Steve is transformed more than Nathaniel. Jamie Foxx is adequate in portraying Nathaniel but he left me oddly unaffected unlike his Ray Charles which was so satisfying.I believe the story arc would have been better served with Steve's POV more fully explored (i.e. his marriage was jeopardized by his attachment to Nathaniel).Seamus McGarvey's cinematography was superb. He really does capture the gritty streets, homeless shelters and chaos of LA's underbelly.6 out of 10 for the effort. Save your money. Read the book, forget the film.",6,0,1,19 December 2009
Up in the Air," The Corporate World
","George Clooney gives a great performance (right up there with 'Good Night and Good Luck') as a driven Type A personality corporate type with no personal life. He plays the part of an outsourced downsizer, Ryan Bingham, who is contracted to fire people across the country, 24/7. A timely movie in these economic times.Ryan can't abide the few days a year he spends at home and only feels threatened when a new hot shot employee in his company threatens to knock him from his pedestal of constant travel by creating a technique of firing people on the internet.George has one goal in an otherwise meaningless existence: he wants to achieve a stratospheric level of total airmiles which few others have reached.Natalie, the go-getter new employee played by Anna Kendrick, and Ryan don't go the Hollywood route in their relationship, which is refreshing. Instead they get to lean emotionally on each other outside of the job. A friendship rather than a romance, which I found appealing. And real.Ryan plays a detached Casanova, with random meetings in hotel rooms that are quickly forgotten. His life is thrown out of kilter by the announcement of his baby sister's wedding and a series of silly photos she wishes him to take.Vera Farmiga plays Alex with sublety and confidence, in a great line she says of herself:'just think of me as you with a vagina'. And she is bang on.Nuance and emotion exist side by side in the movie with comedy and heartbreak. I've often thought that George channels Clark Gable, both physically and the wonderful facets of comedy he is able to portray. the roles he chooses are a challenge as George doesn't often get the girl. His roles are more complex than that as he plumbs ever deeper into roles that on the surface can appear light.This is a movie I would like to see again as there are many threads and many little stories along the way leading to George's denouement which I won't spoil here. Suffice to say is that the normal 2X4s are missing. The whole drama is understated rather than overstated and ultimately very satisfying.The real life people faced with job loss portrayed in the film are heartbreaking. Some wrote their own scripts or reiterated their own exit dramas from real life jobs.Watch till the last credit rolls as the movie doesn't 'end' when it 'ends'.8 out of 10 from me and yes, I would see it again.",8,1,3,13 February 2010
Atonement," Pretentious Mess
","At the outset I will state that I did not like the novel on which this movie is based. It's not that I don't like the work of Ian MacEwan - I loved 'Saturday' - but to my dread, the novel which I thought shallow to begin with was made into an even shallower movie.I wasn't going to bother seeing it at all, but did on the recommendations of many friends who literally raved about it. Particularly the scenes of the war and old London.There was literally no chemistry between the two leads and the direction of 'lunge and thrust' in a key love scene repels rather than engages. I find Keira Knightly affected in the extreme, her pouty lips and chopped off sentences did not engage sympathy. She seemed alienated from everyone.I was in a small mature audience at the screening and there was a lot of laughter at what should have been emotional scenes which again detracted from any investment in the film itself.The story is cliché ridden and I thought, several times, it would have done better in more sensitive hands. I found the direction choppy and frantic. The timeline moves back and forth with no valid reasoning behind it apart from fooling the audience.The war scenes are well done and would have worked better in another movie entirely. I found them ghostly and surreal, particularly the singing, the shooting of the horses, etc.I beg the question: why are so many nominated movies so dismally awful this year? 'Atonement' I found completely overrated, there was literally no sublety (in a movie that begged for it) and the characters were all distant, not one of them got my sympathy. Possibly it might have worked a lot better as a mini-series, the time frame of the film itself was too short to explore the back story of each key character and particularly the key feature of the love between Ce and Robbie. Was it simply lust? The basic story revolved around Briony (Saoirse Ronan) who is that beloved child of British movies, - a precocious, pretentious, self-absorbed writer. She reads a letter sent by the medical student son Robby, (James McAvoy) of the family housekeeper, to Briony's older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). Subsequently she witnesses scenes between them and a scene between a house-guest and a young girl and invents a story that puts the kybosh on the blossoming romance and sends our hero to jail and then off to war.Some of the more mawkish scenes involve his attempts to re-unite with Cecilia. Cecilia, meanwhile, keeps her passion intact by abandoning her family to work as a waitress and waiting patiently for Robby.There it is, I won't spoil the rest. Suffice to say it is a melodrama of a type of movie that were best done in the 1920's but best left alone in the twenty first century.2 out of 10.",2,12,22,1 February 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A courageous unusual film
","The Coen Brothers continue to delight me with their unusual films.  It takes courage to go off the beaten track as they do and take risks.  They did so on all levels with this movie, offbeat casting, soundtrack, script and even choreography. The only irritant was it could not make up its mind what kind of a movie it wanted to be and kept shifting direction and bits of violence, particularly with the character played by Goodman, were needlessly offensive and detracted from the atmosphere. I found them jolting. Maybe that was the intent. Many great turns though....George Clooney as a hair obsessed fop has to be seen to be believed, bravo George, I am beginning to like you. The Coens have stated that this is based on Homer's Odyssey.  Fairly loosely, I would think. This is a semifantasy reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz, even to the three mismatched characters. George's Oz are his wife and 7 daughters.  One of the riveting scenes is of the KKK at a rally. Mesmerizing.  Another is of the 3 sirens at the lake which is haunting. I am a stickler for detail and editing and noticed only 6 daughters at the end of the movie.  Where did the 7th go ?? Nevertheless, I recommend this wonderful spellcaster.
