It," Annabelle
","To be perfectly honest. The whole thing felt like sth between 'Annabelle' and 'Drag me to Hell'. If you like the cheap idea of 2017 Popcorn Horror before going out on a Saturday night then IT is the movie for you. An unfortunate missed opportunity to create a subtle, creepy instant classic. I even prefer the 90's version (although I think it s pretty bad). The new clown: ugh.. IT made its money, so please come up with a more serious remake that is not created for teenagers",2,1,7,21 September 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," one of the worst remakes I have seen
","The remake of the classic 'Murder on the Orient Express' should have never happened. It has no soul, no excitement, no atmosphere and all the actors included should be punished for their horrible performance. 
The only good thing is that Johnny Depp is dead asap.",1,2,4,28 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Waste of time
","I basically just signed up to balance out the generic, positive reviews of this mess. I am a huge fan of the franchise, despite the fact that almost everything past Alien III is not worth mentioning. And believe me, I tried. I watched Alien Covenant almost 5 times, simply because I could not believe that this is a Ridley Scott movie. It lacks originality and character development. It lacks 'new input' and the Aliens look del Toro. The movie flatlines so bad that I can't even be bothered to engage in a more in depth analysis. Just don't waste your time and money on this 'horror'.",1,5,9,8 July 2017
