Minority Report," 30 minutes in excess
","The PKD short story and the film kept only the concept and name in common. There is few in the film from the 'book', but this is not my regret. Steven Spielberg did it again. A quite good film with 30 minutes in excess, have become a mediocre one. All the world around the film make it very credible, the absolutely real ads like the Kellogs, the Nokia screen-phone, the personalized publicity, the watches, the 3D image home projector, the virtual screen manipulation, and so on... (well, except the cars and traffic, that's are quite stupid). Personally I don't like Mr Cruise as actor, but even in this case was not a real bad one (5 over 10). My main dissapointment are the last 30 minutes. Why Spielberg needs to explain everything, why he needs to finish all threads, and specially WHY HE ALWAYS NEED A HAPPY END.",8,0,0,4 October 2002
Pulp Fiction," Excellent film, bad content
","Film is still a must see. The construction, the flashbacks and forwards, the dialogues, the camera position and the music are still one of the best. I'm a business man, I had similar dialogues on my day-to-day business. Not on the same topic, but similar. The way you talk about your travels, people you meet, sex, food, ... The scene when Vincent and Jules wait in front of the door because is too early, I did many times before visiting a customer (sure with different intentions). I always wonder what this 'bad' people talk about, and found same fears and interest like me. My only concern, and that's the reason not to give a higher score is too drug related. Honestly I can handle the violence, but not the drug. Yes, I know it's the same, and probably it's a personal fear, but I found really disgusting the scene where Vincent takes the heroin.",7,0,1,25 June 2002
