The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Dark and gloomy snooze-fest
","All through watching Mockingjay I thought somehow it feeling familiar... and I realised it reminded me a bit of the Harry Potter series and the point where Harry Potter got darker and more grown up. While the Potter franchise successfully transitioned from it's 12- year old demographic, The Hunger Games, did not quite manage so well.Not all is bad. There is some interesting criticism here of media and propaganda, but those are all smack -in-the-face type of observations. The film makes no secret of it. The darkness comes from the topic itself: the film is set in the aftermath of a violent crackdown by the Capitol onto the rebelling districts. It is dystopic, but what is missing is the emotion behind it. Jennifer Lawrence is more Jennifer Lawrence than Katniss, and when she is Katniss...well, Katniss is annoying. The consistent need to push her into doing what she has to do is quite frustrating. Mind you, it is (probably?) a limitation imposed in the Hunger Games books, but that still does not make her any less annoying and infuriating when she'd rather choose Peeta over the future of the whole world.Technically, the Hunger Games have polished up quite nicely. The CGI does not look as dated as it did in the first film, which is good. This film is very grim and dark - the colourful costumes of the Capitol have been replaced by the darkness of the underground shelter and the military uniform. Overall, though, the film sustains the continuation of a mediocre, yet entertaining, franchise. That being said, this one is the least entertaining film so far. The whole 'Part 1' charade is a charade at its best. Not much really happens here, beyond some character 'development' for Katniss (also known as everyone pushing her to get her act together).The first film is still the most engaging and entertaining one - let us hope they will end the series on a better note than Mockingjay Part 1, because otherwise, it will be a snooze.",5,1,4,30 January 2016
The Hunger Games," A thrilling adaptation
","While I am no fan of 'The Hunger Games' books - nor did I really hear about them until the film came out - and I took a whole year to actually get to watch the film, I must admit it is quite good. As a matter of fact, I am quite shocked at how good it is. In my head it was somewhat of a 'Twilight' phenomenon, so I discarded it immediately. However, it was misguided. 'The Hunger Games' has an interesting premise, and a rather well thought out idea. The screenplay is well written and it achieves to keep one fully immersed into the film, and provides necessary thrills throughout the entirety of the film. I was so absorbed and intensely connecting with the characters, I got acid reflux from all the tension. Oh, no, I am not joking. Anyhow, the technicalities of the film need no discussion, really. A film with such a huge budget will make sure to clean up nicely and 'The Hunger Games' is no different. The performances were, surprisingly, quite convincing and were not forced. Jennifer Lawrence is pitch-perfect as the leading lady, and all the supporting cast does a good job. I was especially stricken by the emotional connection with, and performance by the young Amandla Stenberg. It is sad we will not be seeing her in the second instalment of the series, but what can one do.Overall, it was a real pleasure to watch this film. Not only did it deliver unexpected thrills (at least unexpected to me), but it also managed to take the audience into that dystopic world of the future. How dystopic it really is is another question to be asked, especially in light of reality television and its ever-brutal entrance into the real lives of people. Quite often with dubious ethical, moral and taste breaches that leave one baffled.",7,0,4,22 July 2013
Lion," Emotional yet aloof
","Going into an 'Oscar baity' film during the Oscars winter season is always an experiment: is this going to be one that will allow you to fully immerse yourself into the fibre of the story or will you be severely frustrated by all the teary closeups followed by the string score? Lion, for better of for worse, does both. The first half of the film is absolutely splendid. Raw, poignant, emotional. It has it all. A fabulous lead actor in the young Sunny Pawar and a heart-wrenching story to go with him. Things go a bit wonky once the film shifts time and place to Australia. While Dev Patel is splendid here, after Sunny's performance, it is difficult for him to live up to what has been presented. Rooney Mara is excellent, albeit rather tangential (potentially, actually unnecessary as a character). And that is where the problems lie. That strained relationship they have is just not meshing well. It does not progress the story anywhere. There are glimmers of hope in that Australian section, though. The dinner scene when Patel's character has a fit and Nicole Kidman, playing his adoptive mother, has one of the most expressive 30 second performances seen in a long time. Her 'big scene' is also quite good but was too much of a tear-jerker moment for my taste. From the technical side - the cinematography is excellent (again, especially in the first part of the film), and the original score is mesmerising and gives a wholly new dimension to the film. The bottom line is that this film is all well-intentioned, and that is the problem probably with it. It veers on the edge of being fully committed to the story and characters, but then kind of drifts away to be 'a film'. Basically, it is overly obvious and cliché at times. And I bet that the real-life story was not a cliché at all. The film just does not fully realise itself as an excellent one. A good film, definitely. A very good film, surely. But not an excellent one.",7,6,11,3 January 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The beasts are fantastic, but the film lags
","As a Harry Potter fan since the pre-film Harry Potter times, I was clearly extremely excited about the expansion of the magical world that I had come accustomed to explore in the film theatre. The awe-inspiring creativity and ability to project a completely new world onto the screen was what kept on bringing me and millions others back year after year to watch the next instalment of the Harry Potter saga. However, this is a new saga, and, unfortunately, as the reviewer from Entertainment Weekly aptly described, this one seems 'numbingly inconsequential.' Do not get me wrong, this is not a bad film. But it is not a *good* film either. It is just fine. And that is disappointing. I found it hard to get into the story for the first hour or so. It just did not grab my attention, despite of all the action going on. Later on, I did find myself engrossed in the film, but that was not quite enough. The darkness that the HP films went to by the end is well maintained here. The visuals are beautiful. The CGI is amazing and even a notch better than the last couple of Harry Potter films. There is nothing wrong per se. It is just lacking an emotional connection. And that may be because it is compared to Harry Potter and if we are holding the film to that standard, it never will live up to it. It just cannot. The most redeeming factor for me was the feeling that it was very appropriate to have such a bleak view of the U.S. in the wake of Donald Trump's election. While this was overall not quite as exciting nor engaging as I had hoped it would be, it did set a stage with enough unknowns about this new wizarding world of the U.S. that it will probably easily give itself to the other 4 sequels. Maybe they will develop this emotional connection that this first instalment failed to achieve.",6,1,4,11 December 2016
The Great Gatsby," Luhrmann's back in shape!
","Luhrmann has been one of my favourite directors solely relying on his mastery with 'Moulin Rouge'. I enjoyed 'Romeo+Juliet' also, but nowhere near as much as MR, and then Australia was kind of a let down. His visual style, however, has always been consistently amazing and his films are a true feast for the eyes.'The Great Gatsby' continues this trend, and possibly pushes it further. With Luhrmann's trademark great and innovative cinematography, editing, costume design and art direction, Gatsby is technically top-notch. The impressive line up for the soundtrack also adds layers and layers to the film, in a choice similar to 'Moulin Rouge's' soundtrack back in 2001. While some have complained about the over-stimulus visually and the over-the-top costumes and parties depiction in the film, I felt as if it was quite appropriate. It truly showed the lavishness and shallowness of those events, costumes and places, while at the same time allowing for the audience to see the emptiness of Gatsby's life.My only concern was the length of the film, but it is manageable. Almost as long as 'Australia' was, it still managed to feel reasonably lengthy, instead of being a drag. Overall, 'Gatsby' is a well-executed film with lavish sets, amazing costumes, beautiful soundtrack and all other technical aspects. Acting is rather good, too, with DiCaprio having a stand-out performance, while Mulligan and Maguire are rather sidelined in their conventional acting and do not quite push the envelope far enough. Nonetheless, it is a good film and I'd recommend watching it!",8,5,9,22 July 2013
