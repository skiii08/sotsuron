Hereditary," A shocking, disturbing, and genuinely terrifying glimpse into madness and grief
","When the crowd starts hailing a new film as a 'masterpiece of horror,' skeptic heads will turn. I'm a lifelong horror junkie and when I saw the (intentionally misleading) trailer for this movie I knew I had to see it. A24 has made some excellent horror entries in recent years and I expected another unique combination of both real scares and a really good film. I wasn't disappointed.The acting is exceptional. Toni Colette (as Anne Graham) flexes her potential and gives a frightening performance that channels all the anxiety and grief her character experiences. Alex Wolff surpasses expectations, and Gabriel Byrne does a fine job as well. The effect of their great performances is that you are entranced by the horror unfolding within their family - and you yourself are helplessly trapped along for the ride.I don't want to spoil anything and you should see Hereditary as blind as possible. It is truly a film of nightmarish proportions and I found myself nervously giggling like a paranoid child during two or three particular scenes. A large man to my left chuckled a couple of times in the first hour of the film, but was audibly afraid once the terror began to ramp up. At different points I was shocked, horrified, and wrought with anxiety, as director Ari Aster works to build the tension in a dream-like fashion until your nerves are bent to their breaking point.You won't find undeserved jump-scares or cheesy tropes in Hereditary. If you're a fan of psychological horror, supernatural horror, or really just good horror in general, this film will show you what kind of fear 127 minutes of runtime can induce. It is well-paced, craftily shot, and often very subtle in its detailing, and I am sure a re-watch will reveal some thoughtful or scary touches I missed before. And the scenes that are built to shock you will indeed do just that. This is the kind of film that shows you something unbelievably horrifying - and then makes you look at it for just a little too long.",9,18,36,13 June 2018
Aquaman," Progress in the right direction - as long as you're hoping for fun and grandeur
","They've finally done it: DC has embraced the cheese and abandoned their attempts to make superhero movies with both the dark, serious atmosphere of the Dark Knight trilogy and the light comedy of Marvel movies. It didn't work with Batman vs. Superman and it certainly didn't work with Suicide Squad, but they came much closer with Wonder Woman.What we have here is a movie which doesn't try to be grounded and gloomy like before, yet doesn't aim to be clever. Aquaman is proud of its corniness, with all the lame jokes, unexplained phenomena (do none of the underwater folks need gills?), and impressively epic deep sea battles. This last part is where the film soars. I have seen few movies with such a beautiful and grand scale of action that works in spite of its flaws. There are hordes of creative ocean monsters, ancient and colossal predators, Lovecraftian horrors, and jaw-dropping sceneries which make the boring, gray-scale landscape of Justice League almost forgivable.By no means is this a perfect movie. You can expect the usual plot holes and details that don't make much sense. There is little emotional connection due to pacing during dialogue that at times feels choppy and second-handed. The characters are fun and refreshing, but mostly predictable and, except for a couple, one-dimensional. The performances are good but nobody in the cast will be expecting nominations during awards season. I would point to both Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as having the most interesting chemistry simply because of their obviously clashing personalities. Nicole Kidman had some bright scenes with real life in them. Willem Dafoe seemed suppressed in his role. In general, most of the other characters were just 'okay'. One of the main villains (Manta), in all his high-tech glory, is afforded a brief half-assed origin story to make him more relatable.But in spite of this, Aquaman seeks to be FUN, and it does a much better job than any of DCEU's previous endeavors. The change in scenery is even more perplexing than the first half of Wonderwoman. There are so many intricately-designed creatures and characters that I'm shocked the film's budget wasn't significantly higher. Also importantly, Jason Momoa plays a hero who just doesn't really care about behaving like one, which works - at least until a certain very specific turning point in the film. After the first half-hour or so, we are shown scene after scene of gorgeous visuals and battles to rival the most ambitious Marvel projects. It is a comic book movie, after all.There are some not-so-subtle critiques on mankind's treatment of the environment, and though it's a good message, it doesn't strive to go much deeper than 'humans bad, but not all bad'. Don't see Aquaman to have your life changed, but if you want an ultra-fun time at the movies with some significant progress in setting, buy yourself a ticket.6.5/10",7,3,5,4 January 2019
Doctor Strange," Visually impressive, but utterly uninspired. Could have been great
","After seeing this movie, and then seeing the other reviews for it online, I felt the need to write my opinion in order to share why some did not like it and why I feel it could have been far better under different direction.First of all, I generally like Marvel's films. They manage to put out new stories virtually every year and incorporate new characters into their ensemble. They've also mastered the art of masking each film as original and fresh, and for the most part it's just a fun time at the cinema. But the problem is that eventually, while you will always be able to pick new heroes from the massive wealth Marvel has created through comics, the formula, the acting, the uninspired scripts and classic gimmicks will become stagnant and even begin to bore the audience. I wanted to like Doctor Strange, and I, too, was convinced by the trailers that it would be captivating and interesting and thought- provoking. But twenty minutes into the movie and I could already tell how this was probably going to go.The acting was to be expected given the cast they chose, but nothing stood out. Benedict Cumberbatch played a convincing Doctor Strange, but his character was completely static - I felt no indication that he had changed in the slightest by the end of the film (which is what the filmmakers were lazily trying to portray), and I couldn't even figure out why he suddenly wanted to fight the enemy in the first place. The rest of the characters were poorly fleshed out, and I found myself caring little for any of them, a phenomenon that did not occur when I watched 'Iron Man' or 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. The jokes and wise-cracks felt especially childish this time around, and even out of place in the face of sincerely substantial ideas such as alternate dimensions and the fabric of time and space. Additionally, the pace simply felt rushed and awkward, and like I said before, I just couldn't find myself caring for any of the one- dimensional, superficial characters.The plot was formulaic, which is typical and expected of Marvel; hero suddenly has powers, hero is confronted by conflict larger than himself, hero acts selflessly to save the day and the girl, hero returns and the film ends with some good old fashioned comic relief (Wang laughing, in this case). Normally I could enjoy this, but combined with the tepid acting, shallow characters and strange pacing, the whole plot and film just felt... tired. Even with the great visuals (which were truly impressive and to the benefit of the movie), I simply didn't enjoy it. I wanted more, a more interesting script that had at least a couple memorable or provocative lines rather than none, a stronger character arc, a better and more menacing villain (spoilers aside, the final confrontation was COMPLETELY underwhelming and mildly ridiculous), and, all-in-all, a more enticing movie. I really think 'Doctor Strange' could have been a lot better of a film, but I feel like the filmmakers were just flat-out lazy this time around. While I do recognize the cash-cow that is Marvel, I just hope this isn't the beginning of the end for their good movies, movies with at least a little bit of substance. They still plan to cram over a dozen heroes into Infinity War, and if as little heart and care is put into it as was put into this one, it could be a very bad, shallow, exhausted film.3.5/10 for great visuals and a relatively coherent plot.",3,323,513,6 November 2016
Toy Story 4," Jumping the Shark: A Pixar Story
","Batman & Robin. Shrek Forever After. Spy Kids 4. These are a handful of examples where a studio puts their back into a trilogy, and then releases a forgettable, unnecessary, lackluster fourth entry. As it tends to go, most franchises eventually run out of fuel - it's enormously difficult to maintain quality with each successive release given budget restraints, popular demand, and changes in cast/crew. The good news is that as far as fourquels go, Toy Story 4 is far and above the majority. The bad news is that it's just not as good as the first three.The magic of Toy Story is unparalleled, and there's a reason there is a market for it despite the original film being released nearly 25 years ago. Through the first trilogy we follow a band of unique and empathetic toys who deal with themes of loyalty, change, and self-confidence. Even after so many years the original film is such a joy to watch, and the third film wrapped up the characters' story in such a beautiful and satisfying way that it genuinely defied expectations. We got to witness all our favorite toys experience sudden turmoil in their lives and persevere through immense uncertainty; we also laughed, cheered and wept possibly more than either of the first two films. It was nominated for Best Picture for God's sake - that doesn't happen for animated films. It's safe to say Pixar absolutely nailed it.Then the world got word of a follow-up, and expectations ran extremely high. Rightfully so, in my opinion, after such a strong finale nine years prior. We wondered if they would tell a story which takes place during some other time before the events of TS3, or if they would explore new and intriguing themes, or introduce fresh and fun characters. One of the three proved to be true. It's a new story, following soon after the events of the third film, and it is extraordinarily colorful and creative. But the great things about TS4 don't end at the setting; we reunite with an older character who introduces a new lifestyle, the animation is gorgeous, and the comedy, for which Pixar is usually known (though not as much lately), is ubiquitous. I loved the new cast and I enjoyed Woody's relationship with Bo Peep. I even liked the storyline in the antique shop, as obvious as the outcome was. The magic was present. The voice actors were excellent.But as fun as it was, this movie is easily the worst in the series. I mentioned that it achieved only one of the three expectations - fresh and exciting characters. As for new themes, there really weren't any, and we instead retread over old motifs such as a sense of belonging, loyalty to your friends (and your kid), and, yes, consciousness as a toy. People may argue that the new character 'Forky', who was crafted by a toddler, brings up new subject matter regarding existence; but Sid did this in the original Toy Story with his 'Island of Dr. Moreau' creations. The conclusion of Forky's storyline is simply that he is a toy whether he likes it or not and that his purpose is to make a child happy - you know, like in TS2 when Jessie and Bullseye realize they can do the same for Andy. There is nothing really new here.Finally, there is the simple and honest mistake of continuing the story after the events of the previous film. Instead of going a different direction and telling a delineated tale, they follow up with Bonnie, and it just does not have the same emotional impact as before. The shark, as they say, had already been jumped; the giant claw already saved the toys from mortal peril in the fiery trash pit in 2010. This movie feels like a soft, safe return to the familiar world, but with no real stakes, and no real new ideas, and far less of a connection. I liked it, but that's just it - there's not enough love. Whereas people still talk about Toy Story 3 today, I think this will quickly be forgotten. If we see a 5th film, here's to hoping they bring something different, and memorable, to the table.6.5/10",7,0,3,2 July 2019
Insidious," The exact opposite of what I expected; incredibly frightening.
","I have seen a very large amount of horror films such as this one; the whole haunted house setup, the possessed child, et cetera. Having said this, I expected this to be just one more 'Amityville Horror' kind of movie. Yet I heard good words about it and I went to see it with a couple buddies. It got me from the start; the eerie music, the creepy scenes, everything. Yes, it was ultimately a cliché, as many movies similar to this have been done, but in a way, Insidious made a name for itself in being nearly perfect with timing, lighting, the music, the setup, etc. It was original on its own. It was one of those rare horror films where instead of delivering constant cheap scares and suspense buildups that result in merely a cat from behind a door or something like that, it had real, intense moments where you will be squealing and jumping from your seat. Pop-ups come at completely random times, where you are 100% vulnerable and are not expecting it, and boy does it get you good. When the elderly lady is describing the demon to the father and mother in the kitchen scene, and the demon suddenly appears behind the father out of nowhere, snarling, I screamed and so did my friends. Not only random pop-ups, but subtle ones, too, that have you thinking and freaking out at the same time. From start to finish, this film will have you reeling, and a MORE than satisfying ending that will you keep you up for days. Not completely original, but definitely a must-see for horror fans. It's probably the scariest movie I have ever seen.",7,3,7,15 June 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 1-Star reviews? Give me a break.
","I feel compelled to explain why I think SW: The Last Jedi deserves far better than the staggering number of 1-star reviews and why I think it's genuinely a pretty good movie (though not without caveats).Let me go ahead and give my concessions right away, because there is some merit to all the hate on this film.There are some pretty annoying deus ex machinas sprinkled throughout the film (seemingly unfeasible rescues for the sake of the plot). There is absolutely some poorly written dialogue, and if you're older than 13 you will probably cringe at a couple of lines. I don't think the fan service was at all excessive, but the clear merchandising (what purpose did those cute puffin creatures serve?) was too obvious. I did not find the emotional depth to be at the level we the audience probably expected, and finally, I found some of the characters to be not nearly as likable as they were intended.So what made this movie good? Everything else.The storyline, for starters, was new, inventive, and for the most part compelling. I completely disagree with people saying it was difficult to follow, because it simply wasn't; that's something Disney has gotten very good at. There are unpredictable twists throughout the movie and most of them are exciting and bring a fresh feel to the franchise, to the point to where The Last Jedi FEELS different from a classic SW movie. I think this is okay. People saying Luke Skywalker would never behave the way he did; how would you know? More than 30 years have passed since we've last seen him, and the writers had plenty of creative freedom with writing him which I think they used well. I'm not a big fan of Finn personally, but I still liked most of the new cast, and I enjoyed how they incorporated Leia, Chewy, 3PO and R2 (and a surprise visitor in the 3rd act) into the story.Additionally, the visual FX were incredible, but did you expect anything less? The battles were tense and thrilling, the space scenes are lovely to watch (esp. a particular hyperspace jump), and I loved the many, MANY new creatures introduced, with the exception of the useless puffins. My sense of wonder was piqued, and we even get to see a few new worlds. The musical score was beautiful, albeit less memorable than the older John Williams music. The acting was fine; not excellent, but not terrible.Back to the feel of the movie. Compare the 1980s Mad Max movies to 2015's Fury Road. Or, maybe, the 1960-70s Planet of the Apes movies to the 2010 ones. Do they have the same 'feel'? Of course not. Movies change over time, as do their audiences. I don't watch new SW films to feel the way I do when watching the Original Trilogy, I watch for the stories, the characters, the creatures and the awe, and there was more than enough of that to keep me coming back. I think Rian Johnson and the Disney staff that worked on this film had an impossible task: Create a movie that will please all Star Wars fans. I guarantee if this movie was near perfect, plenty of the angry 1-star reviews would still proliferate, because that's what fans with their own vision of the franchise do.So trust me when I say that this movie is worth seeing. Is it perfect? No. We could have done without a lot of the poor dialogue and obnoxious merchandising. I'm sad that this will probably continue into the next film(s). But that being said, SW: TLJ was epic, riveting, beautiful, and fresh, and it's not going to go the way you think.",7,1,2,20 December 2017
Joker," Low-brow message carried by a high-brow performance: Phoenix proves he's one of the greats.
","The people have hoisted this movie high onto a pedestal - and those that haven't have grabbed their pitchforks. This film has arrived during a bewildering time in our country and the world at large, a time when shootings feel more prevalent than ever and months-long protests in Hong Kong have gained international recognition. Given the context, and the importance of the pivotal movement occurring in the new Joker movie's Gotham, some have claimed the film promotes not just protest, but violent protest. I think that's blasphemy. Sometimes, a movie is just a movie. Controversy has been a staple of some dynamic proportion of new films since the dawn of moving pictures, and that doesn't always mean the message is supposed to invoke violence from the masses. Keeping this in mind - and thus watching Todd Phillip's 'Joker' as entertainment and not an invitation to anarchy - I can say honestly that it was an absolute blast.Nobody is surprised that Joaquin Phoenix was up for taking on the role. He's a phenomenal actor with an impressive range; just watch him play Freddie Quell in 2012's 'The Master' and then Theodore in 2013's 'Her' and try to deny his scope of talent. What is surprising is just how enrapturing and satisfying his performance as Arthur Fleck turned out to be. Whatever misgivings you may have about the eruption of violence that occurs around his version of the Joker, Phoenix absolutely elevates this movie, and is impossible (almost to a fault, but not quite) to look away from him. He plays a broken man with a damaged past, and is so completely engrossing, so stunningly bleak, that it makes the film worth watching, and then watching again. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that his arc is a triumph to behold, and I was clinging to every devilish smile, shocking moment, and chilling laugh that flashed across the screen. He's not trying to kick off an uprising for political gain; he just wants to share his bafflement of society's awfulness with the rest of the world.Okay, so the performance was master-class, but was the film a masterpiece? Not in my opinion; the theme of rising discontent with the rich and/or powerful is an old one, and it's beaten with a ham fist at times here. But damn if it isn't difficult to admit that given how gripping and show-stopping the titular character turned out to be. And though he's the best part of the movie by a long-shot, he's not the only great thing that 'Joker' has going for it. The film is interwoven with a harrowing score written by the same composer that worked on 'Arrival', 'Sicario' and 'Chernobyl', and the music manages to pierce the air at all the right moments, heightening the intensity where it is appropriate and pinning suspense for as long as we can stand it. I have no complaints about the rest of the cast because they are all great (and would you guess this is Robert De Niro's highest grossing opening ever?). The movie is indeed dark, at times nihilistic and very often just bleak, but Phoenix screams 'NUTS to that' and revels in the blackness as his tragedy-turned-comedy character transforms into a cackling murderer.The critics have complaints: That Joaquin Phoenix was trying too hard, and that the themes were overt and annoyingly crass. I'd like to point out that acting your heart out isn't always trying too hard, and trying too hard doesn't always make you a great actor anyways. While his performance certainly does not feel effortless, I never once rolled my eyes - I was captivated. As for the heavy-handed 'message', I say please - this is still a comic book movie. I'm not sure what you expected.8.5/10 for the best performance of 2019 in a Cedar Point thrill of a film.",8,0,1,7 October 2019
Arrival," What a beautiful piece of science fiction.
","In an age where sci-fi movies can just as easily be horrendous as they can be wonderful, it can be a gamble going to the theater. I didn't have much expectations going in to see 'Arrival', but I think that was to my benefit last night. What a unique, thoughtful film this was.Essentially, Amy Adams plays knowledgeable university linguist Louise Banks and Jeremy Renner plays her physicist foil. Forest Whitaker plays their skeptical boss and does great in his own right. One day, a dozen colossal alien spacecraft appear at seemingly random locations across the globe, and we tag along the Americans as they attempt to communicate with the visitors, all while also trying to maintain conversation between the other divided nations. I won't spoil anything else - that's sufficient enough information to walk into the film excited.The acting is great, the visuals are great, the tension is towering; I found myself feeling terrified for the humans engaging the aliens and the entire scene where the main cast first enters the 'shell' is one of the greatest uses of suspense I've seen since '10 Cloverfield Lane'. The actors did well to convey their sense of utter wonder and fear and I felt enveloped in mankind's anxiety for first contact. And the SCORE, it was just beautiful... Dvorak composed some gorgeous work and you may also recognize the palindromic music from Shutter Island in the beginning and end sequences.This is an example of what I call an 'efficient' film; nothing goes to waste. Every line of dialogue, every clue, every image serves a purpose and it delivers such an incredible punch towards the finale that you can't help but feel compensated. This really is what makes the film stand out from the rest of science fiction - it's moving creative, and non-gratuitous, and it earns every tear and clap the audience emits. It's so difficult to combine something as significant as a worldwide alien appearance with raw, deserved human emotion and somehow still make sense. I loved all of it, from start to finish (and back again).Go and see 'Arrival'. Have as little expectations as possible, for you might be disappointed if you're hoping for a 'Battle: Los Angeles' or even something reminiscent of 'Contact'. Let yourself be swathed by the movie, drink in what it says about human beings, relationships, time, and language. Congratulations Villeneuve, you've created a masterclass piece of science fiction.9/10.",9,10,23,22 November 2016
