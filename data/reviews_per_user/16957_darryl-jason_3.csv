Hereditary," One Of The Slowest Movies In The History Of Horror
","It took me 2 attempts to sit & watch this film & both times I couldn't keep myself awake. I don't want to call the film 'boring' but it certainly is slow, and for me I felt it was too long of a film which I for one am not really good with. Give me a movie that lasts 1 hour 30 minutes & I'm happy but I just couldn't get into this one at all.After having watched it now I can safely say it's not my sort of film. I've never thought much of Toni Collette as an actress as I haven't really seen many of her films, the only scene that stood out for me was her explosive monologue when the family are sat around the dinner table & she loses it with the son. Other than that I will say to those who have watched it & rated a 10/10, am I missing something ? Is there really something likeable about this film you're seeing that I'm not?Let's just hope a sequel doesn't follow on from this...",1,3,5,14 November 2018
The Lion King," Be Prepared...
","...to be dazzled with mirrored material from the original Disney 1994 classic. After much excitement of wanting to see this movie, I finally watched it the day it hit the cinemas & as soon as the movie started I was blown away by the CGI effect - amazing! The way the film starts (the opening scene of all the animals coming together during 'Circle Of Life') was just exactly the same as the original. Plus the script is the same as well.We all have our disappointments & I'm going to try and concrete what may stand out to you the most as it did me:
Don't expect Scar to look and especially sound any similar to the one of the original movie because he doesn't. Jeremy Irons really nailed his performance and terrified me to hell in 1994 but here we are in 2019 and we're given the voice talent of Chiwetel Ejiofor, who, in my opinion sounds a little wooden, and could have given much more to playing Scar.
Plus his signature song 'Be Prepared' was way much darker in the original. Here it seemed shorter and a lot more plain. Where was the infamous line 'You won't get a sniff without me!!!' They cut it!!!The hyenas were especially more effective & funnier in the original but I guess we can expect that from Whoopi Goldberg because she was incredible in 1994. Such an awesome addition to the original movie. But I guess 2019 is all about featuring voice talents of unknown actors.I also have to agree with another user review who mentioned the very similar look to Adult Nala & Sarabi, yes they looked the same. You couldn't tell them apart.I'm not a fan of Beyonc√© so I can't really say how thrilled I was when I saw she joined the cast of this movie. I'm sure she's a great singer but nothing special in my eyes.The soundtrack could've given a lot more too, a lot of the original hits were there and it's nice to see Elton John back contributing to this but again, the 1994 classic gave a lot more to us than 2019's version.There's a nice little added extras here as well in regards to the script. As much as they've kept to the original, there's a few extra surprises thrown in, especially with Timon & Pumbaa.Mufasa's death - I'm going to try not to spoil anything here but I will say it all seems to happen a lot faster than the original classic. But then I thought the whole movie seemed to be a lot quicker than the original. The suspense wasn't as good. Before I came to the cinema, did I tell myself repeatedly 'I'm going to cry!' Yes. But I did I cry? No! I think I was a little let down with how fast the movie moved, Scar's reactions again were too plain and showed very little emotion in his voice especially when digging those claws into Mufasa before sending him to his death.All in all I will say it's a great movie and you can't argue the fact that the CGI is just mind blowing. It's like watching real life lions in Africa. Really impressive. 110% effort there!Be prepared to be taken back 25 years with very much originality plus a lot more additional creativity.",10,1,14,20 July 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Bad Egg... Straight Down The Garbage Chute!
","It's taken me 13 years to properly sit down & watch this remake. Having not really been a fan of Johnny Depp over the years, I have to say that this film really doesn't suit him. I don't think he was right for the role at all. But then again, who else would be perfect other than the original Gene Wilder. I've given this one a chance now & finally watched it (right now in 2018) & I just can't get over how bizarre Depp plays the role: creepy, wooden, sarcastically annoying to the children in the film. His laugh is horrendous & his head-bopping to the Oompa Loompas songs & dances. It's like he's at a concert & he's enjoying it more than the children. The child actors - I don't recognise one single one & can't say I've seen any of them in anything else. Since this movie was made in 2005 I don't think this film has given them any recognition since we're now in 2018 & you never see or hear of any of them. Whereas the 1971 classic is still there in people's hearts (including mine). The original movie with Gene Wilder still holds conventions around the world where the original actors (Peter Ostrum, Julie Dawn Cole) attend for photo signings but I have to say; just what recognition can one give this 2005 remake. 
The children in this film also show no excitement - no emotion - no laughs or thrills considering they're in a chocolate factory. There's just no engagement & I have to agree with one of the other reviewers on here; watch for the scene when they're in the river boat tearing down at fast speed: the children make no noise of excitement, no screams, no joys. Nothing. I think the most impressive part of the movie is with the squirrels. I'll give this one credit cause it actually quite impressed me the effects of it. & I think it's trying to show you that squirrels can be quite scary (imagine approaching one yourself & it pouncing on you for attack!)Can't say I think much of the Oompa Loompas. Never really thought much of Deep Roy (who plays the duplicated Oompa Loompas). 
I met him once at a convention here in the UK & the guy looked miserable as sin, he looked like he didn't want to be there. Most probably because there was nobody at his table wanting an autograph. I tried to say hello but he just barely said one word back. I'm not gonna say I dislike this movie nor did I enjoy it. I've just got no feeling to want to watch it again. But the original 1971 is always a classic and when it comes to a good egg, I'll be cracking open the dvd to the original anytime!",2,2,3,1 April 2018
