Antz," A kids movie for adults
","'Antz' is, for me, one of the wittiest, most original animated films I've ever seen. It combines a fish-out-of-water tale with an unlikely romance and a political drama, all held together with superb animation and sharp, fast-paced dialogue (riddled with some very well-placed innuendo).Z (Woody Allen) is a neurotic male worker ant who doesn't feel that his career of digging tunnels is a worthwhile way to spend his days. Bala (Sharon Stone) is a rebellious princess who yearns for the spit and grit of the life of Joe Everyant. When the two meet, sparks fly, but after their night of fun transcends into a vicious bar-fight, the princess leaves before she is recognized by the guards. In a desperate attempt to see his prospective lady-love, Z switches jobs with his muscular soldier ant friend, Weaver (Sylvester Stallone). Hilarity ensues, as Z's desperate attempts to romance the proud princess help him unearth the diabolical schemes being concocted by the bloodthirsty General Mandible (Gene Hackman). In the colony's darkest hour, Z might just turn out to be the hero they need.This film is great and fun for all ages. I highly suggest it (don't worry, the adult jokes will go right over the heads of the kids).",10,1,1,3 May 2009
Beauty and the Beast," A Sweet and Beautiful Love Story that Happens to be a Kids Movie
","Beauty and the Beast is arguably one of the best Disney films ever (second only to The Hunchback of Notre Dame), as well as one of the most touching love stories of all time. The relationship between Belle and the Beast is both funny and endearing, the songs are remarkably good, and the animation is beautiful. A lot of the humour is very witty (even though most of it was childish, it can also give the parents a chuckle or two), and, while it is quite violent for a kid's movie, it gives very good messages; the most poignant of which is 'appearances aren't everything'.It's based on a very old story, but it has been altered to become Disney-fied. Belle (French for 'beautiful') is a gorgeous but odd girl who confounds her entire town with her looks and strange ways. Her father is an inventor, ridiculed as well for his seeming madness, though everyone accepts that he's harmless. When Belle's father goes off to enter his wood-chopping invention at the fair, he gets lost and stumbles into a strange castle inhabited by living objects, like clocks, candelabras, feather dusters and teapots. However, his warm welcome at the castle is cut short when a ferocious beast appears and locks him away. When her father doesn't return home (but his horse does), Belle goes off in search of him, only to find the castle herself and to exchange herself for her father. The Beast keeps her prisoner, in hopes that she will fall in love with him and break the spell that has been cast over him and his servants. But between the Beast's temper, Belle's stubbornness, and the constant plotting of muscle-man Gaston, determined to win Belle at any cost, this won't be so easy...As I said before, the relationship between Belle and the Beast is funny and endearing - funny, because at first, they can't stand each other. The Beast appears crude and frightening, and Belle is determined to be as difficult as possible. Once they begin to bond, however, a different kind of comedy emerges - the Beast is hilariously awkward and eager to please (though he isn't really sure how), and Belle is gently guiding him in the ways of human interaction. It's endearing for almost the same reason - essentially, the film turns from a tale of a jailer and captor's unexpected romance, into the story of two outcasts who find both acceptance and love in each other. The music is wonderful (again, as I said before), especially the songs 'Gaston', 'There May be Something There (That Wasn't There Before)' and the eternal classic 'Beauty and the Beast', sung by the teapot character Mrs Potts, voiced by Angela Lansbury. The lyrics are at times funny, at times poetic, at times somewhere in between. The merging of the timeless love story, the conflict and drama, the humour, the songs, the animation, and the classic Disney talking things that shouldn't talk creates a thing of beauty. The story of a pair of oddities who fall for each other; the story of a man who was a monster; the story of a beast who learns to love; the story of the girl who taught him how. Truly a masterpiece.",10,4,5,15 February 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Critics Know Nothing!
","Reading reviews for this movie, I saw that most of the critics found it an awful piece of junk. Like they do EVERY movie! I've learned not to take reviews to heart, for they are almost always bad. There is no in between for these people, only awful movies, or perfect movies. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' was NOT, in any way, a perfect movie, but it was brilliant nonetheless.The story of Anne Boleyn's seduction of King Henry VIII and his famous seceding from the Catholic Church so he could marry her, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' also focuses on a previously unimportant factor in this famed tale - Anne's sister Mary, who was also a mistress of the King. In this movie, you get to see how mercilessly Anne is dangled under the King's nose for a potential mistress. When Anne accidentally leads King Henry into a nearly fatal fall from his horse, she is cast aside as the pawn and her sister Mary takes up the position. Anne seems placid enough about this, until the Boleyn's are summoned to court so that the king can get to know Mary better. Anne secretly elopes with one Henry Percy, and Mary tells her father before it leaks out so that her sister's prospects for marriage aren't ruined by it. Anne, however, doesn't believe that Mary had her best interests at heart, and blames her for her exile to France to wait on the French Queen until her manners have improved. Upon Anne's return, Mary is pregnant with the King's child, and can no longer please him. Anne takes this as an opportunity for revenge, and begins to further seduce their sovereign, whom Mary has come to love.Of course, everyone knows what happens to Anne - she marries the king and is beheaded - for the fame of her story precedes this movie by hundreds of years, but that doesn't at all reduce the pure drama and excitement of the cat-and-mouse theme of seduction Anne chooses for her conquest. I thought that the performances reflected the best of Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman's careers (especially Natalie's at the end - wow!), and that the movie itself was a brilliant retelling of both the novel and the timeless story. The costumes weren't bad either - in these movies, the costumes can either make or break the performances, and in this case, they made them. I also must say that 'The Other Boleyn Girl' brought up an important point - I'd previously despised the person who was King Henry VIII, for his hypocrisy and cruelty towards his wives, but this film opened my eyes to the fact that all of the people at that time were victims, although they were not innocent. Anne and Mary's lives were completely thrown into chaos because of the ambition of their kinsfolk - Henry himself was a victim of all the rich families who were trying to take advantage of him. You can't feel sorry for a lot of them, but you can sympathize with some of them. Critics know nothing! This movie was amazing!",9,1,4,23 June 2008
Hot Fuzz," Gruesome and Gut-Bustingly Funny
","I admit to being a bit skeptical when I first saw this movie - thinking, from watching the trailers, that it would be a corny, overly-violent piece of funny junk. I was (much to my delight) dreadfully mistaken. It was, indeed, overly-violent, but it was truly hilarious and a great movie besides.Starring Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and featuring Jim Broadbent, Hot Fuzz is the story of Nicholas Angel (Pegg), a super-popular, super-talented London cop who, due to the jealousy of his peers, is transfered to the rural small-town of Stanford. The sleepy village, and Angel's new partner, Danny Butterman (Frost), seems to offer little excitement, until a series of suspicious deaths occur. Angel, ever the inquisitive one, suspects murder, but when no one but Danny believes his theories, he begins to delve deeper into the dark secrets of the seemingly dull Stanford. The London veteran soon learns that you don't have to be in a big city to deal with big crime.This movie, full of cop jokes, hilarity, and the most bloody murders you'll ever see in a film, is one of the best cop movies you'll ever see.",10,2,3,22 June 2008
Megamind," It's not HTTYD, but it still kicks butt!
","Dreamworks is notorious for creating a combination of hits and misses - their misses can be anywhere between disappointing (Shrek 3) to just plain forgettable (Monsters vs Aliens), but you'd better believe that their hits hit HARD. Their most recent release, Megamind, coming hot of the heels of the DVD release for How to Train Your Dragon (arguably one of Dreamworks' best), is, despite its poor press, a major HIT in my book.Two aliens are placed in escape pods as infants in order to flee their respective planets, each being devoured by a black hole. One, a well-groomed humanoid with extraordinary powers, crash-lands into the lap of luxury on Earth - the other, a blue, big-headed baby, falls not far away, right into a prison yard. Each a product of their upbringing, the two boys form an intense rivalry in their school (or 'shool') days, as one becomes the egotistical, he-man hero of the classroom, and the other quickly devolves into an outcast. This latter child, fed up with trying to gain acceptance, decides to turn villain on his rival - when the boys become men, they name themselves Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and Megamind (Will Ferrell), and engage in constant battles set in Metro City. One day, when Megamind actually succeeds in killing the famed superhero, he takes control of the city, turning it into a den of chaos. However, without a hero to fight, Megamind feels that he has lost his purpose, and seeks to create a new hero and rival to liven up his life again.This movie works for 3 main reasons - first, the characters. Will Ferrell as Megamind is simply brilliant; flawed but lovable, we pity the guy for all the crap he took that drove him to villainy, we appreciate his intelligence while still laughing at his screw-ups and flamboyant nature. Surprisingly enough, what could've easily just been a purely comic protagonist became a 3-dimensional character, and you actually get to care deeply for him. Brad Pitt's small but memorable role as Metro Man provides great comedy and a snide parody of a certain Man of Steel. And let's not forget Roxanne Ritchi, voiced by Tina Fey - your typical Lois Lane damsel-in-distress. While Roxanne *does* seem to get kidnapped a lot, she never loses her cool... mainly because Megamind simply doesn't threaten her. She's brave, but she still gets scared. She's smart, but she can make stupid mistakes. She's kind and a bit naive without losing that snarky grin. She isn't the *most* rounded heroine out there, but she has her moments, and overall, she's a pretty likable character. Jonah Hill and David Cross are also great, of course, with Hill's character of Hal being oddly 3-dimensional himself, and Cross' being little more than a voice-of-reason for Megamind to play off of.The second thing that keeps Megamind from crashing is the script - it's genuinely funny and heartfelt without seeming pretentious. The comedic moments work because they really are funny. The serious moments work because they have genuine heart - they balance solemn with sweet with sad, all without losing that honest streak that ties them together. When Megamind hurts, you truly feel his pain, and even if it doesn't exactly tug your heart-strings, it definitely serves to further your emotional investment in the movie.And finally, the animation is just awesome. 'Nuff said. I saw it in 2D, but based on what I saw, the 3D showing would be well worth it.Truly one of Dreamworks' hits, Megamind captures just the right combination of crazy humour and lovable characters to create a, dare I say it, MEGA-AWESOME film that kids and adults can both enjoy. 9/10",9,80,90,5 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," FINALLY! Yates gets it!
","Having been a huge Harry Potter fan for the past 10 years (I finished the 2nd book just before the 1st film came out), my relationship with the films has been rather rocky. The first two, I thought, captured the whimsical essence of the first two books. The third managed to make itself the director's own without taking away from the original novel. From 'Goblet of Fire' on, however, the HP films began to go downhill. And once David Yates signed on, I began to lose faith in the art of adaptations.The 5th, 6th, and 7th Harry Potter books are my top 3 favourites in the series (not in that order, mind you), and after the butchered story & characters that made up 'Order of the Phoenix', I wanted to die. Yates had taken the book and made it his own, all right... but not in a good way. He turned 'OotP' into a self-indulgent montage of Harry's angst. He cut all the important back-story and information in 'Half-Blood Prince', and turned it into a romantic comedy with magic. The man simply didn't understand that, in order to make an adaption good, one must first and foremost please the FANS.But, hallelujah, with 'Deathly Hallows', the man finally got it! Capturing the grit and dark tone of the novel without focusing on the angst as he did in Movie 5, Yates' latest film has managed to stay (thankfully) close to the book. Obviously, some things were cut - but considering that most of the novel's first half consists of strategies, flashbacks, and repetitive hiding out, this really isn't an issue. And taking into consideration how much Yates had to throw in last-minute due to their absence in the other films (Mundungus Fletcher, Bill & Fleur's relationship and wedding, additional Horcrux information, etc.), the 2-and-a-half hours they had were put to extremely good use.My beefs were petty, few, and far between. First among them is the already infamous dancing scene between Harry and Hermione. It irritated me at the same time that it entertained me, only because it was pointless and only served to give pathetic hope to a ship that will never sail (seriously, all the directors seem to be Harry/Hermione shippers). My second irritation actually has a name - and that name is Bonnie Wright. Ginny never quite did it for me in the books, but at least she had a personality; Wright plays the snarky spark-plug like so much dead wood. As a result, we care just as much about her (and her relationship with Harry) as we would any random extra. Luckily, she doesn't have that much screen time in Part 1.All technical things aside, when you get right down to it, I'm just relieved. Relieved that David Yates finally gets it - with something as widely-loved as the Harry Potter franchise, one cannot screw around. The director of an adaption has an obligation to the fans of the original work - and Yates has FINALLY acknowledged that obligation in 'Deathly Hallows: Part 1'. If you're a fan of the books, or even if you're not, you'll love it!",10,4,6,21 December 2010
The Shining," Properly Chilling but Disappointingly Cold
","As a huge fan of the original Stephen King novel, I went into Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING with pretty high expectations. After all, this is THE quintessential scary movie, the film hailed as a masterpiece of horror, a brilliant and classic piece of cinematic awesome. And considering how much I loved the novel... ... You can guess where this is going, can't you? Despite the obvious skill of both director and cast (well, most of the cast) THE SHINING falls flat both as a film and as an adaptation, succeeding to disturb the viewer but failing to deliver on any of the pathos or depth of character that was present in the novel. The film, like the book, doesn't outright scare so much as it builds tension to breaking point, forcing the invested viewer to the edge of their seats without them even realizing. However, by electing to ignore the more human aspects of the story, the film forgoes many opportunities, primarily with the characters. Where the novel made you sympathize deeply with the characters (thus making everything that happens to them that much more terrifying), the film almost immediately distances you from them. I could go on for hours about how badly the individual characters were butchered, but let's keep it concise: <ul><li>Novel!Wendy has a great deal of inner strength, is fiercely protective of her son, and though she tries to keep her family together she is not afraid to stand up to Jack when he goes too far. Movie!Wendy does nothing but shriek, cry, and lie back and take much of Jack's (early) verbal abuse with a quiet and terribly pathetic subservience. </li></ul><ul><li>Novel!Danny is a precocious and endearing child; intuitive, kind, strong, and very, VERY brave. Movie!Danny is irritating, dull, mumbles half his lines, and spends a great deal of the movie croaking 'REDRUM!' like a particularly grating parrot. </li></ul><ul><li>Novel!Jack is a sympathetic (though deeply flawed) character who genuinely loves his wife and son and truly wants to fix their all-but broken life. This makes his eventual descent into madness both horrific and tragic. Movie!Jack is cold to his family from the get-go and seems ready to snap the moment he sets foot in the Overlook. </li></ul>Though the film is definitely chilling and enjoyable, it lacks the novel's essential humanity and suffers for it. Kubrick's creepy but emotionless vision of THE SHINING sucks the life and pathos out of a very human horror story.",6,1,5,10 August 2012
Tropic Thunder," Hilarious and (Surprisingly) Thrilling!
","Of course, I was drawn to this movie (as I'm sure many others were) by the big name actors; I'm a fan of both Black and Stiller, and thought that the premise of the movie looked absolutely hilarious. Thank GOD that I was right! Tropic Thunder is incredibly funny, full of jokes, scenes and lines that you can't help but laugh at. The actors do marvelous jobs, especially Stiller and Downey Jr. And, surprisingly, the action scenes were actually quite intense and thrilling, because, after the sudden and unexpected death of the director (Steve Coogan), you really don't know if someone's gonna die, unlike in some movies where you know deep down that everyone will be fine.Although some parts are a bit corny, and others very gory, the movie really pulls it all together for an enjoyable, hilarious, and very very excellent film.10/10!!!",10,1,4,21 September 2008
Twilight," Excellent adaption, So-so movie
","Before I start actually talking about the film, I would just like to say that even though I have read the first book and did enjoy it (despite it's flaws), I am NOT a crazy Twilight fan. I read the book primarily because I was going to go see the film with my English class (of all things) and wanted to have my background info; and let me say, this is probably one of the best book-to-movie adaptions I have ever seen. Not because it's a good *movie*, but because it follows the book to the letter and brings almost everything from the novel onto the screen and into the script.That being said, I found the book to be, while no doubt enjoyable and sweet, written with a mediocre hand and riddled with unfortunate clichés, and original ideas that come across as nothing more than simplistic sketchy plot devices. For a debut, it's undoubtedly passable, but it's really the story and the romance that made it so popular, not the quality. The same goes for the movie.The story, as most people on this Earth now know, is about an awkward teenager, Isabella 'Bella' Swan, who moves from sunny Phoenix, Arizona to the wet, depressing North-West town of Forks, in an effort to give her mom and her boyfriend some space. Although she quickly captures the attention (and hearts) of what seems to be half the male adolescent population of Forks, Bella only has eyes for Edward, the handsome, pale-skinned, and mysterious boy who seems to despise her very presence. However, eventually they begin a friendship that turns into something much, much more squeal-worthy. And therein lies the conflict; Edward cannot allow himself to get too close to the introverted Miss Swan. Why? Bella's pasty Adonis is not only super-strong and super-fast, but super-immortal; he's a vampire, and he 'vants to sauck her bluud'.The movie's dialogue is poor and clichéd, even more so than in the novel - the cast, which I honestly love, did the best they could (for the most part) with a barely acceptable screenplay, but that in itself was enough to bring the film down in my eyes. The same can be said for the awful special effects, which were laughable at best. As several people have already said, in the scene where Edward reveals the reason that he cannot go out in the sunlight (he gets sparkly *rolls eyes*), if I had not already known what was supposed to be happening to him, I wouldn't have noticed the sparkles - and even being prepared, I almost missed the poor effects entirely.However, as I said before, I do love the cast - though not entirely for their performances in this movie, which, while enough to *just* carry the bad dialogue, aren't as good as they could be. Robert Pattinson isn't, to be honest, as attractive as I'd imagined Edward to be (he isn't bad looking, just not good looking ENOUGH), but he has personality, and that, while not revealed through his words or even his actions, comes across nonetheless. He makes Edward way more likable than he is in the book, I think. Kirsten Stewart is wonderful too - I love her and think she is an incredible actress. She manages to create a Bella that you can sympathize with; monotone and introverted, yet still vulnerable, sweet, and in possession of an inner fire that doesn't show itself often, but is obviously there. She and Pattinson have an incredible chemistry - and while the script has nothing but long, lingering looks between them to show that they are falling in love, the romantic/sexual tension they create so naturally manages to take that crappy 'You don't have to say anything for me to know you're perfect' ideology and make it believable.So, all in all, Twilight was an incredible adaption of a mediocre book, sacrificing quality dialogue for lusty glances, turning what could've been a thousand times better into an only passable film that was carried solely by the actors and their chemistry.",6,0,2,22 December 2009
Stardust," You'd Better Believe it's Better than the Book!
","I bought the book Stardust after seeing a trailer for the movie; I had previously glanced over the novel in bookstores but never bought it, however, the trailer was so well-done I thought I'd better read it before the film came out. I was pleased with the plot, but everything else was sadly lacking - it seemed half-finished, almost like an early draft as far as character development goes. And, though it is supposed to be a romantic fairy tale, the primary romance is bordering on non-existent until the last couple of chapters; the climax was HORRIBLY boring and the novel was much too much too short. When I rented the movie I wasn't entirely sure if I'd like it, as films are never as good as the book and the book, for me, was wanting.Oh, joy! The movie rocked!Personally, I think that the actors were all chosen perfectly and that the director did a superb job with the sets and costumes and (most important for me) improving the climactic scenes tenfold. And, even aside from comparisons, the film was, on it's own, brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. The story begins in the English village of Wall, where a wall (no duh) that is guarded 24/7 is the only barrier between our world and the magical world of Stormhold. In the beginning, Dunstan Thorne travels over the wall to go sight-seeing in a magical marketplace, where he meets a mysterious slave-girl who claims to be a princess. They spend a few secluded hours together, and then Dunstan leaves. Nine months later, a baby is left for him at the wall, with a note saying that it is his son, Tristan.18 years later, Tristan is in love with a girl called Victoria, who constantly slights him for Humphrey, a suave and sophisticated bully. But Tristan still persists, until he swears to bring Victoria a fallen star in exchange for her hand in marriage. She consents, and Tristan crosses the wall and finds his prize, only to discover that in Stormhold,stars aren't clumps of rock or gas, but celestial beings - and that he now has to deal with the feisty and beautiful Yvaine, instead of an inanimate object.On top of that, three witches are searching for the star so they can cut out her heart and eat it, to regain their lost youth and beauty, and two princes are involved in a race to the death for the necklace Yvaine carries, for whomever can turn it red again is king of Stormhold. Soon, Tristan and the star are not only running back to Wall, but running for their lives. I suggest reading the book first, only so that you may truly see how it differs - perhaps you will agree with me, perhaps not, but either way, it's a terrific, fun, must-see!",10,3,5,12 September 2008
The Green Mile," Pure Brilliance
","And when I say that, I mean everything about this film is pure brilliance. The acting, the dialog, the direction, EVERYTHING. Surprisingly enough, the film and the novel by Stephen King walk hand-in-hand; it's one of the best book-to-movie creations I have ever seen. Michael Clark-Duncan and Tom Hanks give absolutely AMAZING performances; these are two very talented actors who give a depth and immortality to the characters they portray. It's very important as an actor to make the characters, even ones with bad lines, seem human and believable, and both Hanks and Clark-Duncan managed it effortlessly.The movie is about Paul Edgecombe (Hanks), who works as a prison guard on death row, on a block called the Green Mile by it's inhabitants because of the lime-green colour of the floor. He's seen it all, sexual predators, victims of drink and a bad temper, simple cold-blooded murder, anything you can think of. Which is why he is so unnerved by John Coffey (Clark-Duncan), the simple-minded and monstrously huge man convicted of the rape and murder of two little girls. Coffey is gentle and possesses the mind of a child, and Edgecombe is doubtful that this sweet hulk could possibly be guilty of the crimes he is charged with. And when Coffey demonstrates his miraculous power to cure any illness, even death (if he's quick enough), Paul and the other guards of the Green Mile face a difficult decision; follow orders and execute John Coffey, or do what they can to preserve a miracle? Of course, some scenes are predictable, and some clichés are in there, but hey, it's nearly impossible to do anything anymore without adding something that's been done before. The music and directing is beautiful and emotional. The acting and dialog is capable of inducing a steady flow of tears that won't end till after the credits have rolled. The Green Mile is a truly brilliant film -- I can't see why anybody wouldn't like it! Once more, pure brilliance.",10,0,2,17 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best of the Trilogy!
","I would just like to take a moment to say; I loved all three Lord of the Rings books, and all three Lord of the Rings movies. The Two Towers was actually the best of the books, (which is surprising because I hated the second movie) but when it comes to the movies, Return of the King takes ALL of the cake. We pick up where we left off in The Two Towers (the movie); Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf reunite with Merry and Pippin after the hobbits have defeated Saruman with the help of the ents. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam near the end of their journey, still on their way to the 'short cut' into Mordor, led by the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol. Aragorn & co. split up, with the majority of them staying in Rohan whilst Gandalf and Pippin travel together to Gondor, the kingdom that by right should belong to Aragorn, and also happens to be next on Sauron's hit list. However, Gondor is being run by the Steward, who is the father of Boromir (remember him? the guy from the first one who died?), and he doesn't really feel like trusting Gandalf, *or* handing the kingdom over to Aragorn.Frodo and Sam face problems of their own; the Ring's power is growing and Frodo is suffering the same personality change that got poor Gollum/Smeagol. Speaking of the little bugger, his dual persona's are battling it out; the Smeagol part wants to be good again and help the hobbits, whilst the Gollum part wants to kill them and take the Ring. With this guy leading them, Sam and Frodo really need to watch their backs!Now, I love this movie and everything about it. The effects, the acting, the pure scope and brilliance of the plot meshed with the intricacies of fantasy... it all works. However, there is one. Little. Exception. Mr Frodo Baggins.I absolutely *hate* him! I can't stand him! All he does is wallow in his own misery, he barely fights the Ring's influence at all, and he's always falling over. Oh, gimmie a break, angsty boy! As far as I'm concerned (and, according to my sources, JRR Tolkien felt the same way), Sam is the true hero of the story. He faithfully went along with all Frodo's ideas, he kept him afloat, sacrificed his own food and water to keep Frodo going, because he knew he couldn't take the Ring. He protected him as best he could from that conniving little Gollum/Smeagol. At Mt. Doom, he freaking' CARRIED Frodo up the mountain!!! He rescued him when he was going to let himself fall into the lava! And at the end, he had to deal with the pain of his best friend leaving him forever. A real trooper, a real, brave, selfless Hero. Love the movie! Hate Frodo!",10,0,2,27 February 2009
