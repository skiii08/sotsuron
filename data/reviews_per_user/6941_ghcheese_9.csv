Child 44," More people should watch this
",This is the type of movie people should watch. It is history. History is not always good. But we learn from the good and the bad in our history. This can happen again. A government that hides the truth so they can tell you how good they are. Sound familiar. Now they try to hide the truth by tearing down statues. Blocking speech. Next they will burn the books.,10,1,2,22 April 2019
Fury," Who's Rewriting History
",I could not in good consciousness continue watching this. Hitler was a very bad person. But he did not militarize all woman and children. My mother was a little girl in Germany. I heard many sad stories. Also I come from a family of men who served in our military. These clowns talk like their off the streets of the city. Not in WW2. I am actually shocked to see Brad Pitt in this farce. I spit on my memory of past movie he was in. If you were ever in the military don't watch this. You will not like it. If you think this movie is History as it is billed. Than I feel sad that our public schools didn't give you a proper education. And now your stupid.,1,19,35,22 April 2017
Creed," Michael B. Jordan does Rocky proud
",I'm old time and loved Rocky. I was worried they would screw it up. But Michael B. Jordan is knocking out the movies one at a time. And this was wonderful. Sylvester Stallone found the right person to keep the legacy alive. If your like me and wonder where the good movies have gone I think I just found it. Great Job by all on this one.,10,0,2,25 December 2018
Molly's Game," I Love a Good Story
","I would not put the kids in front of this. They will not understand or care. But if you can follow a good story. A true story. Than this is the movie you want to see. If your looking for car chases and loud parties with women showing their breast, this is not your movie. If you have to have someone explain every detail for you when you watch a movie this is not your movie.",10,2,3,25 May 2019
Man of Steel," Too Much!
","Did you ever make a chili. It is wonderful. Did you ever decide you need to add something to it. Maybe to make it better. Than you added something else. And then you added more. Pretty soon your wonderful Chili wasn't chili any more. What was it. I don't know but it wasn't chili. And it was actually not as good as the simple chili. It took longer to cook. It had everything you could think of. It should have been the best dang chili there was. What went wrong. Too Much! This movie is long. It has a lot of action. It has a lot of Scifi. It has a lot of drama. It has a very complex story. Have you ever seen Christopher Reeves Superman. Simple. Funny, Drama, Scifi, Action, And a story. And it was good. Everyone liked it.",3,1,4,13 May 2017
The Conjuring 2," It said it wants to hurt you
",It is so good that they actually started making scary movies the way they used to be. SCARY! The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 will keep you at the edge of your seat. Or maybe behind it. This is not one of those so called scary movies that things jump out at you for that quick jump. No No in this movie you will see it coming. You will see it and it will scare the pants right off you. No cheap screams here. More like whimpering in the corner hoping for a nice ending. Will you get it? I guess you have to watch it to find out.,10,1,2,30 May 2017
12 Years a Slave," Political Correctness
",History is full of injustice. But if you believe every White person is evil you may like this movie. If you believe that every Black person was treated unfairly you may like this movie. I personally do know that some things in this movie are Historically accurate. I believe this over plays the abuse. And is a movie that was made to Separate people instead of bringing us together. Of course they give Brad Pitt the role of good white person. Although I have my doubts since the day he did not come to his mothers defense when the media took after her. Personally I wouldn't suggest this movie for any one to watch.,2,5,13,2 July 2017
Mother!," You have to have a warped mind
",You have to have a warped mind to come up with something this awful. I wish I could take back seeing this. I get what they were going for. But the person who created this has to be a really sick individual. You must hate everyone around you.,1,5,6,8 December 2019
Creed II," Michael B. Jordon gives a spectacular performance
",If you are like me and loved the Rocky series you can add this one to one of the great ones. Michael B. Jordon has proven once again why he has been given the torch to continue this series. Very powerful heart warming performance. Sylvester Stallone falls into the old wise trainer with a very believable performance. I could just start the movie over and watch it again. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.,10,2,2,15 December 2019
