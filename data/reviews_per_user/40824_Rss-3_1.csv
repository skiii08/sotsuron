Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," These Federation Types are cowards...the nagotiations will be short
","Star Wars was above all my expectations. Good plot (oh I read somebody's report saying that the Federation wasn't scary...they aren't suppose to be...they are cowards...it's Darth Maul who is scary...geez), Good sound, EXCELLENT ACTING (hey see how good you stuck up critics act when you're in a room with a big blue screen and your suppose to be talking to a crazy alien with big ears), And George did a good job making it feel like it was in the same galaxy far far away. Anyway, in order to like and understand Star Wars you have to treat it like a totally different movie. It's like nothing ever before. You can't compare it to Star Trek or Lost in Space. And that is what critics do. They take a good movie and if the other movies don't match up to that movie, the other movie stinks. You can't treat Star Wars like that. Well i don't care what anybody says, 'Star Wars' is a very very well done movie. Thanx.",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
