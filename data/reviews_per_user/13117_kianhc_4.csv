Gremlins," The great film i have been waiting for.
","Gremlins is one of the best family films I have seen in a long time. It is an entertaining, witty and mischievous comedy. It is very different to most films.The plot:A teenage boy receives a pet Mogwai as a Christmas present form his father and breaks the 3 main rules which are never put it under bright lights (especially sunlight), never put it near water and never ever feed it after midnight. When these are broken they turn into the mischievous gremlins.Even though nobody famous stars or directs this excellent film its still worth a watch.Overall it is a bizarrely great film.",10,1,2,28 December 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The only film that makes you laugh at the end of the world
","This is undoubtedly 1 of my favourite movies of all time.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is the greatest black comedy created by the legendary Stanley Kubrick (this is his best work other than Paths of Glory/Spartacus which cannot be forgotten).This is the movie that has my personal favourite movie/Peter Sellers quote:'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the War Room!'I think it is incredibly funny and ironic.Dr. Strangelove is set during the middle of the Cold War when a psychotic airforce general orders a nuclear attack on Russia which a war room full of officials are trying to stop whilst defending themselves from the doomsday machine (which can destroy the world).This also has the most ridiculous and unrealistic movie death it have ever seen, when major Kong is riding the bomb during the last 10 minutes and screams 'WAHOO!' To the world and blows up.This is thrilling, spellbinding, tense, comical and a very ironic feeling to it.This should be watched by everyone. Do not disappoint yourself by missing the Best Kubrick film of all time.",10,1,4,23 February 2014
Rear Window," The ultimate thriller (great movies review #2)
","I literally just finished watching Rear Window, and felt I have to write a review.This is actually the first and only Hitchcock film I have watched. I am definitely watching more Hitchcock from now on. I wasn't too sure about this movie at first but as Hitchcock has received so much critical acclaim for his movies, I forced myself to watch it, I was not disappointed. These are the reasons why:The plot:A professional photographer for a famous magazine, who is wheel-chair bound, suspects that one of his neighbours he can see through his window (into the courtyard where all the other apartments are) has committed murder.Surely most of us movie lovers have come across this type of plot from many okay movies in the past. This version is spectacular and goes up to a whole new level.The concept of the plot is a very complexed and unusual one.The acting is superb. Like always James Stewart (my idol), does a great job at a dramatic performance as professional photographer J.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries. Grace Kelly looks glamorous as usual.Another interesting thing to point out is the cinematography. It is all set in the courtyard of the many apartments the neighbours live in. The furthest it goes is to a tiny passageway leading out of the block. It just looks amazing. This was actually a low budget film, according to my research (that is how much of a film geek i am).That is all I have to say. Make sure you add this to your list of films you must watch before you die.Thanks for reading.Upcoming reviews:Inception, Back to the future, City lights, The Philadelphia Story, It's a wonderful life, Raiders of the lost ark.",10,0,1,8 December 2013
The Great Gatsby," One of the greatest early American works of literature! (Book review)
","WARNING! This is a review of the book, not the film.The Great Gatsby, which most of you have most likely heard all ready, is considered to be one of and possibly the best piece of early American Literature. This is all correct and not over-hyped.It was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and published in 1925.The story is set during the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway, a poor bonds salesman/author, tells the story in his own thought-provoking, wise and influential words, it starts with his moving to the village of West/East Egg, where he is introduced to the luxurious life of the rich by the beautiful Daisy and The Ill-Tempered Tom and meets his dodgy lover, Jordan Baker. But the moment that really triggers the story is this talk of Jay Gatsby, who just so happens to be Nick's millionaire neighbor. Once he arrives back home he decides to give Gatsby a call and then ends up going to one of Gatsby's parties.During the rest of the novel you gradually realize all the characters connect in some way.This book is really quite mind-blowing. It contrasts the moods of lyrical beauty, real brutalism, magic, romance and mysticism and gritty realism.This book is full of life lessons that everyone should take into consideration as well.This is one of those books you HAVE to read at some point in your life (like To Kill a Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men, Lolita and The Catcher in the Rye etc.)Rating 10/10",10,0,3,9 March 2014
