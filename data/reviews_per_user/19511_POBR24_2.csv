The Ring," The Ring, The Scarriest movie since The Exorcist
","I saw The Ring on Friday night at 9:45 P.M. A Movie is always supposed to be scary when you see it at night. But with the Ring it doesn't matter. This movie is creepy. It's creepy in that way that you just want more. Like on one of the days (I don't want to give it away) your nose starts to bleed. That's scary and weird. On the horror part of the film it does great. Acting Naomi Watts is great actor, what can I say? I thought she was ausome in Mullholland Dr. The Little boy can act too. He just has that look and voice that puts goosebumbs down you spine. Pretty much the acting is really good. Special Effects This movie really isn't abou special effects. There's a couple real pieces of art in here though. Like when we see the dead girls body in the begining. Her body is stiff. She looks like a big bruise from being scared to death. Other than that there's a part with a horse, and there's alot of T.V.s that blow up. Bottom Line The Bottom line is that this movie is scary and it is fun to watch. While there are a hefty amount of disturbing images it should be okay for kids if there okay with getting scared. This movie deserves ***1/2 stars out of 4",9,0,0,19 October 2002
Black Hawk Down," And The Oscar Should Of Gone To:
","Black Hawk Down.  What can I say? This movie is flawless. Absolutley flawless. Maybe better than Saving Private Ryan. You have to admit, Saving Private Ryan was great, but Black Hawk Down is greater. People that say say Black Hawk Down isn't good, Your not right in the head. Everyone in this move is awesome. From Josh Hartnett to Ewan mcGregor. I have a note to Josh Hartnett, Keep up with the war movies Josh. Pearl Harbor might not have been good, but he was good in it.Before I get off the subject lets talk about the movie. The two hour strait fighting scenes are good. The acting is good. The sound is good. The special effects are good. What's there to talk about? This Movie comes out on DVD on June 11. See the friken movie.  You won't be angry.10/10",Null,0,0,7 June 2002
