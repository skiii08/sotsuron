Black Swan," Darren Aronofsky has done it again. Black Swan was absolutely spectacular.
","Everyone please go out and see this movie now. It was completely a spectacular film. I was absolutely blown away by the film once it reached it's end. If Natalie Portman doesn't nominated for Best Actress, I'm gonna be pretty upset. Her performance was riveting, she plays the character so well and you see the change she goes through throughout the film and by the time you see her dance as the black swan, she's a completely different person. Amazing.It's definitely the best film of the year so far and one of the best I've seen in quite some time. There need to be more movies like this! To those who've seen Repulsion, be ready for your mind to be screaming 'THIS IS SO SIMILAR!' The Tenant and Suspiria came to mind while watching it too.The cinematography was extremely beautiful, so complex in certain scenes yet so simple in others. The music score was so lovely, I really enjoyed how the composer mixed in elements of Swan Lake and blended it with a modern musical score. Both the cinematography & the music score really deserve nominations too.From the opening scene (which is probably one of best opening scenes I've ever seen) the film draws you in and keeps you in until the ending. I was literally shaking by the time the movie was over. I was that amazed. Darren Aronofsky sure has come quite a way from Pi (that is great movie too), but really every one of his films gets even better after the next. I'm really excited to see what else has to offer. I personally think he's the Stanely Kubrick of our times. (In my opinion) I absolutely loved it. Go see it now. 10/10.",10,6,14,3 December 2010
Paranormal Activity," Without a doubt one of the scariest movies of the past 10 years
","Every time you see a preview for a movie that says that 'this is the scariest movie of the last (enter # of years here) years' But this is actually a movie that lives up to that title.Paranormal Activity is without a doubt one of the scariest movies of the past decade. It is absolutely terrifying, and after initial viewing, i promise you, that you will have lots of trouble sleeping after watching it.The movie taps into one of those primal fears of what goes on in your house at night, that creepy feeling that someone is watching you, seeing that big shadow on the wall thats not yours, and the fear of ghosts/demons.The movie is really a great horror film, following in the tradition of the original 'The Hauting' and 'The Exorcist' this film is a perfect mix of the two films with a little 'Blair Witch Project' mixed in. There is no blood/gore, no sex/nudity. Just a great horror film that pulls out all the stop to scare you without showing anything.Paranormal Activity starts very slow, but within roughly the first 20 mins into the first night scene you will be creeped out immediately. The ending is also one of the major part of the movie that has still be burned into my memory since I saw it on Friday, today is Sunday. I'm not as much trouble falling asleep but it still is somewhat hard to every time this film floats though my head.I urge you to see this in the movie theater, where it is much better (though it also depends if your audience is well behaved and quite) see this film with an audience is the most enjoyable and terrifying experiences I've ever had in a movie theater.When i saw this on Friday, it was still limited midnight releases, but when i got home i read that Paranormal Activity had passed the 1,000,000 point and is now getting a wide release to all theaters this Friday.You should really catch this in the theater if you can, trust me it will be all worth it. Paranormal Activity is really one the scariest movies of the past 10 years that i would rank up there with the original 'The Hauting', 'The Exorcist', and other horror classics. I give a perfect 10 stars.",10,0,4,11 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Incredibly Mindblowing. The Best Film of 2008!
","The Dark Knight was really worth the wait! I waited...let's see...14 months. Wow, thats a long time. Ever since Batman Begins, and the way it ended with the joker card and Batman saying 'I'll look into it.' I was like 'They have to make a sequel!'. And nothing for 2 year...until May 2007, my prayers were answered. My friend told me of something about a new Batman movie in May, I researched, and found the website: (Whysoserious.com). Yes I may sound like a nerd, but I did go on the scavenger hunts looking for the teaser trailers and the posters and photos of the Joker. Then in 2008 with only 7 months to go, hearing all about the production, and Heath Ledger being the Joker, getting so hyped. On January 22, while watching the news, bad news darkens my day. Heath Ledger (April 4, 1979 - January 22, 2008) died of accidental overdose, I did not live for that day, a fantastic actor whose life was cut short sadly.After all the sadness, July 18 finally came along. I saw the The Dark Knight at Cinemark at 7:45 pm Opening night (I was not lucky enough to get my tickets for Thursday 12:00. The Dark Knight has to be the most incredible film I have seen this year. I surpasses Batman Begins in every aspect! (Batman Begins is a great film, The Dark Knight is just wayy better) Every little thing about it was fantastic!! The editing, the direction, the cinematography, the score, the effects, the acting. The acting, Heath Ledger put on the best performance I have ever seen put on film. Aaron Eckhart was just as great as Heath was! Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Maggie Gynllenhaal (who was a great replacement) all did fantasitc. I really have to give the standing ovation to Heath Leger, he did the absolute best in this film. Rest in peace Heath, you are missed. Two warnings about seeing this, It is really long 152 mins (2 1/2 hrs) so don't quibble, noting seems to slow down at all. The other warning is that, parents don't take your children that are younger than 12 years old. The Joker is quite scary, and the way he kills people is very disturbing, how he got the cuts is explained. The Dark Knight really is the best film of 2008! (Wall-E is equally good, but go see this) You won't wanna miss this one in the theater (or even IMAX) because if you do, you'll be missing out on one of the greats. 10/10",10,3,7,21 July 2008
Saw," You Know What, I Saw SAW!
","This is one of the best horror/slasher/thriller movies of the 2000s it is way better than Hostle, because there is no need for sex. But, this movie really does make you think and has and amazing and chilling twist ending. This one is really good, but don't forget to see Saw II, Saw III, and the upcoming Saw IV! Though there is not much gore, it is genuinely scary and freaky, and has one or two laughs here and there.But really messes with your mind! If you are gong to buy this movie, i suggest buying the 2-Disc Uncut DVD! Anyway, this movie is highly recommended! So Enjoy!",10,1,2,5 August 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Terrifying, Grotesque, Funny, Lyrical, Violent, Spetacular.
","Kubrick really knows how to make a good movie! He really has shown me now, after seeing The Shining, Barry Lyndon, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove. I knew this has to be really good!! From the reviews I read, to the opinions i heard. I really set my expectations high for A Clockwork Orange. And the film, really blew me away. It is one of the greatest films ever made (to me). Stanely Kubrick, is now my favorite director. ACO has amazing visuals, the beautiful use of vibrant colors, the acting is incredible. McDowell did an excellent job as Alex DeLarge. The cinematography (spelling?) is amazing. Every little thing about this picture, is beautiful. Along with 2001, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Dr. Strangelove, they all blew me away, and all are in my top 50 greatest movies ever made!",10,0,2,30 June 2008
The Conjuring," By far one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while.
","I'm an avid horror fan. Lately I've been thinking there isn't much that can scare me (though Sinister got under my skin). I appreciate James Wan's films, I love the first Saw, Insidious was a damn good modern ghost story, but like all reviews have stated for it, the movie kinda loses it's momentum in the final act.The Conjuring is better, scarier, and more tense than Insidious. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's one of the best horror movies of the last 5 or 10 years. It goes back to the classic rule of horror film making, never show the bad guy fully to your audience. Plus this movie knows suspense, I tell you, I almost threw a water bottle at the screen from sheer terror once the scare finally happened. There are no fake jump scares, the movie earned an R rating without any blood, sex, or profanity, it's all from the terror that this movie builds upon.Not only is the movie scary, but as a film itself, it's almost a masterpiece. The script, acting, direction, style, tone, etc were all simply top notch. Wan's camera-work here is by far his best out of any of his movies. The choice to set the movie in the 70s was a stroke of genius as it feels so authentic and all the more real. If this story were set in the present, it simply wouldn't be as a effective or scary. The 70s style film making, costuming, and hair styling are a great throwback to likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror.Though there are a few (extremely minor) flaws, such are length, repetitiveness, and a resolution that happens way too fast. I don't care, every horror movie (or movie in general) has it's flaws. There will never be a perfect horror movie, if there is one, I haven't seen it yet. But all I know is James Wan's The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and it's been a really long time that a movie has scared me this badly.10/10 Don't miss this one, it's an amazing theater viewing experience.",10,336,450,19 July 2013
1408," Scary, Funny, and Touching (At Parts)
","I can say many things about this movie and this movie is very scary!!! and can be funny to some but there is a whole lot of jump parts! and some funny parts. if you like The Shining (1980)(not the cheap TV mini-series, which sucked) you will love this, and i just happen to extremely love both movies!! First, let's start with the cast, John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. They did a very great job in this film. so that is a 10/10 for the acting. Second, the scream meter. Well this film has plenty of scares for those horror fans out there. and for you who haven't seen the movie, on the scream meter, it gets a 10/10!!! Now the comedy. There is some parts for comedy, (i wont say when) but it is not laugh out loud comedy, like after a scary part, to some it might be funny, and to others he is just going crazy (in the movie). But overall: 6/10! Last the overall vote. I Really enjoyed this film, and can't wait till it comes out on DVD!! But the overall rating is 10/10! this is one of the best horror films of 2007, the other is Disturbia. But, this one is for people who like supernatural horror films and just like being scared out of their wits! And after you see this, i would recommend not staying in a hotel room for a while, because i know i won't! Oh! and when i said touching is seeing the flashback of his daughter, that can break a tear for some.",9,1,3,29 July 2007
The Dark Knight Rises," Absolutely incredible ending to a near-perfect trilogy.
","The Dark Knight Rises was one most stunning films I have ever seen. One of the emotional viewing experiences I have ever been through too. That's not a bad thing at all, this movie made me feel. It did everything a movie is supposed to do, it made me laugh, it made me angry, it made me happy, it made me cry. Yes, it made me cry. The Dark Knight Rises is the best of the series, with one of the most beautiful endings I've ever seen on film, and dare I say it is equal to or maybe ever a little bit better than The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight Rises exceeded all of my expectations, in terms of acting, action, dialogue, plot, etcetc Though running at almost 3 hours long, this movie never feels boring, never did I look at my watch, I was glued the screen all 164 minutes. The first hour was definitely slower than the rest of the movie, but it wasn't boring. Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job at setting up all the major plot points and introducing the new characters.Christian Bale delivers his best performance as Batman, he is wonderful the whole series, but this time around he goes to place where we've never seen Batman go and he rocks it. Michael Caine should be up for an Oscar for his powerful performance, absolutely fantastic. Anne Hathaway was a definite surprise as the sexy Selina Kyle (never referred to as Catwoman in the movie at all! Hah!), she stole every scene she was in with her quick, dry humor. Other standouts were Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman, who all play wonderfully in their supporting parts. This brings me to Tom Hardy. His performance as Bane scared the crap out of me at times, he was terrifying. Very different from The Joker, there's no comparing the two as they are completely different villains. Extremely well done.From a technical standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. It looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, and flows beautifully. The cinematography, editing, score, and visual effects topped those all seen/heard in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Namely the soundtrack, this is Hanz Zimmer's best Batman score. Nolan's action sequences are better than ever, they are extremely brutal and very engrossing.A few critics have criticized the film for not being 'fun', well I don't know what movie they were watching because there are plenty of those witty chuckle lines throughout and the majority of the film's sense of humor comes from Catwoman.Though this movie is without not flaws, there are minor ones including random time jumps toward the end of the movie, small logic questions, and other little knit picky things, but overall the movie flows and goes with grace that throws twists at you that will leave you floored, and then cumulates to one of the most beautiful endings I've ever seen.I wouldn't be surprised if this movie were up for quite a bit of Oscars this year; I'm thinking a few in the acting department, many in tech, and maybe even Best Picture & Best Director? We'll just have to see! The Dark Knight Rises is the movie event of year, and perhaps the best film of 2012 thus far. Go see it, and prepare to be wowed!! 10/10",10,2,7,20 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Best Film of the Series and Best Film of 2011 thus far.
","I've been an avid fan of the Harry Potter series since I started reading the books on my own in 3rd grade. I've followed the books and movies for a good part of my childhood. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was and everything and more I hoped it would be. I cried when I read the final book, but I wept when I saw this film. If I could go back and count it'd have to be at least seven times I felt my heart break, and then I realized that my childhood was coming to a close during the epilogue. It's been awhile since a movie has emotionally effected me that much. The performances in this film are so powerful and thrilling (namely Daniel Radcliffe and Alan Rickman), the detail of the film's location, costumes, art direction, music, and mostly cinematography blow all of other films out of the water. The most visually beautiful film of the series. I may sound biased because I'm such a huge fan of the series from such a young age, but even if I hadn't read any of the books I'd still think it's a piece of monumental cinema.There's so much about this film that amazed me, but mostly it was the translation from text to screen. Gringotts, The Battle of Hogwarts, Snape's back story, and the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. I had my own little picture of how that played out, but it's so grand to see on film and ever so gripping.I honestly think that this final chapter in the Harry Potter series is worthy of some Oscar nods. I'm really hoping it'll at least get some nods for Best Supporting Actor (Alan Rickman), Best Art Directon, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, maybe even Best Picture... who knows! With the Academy nominating 10 films a year for Best Picture it's highly possible! But, overall this is definitely the best film of the series, emotionally wrenching and heartbreaking but an absolute spectacle of a film.",10,1,2,17 July 2011
