Skyfall," Watchable but disappointing
","This was the first James Bond Movie I had ever watched and was bitterly disappointed. I have never read a James Bond book before so was not previously acquainted with the characters and style of the whole franchise but I found the movie to be lacking in any desirable plot. This therefore made the whole movie slightly tedious to follow as the story was so basic. Although the actors were competent especially Bardem and Harris apart from the character of Silva all the other characters seemed very two dimensional and dull. The Bond character was especially unappealing as he lacked any personality or interesting quirks, his script was very flat and he didn't act like a 'Gentleman'. The most unnecessary moment in the whole movie was near the end when Bond kills Silva. I was expecting to be pleased that 'good defeated evil' and I thought I should have respect or even pride for Bond but none such emotions were felt. Instead there was simply the unnecessary and immature remark made by Bond when he said 'last rat standing.' I literally retched when he said that! He has just murdered a man who has an obvious reason to be mad after being left to be tortured for six months and M refused to help him and rather Bond showing any remorse or respect for a former ally he does the un-chivalrous by sarcastically insulting the man in his dying moments.As with a surprisingly high amount of movies my interest ended up with the antagonist Silva played by Bardem. He was the only character with any back story, character flaws, quirks and brains and for someone who had never been immersed into the wold of James Bond before I found myself almost forcibly latching onto the villain! which I'm sure wasn't the intent of the movie but never the less I found more sympathy in this characters demise than I did with M.This movie is rated OK in my opinion. The plot was basic and therefore a struggle to follow and all characters lacking in any emotion or personality. However the character of Silva should be commended and makes the movie somewhat watchable.",4,2,12,2 November 2012
The Dark Knight," Great movie
","Still to this day whenever I put on The Dark Knight I am amazed by the creativity and imagination put into all aspects of this monumental film. If I could give it more than 10/10 stars then I would without hesitation.The character of The Joker played by Ledger is not comparable to any performance I have ever seen in my life, it is literally in a league of its own. The generously sinister voice that was created by Ledger during a period of time before the filming of the movie where he locked himself away for about a month 'formed a little diary and experimented with voices,' The result of which is a hilariously sarcastic and dark portrayal of a psychopath come out to play! Known as 'war paint' The Joker's fantastical make-up turns out to be no mask at all as The Joker has no other alias and therefore nothing to hide. The script also takes advantage not only of the jokers shocking style but his quirky thought process too. Not only does he use acts of 'random' violence to play on the batman's moral strings, but also that of the audience. What would you do if you had to chose between two ships crammed with people and one had to be blown up? What would you do if you had to pick between the life of someone you love or the hero of the city? The Joker utilises violence and shoves his opinions in the face of others drawing people in and turning them to the dark side, as is the case with Harvey Dent/ Two Face. The character of Batman played by Bale does not seem a worthy opponent until the very end. Time and time again he is thwarted by the jokers intelligence and violent forcefulness. It takes a few new gadgets such as sonar goggles and a beefed up suit but in the end it only takes one hesitation from The Joker for Batman to beat him.Nolan has successfully modernised and stylised Batman to fit into the 21st century and has in my opinion made it more believable than any cartoon you could read. He has brought Batman out of the two dimensional comic strip and used eye popping visual cues and clever script writing to add an extra intensity and emotion to every character in the story.A definite tribute to the original comic book creation.",10,2,7,9 November 2012
