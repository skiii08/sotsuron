Moneyball," did not like Money Ball
",I can't believe I actually tried to watch this movie after about ten or fifteen minutes I just looked at my husband and without another word we just turned if off. Bad film bad acting mediocre meaningless dialog. I am confused how this film MONEYBALL could generate any type of award. I have seen Brad Pitt in bad films before and this one takes the prize. I wasted money watching The Strange Case of Benjamin Button and also Troy and I really wanted to see a good film with Brad Pitt in it because I heard he was going to quit acting in two years. Do not rent this movie and do not waste your time going to see it. There is really nothing to see.,1,5,30,30 January 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Hansel and Gretel the witch hunters
",I found this movie to be totally lacking in taste. It did not hold my attention and I am glad I rented this film instead of wasting money on it to watch it at the theater. I could have used some buttered popcorn to occupy me as I tried to stay interested in a boring and dumb tale with a plot that went nowhere and where all of the fighting ended up to amount to nothing. The actors and the actresses were not believable and therefore I was very disappointed and would not rate this film anything other than a one which is awful. There are other movies out there if you want to see them involving witch hunts and the like and I suggest you go out there and find something better than this bloody and awfully boring movie.,1,2,5,13 July 2013
Mama," dreadful film
",I rented this movie thinking it had the basis to be the kind of movie that would at least give me a decent scare and instead it was cheaply crafted and had poor acting and an even more dreadful plot. Nothing about it made any sense at all and it was tortuous just watching the young actresses in the film play their roles and even thought they did it rather nicely it was not enough to carry the story. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because I had a hard time trying to understand the story and was bored constantly the entire time the movie was going from one dreadful scene to the other and finally I even had to admit to myself that I no longer cared what happened when it finally came to its terrible and pitiful end. Sadly directed and written and a total waste of two hours of bad film.,1,9,18,21 June 2013
