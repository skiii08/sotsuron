The Blair Witch Project," Cinema Verite Fright...
","Is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multi-media event?  It is both.  The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now, we all know the truth, but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.A guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has 'Heather, Mike, and Josh' heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film, it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.Most filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us:  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.True, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.Much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.Rating: ***1/2",8,78,146,25 October 1999
Vertigo," A Visual Work of Art That Must be Seen on the BIG Screen...
","Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO has always been able to connect over the years, whether on TV or the restored video version.  To really appreciate this incredible flick from the Master of Suspense, you MUST see it on the big screen in 70mm.  Check the papers for revival houses in your area where old films from Hollywood's 'Golden Age' can truly be revered.  The opening title sequence, one of the best in cinema history created by the immortal Saul Bass (NORTH BY NORTHWEST, CAPE FEAR), seemed entirely new to me in the darkened theatre.  Hitch made his most artistic picture with wondrous color schemes and amazing screen composition.  Just look at the ghostly greens and reds that help this complex tale absorb you and engage you.  Kim Novak's character is absolutely 'from amongst the dead' in the mind of Jimmy Stewart (in his second best role) and the lengths that he and Hitchcock go to are exhausting and mystifying.Most film buffs know that VERTIGO is considered Hitch's most personal film, mostly because of how he molds his actresses to look perfect much like the Stewart character does with Novak. The two actors have fantastic chemistry that changes drastically from initial obsession, to love, then back to obsession.  Not much happens in terms of pure action, but as pure cinema, this movie is a landmark.  I can't remember a film that can be so visually captivating without a word of dialogue for long stretches of time.  The viewer becomes just as obsessed with 'Madeleine', played sensually by Novak. It really is hard to figure out if there are some supernatural undertones at work, especially in the world of Hitchcock.Bernard Herrman's legendary score sounds crisp and emotional in its new, restored form and is as much a character in the film as the colors and the flowers and the hair twists that come to mean so much as the film progresses.  The 'special sequence', or nightmare that Stewart has is VERTIGO's crowning achievement.  The animation and coloring must have awed audiences of 1958, who actually did not accept the movie at the time. Time has done wonders to VERTIGO and the people at Universal who painstakingly put the film back together for theatrical release have done an amazing job. I only hope the rumors regarding a restoration of REAR WINDOW are true. Look for it in late 1999 !?RATING: 10 of 10 NOTE: Stewart's best performance was in the great MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON",10,9,14,31 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Critic-Proof Extravaganza That Will Please Most Viewers...
","To deeply criticize this wonderfully fun motion picture is to miss the point.  George Lucas and his Star Wars galaxy is so out-of-this-world, how can a critic, or even an angry fan pick it to pieces?  Does it not have sensational sets, spellbinding space battles, perky aliens, and, most importantly, the beginning of a long journey of the cinema's most famous villain? It does and Lucas wows us with a new look to an old universe. People cannot forget that this whole deal takes place 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.'  It's called escapist entertainment, people, and who better than George Lucas, the creator of the original critic-proof trilogy and the Indiana Jones Trilogy to allow us to catch up with some young versions of some old friends and see sights you will never see in real life.EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE is a sprawling thrill-ride that is meant strictly to entertain and produce candy for the eyes.  It's geared towards kids, but with some universally adult themes.  So were the others.  With this effort, an unforgettable story of failure and redemption has its beginnings.  Sometimes a bit confusing, those with a discerning eye for detail and a general knowledge of episodes IV through VI will get it (this would include most of the civilized world, excluding the negative critics who place too much emphasis on the wrong things in this film).  It's funny that my comment regarding a terrific movie is actually a defense argument against those who miss the point of the Star Wars films.  Suspend disbelief (of course), realize that this is only the FIRST in a succession of films that will tie all confusing loose ends this episode presents together (isn't that what we wish for), and just sit back and let the film fly over you.True, the performances and the dialogue are dry and as corny as a farm in the summer, but weren't the other 3 films of the same mold.  The story and the world the characters exist in is what we watch these films for, not for some revolutionary method acting or drama.  STAR WARS - THE PHANTOM MENACE is a throwback to the old Flash Gordon serials, with great-looking bad guys and a beautiful Queen to boot.  Just check out the saber-duels between Jedis Obi-Wan(Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon(Liam Neeson) with a dark lord of the Sith 'Darth Maul'.  He is memorable in appearance and fighting abilities only, but it was enough for me.  The duels are technically perfect, exciting and riveting.I would ask the makers to kill off 'Jar Jar Binks' the most annoying character in a film since Mickey Rooney played 'Puck' in 1935's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.  Other than that, the performances are measured, but well within the context of the story construction and special effects.  Why do critics want Jedis winning Oscars, or Paul Newman-esque acting in the films? They don't need it.  For the young at heart, both in life and at the movies, take EPISODE I for what it is - brilliant entertainment and the start of a long, strange trip through a galaxy a lot more fun than ours.RATING:  Let me think...a 10 !",7,1,2,19 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Old-Time serial brought to excellence by Spielberg...
","RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy, is a throw-back to the old cliff-hanger serials of the 30's and 40's as we all know. It's just how well it is done that is absolutely awe-inspiring.Spielberg is a master technician, filming some of the most difficult stunt sequences ever put onto celluloid. His themes of Naziism and his obsession of WWII appear blatantly for the first time (not including 1941). There are great images of the swastika being denounced. Blood is sprayed on it from a boneheaded brawler and the ark burns it from the box it is enclosed in. Indy even escapes from the map room with a rope tied together with a Nazi flag. The small touches of humor add to the incredible sense of excitement: a mischievous monkey solutes the Nazis, Marion's drinking game, 'It's not the years, it's the mileage' - What a perfect action/adventure film. John William's score helps a lot as well. The break-neck pace and non-stop scenes of pursuit make these 'raiders' something to remember.",10,2,4,4 March 1999
Casablanca," Hollywood System Gem...absolute must!
","There is really not much you can say about the greatness of this movie because of its universal timelessness and appeal.  A famous love story with Nazis and war as a backdrop.  Rick and Ilsa, the interrupted love affair renewed, this time each knowing that they must sacrifice their love for a larger good.  The famous saloon, where international bravado rules and exit visas are rampantly desired.This is undoubtedly the funniest and most cynical of Bogart's characters and Bergman is an absolute stunner.  My favorite shot in the film is that of Bergman as she looks out of the corner of her eye for Rick as Laszlo goes to the bar.  It is a quick dolly in to her right side, her look explaining everything.  This is a movie you must own if you're a film lover.  It can be watched over and over.",10,1,1,19 February 1999
Chinatown," Deep, Dark Noir...Sunny on the Surface
","Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN, is a must for fans of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, although that film does not hold a candle to this.  Not only does it have style, but it has as much substance, something rare in most movies.  And yes, it is a product of the 1970's, the first decade when films showed the influence of their predecessors.  This is an homage to film-noir, of course, but it elevates the genre to a whole new level because of its deep psychological themes.  I could discuss the plot, which is as thick as a dictionary, but 1000 words is not enough to encapsulate this fantastic movie.Jack Nicholson plays JJ Gittes in an understated, Bogart-type way, however he is still a difficult man to figure out.  The film ends, fittingly, in Chinatown, where Gittes got his start in this business.  We don't know what went wrong with him there, something hinted at while in bed with Dunaway's Mrs. Mulwray, but it must have been messy.  The ending is a stunning payoff to what has transpired.  It is unexpected and it is sad.  Dunaway turns in a deceptively great performance as the tortured femme fatale.  Notice her mannerisms whenever her father is brought up.  First time viewers will cringe when they find out why she acts this way.Legendary director John Huston plays the father, Noah Cross, one of the most reprehensible characters in recent memory.  You sense evil when he's on-screen and he is symbolic of the drought in L.A.  The man is soulless and insane. Polanski brings together a great cast of stars and then unknowns to create an ever-unfolding plot that turns left when you expect a right.  He even puts himself in the mix, taking a piece out of Gittes snoopy nose.It is also beautifully photographed, with golden daylights remembering a more golden age, and serene sunsets and nights.  Underneath is the evil of murder, theft, and incest.  Think of all of the elements.  Its like a Hitchcock filmography of props: B/w photos, dead decoys, bi-focal glasses, water basins, broken taillights, the eye of a fish, bandaged nose, a sister, and a daughter. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score echoes loss and tragedy as everything comes to a rousing, murderous halt in CHINATOWN.(NOTE: This film should be seen in its widescreen format on video.  Each shot is almost portrait-like and watching the pan-and-scan cropped version is like pressing your nose against the glass and watching.)",10,1,2,4 March 1999
The Birth of a Nation," Painful Opening of the Cinematic Curtains.
","I first saw BIRTH OF A NATION in a film class and I found it very hard to stay awake.  That was 8 years ago.  My eyes stayed open this time to witness a film of monstrous racism and an epic feeling of sympathy for the Ku Klux Klan.  Of course, I know all of the significance and importance of the movie and how director D.W. Griffith invented the language of modern cinema, at least as far as the silents go.  I must say that the influence, techniques, and  legendary status of the picture goes out the window because of some idiotic ideas and horribly racist scenes that made my stomach churn. 
Its a shame the first ever feature length film has few moments that can only be appreciated unless you consider them within the context of time.  Filmed in 1914, there are massive crowd scenes, re-enactments of critical moments during the civil war, and even the first known depiction of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln (done quite well by the way). Griffith's huge mistake was to show the KKK as heroes and to sympathize with the Confederacy ideals of a Southern republic.Word has it that Griffith was raised by African-Americans and even loved them.  He pays them no respect or even any credit for anything in this miserable play on race.  That's really the problem.  Innovative techniques aside, Griffith must have never realized the pain that is surely felt by African-Americans today who must study this film or even see it for its renowned 'importance'.  BIRTH OF A NATION is for buffs only and believe me when I tell you this.  I could not look past the white actors playing blacks as drinking, jumping, would-be rapists in dark-face.  And what is with the 'mulatto' who tries to create a black empire only to be foiled by the 'glorious' clan members ?  Griffith shows great empathy for the clansmen who look a lot more ridiculous in their clown outfits than the actors in black-face.  I don't mean to sound like a civil rights activist (I am a white guy from the suburbs), but BIRTH OF A NATION is a document not only of the racism that existed in the 1800's, but also of the early 1900's. The first ever film to tell a cohesive story, feature-length style, should be forgotten.  Luckily, Griffith was able to redeem his social image as far as history has written it with some more imaginative films.

Shakespeare in Love," A Better Love Story Than Romeo and Juliet Itself...
","England, 1589. A young playwright named Will Shakespeare is trying to start a new play. He is up on a 'deadline' and rival playhouses are all over him to produce the work. It seems Will can only write about something personal to him, for instance, his latest muse. Romeo and Rosalind, he'll call it. No, Romeo and the Pirate's Daughter? Not a good title. Will doesn't know it, but an unknown, upper-class wannabe actor/actress up for a part in his unwritten play will be his Juliet. Shakespeare IN LOVE, John Madden's winner for best picture of 1998, presents this speculative story of a struggling literary giant with such originality and sensibility, it may surpass Mr. Shakespeare's own fable of forbidden love.Joseph Fiennes IS Willie Shakespeare in a performance so strong and passionate, it is simply amazing how overlooked it was. The film is written so well, the words erupt from the actor's mouths much like Shakespeare's own plays do. Screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard even address the long-time myth that Shakespeare was not the sole creator of the most famous literature ever written. Collaboration comes from suggestions in a pub, speakers in the street, and real-life experiences. Could it be that the Bard himself also took his own life experiences and filtered them into his own work? Maybe. It is certainly a practice universally performed by modern writers, authors, and poets. This is Shakespeare IN LOVE's premise and the love story portrayed is both eloquent and sensual.Gwyneth Paltrow is the object of Will's affection and superb at recreating Elizabethan charm. You find yourself falling in love with her. 'Romeo and Juliet' comes about through their experiences together. Fiennes even climbs a tree up to Paltrow's balcony, a great moment from the play. This is all juxtaposed with the play's rehearsal. These scenes are tender, but they also inspire laughter because of what we already know about the story of Romeo and Juliet. Geoffrey Rush provides some more comic relief in a screenplay with so much depth, it is a unique work of art. Each character is given enough screen time to make an impression on us. Even Dame Judi Dench's 8 minutes of Oscar-winning acting is a treat.I've never seen Shakespeare himself portrayed. This is pure fiction, but Fiennes breathes life into the mysterious figure behind so many colossal texts. For Shakespeare illiterates, you can still enjoy the picture. Everyone speaks in prose, not poetry. A general knowledge of Romeo and Juliet would be helpful, however. The film looks and feels of the time, but a great love story of the 16th century is brought to life in 20th century cinematic fashion. Did it deserve the Best Picture award? No. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did. No matter. It is a true wonder to watch.RATING: 10 of 10",Null,1,2,1 April 1999
12 Monkeys," Finally, A Time Travel Story Done With Suspense and Originality.
","Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films of the Sci-fi genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality.  An apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 MONKEYS never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. Excellent use of Philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place.Bruce Willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen.  He is actually sane, but the people of the future (or present if you will) distort this guy's head so bad through time travel, no wonder he unravels.  He gets sent to World War I just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the Army of the Twelve Monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it. They finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance, we get to see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and an ominous Brad Pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years.Stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that Willis may not be as cracked up as he seems.  A captivating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of 'seeing' each other before, in another place or time.  12 MONKEYS is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present, when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world.The brooding city of Philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for Willis' plight to complete his mission which is, against all usual Hollywood stereotype, NOT to save the world.  He is gathering information.  The film plays tricks on the viewer as well, placing Willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin.  This must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but Gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making.  He even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like TIME BANDITS, and BRAZIL.  The screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films.  If you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS.RATING: 9 of 10",9,17,25,27 June 1999
L.A. Confidential," Spectacular Cop Drama That Rivals CHINATOWN...
","This stylish, action-filled cop story is maze-like in plot and looks absolutely incredible. Not only is there an Oscar winning performance by Kim Basinger, but a discovery of 2 fine Australian actors, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. They seem as American as apple pie on-screen, bringing to life the main protagonists of James Ellroy's novel. The hard-boiled script by director Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland brilliantly follows through with the evolution of these seemingly one dimensional characters, both on opposite sides of a police officer's moral code, who find they have a lot more in common than first glimpsed. Sure, its a recollection of film-noir, but it is without a doubt a 90's film. The 1950's are relived with great nostalgia and period set-ups, however, it is not the showcase of the film. Its plot and acting are what is so great.Kevin Spacey headlines the troupe, playing slick Detective Jack Vincennes, a consultant to 'Badge of Honor', a fictional TV show based on Dragnet I guess. There are many nuances to real-life people and events, not the least being Lana Turner in a hilarious scene, or Johnny Stompanato, her mob bodyguard boyfriend who was later shot to death by Turner's own daughter (not in the movie). Spacey is the cop who 'busted Mitchum' which he takes great pride in. Crowe is such a presence as the brutish enforcer who has a soft spot for abused women for a very good reason. This is where Basinger, a Veronica Lake look-alike (and noir film fixture), is able to come across as a hooker with a mind and ambition beyond what she does. It's a good performance, maybe not Oscar-worthy, but noteworthy, nonetheless. Pearce plays the stodgy, son of a cop lieutenant, who along with Crowe, realizes there is more at stake here than a simple murder/robbery.To get into any more plot aspects or characterizations would be ridiculous. Just view the film and see how unique and important it is. This is not your usual police squad period portrait. Most importantly is L.A. CONFIDENTIAL's ending, which consists of a shootout, something that would usually turn movie buffs away. 9 out of 10 cop dramas end this way uneffectively. Here, we see a revelation. A shootout that holds you in a trance and surprises with each blow. It is to climactic shootouts what FRENCH CONNECTION was to car chases. As far as comparison to CHINATOWN, there really is none. This is not to say they do not belong in the same league. They even have the same Musical composer, Jerry Goldsmith, who again utilizes the trumpet to resonate corruption and deception. These are 2 distinctly different visions of Los Angeles cop warfare. CHINATOWN was more of a character study and had more to say on some pretty deep issues. It took place pre-WWII and was a direct homage to the dark noir pix of the 40's and 50's. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, while deep in substance in its own right, is more action oriented and simpler. Both will always stand as a testament to old-style police melodrama.NOTE: Like CHINATOWN, see it in its 2.35:1 aspect ration, the widest of Widescreen images.RATING: 10 of 10",10,2,3,27 March 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Does Not Capture the True Spirit of Irving's 'Legend', But Still Mildly Fun Anyhow.
","Director Tim Burton's hands are all over SLEEPY HOLLOW, a century-ending update of Washington Irving's classic ghost story of a headless horseman who terrorizes a small New York town.  The story is set in 1799 and even uses some quips about the coming of the 19th Century to tie it together with our time.  Its visually delicious, sometimes chilling, but unevenly odd and bloody.  Heads sure do roll and the murders are surprisingly displayed as bloody massacres, all beheadings considered.SLEEPY HOLLOW is fun.  There is no doubt about it, however Depp is mis-cast and the screenplay is amazingly thin.  The appearances of the headless horseman are not done as well as Burton is capable of doing.  Sure there is mist, vapor, and howling winds.  We are never truly scared by his attacks. They are brutal to say the least.Burton's villain is reminiscent of 'Batman' in appearance sometimes and he, of course, uses Depp as 'Ichabod Crane' as his own alter ego.  Do you ever notice Burton's main protagonists look like Burton himself (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD, even BEETLEJUICE)?   I like the small doses of Burtonesque filmmaking, but a full length feature it cannot make.  Danny Elfman's (another Burton regular) exciting score adds much to the sometimes dreary flick.  Depp never seems entirely comfortable as 'Crane' and more humor was needed to flesh out his character.Its funny how some people complained about the early BATMAN films not being cartoonish enough, only dark and even depressing.  Here is a dark picture literally that may have worked better with a more cartoonish touch.  I know this is horror but isn't the original spirit of Irving's 'Legend of Sleepy Hollow' more colorful and comical?  Yes and this picture needed more spirit and less schlock.An important note: SLEEPY HOLLOW contains one of those scenes that make you want to split - when the 'bad guy' tells his or her venemous story about how they were able to reak evil verbatim, leaving less to the viewer's imagination and more lines of dialogue.  Why not run some title cards explaining it all?  These points must be thought of, but I must say SLEEPY HOLLOW is fine, simple entertainment from a master filmmaker who I thought would provide a lot more.Rating:  **1/2",7,0,0,21 November 1999
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's Most Entertaining Thriller...
","The 1950's was an amazing decade for Alfred Hitchcock.  Year after year, he churned out some sort of a classic: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, etc..  He capped it with the most exciting film he ever directed. NORTH BY NORTHWEST is sheer escapist entertainment, a non-stop ride across the country, with Hitch dealing out his usual cards.  Innocent man (Cary Grant) in a crazy situation which he is wrongfully drawn into, and the beautiful leading lady (Eva Marie Saint), who always seem to be blonde.  I also have to say that musical composer Bernard Herrmann has produced one of his top 3 scores (the other 2 being TAXI DRIVER and PSYCHO).  Right from the opening title sequence, we are souring into this story of international intrigue, decoys, and constant pursuit.The film barely lets up as Grant, in his own dashing manner, plays it cool as an advertising exec who becomes surrounded by the bad guys before we even get settled into our seats.  This is the mother of all modern action/chase films, with pitstops at the UN building, Grand Central Station, Chicago, a vast cornfield, and finally, Mount Rushmore.  Grant's scene on the field has become one of the most famous sequences of all-time.  That dust-cropper definitely had a mind of its own.  The great thing about the scene is that about 90% of it was shot on location.  Again, listen to that music.  It explodes with the suspense of the scene.You never know what side of the fence Hitch's characters are on at times. Is there a real 'Kaplan'?  Why did the bad guys pick Grant as their target? Eva Marie Saint is not so saintly as the alluring blonde who has some kind of angle on the events herself.  You're never really sure what she is up to. This is the greatness and originality of the 'worlds' Hitchcock and his writers create.  Things are never as they appear.  It is up to the viewer to pay attention or let him play you like a fiddle.  Either way, you come out satisfied.This is not his 'best' film.  It is his most thrilling flick, and it also has the refreshing sense of humor that enlighten Hitch's best pictures. In terms of action and adventure, this has no equal within his library of films with perhaps the exception of 1940's FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.  Great dialogue, slick and stylish directing, and a sense of pure fun makes this one better.RATING - 10 of 10",10,2,3,23 March 1999
Apocalypse Now," Possibly the most ambitious film ever made...
","Francis Coppola's descent into madness back in the late 1970's was all about APOCALYPSE NOW, one of the most incredible pieces of art ever placed on the screen.  It is violent, beautiful, ugly, and damn dark at times.  As a war film, APOCALYPSE NOW does not move me anywhere near the way PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did.  Those two pictures deal with war in a more combative, realistic way.  You grow and bond with the troupes in those flicks.  Here, you are engulfed in complete madness, something that seems apart from actual war.  It is more of a morality play into the soul and our 'hearts of darkness' than a war film.Do I think Coppola made a mistake trying to base a story about the Vietnam War on Joseph Conrad's fictional 'Heart of Darkness'?  Sure, and I think he feels that way too.  Vietnam and the U.S involvement in the war has nothing to do with what Coppola was trying to do.  He once said 'My film IS Vietnam,' referring to APOCALYPSE, but is it really? Not at all.  What results is unbelievably hard to assess except to say it is sheer brilliance. It transcends the horrors of war and seemed more of a personal film with Martin Sheen representing each of us as a complex human being on an impossible mission.  It is like traveling to Hell and back, many scars obtained, many feelings drowned out.Everyone who knows a dime about movies, knows the battle itself it was to make this ambitious film.  So many images burn into memory: nepalm explosions to the tune of the Door's 'The End'; Wagner blaring from speakers placed on some U.S. helicopters about to blow up a Vietnamese village; a soldier surfing to the Stone's 'Satisfaction'; the final ritualistic slaughter we witness during the film's dreary ending.  This is all fantasy. The war is nowhere to be found in these and multiple other sequences. Vietnam is merely a backdrop to display a truly insane trip up a river where one clearly defined character (Sheen as Willard) meets a fuzzy character (Brando as Kurtz) and no real resolutions are found.  It is the trip that does it for us.Wondrously eerie sights, sounds, and experiences pulsate throughout APOCALYPSE NOW and the first three quarters of the film are perfect.  Under the conditions Coppola and crew were working under, it is no wonder they had no ending.  Brando truly ruins what Sheen, in what is probably the most underrated performance of the 70's as 'Willard', had done to the point of arrival at Kurtz' compound.  What the hell is Brando talking about?  At least Sheen comes through at the end giving us a hint as to what the journey meant to him.This film ranks way high on my list because of the mystery of it all and the absolute audacity with which Coppola paints his descent into madness.",10,17,31,1 December 1999
Rocky IV," An embarrassing addition to the Rocky series.
","This terrible addition to the saga of Rocky Balboa, Philadelphia's 'favorite son', is an embarrassment.  It is a completely lifeless, emotionless film, that plays like a group of music videos instead of meaningful scenes giving insight into any of the characters.  It is not only a far cry from the brilliant original, one of my own personal favorites, but a slap in the face to fans of the first film.  Why do we need to see a cold war allegory represented by a boxer from South Philly?  This is the basis of the film, which begins with an exhibition bout between Apollo Creed and Russian fighter Ivan Drago.  Apollo dies in the ring, so Rocky must set things right with the free world by fighting Drago in Russia.  Gee, who will win?One of the film's most annoying ploys is the casting, by Stallone, of his soon-to-be-wife Briggite Nielsen.  In order to make space for her in the cast, Stallone completely underwrites the Drago character, rendering him virtually speechless.  This allows the Nielsen character, Drago's wife, to speak for him and have herself a nice amount of screen time.  This gimmick is about as artificial to filmmaking as Stallone's marriage to Nielsen turned out to be.Stallone replaced Bill Conti's familiar and surging music score with a juiced-up, synthesized score I guess he felt was more modern.  Huge mistake. 1) The types of films the Rocky series represent are as old as Hollywood itself.  Conti's score enhanced this fact and help to make the original rise above the usual rags to riches movies that come out practically every year. 2) The new score is used to make a series of MTV-like videos poorly disguised as human drama.I guess a movie that runs about 90 minutes and features a 5-minute flashback sequence can't be very fresh or good anyway.",2,17,41,1 January 1999

","FIFTY-FOUR does not know whether it wants to capture the late 70's, the impact the club had on it, Steve Rubell, or the lives of the fictional characters, who are about as memorable as most people's memory of 54 parties.  They rarely have any.  It does not focus on any of the latter, but instead, tries to wrap it it all into a cohesive whole.  No go.  This is a very ambitious undertaking by the filmmakers, but it seems like they could not or would not let loose.  How can you really recreate Studio 54 unless you shoot inside the actual club ? (it still stands in New York)  I also feel that Miramax was afraid of backlash and box-office so they set strict productional values.  No real big stars, and, most importantly, no representatives of the world famous celebrities who attended 54 on a steady basis.We do see some of the obvious in and outs of the club, like the drug-swapping at the bars, and the guidelines for getting in at the infamous velvet ropes that kept so many people out.  We never get a real sense that we are back in that period.  I would recommend seeing the current documentaries on the club being shown on cable TV.  The film is so short, the documentaries are longer and much more entertaining.Mike Myers gives a half-decent performance, but never-mind the fact that Steve Rubell's partner in the club is nowhere to be found.  And the director makes a half-hearted stab at taking us into the highly private 'basement' where all the stars hung out.  Myers' lines seem forced and I'm sure people who were close to the real Rubell were gnawing their teeth.  What could've been an important statement about the me-decade and its excesses is wasted. Instead, we get a Tony Manero-type story the viewer could really care less about.",Null,1,2,5 March 1999
American History X," A Powerful History Lesson For Us ALL !!!
","The third best film of 1998 is a tenacious, overwhelming depiction of hate for no reason and stupidity that is learned.  Everybody should see this picture, no matter how old, or what color, race, or creed.  AMERICAN HISTORY X is not profound, is not symbolic, and does not have a hero who lets us know at the end that this is all wrong.  In fact, Ed Norton is quite the anti-hero, even after release from prison.  You see he killed two African-Americans who were robbing his car on his own property.  It was certainly NOT self-defense.AMERICAN HISTORY X is a message movie, no doubt about it.  But the message is not told in words or speeches by the actors.  Experiences tell the story of some very small-minded people who believe they have the temerity to 'rid' a portion of California of 'unwanted, inferior races.'  A racial basketball game punches what the opening sequence pulled off right home.  Norton is a 'lieutenant' in the D.O.C., a neo-Nazi organization.  He is the leader while a sinister Stacey Keach recruits and brainwashes from a headquarters somewhere in the city (Venice Beach, CA).  If the whites win, the blacks must leave the court, forever.  I can only imagine the cheers or jeers this scene brought about in audiences who saw the picture during its brief theater run.  In fact, it was probably in the public's best interest not to keep it out too long.  This is sad, but a point is presented here.  Smart, open-minded people will see the senselessness of it all and see racism for what it is: sheer stupidity and ignorance.The film is presented in an interesting narrative method, with flashbacks in black and white before Norton's incarceration.  After his release, we see in living, breathing color the scary gangland that is the racial atmosphere in this section of Cali.  The tragedy of it all is Norton's little brother, played by Edward Furlong (TERMINATOR II), who is clearly headed down the same swasticized path Norton went down.  In prison, Norton's status in the neo-Nazi underworld was heightened to God-like and Furlong, young and impressionable, looks to carry the torch.  Throughout, we see scenes of demeaning race relations and brutal dialogue and ideas put forth blatantly by the skinheads.  Ed Norton, one of the best actors of his generation, bulked up considerably to look the part of the sick skinhead, but after some waking up in jail, he has had enough.Rumors spread rampantly that Norton and director Tony Kaye fought while filming and that a disagreement ensued.  Whoever's 'vision' won out is the correct one, because this film never steps wrong.  It may be headed down a predictable path, but there are multiple ways this picture could end.  Doom and tragedy are in the air and you just know someone is going to die for no other reason than learned racism and philosophy on different creeds.  It's a shame that the ideas come from someone who should've been the most responsible person in these kid's lives.  He was incapable of shielding them from these idiotic thoughts of single-minded bigotry.  Catholics, Jews, Prodestines, African-Americans, and most importantly, skinhead Nazis should see this important work of art and think about the shame of it all.RATING: 10 of 10",9,1,2,13 April 1999
Man on the Moon," Andy, We Hardly Knew Ye...
","Andy Kaufman was an original, no doubt about it.  His biting, often strange humor infuriated people to the point of hating him.  Those who got the joke saw through it all and chuckled at how the butt of his antics (the audience) became annoyed and distraught .  Ultimately and sadly, the joke was on Kaufman himself.  MAN ON THE MOON arrives at this conclusion after a series of episodic Andy moments, most of which fans have seen over and over again throughout the years.You sure wish you could get to know this flawed man and what made his outlandish mind work.  As David Letterman once said, 'sometimes, you look at Andy, and you are not sure who is behind the wheel.'  You never do get a real sense of who he was in Milos Forman's strong, but nearsighted film.There are fabulous moments sprinkled throughout, however.  The first 5 minutes of the picture may have some of those same Andy haters leaving the theater, a further testament to his misunderstood humor.  Forman and his screenwriters have created a brilliant and ingenious method of beginning a Kaufman biopic.  Jim Carrey plays the erratic comedian masterfully in what is by far his best performance to date.  There are times when we see Carrey playing him as a goof off-stage, lying, demanding, and acting just flat out bizarre.  I ask myself whether or not this is the real thing.  Certainly, the many people involved in the production of the film (in particular Bob Zmuda and Danny DeVito) knew Kaufman well as a pro and a friend, but the joke may still be on us as far as finding out what he was really all about.Forman's direction and the screenplay basically play off the hopes that most audiences will be unfamiliar with Kaufman's work.  This is fine, however, there are times when a true fan can mimic what is happening on screen.  MAN ON THE MOON is merely a succession of scenes showcasing his talent, or lack of, leading to a mildly emotional climax.The question of whether or not Kaufman faked his own death is not really touched upon, but some subtle glimpses at film's end could keep you guessing.  R.E.M.'s classic tune fittingly ends what turns out to be a loving tribute to the guy.  Andy's antics did p*** a lot of people off. The film shows how he was able to create the illusion of what could be authentically unbelievable.  Were the wrestling injuries real?  Did Jerry Lawler really slap him on Letterman?  This is mostly left to your imagination for some time, but it is amusing to see who was in on some of the madness with him.The sickly humor of the piggish lounge singer 'Tony Clifton' creates some huge laughs.  Clifton was Zmuda and Kaufman's favorite creation.  I think Forman and company with the help of Andy's pals use the Clifton character, who was the alter ego of Kaufman you could say, to show the tragedy of his comedy and his untimely death.  Clifton was the ultimate Kaufman fake-out, but he was able to live on while Andy was only mortal.What a curious man he was and who better than Carrey to play him (I mean really, WHO better).  His performance is the glue that holds MAN ON THE MOON together, barely.  I just wish I got to know Andy Kaufman much more over the course of the 2 hour film.RATING: ***",8,2,4,27 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Monumental film never to be forgotten...
","Spielberg's 2nd masterpiece of war is a shocking and relentless epic that is a perfect blend of emotion and current film technology. There has never been a battle scene as brutally realized as the storming of Omaha Beach, and no other filmmaker has come anywhere remotely close to capturing the horrors of war. You find yourself forgetting where you are and who is even in this 'movie'. I say this meaning the film seems like a documentary, as well as a first hand account, exemplified in the compelling scenes where Hanks' Captain Miller sees everything in slow motion, blood splattering on him and all. The carnage is as close to war as anyone who has never been to war can get. Forget APOCALYPSE, forget THIN RED LINE, forget even PLATOON. This is it.Actors who have participated in the film say they cannot believe what is on the screen. Matt Damon is quoted as saying he forgot he was in the film while watching the final sequence. People will ask them forever what it was like to be in this picture. Veterans have sent their thanks to Spielberg and his crew for honoring them with this absolute classic. It will be studied forever in schools, grammar on up. It deserves every award it will receive and we all a owe debt to those who made such an important and awesome film that shows us the depths of the human condition, human collaboration, and human hell. Best Picture of the year, if not the decade. It will be universally immortalized.",10,0,0,2 March 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," This is what an Epic is supposed to be - absorbing AND audacious.
","There were all kinds of huge Hollywood productions in the 50' and 60's, beginning with 1952's THE ROBE.  Their common traits were that they were mostly biblical or Roman in theme, ran well over 3 hours, and were shot in CinemaScope or Super Panavision 70, both massive wide-screen processes. LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not biblical, nor is it an ancient Roman story.  It is a 20th Century account of one man's personal fight to change the face of history and third world politics.  It is far better than the films of the previous mold, because it is far more believable and timeless.  We may not learn much about T.E. Lawrence as a man, but his actions and incredible ambition tell us a lot.  The monumental look of the film does not overshadow our involvement in Lawrence's plight and we do care for this strange, intelligent little man who may have become a God to his Arab counterparts, and, to himself.David Lean is a great director, period.  This man takes his cast and crew to excruciating locales (BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI - jungle, LAWRENCE- the middle of one of the largest deserts in the world).  The desert, 'the anvil of the earth' states Omar Sharif as Ali,  is as much a character in the flick as any actor.  This is not a criticism.  You will NEVER see such rigorous performances in the most horrific of earthly conditions.  Lean and co. spent over 2 years out there making this amazing picture and it shows. Peter O'Toole's appears to grow older and wiser as the film moves along (and it moves along at a refreshingly fast pace for a 4 hour epic).  He is perfectly cast to play a mysterious historical figure, a man who was reportedly gay, a topic that could not be tackled on-screen at the time. There are 2 hints I found, however.  See if you can find them, especially in one scene with Jack Hawkins.  His mission to observe the Arabian efforts during WWI turn aggressive, until it eventually consumes his very being. This is personal to Lawrence.  He becomes Lawrence of Arabia because he wants his place in history and he wants to 'give these people their freedom'.  We, in essence, are no longer observers, but become entrenched with Lawrence's fight.The mind-boggling cinematography is so rich and dry, we feel like getting a drink whenever possible.  The night-time shots are as awe-inspiring as the day shots.  The blowing sand over the rigid desert suggests the winds of change about to happen in Saudi Arabia.  The first half of  picture is a bit slower than the second, but my favorite sequence occurs.  Lawrence, against all human odds, goes back to the heart of the desert to save 'Gasim', risking all he is fighting for, as well as his own life. He teaches the Arabs that nothing is 'written', and Lawrence truly wrote his own history almost single-handedly.  Later, he has an unexpected, yet necessary duty, to perform with the very man he saved.  The blinding sun shots and look of the actors in these conditions contribute to the realism of the picture.Serious film buffs must see LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, because of its influential importance.  Steven Spielberg claims to watch it before he starts every new project.  It is all over RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The sheer grandness of its look and feel will change your cinematic values.  It demands viewing because it is the cinema in its purest form.NOTE: This is another wide-screen format must.  It is not even worth seeing without it.  Lawrence's victorious trot across the wrecked train, probably the most celebrated sequence, cannot even be seen in its proper perspective in pan and scan.",10,1,4,20 March 1999
Ghostbusters," Film Has Endured the 80's and Stayed Sharp Through the 90's
","Bill Murray is one of the best wise guys in the business.  I was amazed to find out on the GHOSTBUSTERS 15th Anniversary DVD that Murray had little to do with the dialogue his classicly blase, fiercely cynical 'Dr. Venkman' cuts loose throughout this good comedy.  Credit Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis with 'getting into Bill's mind' as Ramis puts it and presenting Murray with a gag-a-second character.  Murray also lends his own comic genius through his delivery and facial gestures (especially with his classic cross-eyed, curled-lip look).  Together with a fun premise and above average special effects, GHOSTBUSTERS will never be a relic of the 80's and should always be a refreshingly humorous spook show.Murray rules the screen, mauling his geeky para-psychologist partners and hitting on a young blonde while conducting shock therapy experiments on her. Aykroyd uses his standard machine gun delivery of obscure (or should I say made up) facts and anecdotes and Ramis is just enough for the ultra-dork 'Egon'.  The funniest element in GHOSTBUSTERS happens to be Rick Moranis in a splendid role as a small-time accountant who has parties for clients only and becomes mixed up in some extremely supernatural events.  Along with Sigourney Weaver, Moranis has the most difficult physical tasks to topple.This was a picture I loved when I was a kid.  I must have went some 12 to 15 years before I saw it again and I was alarmingly impressed.  It has endured. The special effects are not only good, but they are comedic and add even more laughs throughout the 'Busters turbulent jobs.  The DVD version has tons of goodies included and is an essential addition to any Saturday Night Live fan's movie library.  SNL is the very essence and reason for GHOSTBUSTERS, where Murray and Aykroyd starred.  Director Ivan Reitman created his meal ticket here and can pretty much do any comedy he wants now. It is a shame John Belushi was not around to play one of the 'Busters, for he was originally cast.  The movie is already well-paced and engaging so just imagine how frenzied the pace would have been with Belushi. Regardless, GHOSTBUSTERS is one for the kids, teens, and adults alike.  It has spanned these phases for me and still works wonderfully.

The Longest Day," Allow Yourself A Long Day To See This All-Star War Pic...
","Darryl F. Zanuck's THE LONGEST DAY is indeed long, has over 48 international stars, 3 directors, and took about 2 years to make.  1962 was the year of the epic as far as the 1960's were concerned and this exceptional film is no exception.  No cost was spared.  Some good war sequences mixed with stock footage of WWII effectively present a version of D-Day, June of 1944.  We see it from the German perspective (in sub-titles), the American plight, and the rest of the Allied forces.  One problem:  If you are seeing the film for the first time AFTER watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, you may come out disappointed.  The war scenes are well-crafted, however, the piercing reality is missing.  I tried to watch it as objectively as I could, but it is hard, considering the impression Spielberg's version of D-Day left on me.The soldiers are led by a variety of huge name actors.  John Wayne is a no-holds-barred Captain who will fight, broken foot or not.  Henry Fonda plays Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. looking not to be treated as the son of an ex-president.   Bob Mitchum is great as a cigar-smoking officer of the U.S. raid on Omaha Beach.  The only problem is authenticity.  The actors look good and realisticly war-like, however, they are kept in frame to showcase their talents and they never seem to be near death.  This is by no means an anti-war film like RYAN.  It can be harrowing at times, but watching Richard Burton, Sean Connery, and Rod Steiger deliver cameo-like performances (meaning they know they are only on-screen for a short time) was a bit contrived and distracting.Overall, I did like the movie.  It is greatly detailed and it lets you know exactly who each actor is playing.  This is pure American propaganda, but it is still exciting.  Too many fearful war experiences are handled with kid gloves.  The grand spectacle of the top-notch production values as well as non-stop action  make the picture watchable, if only once.RATING: 7 of 10",7,75,114,12 April 1999
La Grande Illusion," A Vision of Reality the Way it Shouldn't Be...
","It is a wonder to see a film from the 1930's so definite in its view and opinions, yet so touching and revelatory.  Jean Renoir's GRAND ILLUSION is a film of great importance, one that improves with each viewing.  Having just finished the picture again for the first time in some 7 years, I was struck by its freshness.  It is an Anti-War film set during World War I that is something to watch.  It demands intense viewing.This is a French work of art by the great Renoir, who would make his most acclaimed film, RULES OF THE GAME, two years later.  If you ask me, GRAND ILLUSION is the superior pic and holds up immeasurably better.  The small doses of humor and original characters in this film foresee the classic 'shooting party' of RULES OF THE GAME.  With this movie, Renoir uses prisoners-of-war and the ludicrous element of war so prevalent in early 20th Century Europe and merges them into a film not unlike a play (an extremely well-written play).  The viewer has no illusions as to whether or not a war is happening.  We happen not to see any battles or gunplay, rather, the human element between men and women who are not so different no matter their ethnicity.Renoir's camera is an incredible tool used throughout.  He probes the characters at the various prison camps with some smooth dolly shots and brilliant use of focus and pull-backs.  It seems like an extension of his hand, much like his father's paintings.  One striking scene has some weary soldiers singing the French 'Las Marseilles' after getting third hand knowledge of a French victory over their German captors.  Any scene with Erich von Stroheim is interesting because he is human and not some mindless German dictator so many people would come to know at the time of the film's release.  He is a broken man, scarred by war and looking to gain a friend in the enemy.  This is rare.As far as prison camp films go, these guys seem to have it easy, however the fact that they are officers gives us some explanation.  The story-line effectively moves from escape attempts to human realization of the situation they are in.  Parts of it reminded me of STALAG 17, Billy Wilder's 1953 classic no doubt inspired by GRAND ILLUSION.  This is Wilder's film without the Hollywood touch, realist and sometimes drab.  Abel Gance's J'ACCUSE would follow a year later.  If you want to see some anti-WWI films with two completely opposite methods of warning beneath the surface, see these two flicks back to back.The illusion of reality is shattered by war, Renoir is telling us.  If only it could be as simple as those amazing shots of the countryside from inside the German woman's house: a breathtaking, simple look at a peaceful scene the way it should be.RATING: ***1/2",Null,36,45,20 August 1999
Pi," Mathematics + Religion x 3.14 = Avant-Garde Classic.
","Pi is one insane film.  I thought college algebra was tough and thank God there are crazy mathematical wizards like Max (Sean Gullette) to take care of digits and theorems that mean nothing to the common man.  This is not really the point of Pi, an artistic masterwork made on a $60,000 budget, meant to put the viewer through a paranoid nightmare.I was reminded of films made in the same vein like Welles' THE TRIAL, or Soderbergh's KAFKA, both black and white films with a frenetic pace and distorted narrative.  Pi is hypnotic filmmaking not meant for all tastes (by any means) and it is a wonder how writer-director Darren Aronofsky got any kind of financial backing.  His relatives probably did not see the picture until it was in the can or they may have pulled out.  This is not a knock. I found the film to be a true work of genius in an avant-garde manner, something you don't see much in American cinema these days.Here is a film that exists entirely within the main character's state of mind.  He is a math freak whose passion, or should I say obsession, is killing him literally.  To top it off, some sinister people from a religious cult want some answers through numbers and some Wall Street people are out for blood and money.  Forget plot, forget character, forget narrative. This film is a nightmare in structure and appearance.  I would not have been surprised to find the action took place in some netherworld.Why see Pi?  I guess the same reason we had to learn some of this mathematical crap in high school.  There are no redeeming qualities or any revelations made.  Just some grainy, often stunning black and white images and situations that knocks the wind out of you.  If you see it, don't look to deep for any religious or scientific symbolism, at least on first viewing.  Pi will absorb you whether you hate it or not.  This is a very ambitious outing from first-time filmmakers Aronofsky and Gullette and I give them much credit for creating a work of art I've never seen the likes of before.RATING: UNCLASSIFIABLY Good",7,6,9,22 June 1999
Annie Hall," Woody's 1st Serious Artistic Achievement Mainly Because of Diane Keaton.
","Until 1977, Woody Allen films were mostly screwball comedies.  Pictures like BANANAS and EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX... were episodic comedies, films that seemed more like short television sitcoms along the Monty Python vein. He finally reached his full potential with what seems to be everyone's favorite Woody picture, ANNIE HALL.  It is without a doubt one of his better films and foresaw a lot of the narrative techniques and content you can see in his great films of the past decade.  This is Woody playing himself, more or less, for the first time, but it is Diane Keaton as the title character who steals the show in a heartwarming performance that won her an Academy Award.Woody plays comedian 'Alvy Singer', a comedian who hates anything that is not New York and who cannot seem to function outside of it.  He is constantly bickering to best friend Tony Roberts about New York being considered a target for anti-semitism.  He is, for the first time in his long filmography, playing himself, a self-hating Jew who has broken relationships with women.  He even talks directly to the camera describing his paranoid self in the movie's first shot.  After some brief intercutting of failed marriage footage, 'Alvy' meets the peculiar, but sensual 'Annie Hall' from Wisconsin.At this point in ANNIE HALL, the film goes back and forth in time revealing the peaks and valleys of this sweet romance.  'Annie' is a lonely girl, plain-looking, but with a quality Woody and the audience can't quite put a finger on.  She grows more and more lovable as the story of these complete opposites evolves.  It is still hard to figure out what makes Annie so delightful to the eyes and the mind.  She is simple and endearing, which makes her more attractive to you as you watch.  It is great acting by Keaton, who is so original in her choice of wardrobe and mannerisms (especially her need to relieve tension a certain way).The film contains Woody standards like his fear of driving, his fear of bugs, or things that move in the dark ('you have a bug the size of a Buick in there'), and his mockery of Los Angeles.  The scenes in L.A. are some of the funniest I've seen in all of Allen's films especially the physical condition that besets him as soon as he gets off the plane.  'Alvy', like Woody, is always writing something too.ANNIE HALL is not my favorite Allen film.  That honor goes hands down to MANHATTAN, made just 2 years later.  Keaton has a major role in that flick, as an intellectual 'Annie' you could say. His great films of the 90's MIGHTY APHRODITE and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY are direct descendants of ANNIE HALL because of the overlapping narrative, Woody's talking to the audience or to imaginary people, and adorable love interests.The one thing true of this film is that it is his warmest in regard to New York relationships and that is made completely possible because of Diane Keaton.  'La-di-da, La-di-da,' became as familiar to the American vernacular as 'Yada-Yada' has in recent years to Seinfeld fanatics.  ANNIE HALL is complex in structure, yet deceptively simple and entered Woody into the big leagues of artistic filmmaking.RATING: ***1/2",10,3,5,27 January 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Tribute to one of the top 5 filmmakers of our time...
","I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.",10,375,606,7 March 1999
Singin' in the Rain," A Celebration of Moving Pictures, via the Musical...
","It is amazing how a movie such as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN can hit all the right notes, epitomize a genre, and paint an important picture of the most innovative of times in Hollywood: the evolution of silent films to talking ones.  There are 'films' and there are 'movies', as George Lucas likes to say.  This is a 'movie',  a popcorn movie, that is filled frame by frame with fabulous performances, beautiful technicolor, and period songs that will be remembered forever.  Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, also its star, this movie musical was made on the coattails of Kelly's previous hit, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, which won best picture of 1951.  It was only meant to capitalize on that heavily honored favorite.  Not only did it capitalize, it transcended all expectations and has become one of America's most loved and important works of art.The main trio of actors, Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and a young and cute Debbie Reynolds, are perfectly cast in what is really a perfect 'movie'.  Their characters work for Monumental Pictures, actually MGM, and the studio boss is 'L. F. Simpson', representing MGM boss L. B. Mayer.  Silents rule the silver screen, but, this is 1927, and Warner Bros. has released THE JAZZ SINGER, the first ever talking picture.  It becomes the craze and 'Simpson' wants to jump onto the bandwagon of sound as soon as possible.  With this premise, we see how studios changed gears and utilized the new 'talkie' technology. One problem: many of the actors and actresses looked great but did not sound fit for the new regime.  Jean Hagen symbolizes the countless actors who lost their jobs because of the new technology.  She can't sing a lick and is as dumb as a brick. (Her voice reminded me of 'Susan Alexander's' from CITIZEN KANE)  Dialogue coaches are brought in and the studio system is revolutionized.  Not without some hilarious screenings of poorly synched sound pictures that almost has Kelly's career disappearing.The musical numbers brilliantly relay the movie's story of loss and change, but there is never a sour note.  Two sequences stand out.  Kelly twirling in the rain, of course, and O'Connor's Chaplin-esque turn in a stunning virtuoso mix of dance and slapstick during 'Make 'em Laugh'.  Watch this sequence over and over.  You will not believe your eyes.  The grand 'Broadway Ballet' scene is wonderful at giving us Busby Berkeley-type choreography and Technicolor illuminates the fake facades of a skeleton-like stage of New York City.  The switch from silence to sound is quietly told by the song and dance.  The writers even managed to get quite a few rips on the industry as a whole, especially the false relationships presented to the tabloid journalists to boost image.  This is ironic considering Louis B. Mayer condemned director Billy Wilder for his dark and bitter take on Hollywood just 2 years before in SUNSET BOULEVARD.Don't miss SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  It ranks alongside the greatest ever made for a reason.  See for yourself (and crank up the sound and color) !",10,1,4,18 March 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Never Before Has A Film's Title Summed Up Its Message So Well...
","Life really is beautiful and so is this magnificent film from Italy's version of Charlie Chaplin, Roberto Benigni.  Writer, producer, director, and star (along with Best Actor honors) Roberto has finally crossed over to mainstream America after so many years of making foreign filmgoers laugh. The first half of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is an exercise in lightening-quick humor set during the onset of WWII.  There is barely an indication of the horror that is to come.  Some subtle hints are dropped here and there. 'Guido', played by Benigni, is half-Italian, half-Jewish and is a waiter.  A bunch of wonderfully chance meetings between Guido and 'Dora' (played by Nicoletta Braschi) are incredibly romantic and well-done.  Dora is Guido's PRINCESS and is the light of his suddenly new life.LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL does not step wrong, but if you are looking for complete accuracy regarding the Holocaust, this is not where to look.  The sheer elegance and comic magic with which the movie is told leaves the brutal elements of the Holocaust to our imagination.  This is not to say there are NO direct references to it.  We do see a pile of corpses and tons of screaming Nazis, but we really do not need to see them.  Benigni reveals the horrors of the time through his relationship with his son, 'Giosue' (played perfectly by young Giorgio Cantarini).  Not only does Benigni hide the atrocities from us, but also his son, who thinks it is all a game.  What else can you tell a young boy to keep his spirits up?Even during the camp sequences, Benigni is able to present funny things right in the middle of the biggest tragedy of the 20th Century.  He mimicks Germans, he relays messages his own way (great scene), and tries to win that tank for his son.  It is poignant and hilarious at the same time.  Anyone who questions Benigni's performance without first seeing it should watch for the brilliant way he plays his character while NOT in the presence of his son.  He just wants to hide it all from him, but when with the other prisoners, he is just as clueless, overworked, and distraught as the rest of them.  This is important in pulling this miracle of a picture off.  Who would have expected the Holocaust and biting, sometimes satirical humor to blend into a perfect film? The first half alone would've been good enough for me. It is gorgeous-looking and warm.  The subtitles will not bother non-foreign film fans (Just have a quick eye).  In fact, you could see it without the translation and take away the same feeling in my opinion.  Benigni is telling us not to take life for granted and that the ultimate sacrifice may be necessary to keep life beautiful.  See this film no matter what.RATING: 10 of 10",9,2,4,12 April 1999
Rocky," Just Going the Distance is Enough to Make You Somebody...
","Rocky Balboa has become a cultural icon. Stories like ROCKY have been told and re-told time and time again. Rags-to-riches, hero gets the girl, etc., right? Yes, but the way ROCKY is told puts one of my all time favorites many Art Museum steps above the rest. Sylvester Stallone was actually an actor back in the seventies and quite a writer. His raw emotion and presence on-screen makes 'Rocky Balboa' real and original. The film ironically parallels Stallone's now legendary struggle to get it made his way. Could you imagine Burt Reynolds as 'Rocky'? Me neither. Stallone turned down a lot of money to just take a writing credit but he fought his way to the top and revolutionized the actor-screenwriter dimension of film-making.ROCKY is as predictable as tic-tac-toe. Who cares? The music, the setting, the characters, and the fight make it the American classic it is. 'Philadelphia's favorite son' goes through what no fighter in professional boxing could ever possibly imagine. (What world champ would pick a challenger out of a book because of his name?) Director John G. Avildsen puts the exclamation point on Sly's screenplay by isolating the characters and showing their depressingly small world on the dank streets of South Philly. Each performance, especially Burt Young's, is unique. Stallone's yelling match with 'Mickey'(Burgess Meredith), his long-time, 'broken-down pug' trainer is as powerful as anything Brando did in ON THE WATERFRONT. The movie draws from its cinematic ancestors well. The likes of BODY AND SOUL and SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME are oh so present throughout.Notice the similarity between Carl Weathers as 'Apollo Creed' and Muhammad Ali. Pretty close aren't they? This is not accidental. Stallone supposedly saw a fight between Ali and the latest great white hope of the 70's named Chuck Wepner. The two went the distance in 1974 and Stallone immediately had an idea. Several typewriters and notebooks later, he had a story no one wanted to produce. This is the essence of the parallel between art and reality. Stallone became a name and a superstar because of his spirit and fight. He reflects it all rather well in ROCKY.Boxing is a great sport to make a film about and the most important aspect may be the fight scenes. Of the 5 ROCKY films, the original has the most realistic fight. Stallone, who even choreographed the boxing scenes, has a great feel for the sport and its inner workings, all very essential. The training sequence provides enough motivation for any couch potato watching to get off his or her butt and get in shape. Turn your tube up and hold back the tears as ROCKY fights for his girl, his city, and his name.RATING: 10 OF 10",10,2,2,28 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," 1999: A Sex Odyssey
","As long as you don't buy into the hype that surrounds pictures like EYES WIDE SHUT, you can watch without prejudice and assess what you are seeing more precisely.  Let me say that Stanley Kubrick's final film is a psychological and visual masterpiece.  The ridiculous media hype generated by the famed director's meticulous filmmaking methods and the film's allegedly 'pornographic' style with stars such as Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman is flat out sad.  It is an extremely GOOD film with some truly GREAT moments.  Kubrick's swan song is his best work since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in 1971.Short-attention span viewers beware:  Stay Away!  Go see ARLINGTON ROAD if you want generic, meaningless entertainment.  Smart, discerning moviegoers with an eye for art and unique cinema must, and probably will, see EYES WIDE SHUT.  This is an engaging and excrutiatingly candid look at sexual obsession and jealousy within a man's mind and heart.  Sex is what human beings, specifically males, think of most.  What an exploration into a few days in the life of a jealous husband who falls into some strange and disturbing sexual situations.Is the film soft-core porn?  Absolutely not.  The sex scenes are very mild in accordance to what has been reported through both rumors and initial reviews.  Is the film about sex and only sex?  In a way, yes.  Sex involves passion and love, jealousy, and danger.  These 4 elements are tied together with such disturbing subtlety, quite frankly I was spellbound.  Sex also involves temptation and aftermath, which is also pertinent to the rather linear story.  Kubrick and company do not go over the top.  They merely present to us a dangerous nightmare maybe not entirely unlike the Kidman character's sexual dream and revelation.EYES WIDE SHUT is long, but seems bitterly quick and I couldn't help but shake my head in amazement at the people who walked out on such a superlative piece of work.  This is not a commercial Cruise-Kidman film (thankfully).  Marketing has made it appear to be one.  It is a labor of love that will always be looked at through a microscope.The performances are good and I think Kidman may be underused here.  There are some brief moments when the Cruise character reminds you of 'Mitch McDeere' of THE FIRM  and will figure it all out, but Kubrick fans will know better.  The sinister two-note piano key played throughout the movie goes so well within the foreign New York atmosphere (it was all shot in England) and so many of the great director's trademarks emerge (a bathroom scene, steadicam shots, extraordinary set decoration, gloomy lighting).  The title is a nifty way of naming a film the TV networks would call 'The Misadventures of Dr. Bill'.  They truly are misadventures, but a motive is there.Do yourself a favor and see Stanley Kubrick's farewell stamp to his legendary career.  It is by all means a thriller, with dark thoughts, sexual double-crossing, kinky parties, and all that Kubrickian stuff that never fails to leave you in awe.RATING: ****",10,1,1,20 July 1999
The Untouchables," Flashy Period Yarn Unable To Touch On A Historical or Emotional Level...
","This huge production has been called a 're-evaluation' of the lame TV series and according to the end credits, it is fictitious.  Sure, there was an Eliot Ness, but history tells us he was not the reserved man Costner plays him to be.  History also tells us Capone did not fall this way.  Anyway, THE UNTOUCHABLES is brainless entertainment, a film that looks and sounds great, but doesn't have any emotional payoff to look forward to.  There are no glaring declarations of victory over Capone because prohibition was soon to be gone and De Palma and co. throw a last line from Ness at us to make everything okay.  Check your intellect at the door and just accept this for what it is.  A pulsating, slick vehicle for some big stars with an outstanding performance from Sean Connery.UNTOUCHABLES has the De Palma touch: slow-motion scenes, crooked frames, and some fine overhead shots.  Robert De Niro is merely a walk-on as Capone. His opening scene is great, however, his performance is nothing more than a brief blend of his other gangster roles with lines like: 'I want 'em DEAD! You hear me, I want 'em DEAD!'  It is almost self-parody.  Costner assembles 'the untouchables' through a chance meeting with tough Irishman Connery (who won an Oscar), a completely lifeless Andy Garcia (not his fault - the writers gave him nothing), and an accountant played by dopey Charles Martin Smith who has no problem grabbing a sawed-off shot gun and raiding a liquor deal without hesitation.  Costner is his usual dull self, but Connery is no doubt worth watching.  In fact, he holds the film together, barely.There are some brutal scenes, but the standout is the now famous 'Odessa-step' sequence in the train station.  Rewind and watch a couple of times and you see a prime example of great choreography, set-up, and editing.  It is an outrageous and impossible sequence, but it is visually rousing.  (Look for a deadpan spoof of this scene in NAKED GUN 331/3)  The scene, of course, is inspired by the revolutionary step romp in the classic Russian silent BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN.  Credit must be given to the set designers who have replicated Chicago, 1930.  It is a great looking picture, almost comic-book style.  De Palma is a master of technical design and overblown Hitchcockian filmmaking which sometimes takes away from the actor's ability to perform.  They are often overshadowed by the grandeur of it all.I am being very critical because I expected a lot more.  It is worth witnessing, especially in its wide-screen format.  You never get the sense that anything plausible is happening and Costner does not have the presence here to carry it all.  Thank the makers for thinking of Connery.RATING: 6 of 10",6,8,20,8 April 1999
Psycho," A Perfect Film.
","Perfect films are few and far between and the filmmakers usually have no inkling as to the top-notch quality of work they are doing.  Alfred Hitchcock thought it was a good idea to make a new kind of suspense picture back in 1959.  Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order, but bigger bumps must have been the goal.  Hitch had to use his TV crew (from his network series 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents...' because many film executives didn't like the material.  Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented.  At the time, PSYCHO was a nasty-spirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers.  It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless rip-offs.PSYCHO is perfect because: 1) It is in black and white, not blazing technicolor which would have stained the film for no purpose and made the shower murder less artistic. (Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.)2)The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting.  (Hitch made strict stipulations for theatre owners not to allow people into the movie once the picture started in order for this secret to stay secret.)3)Lesser known actors are used to provide a more authentic feel for the characters.  This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins, not exactly a Cary Grant, who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused son/mental madman. (Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)4) The shower scene, of course.  Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the 'old house on the hill' and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it.  (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror.  (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly.  (Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together, none better than this.)Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time?  I don't think so.  Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.RATING: 10+",10,98,153,28 June 1999
Rosemary's Baby," Acclaimed, yet underrated urban horror...
","If there is one talent Roman Polanski has, it is creating confusion on-screen.  'Chinatown' is littered with moments where you're not at all sure what is what or who is who.  'Rosemary's Baby', his first major American work, is a masterpiece of gothic horror primarily because of the confusion the lead character faces throughout.  Are her neighbors witches?  Could her doctor be evil?  Is her husband a part of it? Even though we pretty much know these answers ourselves, the web of intrigue created by Polanski, and Farrow's convincing performance, makes everything that happens seem all the more creepy.Based on Ira Levin's bestseller, the film no doubt exceeds the novel.  There are no ghosts, poltergeists, or possessions.  Just the overwhelming presence of evil in the Dakota apartments where Farrow, with her husband played by John Cassavettes,  live in what should be a safe-haven.  Farrow has nowhere or no one to go to in the biggest of cities.The rape scene is one of the most spellbindingly scary scenes ever done.  We never do see the creature in full view or on top of Farrow, we only see the eyes.  They say it all.  Most horror films would use a quick long shot for a scene like this.  The sequence is very much like a nightmare Farrow believes she only had.  The scenes shot in the huge entrance to the Dakotas are accidently eerie because we know this is the exact spot where John Lennon would be murdered within 12 years.One final note:  According to Roger Ebert, the voice of the blinded actor on the phone with Mia is that of Tony Curtis.",10,0,1,19 February 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," Wonderful Social Classic That Echoes Issues of Its Day...
","TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, '6 and a half feet big' legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused 'negro' on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10",9,200,234,30 March 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Poetic - Powerful - Simple: The Greatness of Cuckoo's Nest.
","The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak  glance at an Oregon morning.  Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches.  Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.   'Randle McMurphy' is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as 'McMurphy', is something of a paradox.  Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be?  That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.Milos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later.  It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds.  Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax.  Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me.  You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward.  The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson has his greatest moments in this picture.  One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV.  It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity.  'McMurphy' immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the 'normal routine'.  He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a 'date'.  Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as 'Nurse Mildred Ratched'.  She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win.  Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional.  That's perfect because that is exactly who she is.  Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited 'McMurphy' in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated.  Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused.  He seems to love his compadres in the hospital.  He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST.  The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the 'Chief' is great as Nicholson's right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on.  The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning. NOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version.  Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.  They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling.",10,328,397,22 January 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Coppola's commercial classic...
","While Bram Stoker's Dracula was being made, the press made a lot of stink regarding this as Coppola's 'Cape Fear', referring to Scorsese's big-budget remake of the original of 1962.  Scorsese did a commendable update of that flick, but Coppola, a director known for his eccentricity and innovation, has taken an old myth and turned it upside down.  I've never seen such visual effects, creating an expressionistic mood that would make F.W. Murnau (director of 1922's silent Nosferatu) proud.  This is German Expressionism and Dali mixed together in color. On top of its visual power is the treatment of the Dracula story, remaining very faithful to Stoker's vision.Gary Oldman turns in his best performance to date, both terrifying and compassionate, and is the most frightening Count since Max Schreck donned the Dracula gear back in the 1922 original.  He takes on forms past filmmakers could only dream of putting on film.  Obviously, the chemistry between Winona Ryder & Oldman is there.  Hopkins is solid as always playing Professor Van Helsing, who has a few supernatural tricks of his own.  Of course, Keanu Reeves is as solid as a piece of plywood, but that's another story.It's the visuals and effects that really put an auteur's mark on the picture. You can tell a lot of money was spent, but Coppola utilizes every penny (something he has failed to do in some past films i.e. One From the Heart, Rumble Fish).  We see some seriously disturbing images such as eyes in the sky and a stairwell in the Count's castle that seems to go beyond the infinite underneath.  What a movie.  This is a must see for all film fans and a reminder that Francis Ford Coppola has and always will be one of the best directors of all-time.  Just sit back and let the film assault your senses.",10,17,24,7 January 1999
The Green Mile," Spiritually Uplifting, Yet Overall, A Green Bore...
","This highly anticipated film from writer-director Frank Darabont touches on so many aspects of human nature and of human feelings that it cannot satisfy on every level.  THE GREEN MILE is a long film, a film that you realize is long.  This is not good.  Darabont, director of the great SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, thankfully does not try to reenact that picture here.  This is like SHAWSHANK turned inside out.  The guards at the Louisiana State prison are 'nice' (with the exception of one), and the hero (the incredibly impressive Michael Clarke Duncan) 'John Coffey' is original like Tim Robbins in SHAWSHANK, but not as resourceful.  He does, however, have an incredible gift that is the backbone for how the audience will feel about him and the predicament he is placed in for the next 3 hours.The film is simply overkill and tries to dabble in too many different notions of the human condition within these prison walls.  It was done so much more precisely in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION that you can hardly believe the same guy made the two movies.  GREEN MILE would have been better off staying almost entirely on the relationship between Tom Hanks and Duncan, which is really all you will care about.  The performances are all good, but too many characters are introduced and the inevitable is very clearly seen early on. You pretty much know what will happen to each character based on the simple Hollywood variations on good guys and bad guys.  Duncan, who plays the massive African-American man accused of rape and murder and sentenced to spend his last days on the 'green mile', the cell block which leads to the electric chair, is quite a find.  He is sure to get Oscar notoriety and deservedly so.  He reminded me a bit of Brock Peters from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, who was in a very similar situation.  The two performances combined paint one of the ultimate portrayals on film of racial injustice in this country, especially in the 1930's.  The film eventually dips into the supernatural quite impressively and surprisingly, but it is marred by the frequent attempts at humor and the sometimes annoying sub-plots.  See for yourself and decide whether or not you would have edited it differently.Long pauses and drawn out characterizations are a drain on the viewer's senses as you watch.  There is a gruesome execution scene that quite frankly indents the moral hypocrisy that is the electric chair, into the mind's eye. The scene is shot with such force and brutality, it is hard to watch.  This brings up the point of the film's muddled message about the wrongs of capital punishment.  Are the guards really against it, or is it just when they have grown close to a prisoner when they don't like it?  Again, decide for yourself.I was disappointed by THE GREEN MILE.  It will no doubt garner a lot of award attention wrongfully.  Frank Darabont loves making films about prison but maybe he has swung just one too many times at that ball.  At times while watching the flick, I thought I should 'get busy living, or get busy dying,' as said 'Red' in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  The movie is that boring and that drawn out.  There are exceptional moments (like the tie-in to the year 1935 and the film TOP HAT), but finally, you must have some more passion and more life on the screen for such a story to really work.Rating: **1/2",5,1,3,12 December 1999
The Waterboy," You pray for the WaterBoy to drown in this pathetic loser...
","THE WATERBOY is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made, plain and simple.  I can't even say that it was a waste of money because it was a huge hit.  Sandler and his cronies have actually stolen our money with this mindless piece of crap.  I know critics are rough on Sandler's films. WEDDING SINGER was actually a good flick that poked fun at the 1980's and why not?  The 80's are an open wound that WEDDING SINGER exposed with hilarity.  It even developed a half-decent love story with the help of Drew Barrymore.  What the hell happened with this?  Did they think this was funny while they were making it or was it in post-production when they realized that it sucked?  Sandler is too talented to think this was any good.  The public bought it.  Why?  We'll never know.I saw it on video, so thank God I did not pay $7.50 for a theater run. After watching it, I didn't even want it in the house overnight.  Sandler and his funny buddies, who get paid handsomely to make this garbage, go after the deep south for laughs.  You get the impression that every person in cajun Louisiana is dirty and stupid.  They can't be any dumber than the writers of this dud.  The filmmakers, and I use this term loosely, have no knowledge of the sport of football.  It is absolutely painful to sit through.I know some people will read this and say I am too analytical or that I did not 'suspend my disbelief' enough to enjoy this debacle.  Get real. 'Bobby Bouche' is boring, and a good ending would've been for him to drown in the Gulf of Mexico with a football in his mouth.   (-1 of 10)",1,8,17,22 March 1999
Platoon," Hands down the best film about the Vietnam War...
","The big question about the Vietnam war is this: What were we doing over there? Thousands of young men died for no apparent reason. Oliver Stone makes no direct attempt to answer this question. Every bit of the movie's action takes place in the jungles of Vietnam around 1967 and 1968. However, the horror and madness we see on screen leaves you with a sad feeling in your heart and we realize we absolutely did not belong there, fighting amidst a civil war within a peasant country we knew nothing about. Stone himself fought in the war and this was his experience, with Charlie Sheen playing his alter ego. As Sheen says during the closing narration, 'we didn't fight the enemy, we fought ourselves.'Many people have drawn comparisons between PLATOON and Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, a spectacular film in its own right. These are two distinctly different visions of the war, PLATOON being a gritty, documentary-like version with APOCALYPSE the surreal, fictionalized account. PLATOON is the better war film because of its honest, in-your-face style. Stone utilized hand-held cameras to capture combat in a way never seen before. We get to know the characters of this platoon and how 'civil wars' probably broke out within American units themselves. There are no tricky shots, nor do we see any glamorization of war, as seen in such films as THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. This is not an artistic depiction of Vietnam like APOCALYPSE NOW. It is bloody realism shown in quite graphic detail, the way it may have been, based on Stone's own experiences.The supporting cast is superb, painting a non-stereotypical portrait of tragic characters. Of course, Tom Berenger's 'Barnes' and Willem Dafoe's 'Elias', are symbolic of the good and evil that most likely existed within some units. These two characters are essential to the inner struggles going on in Sheen's 'Chris'. The battle scenes are shot in such a way that we are put right in the middle of the action, seeing what the soldiers saw. It is nearly impossible to know where the enemy is and who you are shooting at, and there is a frightening scene involving Sheen as the platoon's lookout, who is paralyzed with fear, unable to act while the enemy creeps upon them. The madness of the war is more emotionally powerful than in APOCALYPSE because we are closer to these events and there are virtually no breaks in intensity.I ask anyone who disagrees with my assessment regarding this film and APOCALYPSE to watch both back to back. Anti-war films are at their best when we are moved emotionally, and I assure you will be more wiped out after PLATOON. Again, APOCALYPSE is a great movie, however, do you really care about a fictional mission up a river to kill an insane American? You be the judge. PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN are the two most emotionally shattering and best anti-war films.",10,1,1,17 January 1999
Paths of Glory," Madness, Cowardice, Glory - War in a Nutshell Kubrick Style...
","There is no glory in Stanley Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY, a devastating anti-war film that looks at the Generals who command soldiers as cowards themselves.  How dare these pampered men who will leave the war without a scratch practically order their soldier's slaughter?  This is the conflict posed by Kubrick with the help of Kirk Douglas, who quite frankly is mesmerizing as the Colonel of the 701st Division ordered to take an anthill they probably have no chance of taking.  Adolphe Menjou is the sadistic General who Douglas must fight for the right of his soldiers' souls as well as his own.  We are able to take an introverted look at the madness of war. Cowardice is frowned upon by governments, but how do you decide what it is in such inhuman conditions.Kubrick shows his talents as a master of atmosphere and looming death in this classic of WWI.  The French are the symbol and a possible execution is the tool with which Kubrick stirs our emotions.  Unlike his later films, we have some pretty realistic characters here.  Douglas is the only man with a head on his shoulders and is so passionate about the cruel injustice proposed by the spiteful General he seems willing to die himself. The court scene contains some of the movie's most memorable emotional moments, but check out the 1957 war sequence.  Kubrick had a definite vision as to how he was going to pull this off.  Shot in Germany, the French soldiers go through a frightening, revolutionary experience.  Deep explosions pulsate the soundtrack, soldiers are blown to bits, and cowardice is nowhere to be found.  The mere possibility of a soldier's 'recollections' under such hellish conditions cannot be taken as gospel.The attempt on the German anthill is truly something to see, another feather on the cap of Kubrick, who would create the most amazing boot-camp sequence in film history roughly 30 years later in FULL METAL JACKET.  Compared to that film, PATHS OF GLORY is much more effective at portraying a precise vision of the abomination of war.  Whether its the French, or the Russians, it is all the same.  Worthless when unnecessary, tragic when waged.  Ralph Meeker is great as one of the Corporals on trial for 'cowardice' in the face of the enemy.  At one point, he asks a priest to leave him alone and basically betrays the thought of God in the face of what he is going through.  Pretty deep stuff, I must say.

","Stephen King's short novel CARRIE, was a decent book, not exactly scary, not really well-written.  Brian De Palma's CARRIE is an exercise in terror.  You can look past the religious symbolism thrown at you whenever Piper Laurie is on-sceen (she was up for a best supporting Oscar)  Just when you think you have it bad, you see a brutally mis-treated Carrie White.  Her mother is a religious zealot, tossing her in a closet to pray.  She is mauled at school by the immature (and grossly out-dated) teens in the picture.  Ah, but she has a gift: telekinesis!  Perfect for an ordinary plain Jane tortured by all and everyone around her.  Horror is not a word I think of when describing the film.  How about fiery intensity and terror.  This girl lives in a private hell.Which provides this De Palma classic with a clear and concise context. Carrie can explode at will and knowing this, we are held in a captive state. Also, her mother is probably the most terrifying figure we see.  She is a sick, depraved woman who treats Carrie like a miscarriage.  The mother knows, however, that her daughter has this gift, so she can be somewhat controlled.The acting is a bit dated, true, with the exception of the scenes between Spacek and Laurie.  (Spacek was also nominated for an Oscar as Carrie)  You almost feel like you have stumbled upon a lifestyle you should not be seeing.  Piper Laurie is nasty and demented as Mrs. White.  This film also has the distinction of being John Travolta's first feature.  Vinnie Barbarino goes to the evil heartland.  Amy Irving is forgettable and just so happens to be the only star from the original appearing in the upcoming 'sequel'.  Watch Spacek and Laurie at work.  The prom scene needs no explanation by now.  I was reminded of Hitchcock's REBECCA, when Judith Anderson sets Olivier's estate on fire.  This, like most of De Palma's work, stands on its own, with a little help from the master.",Null,2,3,10 March 1999
The Iron Giant," An Absolute Wonder Which Cherishes Its Influences - The Best Animated Feature Ever !
","Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.This is a movie with a heart the size of the title character.  A gentle, gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy.  The kid has a single mother (voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston) and he is just looking for a friend, whether it be a squirrel, or even a 50 foot tall machine.  The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T.  One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth.  E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth.  Here, it is animated and almost just as effective.IRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine.  The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth.  Live-action sci-fi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of 'dangerous' alien life and our efforts to destroy it.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons.  Ultimately, the characters in that classic learn from the extra-terrestrial being and realize the dangers of the A-Bomb.  It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.A beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great, hand-drawn film.  Here, we see both hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated 'iron giant'.  The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him.  There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment.  At one point, he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink.  I guess robots must blink too.  Enough analysis.  I loved this movie.  It is ranked #81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason.  Not only is it escapist, fantastic entertainment for kids, adults, and seniors alike, it is an animated picture like no other.  It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, the commentary of 1950's science fiction, and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel.  Do not miss this enchanting flick.RATING: ****",10,97,114,22 January 2000
Any Given Sunday," A Dizzying, Entertaining Peek Into Pro Football...Stone Style
","Sports movies are tough to make.  Creating the essence of the actual event is the toughest.  Most films fall short in the editing process of the event or through sheer carelessness and lack of knowledge.  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is somewhat of an exception.  It is hard-hitting and bloody like NORTH DALLAS FORTY.  It is actually conventional when you think about it, like a warped RUDY.  It is a hell of a lot more realistic than say, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. These are all football films with varying degrees of success (except ROUGHNESS), but Oliver Stone, in his usual over the top way, throws a dizzying, mind-splitting film at us, much like the sport itself.  This is why I liked it.Oliver Stone began a wicked spell of filmmaking with JFK, evident in its editing style.  Fast-paced, black and white mixed with color, documentary-like methods ensued in NATURAL BORN KILLERS, NIXON, and the ghastly U-TURN.  Nothing is new here with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  Football is a battlefield Stone chooses to depict and depict it he does.  Even the most ardent fans of the sport do not really know what it is like for a quarterback to drop back and get rid of a piece of pigskin before 11 players maul him.  You certainly get the idea watching this.  Al Pacino is the dried up head coach of the fictional Miami Sharks and he barks out the usual coaching cliches you hear in press conferences after real games.  Pacino also seems to be sleep-walking through the picture.  At times, he appears drunk even when he is not supposed to be.  Cameron Diaz's character, a young chick owner, (yeah right) destroys any credibility the film may have had going in (Even the NFL would have nothing to do with this movie). Her constant bickering is so over-done, you almost feel like hurling much the way Jamie Foxx does every time he enters a game as the team's 3rd string quarterback.  Realisticly speaking, this is not a very sane film about football.  It is a maniacal celebration of the game.  The scenes on the field are the ones I cherished.  Beware of the locker room or domestic sequences.No one has ever put such energy into football scenes in a film before.  He definitely had some good consultants.  There are some comical cameos - Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus play opposing coaches.  Lawrence Taylor can actually act a teeny bit and Jim Brown shares the film's best off the field scene with Pacino in a bar.  Stone tries to show us how the game has changed.  He resonates past glory with quotes from Lombardi, dissolves showing Red 'the Galloping Ghost' Grange, and even Unitas handing off to Ameche.  TV has changed everything, says the coach, and he is right.  It seems to be all about the money nowadays.That is the message, but you'll find yourself losing that idea in the lunacy of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY and the bone-crushing, ear-damaging football scenes. They are filmed and cut with such raw intensity, you feel like playing afterwards.  This is definitely a film for football fans only unless you like big, sweaty men.  Is there a big game at the end that needs to be won? Yes, and this surprised me considering how unconventional Stone usually is. Basically, surrender your senses and thought process to Stone's most entertaining film in quite some time.RATING: ***",7,49,74,14 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," A Back-to-Basics Spook Film That Proves You CAN Scare Without Computers...
","THE SIXTH SENSE is a refreshing and absorbing ghost story that is much more than meets the eye.  It is great to see a major Hollywood release go back to old school fright methods.  Do not expect to see thrill-a-minute, falsely produced chills.  This is a truly original piece of atmospheric filmmaking that earns the viewer's responses, which include frequent oohs and aahs and an occasional scream.Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan, a Philly native, presents a plodding build-up to one of the best payoffs I have seen in a thriller in the past few years.  Seeing the film, I knew the young boy (played incredibly by Haley Joel Osment) has a 'gift' and sees certain people walking around no one else can see.  Shyamalan seems to have taken a page out of Spielberg's JAWS, where the shark is never fully seen until crucial climactic scenes, and applied it to the boy's problem.  It is most definitely a problem if you are interacting with people who supposedly no longer walk the earth.  You may be unsure as to what he really is seeing until the great frights and charms of the picture hit you.  You know when Shyamalan means for us to get it and become involved.Bruce Willis is so reserved it is scary in itself and he plays off the boy very effectively.   SIXTH SENSE takes place on some other plane of existence it seems.   That is how I felt.  Sometimes you wonder whether people are seeing the main characters, who are all, in varying ways, mixed up in this whirlwind of terrifying sights and dimensions.  It is not manipulative and the scares do not need manufacturing.  We are led through them as a good script should put an audience through.Toni Collette has picked up a good South Philadelphia accent and is simply flabbergasted as to what the hell is going on with her seemingly gifted, yet sick, young son.  Osment as 'Cole', the boy star of the film outshines even Willis and shows he is capable of playing a character deeper than Forrest Gump Jr. (yep, that's him).  There is a lot of religious reference to afterlife which is fitting and the so-called 'twist' is indeed a twist to remember.All involved in this surprising production should be proud of the fact that you can still keep an audience in traction with moody story-telling and visuals and NO computer-generated effects.  Compare this to the current release THE HAUNTING and realize how much better these bare bones are.Rating ***1/2",9,1,2,11 August 1999
The Truman Show," Surprisingly strong message...
","This clever film from the director of WITNESS and THE MOSQUITO COAST is surprisingly effective in presenting a pretty important message.  By now, everyone knows the premise of the story (young man's entire life captured on live television without his knowledge).  Of course, cracks begin to show, especially when a lamp from the top of the huge dome that represents Truman's fictional world falls to the street.  (It's later revealed to Truman on his car radio that a plane has been shedding its parts in flight)  I found myself thinking of celebrities, even of Jim Carrey himself, who are constantly harassed with cameras and TV exposure.  This is the hidden message of the movie, because Truman is the victim of television exploitation without approval, which is wrong.Don't expect an over-the-top performance by Carrey, who does a good job of balancing the character's mildness and his insanity while discovering the weirdness that surrounds him.  One question remains unanswered throughout the film:  Does Truman actually have sex with the 'Co-star' who plays his 'wife' ?",9,0,0,13 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Duel of the Fates Has Just Begun....
","I would hope that people who truly love and respect the STAR WARS story as much as I do will put behind any unrest they have for the 1st episode.  It was spectacular and it is JUST the first in a line of three films we have to travel back to that galaxy far, far, away.  If you hated the first episode, you have forgotten what it was like to experience that place from the very start.No doubt, the 1st of George Lucas' saga is the best (with EMPIRE coming a close second), but the excitement is there, the galaxy has expanded, we see a younger version of Sir Alec Guiness played well by Ewan McGregor, and Lucas is behind it all more than ever.  Watch Episode IV - A New Hope and remember what we will be arriving at.  For God's sake, use your imagination. Any naysayers are forgetting what you were witnessing the first time around.STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE - ****",10,5,14,15 April 2000
The Thin Red Line," Love it or Hate it...
","Terrence Mallick came out of his Kubrickesque hibernation to make this fascinating, yet flawed, war picture which is anything but conventional. People will love it or hate it, however I fall somewhere in between.  It could have been great had it not been for the film's snail-like pace.  It is very good because it is a meditation on war with some strong performances and it is one of the most beautifully-shot color films I have ever seen.  I also admire Malllick for not ending it with an apocalyptic battle scene which seems essential in modern-day filmmaking (although the film could have contained more substance over style for the final 1/2 hour).By now, anyone reading knows the backdrop for this WWII epic, so we'll cut to the performances, none of which stand out with the exception of the main character, who's name still escapes me, Ben Chaplin, and Nick Nolte as a crazed General. The big-name performances are basically showcases to keep a sleepy viewer awake and its reputation high.  None really give to the film's 'story' or relate to the characters we even care about in the slightest way. Obviously, Mallick is well-respected within the industry and no matter what you think, I would not be surprised if it won the Oscar (really).  Mallick may not tell a great story here or focus enough, but it is technically brilliant.The movie lingers like a dream, especially because of its look.  The swaying weeds and grass are reminiscent of Mallick's previous efforts, 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven'.  If only he was able to project more of a pulse, we would care more about the brutality of the battle scenes and the consequences of what happens in the film.  Anyone can blow people up in battle pictures, but you need emotional connection with the characters for it to be effective. Again, I must say the film did effect me in some odd way because of its beauty and originality.  This will undoubtedly go down as a cult classic.",9,0,0,19 February 1999
The Birds," Hitchcock goes out on a limb and scares with THE BIRDS...
","Hitchcock topped himself in 1960, basically inspiring all modern horror pictures with PSYCHO, a new kind of fright flick never seen before.  3 years later, he made a foray into the supernatural with THE BIRDS.  If you have not seen the film and do not think a bunch of gulls and sparrows can hold you in suspense, think again.  The great thing about a Hitchcock movie is that you always know you are about to enter a world where all is not right. This 'world' usually involves an innocent man wrongly accused, eventually on the run.  The world of THE BIRDS has none of this.  Nature has run amok and the characters, paper-thin as they are, will go through a truly terrifying ordeal.One of the most innovative aspects here is a lack of any musical score of any kind.  Hitch's long-time partner Bernard Herrman is listed as 'sound consultant' and I'm sure he had something to do with the ominous sounds of the various birds, as their building wrath is indicated by their squawks. The attack scenes are a bit dated, but considering the technology of the day was pre-historic compared to the computer generated effects of today, they come across chillingly.  Some birds were props, others hand-drawn, even others real.  The film surprisingly benefits from a lack of music, heightening the suspense.Tippi Hedren is the icy blonde and a standard of Hitch's movies, the jealous or overbearing mother, is played by Jessica Tandy (in an awkwardly distant role).  Performances aside, Hitch does something he wished not to do in PSYCHO.  The bloody attacks are in bright technicolor, and one scene depicting a victim of the birds is quite shocking.  Hitch was afraid of showing the bloody carnage of the 'shower scene' in color, leaving it to the viewer's imagination.  It works here, showing the blood-red evil happening in this everyday small town.If you are claustrophobic, I would avoid THE BIRDS.  Like Janet Leigh in the PSYCHO shower scene, Tippi Hedren is caught in a phone booth in one of many tight situations, shot from overhead.  Otherwise, let Sir Alfred play you like a piano, like he so often has before !",Null,68,135,21 March 1999
