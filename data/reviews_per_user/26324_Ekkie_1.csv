Requiem for a Dream," Terrifying, I came back shaking.
","Many friends of my stopped watching after a few minutes because they felt that it was boring. I did stop watching too but not because it was boring. I stopped because it gave me an uncomfortable eerie feeling I didn't want to feel at that time. A couple of weeks later I watched it again and the movie gave me the creeps. The music, the sounds, the way the camera shakes. Everything gave me a feeling of disgust yet intrigued me. It was absolutely amazing but left you with the worst feeling imagenable. Which is brilliant because that is what the movie wants you to feel. You see these lives being thrown away in the most horrible way imaginable and show in the most disturbing way as possible. This is one of the most important movies I have ever seen.",10,0,0,9 April 2001
