The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Fans of the book will still enjoy, but most should wait till Part 2
","Mockingjay: To say that I am a fan of the Hunger Games Franchise would be an understatement, I have been eagerly waiting for this film since last year after watching Catching Fire. I am a huge fan of the books, so I had a general idea of what was going to take place in this film and where they would end it. I was a little disappointed with the movie, I still liked it very much but was a little disappointed. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is well thought-out, very well acted, but lacks the action and intensity that made the first and second films so enjoyable. Aside from adding in a few propo(propaganda pieces used in the film) scenes, the director did a pretty good job a keeping it true to the book. That is the problem though, it was one book and this is only half of it. The book was honestly a little boring for the first half compared to the other two, but was still a great book because it picked it up in the second half. The film obviously had scenes that were only there to lengthen the film and were very unnecessary and added little to nothing in terms of the plot. It would have been a much better film if it was closer to three hours and was just one film. That way they could have given the book adaption justice and would have been much better overall. Of course, they would make nearly double the money by splitting the book into two parts which is the only reason why they did it. The director did his best with what he was given and I give him much credit for making it a very enjoyable film. What made this film still incredibly enjoyable to me was the acting ensemble they had. They have so much great actors and actresses across the board that they used tremendously well throughout the movie. Jennifer Lawrence(surprise, surprise) still gave the best performance. She continues to perfectly convey the personality and attitude that is Katniss Everdeen. Liam Hemsworth also did a outstanding job since this is the film that gives the most screen time. He is no Peeta Mellark to me, but he did a nice job at playing the tough, honest guy who you can tell really wants Katniss to love him the say way he loves her. Josh Hutcherson has far less screen time in this film, but was given a much more challenging role. I was curious to see how he would take to it since it is abnormal for a character to have to change his entire personality during a film. He was brilliant. He exceeded everyone's expectations and I have very high hopes for him in the final Hunger Games. The rest of the ensemble did very well. Woody Harrelson continually gave the audience nice laughs throughout the film. It is up to you on this, I think you should see this film in theaters, but you will honestly have a better experience if you just wait to see this a little before you see the final Hunger Games. Still, I think you should see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 at some point, whether it is in theaters or on DVD.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7,2,13,5 December 2014
The Monuments Men," Biggest Disappointment of the year!!!!
","The Monuments Men 2/10- Everything about this movie makes you think that it will be a hit. It has got George Clooney as the director and star, Matt Damon as the other lead, Bill Murray, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett, I mean that cast alone screams this movie will be awesome. Plus, the source material that this movie is based off of is very interesting and definitely deserves to be told. What could go wrong? Everything. Everything went wrong. I do not know how all of these great factors leads to such a terrible movie. The Monuments Men is one of those movies that after twenty minutes of watching, you feel like you have been there for an hour. I will begin with the score. A score is the entire music made for a particular movie. In almost all of the movies I have seen, the music only enhances the viewing experience and adds something special to each individual scene. Then there are these handful of movies I have seen where the music makes each scene worse, the monuments men is unfortunately one of those few. During this movie, there will be this poorly written inspirational speech or emotional scene and someone during this the music will start playing.Even if this speech was the greatest movie speech ever written, the music made for the Monuments Men would have ruined it and would have made you hate speech. To be honest, I have never disliked any music for a particular movie more than this one.Now for the plot. The Monuments Men has a particular interesting plot at first because it cultivates a patriotic World War II theme whilst still maintaining an intellectual background with the artists and sculptors being on the front line. The Trailer makes it look very clear cut, they all go in together and find the art throughout Europe and bring it back to its rightful owners. Everyone that I know was excited for this film just because of the trailer, but sadly that's the only good thing about this movie, the trailer. We saw the only good parts of the plot in the trailer. When the actually movie begins, the audience suddenly realizes right away that is very poorly written movie and the rest of the movie they hope that at least is will get a little better. Nope, somehow it gets progressively worse throughout the entire movie. I do not want to give away any particular details about The Monuments Men if for some reason you want to see this movie after reading this review. Last and definitely least the acting. How can a cast that has one more than five Oscars not deliver an outstanding performance? I have no clue. What did they do differently this time? Why were they so terrible in this film? It is honestly a mystery, but the main suspect is George Clooney who did not show any solid directing skills from this work. I am not going to point out any particular person for bad acting in this film because all of them were just as bad as the next and for some of them it was the worst performances of their career. To sum it all up, bad music, bad plot, and bad acting. This is the first movie that I strongly recommend you do not even see when it comes out on DVD.

Captain Phillips," Fantastic All-Around Film
","Captain Phillips 8.5/10- Based on the real-life hijacking of the Maesrk Alabama, Captain Phillips is a brilliantly directed film by Paul Greengrass with riveting performances by Tom Hanks and the newcomer Barkhad Abdi who plays Muse, the leader of the armed pirates.The movie is great largely because of the always great actor, Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks, who plays Captain Phillips, might have had the best performance of his career since 'Forrest Gump.' Barkhad Abdi makes every single person in the theater believe that he actually is an actual Somali pirate. Paul Greengrass does not just show captain Phillips as the good guy and Muse as the bad guy. He gives Muse heart, he shows how the pirates are still people too and it works like a charm. The design of the ship and the life boat was extremely realistic . Captain Phillips is one of the most intense movies of the year and it keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire movie guaranteed. I dare someone to fall asleep in Captain Phillips. I forgot about the pirate incident that took place a few years ago and seeing this movie got me to remember how intense of a situation it was for Captain Phillips whose heroic actions saved his crew. The movie made me feel like I was there and it did not even seem like it was a movie as much as someone filming the actual events with a very good camera. Captain Phillips is one of those movies that everyone goes to the movie theater to watch, one of those films where you completely forget everything going on in your life and you are just watching a movie. This movie was a great start to awards season and this is bound to be nominated for several Oscars and even win a couple. Captain Phillips is a great movie that anyone with a brain can enjoy and it is no doubt worth the ten dollar ticket admission.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",9,0,2,23 January 2015
The Equalizer," Bloody Great Action film
","The Equalizer: I am gonna go on a limb and say most Denzel fans have seen his most famous role- Training Day. Denzel's role of the corrupted cop Alonzo Harris is known as one of the biggest badass roles of all time. Picture Denzel in Training Day, but as a good guy. That is his character in The Equalizer. To make it even better, the director from Training Day returned to direct this film. I cannot picture a better scenario. Despite some over the top Hollywood moments, The Equalizer delivers in strong lead acting, great music underscoring, and equally impressive action sequences to give one of the most entertaining action films this year. What I mean by over the top Hollywood moments is things like walking away from a huge explosion without looking back. Training Day was very successful at staying away from those kind of moments which is why it was such a memorable action movie. Unfortunately, this film decided to use those moments which are entertaining, but put it closer into the general action film category. These select few times in the film were the only moments where I was just thinking to myself 'really?' Fortunately, nothing else seemed to bother me about the film. Now to the best part of the film, Denzel-freaking-Washington. He perfectly played this role, I firmly believe no one could have played it better. He wasn't just able to give you the great badass that the director asked from him, he gave more. He delivered great light comedy that really made the movie whole. Without it, the movie would have been too dark like The November Man. The action sequences in this film were very well done. What I mean is, they did not bring in a kung-fu master to have Denzel fight at the end or anything, it was just great street fighting. Denzel's character, Robert McCall, could slow down certain moments and see all of the angles he needed to defeat his opponent. The audience really just sat in awe at how impressive it was. The action sequences can get pretty bloody, so if you do not like those kind of things, I advise you not to see this film.If you are the kind of person who just loves action movies, I highly recommend The Equalizer your first choice going into the theater.

John Wick," Good action flick!!
","John Wick: In the 90's and early 2000's, any action movie with Keanu Reeves was a must--see movie for all. In the past eight years or so, Keanu Reeves practically went off the map and no one knew if he was still acting anymore. Then, he suddenly decides to pick up where he left off and return to action. 'Everyone's been asking me if I'm back, yeah I'm thinking I'm back- John Wick.' With the plot of John Wick somewhat laughably mimicking the career of Keanu Reeves, we cannot help but enjoy the thrilling ride of seeing a solid action film.I do not usually give the plot of the film but I feel it is appropriate for this one. John Wick, a once great hit man, comes out of retirement from his peaceful quiet life to track down the men who took everything he had, showing he has not lost his touch at what he does. With the exception of trying to enact revenge on people who wrecked his life, that plot sounds a lot like Keanu Reeves's career. That is why I thought he was perfect for the role and why the role was perfect for him. I would have given this movie a higher rating if it was not for the fact that I have seen this type of movie many times before. In fact, John Wick reminded me a lot of a movie I saw a month ago called The Equalizer which has an extreme number of similarities with John Wick. If it was the first time I ever saw a movie with this plot, it would be one of my favorite films. Sadly, it is not the case and I never was really surprised with the direction the movie went.Enough about that, time to get on to why I still liked the movie. The main reason the movie is very enjoyable is because it accomplished what it wanted as solid action film. It did not try to do more or get overly complicated in it's own plot leaving the audience lost. It was clear-cut and direct, what many films are not successful achieving. There is no one is better to achieve it than Keanu Reeves. I am not sure if the script was written with Keanu Reeves in mind or if it was just cast perfectly. Whatever the case may be, the intimidating, quiet, resourceful guy pretty much describes Keanu Reeve's bread and butter role. The rest of the cast did their job accordingly, but Keanu Reeves definitely shines in his return to action films. If you are in a theater where they are showing both John Wick and The Equalizer, flip a coin and you will enjoy both of them equally. Still, I recommend you see John Wick at some point while it is still in theaters. For more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7,8,22,20 November 2014
Lone Survivor," Great inspirational true story!!!
","Lone Survivor 8/10- I did not know what to think coming into this movie. I have seen so many disappointing war movies I have lost count. Lone Survivor though, was a truly great war film that is probably the best war movie of the past ten years. Now, I have no clue if these kind of films are realistic or not since I have never been in any situation remotely like the ones in this movie, but people I know who have been say that this movie is one of the only realistic war movies they have ever seen. That itself is something very rare. For those of you that do not know the plot to the movie, Lone Survivor tells the story of four NAVY SEALS who are tasked to go a mission to neutralize a high-level Taliban operative and are forced to fight for their lives when the mission goes wrong. It starts out with footage of NAVY SEALS training and it is amazing to believe all of the stuff they have to do to become biggest badasses in the world. I could not imagine how mentally and physically tough a person could be to go through all of that and all of these actors in Lone Survivor were able to portray these roles very well. Mark Wahlberg, who plays Marcus Luttrell, gave his usual amazing tough guy performance and gives this movie exactly the right character portrayal that it needs. Taylor Kitsch, who plays the leader of the mission Mike Murphy, gave probably the best performance of his career and I am very glad that he is finally is in a successful film. Emile Hirsch, who plays Danny Dietz, gives a good enough performance to make his character memorable enough. Without a doubt, the best performance of the movie was surprisingly by Ben Foster, who play Matt Axelson. He gave his character more life than any of the others. The acting though is not the thing that the audience remembers when they leave the theater.The action scenes are amazingly crafted and are the best I have ever seen. It just seems impossible how well the director was able to make it look like the NAVY SEALS got shot or fell through the forest like rag dolls. I do know who was the head of that department, but that guy deserves an Oscar. One thing that I also like about this movie is it doesn't just show the Middle Eastern people as the bad guys, Lone Survivor shows how a lot of the people are and how they feel about the Taliban. It really showed me a new light about the Gulf War and how it happened. What I personally loved about this movie, is the message that it leaves you with. It inspires you to go farther than you can possibly imagine and to never give up. It plants the idea in the audiences minds that if these NAVY SEALS can go through all of this stuff and not complain, I have a pretty good life and have very little to complain about. This movie could be a little too much for some people as it is pretty gory in some scenes, but for those who can handle it, you will love this movie and feel incredibly inspired as you walk out.

Fury," Amazing war film that doesn't hold back
","Fury: I have seen at least two dozen different WWII movies in my life and with the exception of Saving Private Ryan, Fury is the best WWII film I have ever seen. Sergeant Wardaddy says 'Ideals are peaceful, history is violent.' This film is not for the faint of heart because it is not afraid to hold back on the brutality and utter gruesomeness that war brings to the world. Some of the images are horrifying to watch but are necessary to establish the theme of the film. I rarely see a film like this one. With ingeniously-crafted intense war scenes, strong acting across the board, and a new somewhat claustrophobic setting, a tank, Fury has become the best war film of the past five years. I had to think really hard about what I would have changed for this movie. Aside from a somewhat laughable moment where they had to find an excuse to have Brad Pitt take his shirt off, I could not find anything to criticize. Some people say this film suffers from a plot that does not seem to go anywhere, but I thought it knew exactly where it wanted to go. A soldiers life does not have a clear-cut path that he has to follow. The plot follows as such a soldier's life would go-in all directions. From what I have heard since I have never been in a war, Fury is very realistic. It does the opposite of holding back. It shows gives you the horrors of war and how soldiers have to respond to them. It has you like a character one second showing you how great they are, then shows you the character dead in a pile of rubble. It's not glorifying the Americans at all times either. It shows the pure hatred the Americans had for Germans. This is something we would all feel though and shows how one day of war can bring that hatred out of someone. The tank is also something I have never seen before. Fury is the first film to use a genuine Tiger I tank in the making of a WWII film. The tank called 'Fury' serves as the main setting throughout the film and it is amazing the type of shots their were able to capture inside an actual tank. Outside of a couple of scenes from Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, no other director has even come close to the scenes captured in this movie. Hats off to David Ayer!The people that served in WWII were never the same because of the experiences that had. It is very hard to actually convey this type of emotion and character in acting, but I surprised that everyone involved in the film did an incredible job. They were all perfectly casted. I know a lot of you are thinking right now 'even Shia Labeouf was good?' Yes, as much as it pains me to say it, he had the strongest acting in the film. Even a little better than Brad Pitt which is really hard more me to say. Brad Pitt stills did a great job, and Logan Lerman easily had the best performance of his career along with Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena. Suffice to say, this movie has no shortage of outstanding acting.If you can handle some very intense war scenes and also love incredible films, I highly recommend Fury as your first choice going into the theater.

The Maze Runner," Darker Better Version of Lord of the Flies
","The Maze Runner- Young-adult films in today's day and age have been pegged with the tagline of 'Silly teen romance with silly life threatening situations on the side.' The Maze Runner, as most can tell, is nothing like that. This movie has sort of a Lord of the Flies and Lost combo to it, making it a real breath of fresh air to the YA genre. The thing that made Lost so interesting was the questions the show posed. This film gives the same feeling to the audience members. Despite a bit of a lackluster ending and somewhat predictable plot, The Maze Runner combines strong acting, breathtaking CGI effects, and a refreshingly darker approach to the YA genre, to give the audience an wildly entertaining thrill ride for the whole film. I know a lot of people are huge fans of the book, but I have not read the book and therefore will not judge the movie with any comparisons relating to the original source material. From what I heard though, the film cuts out some scenes from the book, but still stays along the same line. All of the people that read the book that I have talked to, say they very much enjoyed the movie and cannot wait for the sequel.What I am mean by predictable plot is the common features that The Maze Runner's storyline shares with other films. The constant adversity he must overcome to be accepted as part of the group is the main one, but that is probably how it would happen so it is hard to judge that factor. The main problem that most people had with the film was the rushed ending where everything seemed to be happening too fast. The movie is obviously just setting up for a sequel. Still, it should not have to cram in so much information in the last eight minutes to do so. The film still keeps the Lost sort of feeling and leaves us still thinking towards the end which I tend to like, but others may not.When I was watching some of the action sequences in the film, I said to myself 'Thank God they didn't make the action so lame so that it would be suitable for six year old to watch.' I really stress when I say young-adult because the action was actually a lot darker and more gruesome than I thought it would be so I would advise you not to take your little kids to the movie. The action was actually something I appreciated because it was not afraid to hold back on the fighting. The action sequences were simply awesome. The CGI was also very well done. The amount of imagination that must have been put forth to achieve the look of the 'never- ending' maze was astounding. They really had you going. It seemed like everything that was happening in the film was really taking place and that is the goal for all CGI. Another thing I was impressed with was the great acting across the board in the movie. Dylan O'Brien, who plays the curious and courageous Thomas, delivers a strong lead performance and easily the best performance of his career. Will Poulter, who plays the tough and kind of mean guy Gally, really showed that he is not a one-sided kind of character and possesses a lot of acting ability. I was skeptical of Will Poulter being the right man for The Maze Runner after seeing him play the goofy kid in We're the Millers. To my surprise, he managed to show he can play more than just one type of character. The rest of the cast were all well-casted in their roles and all did a fantastic job. As I said before, this is not the type of movie for little kids to watch. If you are age appropriate though, I recommend you see The Maze Runner while it is still in theaters.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Amazing Sequel that shows hope for future Marvel Films
","Starring- Chris Evans, Scarlett Johnansson, Anthony Mackie, Frank Grillo, Sebastian Stan, Cobie Smulders, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. JacksonCaptain America: The Winter Soldier 8/10- After seeing Thor: The Dark World, I was skeptical at how this sequel of Captain America will turn out. The Dark World was such a disappointment that I was almost certain that Captain America: The Winter Soldier would be nothing more than a good trailer. I was dead wrong. Captain America has earned the right to be mentioned in the same breathe as The Avengers and Iron Man. The plot of this film is by far superior than any other Marvel entry and the connections that it makes with the original film while still moving on to the next- stage of film making is without a doubt the biggest accomplishment of this picture. The thing that made this sequel unique from all of the other Marvel films, with the exception of possibly Iron Man, is the enemy. Most of the Marvel films have a foreign enemy, an enemy that comes from a competing company, country, or realm. The Winter Soldiers enemy comes from S.H.I.E.L.D.This enemy is apart of the organization that swore to protect the world. That is the reason that Steve Rogers A.K.A. Captain America joined S.H.I.E.L.D. The way they introduce this new enemy is something that really keeps you entertained and wondering what will happen next. All of the new and returning characters were a great choice of being added to this film. I was glad that this film focuses on the inner-workings of S.H.I.E.L.D. I was wondering which sequel Natasha Romanoff, who is played by Scarlett Johansson, would play in and they made they best choice of putting her in this one. Nick Fury, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson, was the obvious slam-dunk choice for this film and I was glad to see that he is more involved in this movie. It would have not been the same without him. The acting is really secondary to all of the other aspects of the film but I would still like to point out some performances that no one else could have done better. The Chris Evans- Scarlett Johansson duo really was a breathe of fresh air considering that a lot of the superhero movies of today feature more solo heroes. They both had great chemistry together and I easily believed that they were going on secret-missions for years. I really have to applaud Chris Evans because I feel like he has tremendous potential as an actor. Seeing him play the too cool for rules, playboy Human Torch in Fantastic Four to seeing him play the straight-laced soldier in Captain America, it just seems like his acting can only go up at this point and he was without a doubt a perfect choice for this film. Samuel L. Jackson is without a doubt the master of the all wise but very angry leader of everyone, and his character Nick Fury is a great of example of that. Again, none of the other Marvel movies even compare to how great of a plot this film has. This aspect alone is enough to make it an enjoyable movie experience, and when you factor in all of the others parts of the movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier goes above and beyond in every way. I definitely recommend this as your first choice walking into the theater. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",8,1,2,22 November 2014
Interstellar," Nolan does it again!!!
","Interstellar: Seeing the trailer for this ambitious film, I immediately became overjoyed because if anyone can pull off a movie like this one, it is Christopher Nolan. And who better to lead the charge than Matthew McConaughey. A guy who has completely turned his career around in the past three years and is now consider to be one of the top actors in Hollywood. This movie is incredible to say the least. Interstellar combines interesting concepts and ideas, brilliant script writing and directing to make the most thought provoking and groundbreaking Nolan film yet.This movie was near-perfect too me, but the only thing that kept me from giving it a 9.5/10 was it getting to complicated for it's own good. Towards the end after so much stuff has happened, it gives you more to contemplate just to keep up with whats going on. Still, it does not fall into the same pit as Lucy where towards the end it gets caught in its own complicated story line and it can't get itself out. Also, I feel like they rushed the beginning when they were still on Earth. Nolan seemed as if he wanted to get to space as fast as possible which made the scenes on Earth far less impactful to the audience. I love the acting in films, but in a film like this, the acting is secondary. The primary focus is the special effects. They made entirely new worlds from nothing. Space stations from scratch. Everything imaginable to make this movie believable was created. What I like about Christopher Nolan's films is the fact he tries to use as many 'real environments' as possible. They were not CGI'd into a spaceship, they were actually in one. What Nolan did to make the acting even greater was he created the imagery before hand. Doing this, the actors reactions to what they saw when they looked out the windows were real. The CGI was still incredible too. The idea and design for the robot they made was breath-taking. They made you believe a futuristic robot could go across any terrain, known or unknown. I firmly believe the CGI could not have been better done and it is, in my opinion, the best in the history of cinema. I would also like to mention I have only ever heard a score for a film this good one other time- Inception. This one might even be better. The music and underscoring conveyed the exact feelings the director wanted the audience to feel at any given moment. The score gave the audience a sense that anything was possible. Anything within our imagination could come true and nothing is ever out of reach. What I love during the film was the special effects, but what I loved so much about Interstellar after watching it was the script writing and directing. The way the Nolan brothers were able to come up with all of the concepts about time relativity and gravity is far beyond me. What I love the most about the script though was how it all came back together at the end. Everything began to make sense. Their were no major plot holes that bothered me throughout or things I could not understand well-enough because the film did not explain it enough. Everything made sense. This film was cast perfectly as well as being written near- perfectly. Matthew McConaughey was a slam-dunk pick to play the lead in the film and he conveyed the perfect normal, but smart loving character needed to make the role work. The scenes where he sees his kids for the first time in years is really amazing because of the overjoyed happy and sad feelings he has to show from seeing his kids grow up without him. Anne Hathaway also did an amazing job and played the part well. The rest of the cast did the best they could with the screen-time they had and I loved the completely unexpected cameo they threw in the film. If you can handle intricate films that you have to pay attention , Interstellar will amaze you. Don't wait to see it at home, the movie theater experience will enhance the film experience a hundred times more. Obviously, I recommend you see Interstellar as your first choice walking into theaters. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",10,3,9,20 November 2014
American Sniper," Intense and powerful!!! Great way to end awards season!!!!
","American Sniper: Powerful and intense. Two words that perfectly describe American Sniper. From the moment Chris Kyle is deployed to Iraq, the intensity in the film never lets up. Without a doubt, this is the most intense film I have ever seen. I thought good action movies kept me at the edge of my seat, but American Sniper is the true definition of an edge-of-a-seat film. At some points of the movie, I almost had to stand up and take a deep breath because my heart was beating so fast. I could tell everyone else in the audience felt the same way. With Clint Eastwood's best directing since Gran Torino, career best performance from Bradley Cooper, and the most powerful scriptwriting I have seen, American Sniper excels in nearly every category. I just want you guys to know that some may find this movie biased because it calls a lot of the Iraqi's savages and seems very one-sided in it's view point of the War. This movie is about a soldier's life, and no way in hell a Navy SEAL is gonna think the work he does is not important or the men who try to kill his teammates are nothing less than scumbags. All of us would think this way if someone tried to kill our friends. The trailer for this film kind of makes it seem like the movie is a little boring, but that is literally the opposite of what this film is. All of the emotion and intensity they are able to convey behind a sniper scope and with no one talking is astounding and very impressive. It draws you into the story with those emotions and intense scenes and you feel like you are living in the story with him. The script was near-perfect as well for the story it was telling as well. I will never know how hard it is for military men to acclimate back to their lives back home, but now I at least have a better understanding of the fight they have to go through from hearing gun shots all day to expecting to be normal at their son's birthday party. It is exactly like what Taya Kyle, played by Sienna Miller, says to Chris Kyle, 'if you think this war hasn't changed you, your wrong.' The power it was able to convey in nearly every scene was incredible, the script, the music, the acting, just everything went together perfectly. The audience felt exactly what Clint Eastwood, the director, wanted us to feel. I think it might even be his best work since Unforgiven to be honest.When I saw Bradley Cooper in the trailer for this film, I could not believe it was him. He looks so different which is just a testament to how much dedication he puts into his roles. He worked for months on end to put forty-plus pounds of muscle on to play the most deadly sniper in military history. His acting was phenomenal. He has a perfect Texas accent and plays the born and bread country boy down to a tee. He definitely deserves every inch of that Oscar nomination he received. How perfectly he played not only a Navy SEAL, but a SEAL who has to find some impossible way to go back to the life he has home is amazing. This film again is extremely intense and some scenes in Iraq do get a little graphic so make sure you are ready to see this film because it is not one of those films you can just pick up and watch whenever. If you can handle it though, I highly recommend American Sniper as your first choice walking into the theater. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",10,39,78,21 January 2015
American Hustle," Very good once it gets it's feet on the ground
","American Hustle 7.5/10- I will start this off by saying that I am a huge fan of David O'Russell, Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence. It is an understatement to say that I hold David O'Russell's directing and his screen writing at the highest regard. American Hustle cons its way into making a near-masterpiece of film making. When I saw the previews for American Hustle, I read that American Hustle is loosely based on the 1978 ABSCAM scandal. I would explain what that is, but I do not want to ruin the movie for you. What I will say is, American Hustle gives a completely new view point on the FBI and how they do things. As said in the movie, the world is not black and white, it is gray. Now, none of the depiction of the ABSCAM scandal would be believable it was not for the great costume design. Bradley Cooper's curly hair looked hilariously superb, but Christian Bales comb over looked fantastic. The costume design department obviously knew what they were doing when they made these risky moves that more than paid off. It is impossible for me to describe how great the screenplay was. The movie has a lot of ground to cover in a short two hours and five minutes. American Hustle moves at an electrifying pace that informs everyone on the background of all the people involved. The movie is a shoe-in to be at the very least nominated for an Oscar in the screen writing department. Now, a great movie is nothing without great acting. The acting ensemble that American Hustle gathered from all of his previous movies and a few new members was perfect. A lot of credit goes to both David O'Russell and the casting department.When it comes to the acting, I do think everyone in the audience would agree that it was top-notch. Amy Adams, who plays Sydney Prosser, continues to deliver these amazing performances where she is sure to get a best actress in leading role nomination. Amy Adams plays the con-artist partner duo alongside Christian Bale. Christian Bale, who plays Irving Rosenfeld, amazes the audiences by his ability to commit to a role. Not many actors in Hollywood would be willing to give up a six-pack and gain forty pounds and have a comb-over for one movie role. This is what makes Christian Bale stand out. He can play any kind of character. He obviously did his homework for the role because he demonstrated his knowledge of the con game as the character that Bale plays is revered as one of the best con-artists of the 20th century. The Christian Bale-Amy Adams duo worked out well together and they showed good chemistry together. The characters they play, Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser go into the con-game together and are eventually forced to work with the hot-headed wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso. Bradley Cooper, who plays Richie DiMaso, gave a career best performance. He does not play very many characters that are arrogant and selfish, but no one in the audience would even guess that. Bradley Cooper also must have done his homework as he is being taught the con game by Irving Rosenfeld in American Hustle. Jennifer Lawrence will no doubt be nominated for best supporting Actress and I think she has a good shot at winning. Jennifer Lawrence plays Irving Rosenfeld's wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld. She has played this type of character before unlike the rest of the cast as she plays the loose cannon that can blow up the whole con whenever she becomes upset. Just like in Silver Linings Playbook, Lawrence plays someone who clearly has mental problems and her performance is so believable that some people guess if she actually has any mental issues. That is of course NOT true, she is just a normal nice cool young adult who deserves to be biggest in demand actress in Hollywood. But, that is neither here nor there.Last year, Silver Linings Playbook was the first movie to be nominated for an Oscar in all four acting categories. I think American Hustle has a legitimate chance at doing what Silver Linings Playbook did. It is just one of those movies that makes you love every single character despite all of their flaws and you kind of end up rooting for all of themAll in all, American Hustle deserves all of the great reviews it has gotten. You do not even need to like any of the actors to love American and I would recommend this movie to anyone thats wants to see one of the best films of the year.

Divergent," Don't listen to the critics and just enjoy the film
","Divergent 8/10- Most are skeptical of book to movie adaptions, especially when it is in the young adult genre, and most movies of the past have not given the genre a good name. Divergent however, is a solid film that without a doubt makes up for all of them. It takes you on a non-stop suspense-filled ride while staying true to the book and literally makes the magnificent words fly off the page. I would like to clarify that it is not some twilight garbage or trying to rip the Hunger Games. It is its own film and does a fine job standing by itself. I will begin by saying that I do agree that at certain points of the film, it does feel like they are going a little slow and are dragging on a certain scene. These scenes are this way though because the director has a gigantic respect for the book and wanted to stay true to the book as much as possible. The main problem that I heard most people had with the film is that they felt like the ending was too rushed. I can see why someone would think that, and I do agree that is was a little rushed but I still thought it was a near-perfect scene. Again, the reason it was this way is because that is how it is in the book. I love the book and I loved all of the scenes that they chose for the movie, but I would have maybe changed the scenes a tiny bit just so it would be more amicable for an audience. Those changes would be very small though and all of these minuscule problems in no way stopped me from enjoying the film.Whoever was the head production designer deserves an Oscar for this movie. He made the exact images that I pictured in the book come to life. He picked the perfect shades for the colors of each faction and made amazing communities for each faction as well. He did an outstanding job particularly on the dauntless designs. I was very concerned coming into the film about how he would portray the dauntless and the place they live in, but I was just astounded by how great of a job he did. The fighting arena, the pit, the rooms, they were all awesome. I would also like to give props to the choreographers of the film for completely coming up with a new way to fight. They do not follow the usual boxing type fighting, they design their own that significantly contributes to each combat sequence. The casting directors of Divergent could not have done a better job, particularly with Shailene Woodley and Theo James who play Tris and Four. I'm really glad that they took their time and found the perfect people for the movie who have such great chemistry together while still each giving off a good intensity of their own. Shailene Woodley, Theo James, and all of the rest of the cast were amazing together and you could tell that they were all fiercely dedicated to their roles. Shailene Woodley did a great job at really diving into her character Tris Prior and no one could have done as great of a job as her. The emotional scenes she was in were really the highlight of her career. I see plenty of actors that just completely mess up those scenes because they are just not good at acting, but Shailene Woodley really made you believe she was experiencing what Tris Prior was in those moments of the film. Theo James did just as good of a job and I truly believe that no one could hold his own with Shailene Woodley as well as he did. He really puts on the mask that Four does at the beginning but as his character develops, he changes with him and really was a perfect choice for the role. The rest of the cast all did an above-average job, but Shailene and Theo were really the ones that were mentioning walking out of the theater. My advice to you is do not listen to the critics, most of them just do not like the young adult genre in general. The movie the best film out right now and I strongly recommend that you go see it in theaters.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",8,0,1,22 November 2014
Ender's Game," Good film, great entertainment!!!
","Ender's Game 6/10- I am not a huge fan of Asa Butterfield or Gavin Hood's films, but this is the best film I have seen by both of them. Don't get me wrong I loved Hugo, but it had nothing to do with Asa Butterfield. Ender's Game though was Asa's best work by far. The movie somewhat grabs your attention at the beginning with interesting concepts, and the story gets much better throughout the film. The movie had very good action sequences that surprised me and everyone in the theater. The zero gravity battles in particular were the highlights of the movie for me and everyone that I have talked too. The movie does a good job of not just putting action in the movie for the sake of action. They follow a good concise plot with the action only adding on to it. The design was pretty good all around, even though it was set in the future, it all seemed believable. I have not read the books, but from all I have heard about them, the movie stays in line with the key plot points. The movie focuses on Ender's training process more than anything else. The movie does not have any clichés during the training either like a love relationship or a bully that continually torments him like most teenage-centered action films. Ender's ability to analyze situations and take the necessary course of action is brilliantly displayed. Asa Butterfield particular displays this type of the character flawlessly with everyone believing that he is a Steven Hawking type. The only part of Asa Butterfield's performance that is weak is when he has to show true powerful emotions, but thankfully the movie did not have much of that. Harrison Ford's character was one that I have never seen him play before, but he made it look like he has been doing that type of aggressive, emotionless character his whole life. The other performances all did a decent job because the casting department did a chose each of them masterfully. There are some flaws that you will notice that particularly do not fit into the plot well and the director just put those in the movie hoping no one will notice because they were still key to the plot, but sadly there was no build up. I do not want to go into detail because I do not want to spoil it, but they seem like rookie mistakes. Other than those, Gavin hood did a solid directing job that is a huge step up from X-men: Origins Wolverine. The movie sadly does not contain much humor and it deserves the movie to have barely any comedy during the film. The movie finishes fairly well, but it seemed a little rushed like the endings of the transformers movies. If the movie gave the ending more time, I think it would have improved the film much more and given the audience a more solid feeling at the end of the movie. Still, the ending is better than most sci-fi movies. All in all, the movie delivers decent enough action with good performances from Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. The film is entertaining enough that makes the viewing experience enjoyable. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",6,2,3,23 January 2015
The Lego Movie," Biggest Surprise Film of the Year!!
","The Lego Movie 7.5/10- When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked pretty stupid. I was surprised when I saw it had a 95 on rotten tomatoes. So, I decided to give this movie a chance and could not have been more impressed. Yes, it is funny but the thing that is incredible is the visual effects. It did something that few have done before but it was the first to do it successfully. You do not have to be a four year old to enjoy this. The Lego Movie is something that we all can appreciate. The plot was somewhat cliché but the way it turns towards the end and gives itself a new direction is really impressive and definitely separates itself from other films of its category. T he visual effects were the thing to talk about. It takes a second to get use to but once you do, you become entranced in the world of legos. Also the way they so quickly build legos like it is a video game and putting it on the screen is stunning.The decision to make all of the characters from famous lego sets as characters in the movie was very amusing and the only thing that might have did wrong is not having Harry Potter in it. The rest though such as: Batman, Abe Lincoln, Green Lantern, Superman, etc... all did great job in adding something to the plot. As far as voices go for movies, the Lego Movie did exceptionally well. Then again, with Morgan Freeman being a voice in a movie, it is hard to go wrong. The rest of the cast: Chris Pratt (Emitt), Elizabeth Banks(Wild Style), and Will Arnet(Batman) all did amazing well and I believe the movie would not have been as good with them. Basically, The Lego Movie is a great choice to go see at the movies and will no doubt be in the line up for the Oscars next year.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",9,1,6,22 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men movie yet!!!
","Starring- Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Peter DinklageX-Men: Days of Future Past 8/10- I have been a fan of the X-Men films all of my life and when I saw the trailer for this new X-Men movie, all I could say was 'Please let this one be good!' And my hopes were more than answered. With a cast as talented as this one and director Bryan Singer fixing all of the mistakes made in X-Men: The Last Stand, everything worked out better than I could have imagined. Days of Future Past combines all of our favorite characters from the previous X-Men films with exciting new concepts and effects to engineer ones of the best blockbusters of the year and the most exciting X-Men movie yet. There is so much I could say about this sequel/prequel that makes it more unique and overall, better than its predecessors. The major thing though was the enjoyment of seeing all of the characters from the X-Men combined into one film. Anyone could have guessed that if X-Men could somehow do this than it would be a hit on this standard alone. The key thing though was pulling it off without ruining the entire film. I do not want to give away any specifics but Bryan Singer basically made his own version of time-travel to do exactly what was needed, and I have not seen this good of a time-travel movie since Back to the Future. The acting is my and pretty much everyone's favorite part. This new picture features nearly everyone in it at the top of their acting game. I have seen all of the returning characters in other X-Men films and they all did tremendously well. The performances that I really enjoyed were James McAvoy, who plays young Professor Charles Xavier, and Jennifer Lawrence(big surprise),who plays Raven aka Mystique. I will be honest, I was a little disappointed by James McAvoy in X-Men:First Class because I knew he could have gone to another level of acting if he just figured out how to get there. He found out how in this brand new one. Jennifer Lawrence did not have as much experience acting in big blockbusters at the time of X-Men: First Class and now that she has, she was really able to display her confidence and comfortability in her character. The special effects were all executing amazingly which is what I would expect from Bryan Singer by now. There is only one scene where I was really left in awe at how well it was done and everyone in the theater agreed with me and was even laughing at how funny it was at the same time. I do not want to ruin the surprise but make sure you are watching in all the scenes that Pietro/Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver is in. The design of the sentinel robots was something I especially enjoyed and also seemed rather familiar to me. Even if the sentinel robots looked like they were copied from Thor, I do not think they could have been done better. The plot pretty much speaks for itself in this film. The concepts and theories that were introduced though were nearly mind-blowing to the audience and leaving you thinking when you walk out the theater. Again, time-travel is very tricky to deal with in films because you have to be so careful using it. Even the slightest mistake could end up ruining the whole story, luckily that did not occur and the story was rewarded because of it. Was X-men Days of Future Past the best X-Men? Yes, even better than X2. I very much recommend you see this movie in theaters and if you do, make sure to stick around after the credits.

Non-Stop," Another excellent action thriller with Liam Neeson
","Starring- Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Nate Parker, Scoot McNairy, Michelle Dockery, and Lupita Nyong'oNon-Stop 7.5/10- Action movie+Liam Neeson= Awesome film. Everyone should enjoy Non-Stop. The trailer makes you believe it is just a decent action movie, but it is much more than that. Mystery movies are truly an unappreciated genre in film and Non-Stop is the closest thing you can to a solid mystery movie nowadays. It is not in the Murder on the Orient Express territory, but it is a great 'who done it' type of film with action legend Liam Neeson at the helm. Part of the reason Non-Stop looks so appealing to everyone is that we have all seen Liam Neeson in this type of role before. He has no clue whats going on, but he is smart, and can beat the crap out of anyone. This is without a doubt Liam Neeson's bread and butter movie. He could have carry this movie if he had to, but thankfully the movie actually brought other good components to the table other than an A-list lead actor. Aside from the movie Flightplan, no other films have really taken place entirely on an airplane and the setting alone is a breathe of fresh air. Now to the plot, you know from the trailer that there will be a few twists and turns, but still the presentation of these twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat despite the fact that you knew it was coming. You really have no idea who the person sending him the texts is going to be. You think you have it figured out, but then the director knew you would think that and eliminate that option and keep you guessing. No one in the theater knew it was going to be who it was, not even me. The screenwriters must have known while they were writing the movie that Liam Neeson was going to be the lead role because they wrote in all of the advantages that Liam Neeson gives a film. Liam Neeson plays a federal air marshal who is just doing his job. Then, suddenly he has to spring into action after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfer $150 million into an off-shore account. The premise of this 'who done it' thriller alone is an impressive, bold idea that everyone loves and has definitely paid off. Liam Neeson no doubt gave a great performance Agent Bill Marks and after seeing this movie you will definitely agree that no one could have done a better job. Best action movie out right now. Anyone who likes entertaining movies will love Non-Stop. I encourage this movie to be your first choice heading into the theater.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7,0,1,22 November 2014
Gone Girl," Too Dark for my taste
","Gone Girl: Not since I saw Prisoners last year have I felt the way I felt after seeing Gone Girl. In certain parts it makes you feel horrified by what happened and how they showed it happening. It is probably the darkest film I have ever seen. For what it is though, it was very well put together. With creepy good acting from Rosamund Pike and well guided directing from David Fincher, Gone Girl successfully disturbs you throughout the whole film. Quick note: For those of you that read the book, the author of Gone Girl also helped write the film and in order to keep the readers interested, she changed the storyline and the ending. The reason I may not sound super enthused about this review is because I am not a very big fan of dark movies or scary movies in general. They just are too creepy for me. If you love those kind of films, I could not think of a better choice for you than Gone Girl. As far as what I thought the film could have done better, I cannot think of much other than to try to put a little more comedy in it so it would not feel so dark for such a long time. This way it would be able to appeal to much wider audiences. The acting speaks for itself in Gone Girl. Ben Affleck does a good job playing the psycho, unlucky husband. Rosamund Pike does an amazing job convinces us that she is certifiably insane. Even to a disturbing degree in fact. For those of you wanting Neil Patrick Harris to be playing a similar role as the one he played in How I Met Your Mother, you are in the wrong place. He is much more versatile than I could have imagined, as his role was completely opposite of what his role was in How I Met Your Mother. The only thing I kind of liked was the way the director plays the audience in the film. He makes you sympathize for one character one minute then make you hate that character the next, and visa versa. The great use of underscoring, selection of shots, and shock and awe moments were the key factors that made Fincher's directing of this picture successful. The author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn did a fine job supplying the necessary source material horrifying enough to have every audience member say 'what the ****!?!?'As I said before, if you like dark films, nothing will suit you better than Gone Girl. If not, I recommend you to stay away from this film.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",5,2,9,20 November 2014
Frozen," Best Disney film in 10 years!!
","Frozen 7/10- Coming in to this movie, I had no clue what to expect since the trailer I saw for the movie did not really give any key plot details. I had hopes for the movie since the directer, Chris Buck, also directed my favorite childhood movie Tarzan. I was pleased with the results. The first part of the movie got me thinking it was gonna be just a regular princess meets prince and they fall in love type movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie did not even focus on any romantic relationship as much as it focused on the relationship between the two princesses Anna and Elsa. Elsa has special powers where she can turn stuff into ice or snow. This movie makes that seem like a good thing at first, but as it wears on we see that Elsa cannot control her powers and now puts everyone around her in danger. She has to be isolated from everyone, including her little sister Elsa. Elsa does not understand why she can never be with her sister. Elsa one day comes out to be inaugurated as queen, but when her emotions get out of control, she puts the kingdom into an eternal winter and then shes flees to the mountains. Anna must go get her so she can get the kingdom out of an eternal winter. The movie gives a lot of very funny laughs that everyone can enjoy. The characters are all refreshingly original, but the way they are presented is probably what makes them all so likable. Now, just like every other animated movie, the characters at some point break out and start singing. Most of the time, this part of the movie I detest, but I found myself enjoying a couple of them. Don't get me wrong, I find that a character singing out of no where with no one else around to be silly, but at least the ones where the situation made sense for it, I enjoyed. The plot though is very cliché and I wish animated movies would at least try to make themselves different from the others. This movie is at least very fun which is more than enough for me. This movie is not as good Tarzan, but in my opinion, it is the best animated movie of the year.Frozen brings joy to nearly everyone in the theater at one point or another and it is no doubt a great family movie.

22 Jump Street," Funny, but not better than the first
","22 Jump Street 7/10- I loved 21 Jump Street to say the least, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Needless to say, I had pretty high hopes for 22 Jump Street. I was satisfied with the results, not overly impressed, but satisfied with the sequel. While 22 Jump Street suffers from sequel prone receptiveness, it still delivers on good humor, a well enough thought out plot, and solid chemistry from the lead actors: Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Even though this film says that it is basically doing the same exact stuff in the first one, if you do a joke a second time, it is almost never as funny as the first. The Hangover Part II definitely told everyone that. I get that sending youngish looking cops into a school demands some of the same routine, but I was expecting at the very least a different approach on it. Now, they did do a different approach on some of the routine, but if the director did this for all of it, the movie would have benefited. I also believe that this film lost some of the concepts that made it so hilarious to begin with. The main one being that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are just regular cops, not a couple of James Bonds where every little thing can cause an explosion. They played this well in the first film, but it seems like they forgot about it in the second film. There was other little stuff that bugged me, but that comes with every movie. The only other thing that I would have changed was the ending credits scene, which was funny, but over- extended. I thought the casting for this film was really done well. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have such great chemistry together that it is hard not to laugh when they are together. Ice Cube is an easy pick for an angry captain and plays it very nicely. Most of the returning cast was probably the best actors of the film, but the new members still kept the scenes they were in entertaining. The new gags were probably my favorite part of the film, I do not want to give any of them away, but they nearly had me on the floor laughing. I liked that 22 Jump Street was set on a much bigger stage, the first film had to do the ground work, but I was glad it was taken to a new level. With a new stage came a much broader range of jokes and gags that helped this picture differentiate from the original. It was also a nice change of pace to see Channing Tatum as the one having fun and Jonah Hill as the one who was having a hard time getting through the case (which is what I thought was going to happen in the first film). Football was a nice touch to the storyline, even if it was very hard to believe. The only thing I would have changed about it was to go away from the same cliché of football players being dumb, hard headed jocks. I thought taking Channing Tatum parkour skills to a new level was a nice change of pace. The plot twists kept you on your toes for most of the film and this Jump Street franchise still did well at making fun of the past buddy-cop Hollywood movies. Hands-down funniest movie out right now. Its been a while since a solid comedy has come into theaters and I recommend you take advantage of that and see this film in theaters(only if you like to laugh though).For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7,0,2,20 November 2014
Grudge Match," Sometimes it's so unfunny that it is sad
","Grudge Match 2.5/10- I came into this movie with much higher expectations than Sylvester Stallone's other recent movies. I thought it could be good simply because I think that Stallone can only act well when he is boxing and he has in my opinion one of the best and most versatile actors ever-Robert De Niro. I believed that with the two together, the movie would be at least passable, and that is what it is, passable. The first half of the movie was awful. They did not really mention boxing that much other than the fight between Henry 'Razor' Sharp, who is played by Stallone, and Billy 'The Kid' Mcdonnen, played by De Niro, that took place thirty years earlier in the first half. The jokes were off the mark and surprisingly Kevin Hart was not that funny. I was just really hoping that the second half would be better. Thankfully it was slightly better. The boxing scenes and training were at least entertaining enough to enjoy. Basically the second half of Grudge Match gets the audience to remember how great Rocky and Raging Bull. The thing that irritated me throughout the film was it seemed like the movie relied on the two actors previous roles in Rocky and Raging Bull to sell tickets. Someone should have told the director that it is nearly 35 years later since Stallone and De Niro's boxing movies and therefore they cannot be the same characters with just different names. The acting was not good to say the least. I think everyone could tell De Niro was not very interested in this movie because it was evident that he did not give his best effort. Sylvester Stallone is really just not that good of an actor and the studio knew that so they kept making references and quotes from Rocky to make him at least decent in his role. Too bad in did not work because I really enjoyed the most recent Rocky Rocky Balboa in which Stallone gave a great performance. Really the best part in this movie was Alan Arkin. But saying Alan Arkin gave the best performance in this movie is like saying he was the best looking person at an ugly convention, its just not saying much. Still, he was without a doubt the funniest person. The thing that was probably the worst about this movie was the plot. There are things that do not fit in the plot. I do not want to ruin the movie for you if for some reason you decide to see this but there are certain common points that sports movies tend to follow and Grudge Match is no exception, but there is no build up to these almost essential plot points. The movie is cliché to say the least, and I have no problem with that, but if they decide to make the movie with Robert De Niro beginning to change so he can have a better relationship with his son, he will not just out of the blue decide to ruin that. This is just an example, there are plenty more. This movie is terrible at the beginning but it does start to find itself toward the end, but unfortunately there is just too much bad directing, screen writing, and poor acting to really make this movie worthwhile. I do not recommend you wait till this movie comes out on DVD. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",3,3,6,23 January 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not as good as the first but still worthwhile
","Age of Ultron: Watching Marvel films, it is hard to deny it is a lot of fun. We all know the films will never win any Oscars(outside of a long shot Oscar for best visual effects). The first Avengers was the most fun many people, including myself, have ever had watching a movie. The action, story, characters were all outstanding and wildly entertaining. With this sequel, most probably found themselves expecting a worthy successor. Although the beginning starts a little shaky and the villain isn't quite advertised accurately, Avengers: Age of Ultron still delivers incredible action and fantastic visual effects to leave the audience satisfied walking out the door. I was pretty worried at the beginning of the movie. The dialogue was poorly-written and corny taking the audience away from the action and storyline. I was just hoping it would not be like this the whole movie. Thankfully, it wasn't but more on that in a second. Ultron, the new villain, in the movie was advertised as a very serious, powerful foe. Although Ultron is without a doubt powerful, the dialogue written for him was also very one-sided, and stupid giving no depth to the character. Yes, it is a 'robot', but he is also supposed to be a highly, artificially intelligent life form. Ultron should have been portrayed this way, but sadly they flip-flopped between and powerful and serious to stupid and unnecessary one-liners.As I said earlier, the movie had a rocky start but found it's stride after a few scenes. The thing Age of Ultron did the best, which not many other film franchises can did, is it found a way to balance all of it's characters. They have more star power than almost any film to date, and though there was not a lot of depth to some characters, we still got a feel at each and every character that was in the film. The thing that was the best move for the franchise was really exploring Hawkeye's character and developing the beginning conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. I do not want to give away any details, but suffice to say, it was enjoyable to say the least. The real reason most people come to see a film like this is because of the promised great action sequences. Between Hulk and 'ultra' Iron Man battling it out in the streets, Captain America hurling a motorcycle at an assault vehicle, and Thor knocking out over a thousand robots, great action sequences was surely delivered. Each actor did a good job as well. Robert Downey Jr. added his hilarious sarcastic humor to the movie and everyone in the audience appreciated it. Is Avengers: Age of Ultron as good as the first? No, but it is still a quality sequel and you can't go wrong with watching it. I recommend you see Avengers: Age of Ultron while it is still in theaters.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest,com",7,4,10,8 May 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Most surprising film this year!! Tom Cruise has still got it!!
","Edge of Tomorrow(Also known as Live, Die, Repeat) 8.5/10- When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked really stupid. It looked like a video game nearly. Then, the new trailer came out and showed the main concept of the film. I changed my mind about the movie and decided to give it a chance. I am very glad I did. Edge of Tomorrow is a well-made mix of Groundhog Day and a sort of Saving Private Ryan the way they storm the beach of Normandy(except in this film its futuristic invasion on an alien species.) Not to mention it has Tom Cruise leading the charge who has nearly mastered fighting extra- terrestrials on camera. I will get the bad stuff out of the way first. It was up to me, I would have gone with other fighting suits because most everyone agrees they look at least a tiny bit stupid and a little too much. The fighting suit situation is just something you have get passed in the film. Also, although I love the 'live, die, repeat' part of the movie, the repeat part gets to be somewhat exhausting at times. Still, the benefits of the repeat part of the film far outweigh the downsides of it.The special effects is something I and probably everyone expect at this point from a Alien- Tom Cruise picture. They are what they need to be, nothing more. The explosions and gunfire are all awesome but we have all seen them before. The only thing extraordinary that the special effects department did was the design of the alpha alien. The look and execution of the alpha alien is something that I have, at the very least, not seen very often and would like to highlight their efforts on this. The plot was the best part of the film because it provided so much to it. The plot paved the way for the good comedy that the movie needed, intricate storyline, and biggest thing was giving the audience something that we have not seen in a really long time. It may seem like a rip-off of Groundhog Day, but in my opinion as long the idea and storyline are executed well, Edge of Tomorrow has just as much right to the idea as Groundhog Day did.The acting side of this film is just like the special effects department, what you would expect from the film. The actors make you believe that they are who they are playing and all of that stuff. The thing I was wondering though is how Tom Cruise was really going to sell his role since this particular character he is playing is much different than any of the others he has played in the past. I was pleasantly surprised by how well Tom Cruise was able pull it off. He was able to express all of the emotions that would take place if something like this actually happened to a person. All of the anger, confusion, pain, excitement, everything all throughout the film. I thought this was easily his best acting in fifteen years maybe ever. Emily Blunt has ,without fail, surprised me by the diversity of her roles and how well she is able to play each of them. There are a couple of scenes in this film where she really shows a lot of the talent and potential she has to offer to the film industry and I hope she is recognized for this. I do not usually say this, but I advise you to listen to the critics for Edge of Tomorrow and it will not disappoint. I recommend that you make sure to see this while it is in theaters.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Amazing!!! Leonardo Dicaprio is incredible!!!!
","West: The Wolf of Wall Street 9/10- Think of the best Leonardo DiCaprio movie you have ever seen, now multiply it by infinite and take it to the depths of forever. Now you have a glimpse at how this movie will play out. I have never seen a movie like this before, it is the most dynamic and energetic movie I have ever seen. I do not understand why this movie did not get better reviews. Some people may have thought that it had no class and was vulgar with unnecessary language, but they should know that Martin Scorsese films have never just tried to be good while staying on the same line that all other movies do so that it is deemed acceptable to all. No, Scorsese sees that line and says the hell with you line, I will do what I want. He achieved greatness with this movie by doing so. I guarantee that no one in this movie was playing themselves, but they fooled everyone. They could fool themselves to believing that they were these unpredictable, drug addicted stock brokers who broke every financial law in America. Leonardo DiCaprio is probably the one of the few actors in Hollywood right now who has been great in every movie he has been in. He just has the raw talent that is necessary to number one. He delivered the best performance of his magnificent career in this film playing the once legendary stockbroker Jordan Belfort. He delivered a perfect New York accent and the way he was able to show all of the different versions of the character he had was truly amazing. I have given this a lot of thought and I think this might be the best performance I have ever seen in the history of cinema. I honestly feel bad for Jonah Hill because he gave the best performance of his career as well but when you put him right next to Leo, Jonah Hill's performance looks like a first grade school play. Still, credit should be given to Jonah Hill because I firmly believe that only a few people could play this role as well as he did. Jonah's performance in The Wolf of Wall Street is a million times better than his performance in Moneyball. Aside from those two, who were really the only people who were in the movie consistently, the acting decent. I do not think that anyone else in the movie did a bad job, but when you have a three hour movie and someone is in there for twenty minutes such as Matthew McConaughey, it's just not memorable. McConaughey still did the absolute best he could with the screen time he was given. The Wolf of Wall Street was not just some hard core drama biopic either. If you are a person, you will be nearly on the floor laughing throughout this whole film. Some jokes may cross the line for some people, in fact probably a lot of people, but if you anything about the real Jordan Belfort, this plot is an understatement. The one thing I will say though is that there are a couple of scenes that are not really useful to the plot or understanding the characters, but still, even The Godfather wasn't perfect. I wish Leonardo DiCaprio would win an Oscar for this film like he deserves, but sadly the Academy probably will not give him one because it as I have said before, just crosses too many lines that some critics deem disrespectful. Nonetheless, I believe that if you have a good sense of humor and are open-minded, I think this film will amaze you.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",9,2,6,11 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," It's good enough...
","The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies- As we come to the conclusion of not just the Hobbit franchise but to the Lord of the Rings universe as well, Peter Jackson's final installment has a lot to live up to. If you have seen the trailer or just look at the title, you can tell a lot of war will take place in this film and in turn, an enormous amount of CGI. The CGI was average at best, and even though it was eleven years ago, The Lord of the Rings had much better CGI effects (again, it is a lot to live up to). The acting was solid by every member of the film, which is saying a lot considering this is a very large cast. The story could have been better, but it was still entertaining. All in all, The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies may not be as critically-acclaimed and groundbreaking as Return of the King, but the film was satisfying enough to conclude the franchise.My main problem with the film is the lack of story involved. The movie is basically just constant fighting and battling and unlike the last Harry Potter film, there is very little depth taking place in the two-hour long battle sequence. All of this battling then forces the special effects department to CGI the hell out of the film in order for the battling to be entertaining. There is never really any build up in the fight, it is just the same thing one after the other. This makes the final battle sequence of the film to be far less dramatic than the director intended. The abundance of main characters in the film was also not handled well. They either needed to make the movie longer and give the characters more screen time, or cut out other characters. By doing so, the audience would actually be able to feel for the characters much more and get a sense of their development over the course of the film instead of just a couple of them.The acting definitely carried the film for me. Everyone gave a terrific performance and you could really tell the cast was having fun while they were filming. Martin Freeman was nothing short of spectacular as Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen definitely gave it his all as this was his last time at playing the legendary badass wizard Gandalf. The one who really surprised me though was Lee Pace who plays Thranduil, King of the wood Elves and father of Legolas. His performance was nothing short of masterful and without a doubt stole the spotlight in every scene he was in. All of the actors have also by now, come to develop great chemistry with each other and it showed on screen. Overall, the acting was the best part of the movie.Even though this film was not 'in my standards' great like the Lord of the Rings franchise, it is still wildly entertaining. When it comes down to it, that is all a movie has to be. I still very much enjoyed watching this film and I recommend you see The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies at some point while it is in theaters.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",6,0,8,21 January 2015
Thor: The Dark World," Set your expectations low!!!
","Thor: The Dark World 3.5/10- I loved all of the Marvel movies, with the exception of Iron Man 2, and I thought the trailer made this movie look awesome. It was an understatement to say I had high hopes for this movie. It hurts me to say this, but I left a little disappointed.The beginning of the movie to me did not start off well. I thought the idea of the movie beginning with Thor restoring peace to the nine realms was good, however, I could not stop but from thinking that it all looked silly. The costume design looked like it was just mashed together at the last minute and I thought they could have picked a better setting to at least add some tone of seriousness to the opening scenes. I did like how all the Marvel movie including this one continue to offer good laughs through out the film. Unfortunately, there is a time and place for those laughs. Thor: the Dark Work did a relatively good of monitoring where to put those jokes until the final fight scene. The final fight should have had some intensity to it. I'm not gonna lie, I did laugh along with everyone else, but I was still expecting something more. This part that I was waiting for never came and because of this, the movie felt incomplete. The brightest light of the movie to me was Tom Hiddleston. His acting continues to grow and I thought he was even better in this movie than in the Avengers. He is the perfect choice to play Loki, the devious brother of Thor who is not sure which side he is on. Hiddleston dominated every scene he was in. Chris Hemworth delivered another solid performance as the hammer-wielding God Thor. He adds good humor to the character and does the best with the story line that he is given. Natalie Portman does an above-average job at playing the pretty yet extremely clever scientist Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins seemed like he was not really giving his best effort as he was playing Odin, king of Asgard. Still, Anthony Hopkins worst is still better than most others best. The only time I thought the plot was well-written when the ending came which really got everyone in the theater thinking and that Tom Hiddleston's great performance finally resulted in something good. Now, just like any other Marvel movie, there is a scene after the credits. I was confused by what it meant, but I would be lying if it didn't leave me intrigued and excited for the next one. Was this movie the best in the Marvel series? No, not by far. Aside from its predecessors, the movie still offers enough good laughs and some solid action to make your experience entertaining. Still though, I was expecting a lot more than it gave.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",4,1,3,23 January 2015
Unbroken," Hoping for a lot more...
","Unbroken: I could not have higher hopes coming into this film. After seeing one of the most inspiring trailers I have have ever seen, I was expecting one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. Sadly, the film came up short. Some moments are inspirational, but a lot of the times the film just stayed on the surface- played it safe. It never really got to the level I was hoping to see. Yes, I know there is no more inspiring real-life story in the world than this one, but that is not the movie, that is what the real Louis Zamperini did. The movie cannot take credit for it. Unbroken is a film that will leave most satisfied enough but with poor directing and screen writing, this film is not a worthy enough picture to be made about the life of Louis Zamperini.When I asked most people what they love about the movie, most just say 'Oh, I thought it was really good, I loved the story.' The story is what makes the movie appealing but that is just what the movie is based upon. Its like saying 'I loved the movie because I loved the book.' If they actually thought about it strictly as a film, they will realize that the movie is not half as good as they have it in their mind. Why do I say this? Mainly because in the moments when the audience is suppose to get that feeling of courage and perseverance, I did not. I did not feel inspired. The first time director, Angelina Jolie, did not fully capture the moment in the film and I kind of fell like she just hoped we would feel inspired because of the story and of some patriotic duty. To make it worse she added in these stupid Hollywood scenes that never even really happened. Why would a the head of a prisoner of war camp ask you to hold a really big piece of wood and if you drop it you die? They don't. That never really happened. Yes, there is a special spot in hell reserved for that man known as 'The Bird', but even he would say it would just seem moronic to do that. It was just a cheap trick that the director tried to use in hopes of making the movie stand out amongst other war films.Alright, alright, enough of that stuff. I still did enjoy a few things about Unbroken. The main being the acting. Jack O'Connell, who plays Louis Zamperini, was the only one in the film throughout the whole thing, and he did a great job at what he had laid out in front of him. I believe he was a little misacted because he looks a little to Irish to play an Italian guy but that is not his fault. What he did with the role was very impressive. If directed better, his performance would have gotten more notice, but still I believe O'Connell shows much promise with this role and I think he might hit it big if he gets the right director. The rest of the cast all did well with the screen time they were given. Another thing I liked was the parts of the movie that focused on Louis Zamperini's youth. The flashback scenes of him as a kid and during high school were the scenes I feel were directed the best. They really conveyed his early upbringing well with the short amount of time they had to do it. If that kind of directing was continuous throughout the film, it would have been much better. I also liked the relationship between Zamperini and his fellow soldiers. In war, a relationship with your fellow soldiers is what keeps you alive and it is the main reason why you keep fighting. If they added in a few more scenes with this is mind, it would have served the film well. As you may know, this film takes place largely in a prisoner of war camp and has numerous scenes where the main character is getting tortured. As such, it is definitely not suitable for children and anyone who can't handle that kind of stuff. I recommend you see this film in theaters or on DVD, but you will probably enjoy watching it more at home.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",5,2,5,21 January 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," 10 times better than the first!!
","Starring- Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and Stanley Tucci, with Donald SutherlandWest: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 9/10- Many people were skeptical about Lionsgate's decision to bring Francis Lawrence as the new director to the widely anticipated sequel. In my opinion, they made a perfect choice. His style gave the film a whole new light that only made the movie better.The movie itself was made tremendously. They were able to show the Victory Tour in a very nice view that is how many people envisioned it when they read the book. The design for each District could not have been better even though we only saw a few seconds of each district. The arena was made incredibly. The design of the cornucopia and the water and forest surrounding it was amazing. The design of introducing each lethal part of the forest was done fabulously. All in all, the movie, in my opinion could not have been better. It is amazing to see how all of the young actors grew with their acting over such a short time. Liam Hemsworth's was given much more screen time in the new movie and he used every minute to his advantage. He really showed who Gale is in the Hunger Games. Liam Hemsworth's performance added very much to this movie. Josh Hutcherson is the perfect Peeta. Although his performance did not improve a whole lot from the first movie to the second, no one could have done a better job. Now we come to Jennifer Lawrence. She delivered an amazing performance that is worth praise. Her performance multiplied by ten from the first to second movie. Her ability to bring out how Katniss really is in the books should be worthy of an Oscar nomination. Now, the question that was on everyone's minds since they saw The Hunger Games was 'Who is going to play Finnick?' Sam Claflin answered the bell like a boss. He showed the perfect balance of playing the pretty boy of the Capitol while still have a very real human side to him. The sugar cube scene was very entertaining as it was Finnink's famous scene. He shows much promise for the next two movies. As usual the veterans of the cast: Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Banks, Stanly Tucci, Donald Sutherland, and even Lenny Kravitz all delivered a solid performance that fits each character very well. Was Catching Fire better than the first movie? Without a doubt yes, in every way. This movie is great for any occasion for all people.For more of my reviews go to my website at westandbeys.com",10,1,17,28 February 2014
Godzilla," Acting is subpar but special effects save the film
","Godzilla 7/10- We all know that the 1998 Godzilla with Matthew Broderick was a total train wreck and a pointless remake doing nothing except attempting to copy the original with no success. Now, since I have not seen all of the original Godzilla, I will not make any comparisons. Having said that, the 2014 Godzilla is a good stand-alone film that features near ground breaking special effects plus top-notch acting from supporting actor Bryan Cranston. Aside from the acting from Bryan Cranston, the rest of the acting was sub-par at best. Then again, Bryan Cranston is a great actor and anyone who is compared to him in this film will be put to shame, so I will try not to be too harsh. Still, I expect the other actors to at least try their best and it seemed apparent that in some of the scenes that demanding good acting, they did not. The plot was hard to follow at times, but that may be because the trailer was not bad, but misleading and has you searching for a different path while the movie keeps giving us all of these twists and turns. What I liked about the plot though is that Godzilla was not the only monster, he was not the only possible antagonist. In terms of choosing those types for the other antagonists, I felt like they could have done better since giant mantis looking dinosaurs are not very appealing, but this is all just my opinion. I will not go over much of the acting since most of the movie is special effects, but I would like to give a couple spotlights. Bryan Cranston, as I said before, gave a powerful, literally astounding performance that owned every scene he was in. I was a little worried that he would not be able to set himself aside from Breaking Bad, but no need to worry, he is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now and he shows that in this film. Aaron Taylor- Johnson did nothing special in this film, but it is hard to blame him since he was in the heavy special effects scenes. The only performance I really did not like was from Elizabeth Olsen because she just did not sell the role of her being a loving mother and wife, the same with Aaron Taylor Johnson in terms of father and husband as well. They are both very young though so I think it would have been smarter to either get older actors or to have the couple but not the kid. The rest of the cast did average but again their is only one Bryan Cranston. Now we venture to the best part of the film, the special effects. WOW, that is how I describe the special effects, WOW. I have not said that since Avatar. Just the shear size of Godzilla is something that really leaves in audience in awe. Then adding two other dinosaur/monster characters to the mix really gives the action scenes a lot more depth. I do not want to spoil the part that the entire audience agrees is the highlight of the film, but trust me the final part of the film, the final action is so good that this part alone is enough to see the movie. To put it simply, a lot of tremendous special effects with some fine acting with Bryan Cranston makes the movie very enjoyable to say the least. I definitely recommend Godzilla as your choice going into the theater if you want to see top-quality action film. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7,4,7,22 November 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Who doesn't love a good action movie!?!?!?
","Kingsman: The Secret Service- Today's spy movies feature too much goriness and unneeded intensity that the final product always turns out generically the same and adds nothing to the genre. To put it simply, they have no style. Kingsman: The Secret Service, I am very happy to say, is an exception. Stylish is the best way to describe this movie. It is the best spy film I have seen since Casino Royale. It is a breathe of fresh air to see a movie that perfectly balances action and comedy together. It is more like the Pierce Brosnan Bond films and in my opinion, those were the most enjoyable. With great action, witty humor, and great performances from the whole cast, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most enjoyable film of the year so far.Is it perfect? No. No film is ever perfect. The only flaw I could see though was some of the action sequences seem really far-fetched and hard to believe. I believe this is on purpose though. This is the quintessence of why kids want to be super-spys when they grow up. It so much fun and the spies always seem to do it with what today would be called 'swag.' The best aspect of the movie was, no matter what it was doing, it was doing it with style. It added something to the genre. Even though it didn't hold back on violence, it didn't focus on it and that was a huge difference in making it stand out from the other spy thrillers of the past. Everything going on in the film was so much fun. The action they did, no matter if a guy was getting cut in half or one guy was taking on a platoon of bad guys, no one ever had to turn away because it was never too much violence, it was just enough. The director, Matthew Vaughn, said this movie was in part a tribute to the old Bond films. He definitely did them an honor. The acting and action were both equally the best parts of this movie. Colin Firth by far had an incredible performance as the suave, badass Kingsman Harry 'Galahad' Hart. No one could've played his part better. The way he was able to carry himself throughout the movie was the same kind as the likes of Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery, and Daniel Craig. When I watched the trailer for Kingsman, I wasn't sure who the actor playing the main character was. Taron Egerton is his name and I believe the casting department did a great job at choosing an up and coming actor to play Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin. This way, the audience did not think of him as any other characters as they were watching the movie and were able to believe his transformation into a Kingsman very quickly. He delivered a great performance as Eggsy, and you could tell he was having a lot of fun while doing it. Be aware there is a good deal of violence in this movie. But, if you are a fan of spy films or good action films in general, I recommend you see Kingsman: The Secret Service while it is still in theaters.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Mild Max
","I have only seen bits and pieces of the original Mad Max films so I won't be making any comparisons between the two. Without a doubt, this was one of the most unique movies I've seen. I have never been able to say about a movie that it was the weirdest and darkest, but very well-made films I have ever seen until I sat down to watch Mad Max: Fury Road. Still, I felt very mislead because it didn't advertise the fact that there would be less than 150 lines of dialogue in the whole that definitely resulted in the lack of character depth and acting in the film. Despite some of it's shortcomings, Mad Max: Fury Road delivers in it's promise of a movie that is ninety-nine percent action with some of the most realistic effects ever seen on the big screen. I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy. I think he is a great actor whose best films still lie in front of him. But, if you are going to hire a great actor in a big budget action film, give him something to work with. It is pretty hard to act in an action movie when you get virtually one line of dialogue ever five minutes. I would not be surprised to learn that Charlie Theron(who has the most screen time) and Nicolas Hoult had more lines that Tom Hardy. I understand, I understand this is an action film, but that is not an excuse for lack of character depth and development in the movie. Yes, Max is just a 'Road Warrior' whose mind will always be the same, but that does not mean he has to be a static character throughout the whole movie. The only person whose character changed during the movie was Nicolas Hoult, a supporting actor. I feel that any good movie needs a good amount of character development to make the story interesting and exciting, especially for an action film. Enough about the bad aspects of the movie. Now, we are going to talk about the without a doubt best part of the movie, the action. So basically, the whole movie is one giant car chase with minimal breaks in between. Naturally this calls for some great action sequences. From what I read on the movie, George Miller(the director) wanted to use CGI very sparingly and use as much on-set action as possible to give the movie a very realistic style. He achieved action filmmaker Hall of Fame by using so. Never have I quite seen explosions and action sequences in a film quite like the ones in Mad Max: Fury Road. So many times during the movie, I kept asking myself 'how the hell did they film that?' The answer even if told to me, I probably still wouldn't be able to comprehend. The screenplay as I said before is mainly just one incredibly well-filmed car chase and since it is based in an apocalyptic desert wasteland where a warlord is hunting the main protagonist down, there can't be much clearly outlined direction says the plot is as Max said in the first few seconds of the movie, 'Survival.'Keep in mind that this movie is very dark in it's action with incredibly intense action sequences not for the faint of heart. If you can handle that though and like to see good action movies, I recommend you see Mad Max: Fury Road while it is still in theaters.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",6,2,8,28 May 2015
Draft Day," Decent football film if you do not expect much
","Starring- Kevin Costner, Jennifer Garner, Denis Leary, Chadwick Boseman, Ellen Burstyn, Frank Langella, and Terry CrewsDraft Day 5/10- I am going to take a guess and say that there are at least fifteen boring cliché sports movie that have come out in the past three years. I was almost sure that Draft Day would be a prime example for those. Fortunately, I was wrong. Draft Day may not be as good as Field of Dreams, but it delivers on a well-thought out plot given a decent amount of laughs the whole way through. Also, it has Kevin Costner at the helm delivering his best performance in five years. Let's clear up a few things first. The trailer makes it seem like that the director is an idiot because it says the Dallas Cowboys are winners. This film is set more like a couple years in the future where all of these things like the browns playing well and the cowboys actually winning are possibly (though it is extremely unlikely as long as Jerry Jones is there.)I would like to begin by saying that if you are not a sports fan, particularly football, Draft Day may not be for you. It does not really explain all of the workings of football that someone who does not a whole lot about football would need to know in order to enjoy the film. It also still has some of those cheesy sports scenes that we have seen a hundred times before, but even great sports films have these flaws as well. For those of you that do know a little bit about football, this movie is perfect for you. This film shows us all the work that goes into putting those all-star athletes on the gridiron. I have been a die-hard football fan my whole life and even I was surprised at all the inner- workings that happen before opening kickoff. The last-minute trading, the very well thought picks for different players, all of the pressure the general manager and his staff are under, etc... All of this was very entertaining and eye-opening at the same time. Honestly, the best part about Draft Day was the fact that we have not really got a refreshingly original football movie in a long time and Draft Day gave that to us. The thing that was the best part of the film for me was the directing. I really believe that he knows all of the ins and outs about football because i do not see how a movie like this could have been done without that knowledge. I would not be surprised if the director has been a football fan his entire life. The screenplay is also very well written and if you decide to see Draft Day, you will probably think there are a few holes in the script but they are addressed and actually give you an ending you do not see coming. Kevin Costner is the perfect guy for this film. He has this kind of role mastered at this point. I feel like he will be making a come back from that stream of awful movies he has done lately. Jennifer Garner does pretty well, but the role did not really demand much from her or the rest of the cast for that matter. I would like to shine a spotlight on Chadwick Boseman for getting in tremendous shape for this film. I easily believed he was an all-star defensive end about to be going in to the NFL. The whole cast does a good job a giving solid sports humor throughout the entire film. If you are not a football fan, this is not for you. But, if you are one you are going to love Draft Day guaranteed. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",5,0,0,22 November 2014
Furious 7," Paul Walker would be proud!
","Furious 7: Without a doubt, this is the biggest fast and furious movie to date. Everything is bigger. The action scenes are bigger, the car scenes are even faster, and of course, 'The Rock' is bigger. Furious 7 was already highly anticipated, and then tragedy struck, Paul Walker was killed in a car crash when filming. He will always be sorely missed and no one can ever take his place. Even though some of the dialogue and action might be a little cheesy, with great action and car sequences, Paul Walker got the send off he deserved in the series he dedicated his life to.What I mean by cheesy dialogue is primarily applied to 'The Rock's' lines in the movie. He still has a supporting role but it is not nearly as big as his role in the previous two films. To put it simply, his entire dialogue is a series of one-liners to show how big of a badass he is if for some reason you can't already tell. It is amusing still, but it gets slightly irritating after a while. Once he takes out a few helicopters single handedly, you forget those lines and just laugh and love the enormous action taking place. The trailer also clearly shows Jason Stathom who plays Deckard Shaw in this installment as the main villain, but he really is only sprinkled throughout the plot. He never really gets the same screen time Luke Evans, who played Owen Shaw, in the previous installment got. Nevertheless, in the screen time he gets, he acts like the ultimate badass that he is and we can't ask for anything more.The action and car scenes speak for themselves. In some of the tallest buildings in the world, we see Vin Diesel and Paul Walker practically fly a car straight through three of them and you can't ask for more than that. Sure, it might be outlandishly crazy but everyone should know walking into this movie that it is a hardcore action-car film, not an art film. The fight scenes are also pretty well done. Seeing Vin Diesel and Jason Statham going in a slow-mo glorifying fight to the end shot is incredibly funny and widely entertaining at the same time. The acting is what we have come to expect from each cast member. They all own their roles. They are their characters at this point. Sure, some may not consider it 'real' acting but the actors did their part for the movie and you can't ask for anything more. Also, as I said earlier, Paul Walker's send off really was tremendous and many of the audience members might actually find themselves tearing up towards the end as we all listen to the song 'See You Again,' which I think might be nominated for an Oscar for best original song. If you just want pure-thrilling entertainment with some laughs thrown in here and there, you should definitely see Furious 7. Since this is a movie where it is a hundred times better on the big screen, I recommend you see Furious 7 in theaters.
