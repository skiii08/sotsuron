Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Will anyone watch this for pleasure in 10 years?
","Hey, blindly loyal Star wars fans who have posted your love for this movie here: just what exactly do you see in this movie that will draw you back again and again as the first movie did?  The kid's all-thumbs acting?  The completely undeveloped relationship between Jedi master and apprentice?  The dull, unscary villains?  The human warmth of the scenes in which the kid leaves his mom forever without even a goodbye?  Trying to figure out which one is the queen dressed as her servant and which one is the servant dressed as the queen dressed as the servant (like it matters)?  Watching the best years of Ewan Mcgregor's career be wasted talking bilge about midi-chronthians or whatever they were?This is shockingly inept filmmaking, illogical even on its own terms-- Jedis blather so much about sensing the force, but Obli-Da can't sense a Dark Lord coming up behind him on a scooter-- and bad at everything we used to go to movies for (and even got a little from Lucas's early movies).  Lucas plainly doesn't know that what made the originals enjoyable was the presence of a character mocking the whole business (Han Solo); now he takes himself as seriously as those dull Star Wars imitations (Krull, The Dark Crystal, etc.) that followed in his wake.  There is nothing in this frantic, pompous kiddie adventure movie to suggest that he will be capable of handling the more serious themes of Annakin's temptation and corruption that are implicit in where the next two films will go-- you might as well ask the director of the Pokemon movie to do Godfather IV.  I look to the hype surrounding the next two movies with nothing but dread.",1,4,8,10 December 1999
Citizen Kane," So why do people say Kane is the greatest movie ever made?
","It's hard to see Kane plainly for the voices you hear on either side of you now-- the one telling you it's the greatest movie ever made, and the other one (represented by so many people here) asking, what's the big deal? Here's an attempt at an historical answer for why Kane has been regarded as supremely great-- and whether there is any justice in the claim.Throughout the 1930s there was a certain critical faction, especially in New York, that felt that the art of the cinema died with the arrival of talkies-- that movies got visually dull and politically timid in dealing with the important issues of the time (remember that the whole debate about whether Hollywood should make social problem/message movies like The Grapes of Wrath would have just happened when Kane was made).  That Hollywood had sold out for the buck, turned its back on geniuses like Griffith and Stroheim and the kind of cinematic art represented by German Expressionist classics like The Last Laugh and Sunrise.  The capper on the whole decade would have been the enormous hype for Gone With the Wind, a masterpiece of middlebrow sentiment that even the New York critics were cowed into tiptoeing around.  (Read the NY Times review, in which future Searchers screenwriter Frank Nugent feels compelled to argue, a bit nervously, why it might NOT be automatically the greatest movie ever made.)  Once in a while these critics had managed to make a certain smaller noise about a movie they felt met their criteria, such as John Ford's The Informer, which was about as good an imitation of a German Expressionist silent picture as Hollywood ever made.Along comes a New York theater figure, Welles, who makes a movie which looks like The Informer (even using a cinematographer who had worked with Ford and apprenticed under the cinematographer of The Last Laugh), but unlike the somewhat ponderously arty Informer has a much livelier American-feeling pace that links it to the tradition of American newspaper comedy-dramas.  Where cameras had been mostly parked at a two-shot distance for ten years, Welles uses his like a silent filmmaker, diving through skylights and burrowing in for mammoth closeups.  He plays with the medium by starting his movie with another movie, a newsreel, which he mocks brilliantly (and there were plenty of people in New York then who delighted in the mocking of the Time-Life empire).  And he dares to poke its nose into the personal life of a still-feared and influential figure, Hearst, at a time when, say, Hollywood could make a movie about the Dreyfus case 40 years before and still be too timid to say the word 'Jew.'  So not surprisingly, the critics, thinking that most of humanity thinks Gone With the Wind is the best movie ever made, jump all over a movie that seems to have been made just for them and say, no, HERE'S the greatest movie ever made.  As it happened, few agreed with them at first, but starting some time in the 50s, when the film started to be seen again at 16mm film societies, its reputation spread and as a result, where it wasn't even mentioned on the first Sight & Sound International Critics Poll in 1952, it has placed #1 every ten years since (though perhaps in 2002 it will finally give way, probably to Godfather I & II).But you look at it today... and you say, so what's so great about it.Well, in one regard it's suffered the fate of so many innovative films-- it has been influential to death.  (How many more Abysses and Mission to Marses can 2001: A Space Odyssey take before it suffers the same fate?)Within a very short time the German Expressionist-influenced look of Kane became the shadowy look of film noir.  The flashback-narration structure, which seemed very innovative at the time (although the critics would have all just seen it in the French film Le Jour se Leve-- but that may have been a bonus for Welles rather than a detriment), was also picked up by dozens of thrillers in no time.  (Go rent The Mask of Dimitrios if you want to see Kane practically remade as a crime thriller.)  And, of course, the idea of telling the inside story of a famous person's life is no longer the province of daring art, but of glossy trash like The Greek Tycoon and The Carpetbaggers.It took somewhat longer for Welles' camera style to be absorbed. For decades only a few maverick stylists like Stanley Kubrick used the camera like a pen the way Welles did.  But since the era of the music video and the Steadicam, suddenly everyone does.  Welles' style seems rather staid after you've watched the camera glide through the bar in Goodfellas, chase dogs through a grocery store in Raising Arizona, and stick up a pharmacy in Natural Born Killers.So what does Kane still have to offer?  Well, for one, a deep sense of mortality and moral decline and failure, an almost Shakespearean psychology, that's extraordinary in a 26-year-old filmmaker.  Second, a density and richness of visual imagery that deserves to be seen on the big screen, where Welles' and Toland's black and white chiaroscuro can be at its most seductive.  But before you go to it, rent a couple of ordinary movies of the late 30s-- best of all a couple of biographies or historical films, perfectly enjoyable in themselves, like The Life of Emile Zola or In Old Chicago-- and then, with their visual style in your head, try to recapture a bit of how Welles seemed to set the camera-- and the director-- free.",Null,1,3,13 November 2001
Underworld," Beckinsale surprisingly good, male leads surprisingly bad
","The pleasant surprise is that Kate Beckinsale in black leather and stringy hair is surprisingly game and credible as an vampire butt-kicking killer. The unpleasant surprise is that the male leads of this picture are, almost uniformly, godawful-- costar and love interest Speedman is a total block of lead, a Michael Lembeck for our time, while bad guy Brolly is unintentionally hilarious every time he scrunches up his mouth in a widdle-bitty pout and tries to be menacingly evil. Even Bill Nighy, who has done some good things, is a bland choice for the middle-aged King of the Vamps, he looks like Mr. Greenjeans in Halloween makeup, and proves a pale shadow of the character who probably inspired his casting, Corin Redgrave in the brilliant British vampire miniseries Ultraviolet. (Only Michael Sheen, recently seen as a swishy sort in Bright Young Things, doesn't embarrass himself.) All in all, this is a dull, backstory-heavy muddle with little to recommend it. Naturally, a sequel is on the way.",3,0,2,21 February 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Less irritating and less interesting than Reloaded
","By this third film the Wachowski brothers almost completely abandon the idea of The Matrix, not to mention the two stars who had led the first film (Neo and Trinity), and produce a black-oriented action flick set almost entirely in Zion. The result is a movie that is less irritatingly smug and confusing than The Matrix Reloaded, but also lacks any of the mind games that carried audiences through the first film and part of the second; it is now simply a Sci-Fi channel action movie with a bigger budget. If you care at all what happens to such fascinating characters as Morpheus, Niobe, Bane and Councillor West, well, here's your chance to watch them save the sweaty, bad-smelling Zion and keep it free for humorless black people. If you can't even remember who such unmemorable characters are, and wonder how the Wachowskis so badly misunderstood what made the first movie appealing, well, me too, my friend, me too.",2,1,2,21 February 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Another tedious Potter movie from Warner Bros.' factory
","Don't believe the hype-- while director Alfonso Cuaron may have provided a slightly more gothic feel to this third Harry Potter franchise Happy Meal, the guiding spirit here is still that of Warner Brothers' executive suite (and promotions department), and he is no more able to transcend the existing problems with these adaptations than a Lee Tamahori or a Michael Apted has been able to impress the stamp of his own personality upon the James Bond franchise.  Once again, we have an adaptation which races from plot point to plot point to make sure those following along page by page are not disappointed, but never catches enough breath to give any character or actor the time to actually win the audience over. The colorless Daniel Radcliffe remains as uninteresting as the average 13-year-old (it's as if the Bond series had begun with George Lazenby), and his friends are only slightly better.  Fine character actors demonstrate the value of their training, but is there anyone among us who could not imitate Alan Rickman playing Snape nearly as well as the man himself plays it, when he's given nothing with which to surprise us?  Likewise, the movie is full of details which seem as if they could be charming, but somehow never are-- so the paintings can move (an effect achieved rather cheaply by filming real characters and then overlaying a standard Photoshop 'Canvas' filter which doesn't even really look like oil painting), but do they ever do anything interesting?  (Yes, once, when a giraffe walks through half a dozen paintings at the same time.  But only that once.)  A sequence in which the same characters relive a day from another angle seems painfully flat and predictable when considered against the ingenious playing with time in movies such as Run Lola Run.Audiences have convinced themselves they love these movies-- you have only to read the bulk of the reviews here-- but it is hard to believe they will be long remembered, unlike the books which, however prefab some of their borrowings from Tolkien, Roald Dahl and Star Wars may be, nevertheless have real wit and charm as well as being viciously compelling pageturners.  Somehow the same plot on screen proves leadenly predictable on film. Perhaps someday someone will figure out why, and make a Harry Potter movie as good as a Harry Potter book.",Null,0,0,8 June 2004
The Mist," Even in black and white, a pedestrian mis(t)fire
","The one possibly distinctive thing about The Mist was shot down by the studio and can only be seen on the 2-DVD set: a black and white version. What looks like smog in the color version takes on a silvery menace of nothingness in black and white, and Darabont's intention here-- basically to make a Twilight Zone episode-- becomes clear and, at times, visually effective. Nevertheless, this is a misfire which owes most of its flaws to King's original story, but is not helped by Darabont's flat, unconvincing direction, which desperately needs a touch of Cloverfield-era rawness to transcend its TV movie feel. The blue collar locals are caricatured as dimwits who are more or less instant prey for a religious nutcase; and possibilities for dramatic tension between characters with reasonable opposing views are tossed away (the most intelligent opponent of the hero is done away with quickly). Virtually all the speaking characters quickly wind up in the hero's camp (even though we've seen little reason in their characters why they're all so rationalist and others aren't)-- yet the logic or necessity of the hero's choices are not at all clear. All that could be forgiven if the movie was... scary! Here we have to start with blame for King-- it's a real letdown that a mist that could have contained anything turns out mainly to have giant rubber bugs in it. The menace of the mist dissipates the moment we first see CGI tentacles. Add in the explanation eventually given for what's going on and this is Lovecraft Lite without a real sense of bottomless awfulness hiding in the Mist.",4,1,4,27 October 2009
Black Hawk Down," Frustrating-- a well-made movie about nothing in particular
","Black Hawk Down is so technically well-made and vivid in its depiction of the incredibly technologized way America fights wars, that it's frustrating how little it comes to in the end.  Mark Bowden's book hasn't been Hollywoodized in theconventional sense-- there aren't love stories a la Pearl Harbor or moments of wacky military comedy, as you might expect.  But it has been Hollywoodized in another way, which is, stripped of all geopolitical context on the assumption that an American audience would not be interested in anything other than the fates of some handsome young actors playing Americans (though many aren't,actually).  We're given little sense of the African side of things-- what the appeal ofwarlords like Aidid was, how the country has broken down and why you'd allyyourself with one strong man or another.  This led some critics to see the way hundreds of anonymous Africans are mowed down without a thought in themovie as essentially racist.  Yet it wouldn't have to be; they could be essentially an alien menace to the main characters and yet be granted a logic and even adignity of their own, as the Zulu hordes in Zulu are.  But to do that you'd have to understand them a little, and this movie seems profoundly incurious about Africa itself.  There also might be sharp points to be made about the clash of a highly technologized army with an almost pre-technology one (except for its stock of Western weaponry), but again, the lack of interest in the African side makes it impossible to draw such a picture.  The movie doesn't have to turn intoApocalypse Now, this was an entirely different war for different reasons, but it doesn't even seem aware that there's anything interesting about the contrast.In the end, what makes Black Hawk Down a frustratingly insubstantialexperience is that the real-life civil war in Somalia just becomes a prop for a story of movie guys in peril-- like an Alien movie, or that thing where Emilio Estevez and his yuppie buddies get lost in inner city Detroit.",Null,0,0,13 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Too literal, decidedly non-magical bore
","About halfway through Harry Potter 1, I considered walking out.  It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line.  It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard).  Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository.  Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year.  Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.
The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job.  He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity.  Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III.  Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing.  This isn't as awful a blockbuster as, say, Tomb Raider, but it comes from the same land of impoverished imagination camouflaged with booming, expensive yet somehow cheap-looking special effects.",1,17,45,15 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Utter, pointless waste of time, money, the universe
","Bottom line: George Lucas can't direct, he can't write, and apparently he can't hire a decent casting director or a high-def-video-cinematographer who can keep Natalie Portman from looking like a middle-aged Hispanic man, either. I suppose it's my own damn fault for failing to learn after the last Harry Chamberpot movie that when the media starts hyping a sequel as a big improvement on the $150 million pieces of crap that preceded it, they're merely trying to protect the parent corporation's investment. Relative improvement is still within the context of born and bred crap.The story is tiresome and unaffecting; taken as backstory, Darth Vader's evil personality and scarred body made him an impressive, relatively complex villain by comic book standards, but with his unhappy childhood and adolescence spread out in realistic detail over three films, it's as if Wagner had written three operas explaining what drove Colonel Klink to become a Nazi. Basically Lucas seems to want to make Godfather II (it is I, Francis C., who am the master now) and seems clueless that a comic book universe is not dimensional enough for that kind of story and character development. Of course, the fact that he totally pulls his punches and Annakin/Vader is a nice boy who is fooled into becoming a psycho killer by bad old Palpatine only makes his story that much weaker. It's as if Raging Bull ended with a reconciliation scene in which Jake LaMotta explained to his brother that being a world class jerk was just his way of showing that he loved him.The action scenes are so busy you can rarely even spot what it is that's going on, and even when you can, they reveal nothing, say nothing about character, amount to nothing. More than once we cut to some CGI marvel and I had no idea who or even what planet we were looking at. I guess the reason he called him Annakin Skywalker is because calling him Curtiz Skywalker would be such a blasphemous joke. However, in the interest of helping Fox and Lucas toward the extremely unlikely goal of recovering their investment in something so patently awful, I submit the following possible blurbs for the newspaper ads:'ALONE IN THIS CAST, EWAN MACGREGOR ALMOST MANAGES TO GIVE A PERFORMANCE!''AMONG HIGH-NUMBERED SEQUELS WITH CHRISTOPHER LEE, EASILY OUTSHINES Dracula A.D. 1972 AND POLICE ACADEMY V: MISSION TO MOSCOW!''IAN MACDIARMID GIVES THE BEST CAMPY OLD QUEEN PERFORMANCE SINCE Micheal MACLIAMMOIR AND HILTON EDWARDS IN WELLES' 'FILMING OTHELLO'!'",1,24,48,25 May 2005
