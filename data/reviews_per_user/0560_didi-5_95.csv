National Treasure: Book of Secrets," ridiculous yet entertaining action flick
","Sometimes you just want to see a film to be entertained and distracted from the boredom of everyday life, and National Treasure: BoS proves to be that distraction, a no-brainer which mixes some real history (the Resolute desks) with a lost world under Mount Rushmore, a professor in ancient languages (Helen Mirren) who has a love-hate relationship with her ex (Jon Voight), a vain writer (Nicholas Cage), descendant of an American Civil War hero and ex boyfriend of a 'New Woman', and lots of trips around the world to England, France ... oh, and a car chase with guns.It does what it says on the tin and is never boring. Clearly this would never happen in real life (the President is a lot more clever than Mr B for a start) but as an engaging saga, it fits the bill. The history links might make it a bit more cerebral for those who like that kind of thing, the others can just sit back and watch the FX!",7,1,4,28 February 2008
Vertigo," a frustrating classic
","Hitchcock's work remains interesting and this one raises various questions about the mind, psychosis, mistaken identity, mental breakdown, suspicion and possessiveness.  James Stewart and Kim Novak shine in the leads, and the plot moves along at a cracking pace, startling and intriguing the viewer. The camera tricks are effective and the ending is extremely well done.  It is saying a lot about the weakness of the human spirit within what starts as a simple (if unlikely) story, and grows to something beyond plot and linear thinking.  Along with 'Strangers on a Train', this is my favourite from Hitch's body of work.",Null,2,4,19 January 2003
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," finally ...
","Two drag queens (Guy Pearce as bitchy Felicia, and Hugo Weaving as Mitzi) and a transsexual (Terence Stamp, marvellous as the widowed Bernadette) make a trip to Alice Springs in a pink bus called Priscilla. 
Cue a soundtrack of mostly Abba songs (plus an off-the-cuff 'I Will Survive', and C E Peniston's 'Finally' - a great set-piece) and three towering performances.  From the initial hilarious premise we follow the trio through the Australian desert and meet the various inhabitants of places they pass through.  It remains fast-paced and touching within the comedy.  Wonderful.",9,30,42,23 July 2003
Walk the Line," light on story but the music is excellent
","This film follows in the footsteps of other biopics such as 'Ray' in presenting the story of country music's Man in Black, the late, great Johnny Cash, and his on-off friendship/relationship with the wayward daughter of the Carter family, June.As Cash, Joaquin Phoenix is perfect, with facial expressions and vocal technique on target throughout. His performances of iconic songs such as Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, and Jackson, are exciting and perceptive. Reece Witherspoon is much less irritating than usual as the jokey June Carter, and her vocals are excellent as well.The story starts with Cash preparing for his gig at Folsom Prison, where he recorded his best-selling live LP, and takes the form of a flashback to his early life with dad, mum and elder brother in the 1940s. We get some sense of where his roots were and where he wanted to go.With first wife and baby settled in Memphis, Cash heads off to Sun Records where he secures a record deal with the legendary Sam Phillips alongside Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis (both depicted in this film; Tyler Hilton is an OK Elvis, while Waylon Payne is excellent as Jerry Lee). From then on we watch his ascent into stardom and his descent into the grip of drug addiction; all the time shadowed by his faithful friend and singing partner June.The plot wears a little thin but is more than fleshed out by the fabulous musical numbers (filmed with real energy and mostly provided in full), and the central performance of Phoenix.Other notable performances in the cast include Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's frustrated first wife, Vivian; Shooter Jennings playing his father, Waylon; and Robert Patrick as Ray, the father who can never forgive his younger son for growing up.",8,2,4,5 February 2006
Gremlins," overrun by the mogawis
","In this daft movie, a teenage American boy gets an unusual creature for his birthday, a cute, furry little creature called a Mogwai.  There are just certain rules you need to follow like don't leave him in the sun, don't get him wet ... the fun starts as soon as the boy starts forgetting the rules.When the Mogwais become Gremlins and you realise they really are horrible little killers rather than the little cuties you thought they were, the movie gets really funny.  There's a scene where the Gremlins are singing 'Heigh Ho' which is hilarious.  The film also had a fabulous theme with all the little voices squeaking away together.  The creatures are far more memorable than the humans who appear (notably Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates).",Null,0,2,22 May 2004
The Sound of Music," How do you solve a problem like Maria?
","The greatest, best-known, most irritating and over-rated screen musical of all time - that's Rodgers and Hammerstein's last collaboration, 'The Sound of Music'. Julie Andrews is Maria, appearing on film again after her Oscar-winning triumph as Mary Poppins and her stage successes as Guinivere in Camelot and Eliza in My Fair Lady. Maria on stage had been the peerless Mary Martin, not quite as sugary as Andrews, but who could argue with this sweet-voiced screen version? Maria is in a convent but she isn't suitable material for a bride of Christ. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood, here I think dubbed for her rendition of 'Climb Every Mountain', considering her pure soprano years earlier) sends Maria out into the world to take charge of the Von Trapp children. Their father, the starchy Captain (Christopher Plummer) rules his household with perfect timing and has little love to give to his children - Maria is about to bring a ray of sunshine into their life.You know the big songs - 'Doh Ray Mi' (which seems to go on forever), 'The Lonely Goatherd' (while the children work with a puppet theatre), 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' (lovely performances in a summer house from Charmian Carr as Liesl and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe), and, of course, Julie Andrews spinning around a grassy hill singing the title song.Maria and the Von Trapps get caught in the second world war and have to ship out from the clutches of the Nazis pretty quickly. With the sugary musical backdrop to this war-torn drama stopping it working, this section of the film is sluggish in comparison to the joy of 'My Favourite Things'.",6,3,13,3 April 2005
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'ET Phone Home'
","I really wanted to like this film - along with many other pre-teens I saw it when it was first released and although some scenes remained in my mind (ET amongst the toys in the cupboard; the bike ride up in the sky; ET's squeaky voice) I was largely bored with it.Twenty years later I tried to watch it again (this time with Spielberg's changes such as guns becoming flashlights). Although there is no denying that the relationship between the stumpy legged alien with the wide face and the human children is a nice touch, and that the little fella is a cutie, the film just doesn't have anything to say to me.The kids - Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore - were fairly good, but not enough to keep the interest throughout. It is far too long before ET comes on to screen to keep the interest of its target audience, and the adults are just that little bit one-note. Cut through the hype and you might find this a bit dull, I'm afraid.",Null,3,6,28 November 2004
Casablanca," the problems of two little people ...
","Everyone remembers 'As Time Goes By' (the song that only stayed in the film, so popular culture has it, because Bergman had cut her hair for 'Joan of Arc', and couldn't retake scenes using another tune) but there is much more to this world-weary romance.Bogart, of course, was hardly the usual romantic movie hero.  Which is possibly what makes him so perfect for Rick, in his Casablanca nightspot, on nobody's side.  He spars with Claude Rains (the crooked police captain) and Sidney Greenstreet (a rival bar owner) like a trooper, has a quiet contempt for Paul Henreid (a freedom fighter) and Peter Lorre (a thief), gives Conrad Veidt (the Nazi Major) as good as he gets, is on the level with employees Dooley Wilson and Cuddles Sakall.Through all this, truly loves Ingrid Bergman (the beautiful Ilse, the love of his life).  It is their story, but not the story you might expect.  This is the secret, I think, of 'Casablanca' and its lasting success.  From the moment we see the map and the film title to the 'beautiful friendship' line at the end, we're hooked.   Every performance is a lasting joy.",9,5,7,11 July 2003
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," charming Disney although lacking songs
","101 Dalmatians is classic Disney in every sense of the word, giving each little puppy a characterisation and making us involved in the plight of Pongo and Perdita and their search for their stolen family.Cruella de Vil is evil personified, a smoke-breathing, wild-eyed monster looking for new ways to make fur coats. No animal is safe around her! Dodie Smith's book comes to life after a long journey in production and is well worth the effort. Despite most of the songs written for the film being junked before release, this film manages to enthral both children and adults alike, and is still better than the two live-action versions which were released in the 1990s.Funny, charming, beautifully animated ... and timeless.",6,1,3,10 April 2008
Lifeboat," high tension in the high seas
","***Possible spoilers***A wartime drama from Alfred Hitchcock, 'Lifeboat' is notable for the following reasons: it takes place in just one setting throughout, the 'lifeboat' of the title; it marked the return to movies of the husky-voiced, 40-something, Tallulah Bankhead, after years on Broadway, playing a hard-bitten journalist whose preoccupations are make-up, getting a good story, and getting what she wants; and it is filmed largely in close-up, adding to the claustrophobia of the small space in which the shipwrecked survivors and the Nazi captain of the U-Boat which sunk them find themselves.Tallulah Bankhead's forceful screen presence makes her character the nominal focus of the piece, right from the first time we see her, immaculate and alone in the boat.  Whether she's lusting after the resident bit of rough (hot-headed crewman Kovac, played by the gorgeous John Hodiak), sparring with the German captain (good but limited performance from Walter Slezak), or needling the factory owning millionaire (Henry Hull), your eye is drawn to her.  However, everyone in the movie gets their chance to shine (Hume Cronyn, Mary Anderson, William Bendix, Canada Lee, and briefly, Heather Angel as a bereaved mother).My favourite bits in this engaging movie include Bankhead's flirty writing of her initials in lipstick on Hodiak's chest alongside the tattooed initials of his previous conquests; Bendix's dreamy recollections of his dancing days with his girl; Lee's flute playing; Bankhead deciding to give up her bracelet for the good of her fellow survivors (and to help her get what she's after?) and Cronyn unpicking the ribbon from Anderson's hair and realising he is in love with her.  The scene where the German is eventually attacked and killed, however, seems contrived.  The camera pulls back and we're detached from the characters we've been close to until then. 
Not seen often enough these days, this 60-year old movie is one of Hitch's best.  It also represents career best performances for many of its talented cast.",Null,12,17,20 June 2004
To Be or Not to Be," wartime curio
","We're in Poland, just as a theatre company rehearses their production of a new play, 'Gestapo'.  The year is 1939, and the Nazis are about to invade and attack Warsaw.  The Turas, an indifferent acting couple (Benny and Lombard) are playing in Hamlet, and Lombard has an ardent admirer in flyer Robert Stack.Once the war begins the film takes flight into a fairly funny interpretation of mistaken identities and ham acting.  It also has its serious side, attempting to focus on the dark side of Nazism while simultaneously depicting its followers as buffoons.Good though it is, I'm just not sure what it is trying to achieve.  It isn't hilarious, it is more 'cue a smile' funny.  Jack Benny can be tedious at the best of times, but he is bearable here.  Carole Lombard is very good (of course this was her last role before being killed in an air crash a few days after filming wrapped), as are several of the support cast.  It is just ultimately a little disappointing - perhaps something more bitingly satirical would have made more sense?",Null,2,5,17 August 2003
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Python at their best
","Every creative team has a classic, and this is the Python peak - the story of Brian Cohen aka Brian of Nazareth aka 'a very naughty boy' aka The Messiah (allegedly) and his parallel story with the life of Jesus Christ.The script is tightly written, with a number of roles for many of the Python team (except Graham Chapman, who is in almost every scene as the hapless Brian) - giving the movie life and familiarity.  Perhaps the only bit which doesn't quite work is the appearance of the spaceship but it is sufficiently off-the-wall to be acceptable.Look out for a lovely bit by Spike Milligan, a true class act.  And enjoy both the snappy songs (especially the opening Shirley Bassey pastiche number) and the Tunisian scenery.",8,4,12,10 August 2003
Citizen Kane," the greatest film ever made?
","Somehow you feel like everything has already been said about this movie: often at the top of best of' lists, certainly regarded as the greatest first film ever made by any director, and the best of all the films to be associated with Orson Welles.  Of course he was only in his twenties when he not only co-wrote and directed Citizen Kane', but also appeared as the central character over a span of decades  from fresh-faced young entrepreneur to crabby old man of wealth, trapped in his white castle of mirrors and jigsaws.The structure of the film  a series of interviews about the man who has just passed on, plus incidents from his life in flashback  doesn't always come off, but for sheer scope and inventiveness this piece has few peers. We see Charlie' Kane right from the early moments of his life, when he is sent from his parents to a better life, fit to govern, through his highs and lows as a newspaper magnate.  We meet those who loved him, those who hated him, those who weren't sure.  We get swept along by the momentum of the movie.  Other films would be directed by Welles in the future that are worth seeing (The Magnificent Ambersons, plus his own takes on Macbeth and Othello with himself in the lead) but Citizen Kane' is the most memorable and the most important.  His own Mercury Theatre group play the various parts within the saga  names such as Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead, both of whom would have long careers after 1942.  Others such as Dorothy Comingore didn't live up to their initial promise but at least have left us this film to remember them by.  Citizen Kane' is certainly worth the time of anyone remotely interested in the history of film.",9,5,9,19 May 2004
The Birth of a Nation," mixed blessings
","It is really difficult to look objectively at this key moment in movie history, almost 90 years down the line.Griffith's greatest achievement has to be seen in its historical context to understand its lauding of the Ku Klux Klan; here was someone who saw the Civil War and the movements within it with glory and affection, and who undoubtedly had very different values to today's viewers.  This gives rise to what can only be described as a flawed view of the race question in America. However, I don't think that gives modern filmmakers the right to change or tamper with Griffith's vision.  It must be left to stand as it is, faults and all.Performance-wise, we have Lilian Gish and Mae Marsh, both perennials for Griffith, and both excellent, and the great Henry B Walthall, plus an entertaining short appearance from Joseph Hanabery as Lincoln.  There's also a small, showpiece role for the young Wallace Reid (as the blacksmith).  We have sweeping vistas of battles both in war and outside, we have imagination, scope, and energy not seen in films made prior to BOAN's appearance.  Yes, the politics are suspect - but this is film history, it is our heritage, and for that reason alone, BOAN has to be recognised for the great milestone it was and the influence it undoubtedly had on movies that followed.",Null,7,13,9 July 2003
Shakespeare in Love," comedy romp through Shakespeare's world
","This daft comedy, written by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, focuses on the young Will Shakespeare as he tries to write a new play to please Queen Elizabeth.  He is stuck with a title - Romeo and Ethel - but can't get this play off the ground. Still, all it takes is a real-life woman to give him inspiration.Shakespeare is played by Joseph Fiennes, a weak actor who is probably the most lacklustre performance in this movie.  The lady of his dreams, Viola, is played by Gwyneth Paltrow - very well - while other big names cluttering the cast include Ben Affleck, Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Judi Dench (who won her Oscar for an appearance totalling less than 10 minutes), Antony Sher, Jim Carter, Simon Callow, Martin Clunes and Tom Wilkinson, with Rupert Everett playing Kit Marlowe briefly and memorably.Not a marvellous film, but an entertaining one.  Viola of course eventually inspires the great play 'Twelfth Night' and, it is surmised, kick-starts the greatest creative period in Shakespeare's writing career.  All rot of course, although the story weaved around in this movie is intriguing and in places very funny.  Geoffrey Rush and Antony Sher in particular romp away with the comedy performances.  It's an ok film if you're in the mood.",7,1,2,23 May 2004
12 Angry Men," important landmark movie
","This is the famous courtroom drama starring Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam and Lee J Cobb which takes place largely in the jury room where the twelve men are discussing the likelihood of the young outsider having killed his father.  Of the dozen passing judgement, only Fonda has initial doubts, acting as the voice of conscience and coercion to change the minds of his fellow jurors.The film is rightly famous for its tight structure, economical script, and claustrophobic acting.  Perhaps Cobb's character is too extreme and more than a bit clichéd, but the types present around the table are well-drawn and convincing.  Prejudices tumble out and coincidences jostle to turn the initial premise completely on its head.  It is significant that on this hot day there are such a group of hotheads confined in one place.A remake forty years later was of some interest but this is the superior piece of the two.  A gripping play, done with economy.",6,2,7,7 June 2004
Beauty and the Beast," not a classic Disney film
","Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's songs provide the cornerstone of this cartoon, inspired in part by the 1940s film by Jean Cocteau. Much of the settings mirror those in the classic film.This film was a major money spinner for the Disney corporation, but for me wasn't up to the standards of the days when Walt Disney was alive. However, it was an enjoyable cartoon with interesting characters and a Broadway feel - indeed, it enjoys a second flush of fame as a stage musical today.I think 'Beauty and the Beast' was the last really good Disney film - 'Aladdin', which followed, was just disappointing. The legend survives intact - Belle and her Beast dance in a ballroom dripping with chandeliers; the teapot and cups sing a welcome when she arrives; and the girl gets her Prince to the swirling sounds of musical Americana.",6,2,17,27 February 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," very good realisation of a splendid book
","17 years after the first attempt to translate The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe into a live action film comes this big screen treat from Andrew Adamson, previously best known for Shrek.CS Lewis' book deals with four children, evacuated during WWII to the home of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), who find a magical world inside a wardrobe in a stately home. This new world is populated by mythical creatures (fauns, centaurs, satyrs, and dwarfs) and talking animals, and is ruled by Aslan, a Christ-like figure in the person of a talking lion.Narnia is in the grip of the White Witch, the self-styled Queen Jadis (played by Tilda Swinton). Curiously if all 7 books are to be filmed the story of how Jadis came to be in Narnia has been missed out (this is told in book 1, The Magician's Nephew, although The Lion... was written first). It is always winter and never Christmas, and there is a mysterious prophecy that states that the White Witch will lose her power when two boys and two girls sit on the thrones of Cair Pavarel.Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the quartet who find themselves placed to fulfil this prophecy. As such they have to carry the film, and are not bad in doing so. Little Georgie Henley as Lucy and William Moseley as Peter are very good indeed; Anna Popplewell as Susan and Skander Keynes as Edmund less so - but watching four children could easily tire the patience of an adult viewer and they were pleasing enough to watch.CGI is employed to produce the battle sequences and the talking animals. Aslan, voiced by Liam Neeson, is an impressive creation, but others - the beavers and the fox - are obviously fake. None of the other animals or creatures (save the centaurs) are sufficiently magical in the way characters in the Lord of the Rings series were; although the film more or less keeps to the story Lewis wrote, and James McAvoy puts in an appearance as an impressive Mr Tumnus.The screenplay does contain some howlers ('Gee up horsey' 'My name is Philip') but is basically very good. The soundtrack is largely modern, save an Andrews Sisters number early on (just to remind us we are in wartime no doubt). Thankfully someone resisted the temptation to follow the lead of the stage show which turned the book into a musical! What Adamson does well is to show us how the children develop to their new lives in a strange land. They meet the demands of battle and learn to cope with new friends and new dangers - the police are vicious wolves, Father Christmas stops to give them weapons of war, the Wicked Witch turns her enemies into statues; and there is the ritual sacrifice on the Table of Stone.A promising start then. I look forward to seeing other instalments in the series and hope this film is a success.",9,5,13,11 December 2005
Madagascar," slightly entertaining animal cartoon
","I must admit to not being a fan of the Dreamworks animations. They don't look particularly inventive, the voice talent is often at best distracting, or at worst, poor, and the stories are very sparse.Madagascar really is no exception to the rule. We first meet the heroes of the film - the animals - at the New York Zoo. Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is a zebra bored with captivity and longing for the freedom of the wild. Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) is a vain yet cowardly lion, happy to pose for the public in his cage, and so full of himself that he buys Marty little icons of himself as birthday presents. Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac giraffe, while Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) is an earth momma, keeping her pals in check.There is a also a small mafia of penguins in the zoo who want to go to Antarctica. These are funny and inventive characters, but a little at odds with the rest of the film.This film has its moments - the animals going on the subway to Grand Central Station; the squirrels and chipmunks who rule the island of Madagascar (the wild Marty is so keen on); and the film and TV references - Hawaii Five O, Born Free, Chariots of Fire, American Beauty, and more.But the characters are two-dimensional, the script is needlessly childish (yes, I know it is for kids, but give them some credit for having brains), and the film is pretty pointless, other than the same old 'you've got a friend' theme that pervades almost every film from the studio. The voice talent is just OK (and Ben Stiller in particular makes Alex irritating) and the animation is boring.Not one I'd rush to see again.",6,1,2,23 July 2005
The Other Boleyn Girl," same source but quite different to the TV version
","Philippa Gregory's novel comes to the screen for the second time, the first time being a small screen BBC production in 2003, using a 'confessional diary' style, and now on the big screen with a larger budget and huge name stars.Eric Bana (Troy, The Hulk) makes a rather bland Henry VIII, not big on personality or character. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen play the Boleyn sisters, the showy and scheming Anne, polished from the French court, and Mary, quieter and content to live a plain life away from court. As the older members of the Boleyn/Howard family, Mark Rylance, Kirsten Scott-Thomas, and David Morrissey make an impression, plotting to sell their family members as you would cattle for the amusement of men and the enhancement of family fortune.I preferred the original version in many ways, and some of the source novel was tweaked and changed to make more of a big budget statement, but this is not a bad film, it looks good and has obviously had money spent on it, it has good performances and, although historically shaky, tells an involving tale.",7,1,2,23 March 2008
Elizabeth," Historically shaky, visually stunning
","Having heard a lot of negative comments about this film, I went along purely on the strength of the largely British cast and what I knew of their previous work.  I wasn't disappointed.  Kapur's direction is a little irritating at times (a few too many overhead shots), but the film looks fantastic and the music, although perhaps not always from the right period, fits the visuals perfectly.  Cate Blanchett is a stunning Elizabeth, although I feel the insistence of the film to focus on the early part of her reign is a little disappointing.  And why no mention of Essex, Drake, or even Mary Queen of Scots, except in passing?  Best performances come from Chris Eccleston, Geoffrey Rush, and Richard Attenborough, but everyone has their moments and no one lets the cast down.  Well worth seeing.",9,3,6,11 November 1998
The Others," Intriguing ghost story
","This movie, starring Nicole Kidman as Grace, a deeply religious mother with two photosensitive children (Alakina Mann as Anne, James Bentley as Nicholas), starts with a mysterious trio of new servants (Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy and Fionnula Flanagan) being employed to look after the house, the garden, and to look after the children. The house is only lit by candles and the curtains must always be drawn in daylight, adding to the creepy feel of the piece.The music is minimal and help the effect when strange things happen. The twists - first we find that the servants died fifty years earlier of TB and are buried in the garden, then (twist on twist) we find that Grace killed her children and then herself and their spirits live on. The intruders are not the people we think they are! There are several hints to point to this when you reflect on the film - Grace's husband Charles, who was at war, appearing out of the fog in the garden and then disappearing; the curtains being taken down by persons unknown; the boy Victor squabbling with the ghost children over the light; and the photographic 'book of the dead' (the one photo missing being the one of the three servants).Does all this work? I'm not sure. There is certainly atmosphere throughout, and some shocks - but the ending felt like a cop-out in many ways. An interesting idea that just misses the mark.",8,1,2,12 January 2005
Troy," could have been a lot worse
","'Troy', directed by Wolfgang Petersen, best known for 'Das Boot', suffers a bit from the casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles and having him show off his buffed and toned body frequently. But it isn't chronic miscasting - not my idea of the famed Spartan warrior, but surprisingly convincing at key points in the story.The story of 'Troy', of course, really starts when Paris, a Trojan prince (a disappointing Orlando Bloom), steals away with Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger, whose chief acting talent lies in lowering her kohled eyes and looking sad), and in doing so, raises the hackles of her husband, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) and his brother Agamemnon, a power hungry king (played very well by Brian Cox). And so the thousand ships are launched and all the kingdoms of Greece go to war against Troy, a city ruled by the god-fearing King Priam (Peter O'Toole), father of both Paris and the great warrior Hector (Eric Bana).In a nutshell, that's it. Those of you who know the Iliad will find few surprises here, although the final act contains a few liberties with history. There are many well-known faces amongst the ageing lords and warriors of Greece and Troy (Julian Glover, Trevor Eve, Nigel Terry, John Shrapnel, and Sean Bean) so there's some fun to be had from spotting who plays who. Julie Christie also has a brief appearance as Achilles' mother, Thetis, and despite having aged considerably has retained her mysterious beauty from her peak in the 1960s. To my mind, though, the best person in the cast is O'Toole, in a tour-de-force performance as the doomed king - probably a role he could do in his sleep, but nevertheless engaging.As for Pitt, there's a touch too much posing in his performance as Achilles, but it could have been a lot worse. It is also significant that even with the removal of direct intervention from the Gods, they still figure heavily within the fears and beliefs of the men at war. 'Troy' is ultimately an action flick with dialogue to pad it out, but it could have been much, much worse.",5,4,8,26 June 2004
Brokeback Mountain," A slow-burner that lingers long in the mind
","The first mainstream gay western (Warhol's 'Lonesome Cowboys' can only be described as niche or cult), 'Brokeback Mountain' was the surprise hit of 2005, another triumph for the talented director Ang Lee (who also gave us such diverse films as The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon).Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the cowboys who start working together and find an intense sexual attraction which will continue to burn for twenty years. The film covers those two decades as we watch the idealistic Jack, who dreams of acceptance and a life with Ennis out on the ranch, and the tormented, disturbed Ennis (who remembers gay cowboys being murdered in his youth), who can't connect with anyone and anything other than his lonely soul.Extremely slow in pace, and all the better for it in an age of fast, rushed films for the MTV generation, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a love story just as valid as any other. For a mainstream movie to even address some of the issues looked at here is amazing, and the film benefits from sensitive direction, low-key romantic scenes, and total commitment from the leading actors. Gyllenhaal is better than he was in 'Donnie Darko', but he is overshadowed by Ledger, who shows here what a fantastic actor he was. It is a tragedy that his early death has robbed us from seeing this talent grow. Here in this film he resembles a young James Dean in 'Giant', playing older than his age with ease.Not an easy film to watch, then, but it repays close study and patience, and some of its lines and images will stay with you for a long time after the credits roll. Proof that intelligent cinema can still survive in the age of blockbuster action flicks.",7,6,6,10 April 2008
Ed Wood," Much better than expected
","This is truly a great little film, probably much better than any of Edward D. Wood Jr's movie horrors ... never a Tim Burton or a Johnny Depp fan, I was surprised by how good both of them are in this, but it is Martin Landau's hilarious and touching portrayal of Bela Lugosi which pulls this feature from the usual dross which passes for a good film in the 90s ... good stuff.",Null,0,0,10 May 1999
The Jungle Book," superb Disney
","What can I say about this that hasn't already been said?  It is extremely funny, with Baloo, King Louie, Shere Khan, Bagheera, Kaar and the other great characters (the elephants!).  The music is brilliant, full of hummable tunes.  The animation is colourful and full of little touches of genius (I love the expressions on the various animals' faces).  Then it goes off into a vein of sentimentality at the end which fits perfectly.  I also love the opening music.  Perhaps the last truly 'great' Disney film?",8,8,16,25 February 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," helplessly funny
","This Kubrick goodie pokes fun at just about everything from war counsels to bomber planes, and includes a famed triple performance from Peter Sellers - he was to have been 'King' Kong, the Slim Pickens role as well, but this idea was eventually ditched.  Aside from Sellers (for my money not at his best as Dr Strangelove himself, but as the President with the soothing voice 'now, listen, Dimitri ...'), there are some interesting names in the cast - George C Scott as the gung-ho general, Sterling Hayden as the mad brigadier Jack D. Ripper (ho ho), Keenan Wynn as the suspicious colonel, and the wonderful Peter Bull as the Russian ambassador.If you come to this film knowing little about it, you'll have a good time. And for once, even if you've seen the hilarious trailer, you'll be none the wiser.  Great use for Vera Lynn's 'We'll Meet Again', too.",Null,3,7,2 July 2004
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," gory, showy, black comedy, good performances
","Long-awaited and presented as a musical gore-fest, this 'Sweeney Todd' is excellent and does full justice to the Sondheim musical. Who would have thought that Johnny Depp could sing and put across the songs (Epiphany, Pretty Women, Johanna, etc.), albeit in a slightly higher register than some previous Sweeneys and with more than a nod to the vocal style of Anthony Newley and other Broadway greats? Who could have imagined the English rose, Helena Bonham-Carter, as Mrs Lovett, maker of 'The Worst Pies in London'? Johanna and Anthony, smaller characters,are soppy cyphers on the side but some other clever casting (Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, Timothy Spall as the Beadle, Alan Rickman as the Judge - his duet with Depp is a delight) makes this film extremely watchable. Yes, there's a lot of blood and the violence is graphic and realistic, more so than any stage production. Dark and brooding, this London is one of shadows, broken hearts, bitterness, and mystery.I miss 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd' though - theatrical though that song is, it sets the tone and acts as a chorus throughout the drama, and if you know the stage play well, you instantly notice it has been cut. However, there are more than enough Sondheim songs remaining, done well, and fitting perfectly with the way the film has been shot. The opening credits are also well done and appropriate.Maybe this is the first 18 rated musical, but it is a mix of genres which works well.",7,0,1,23 January 2008
The Best Years of Our Lives," wonderful post-war epic
","This is a home-coming tale of three WWII veterans, returning to the same small town.  One was a bank clerk who rose through the military ranks (Fredric March, who got the Best Actor Oscar for this, well-deserved) with an understanding wife (Myrna Loy, excellent) and daughter (Teresa Wright). One has lost his hands (Harold Russell, real-life veteran, putting in a touching performance) and struggles to cope with this and with his relationship with his girlfriend (Cathy O'Donnell).  The other was a soda jerk but has flown bomber planes throughout the conflict (Dana Andrews, in one of his best roles) and is now heading back to his pin-up wife (Virginia Mayo, a small role but an interesting one).We follow them on their respective journeys, often meeting up in Butch's bar (run by Hoagy Carmichael, who gets the chance to play piano, etc.) and often finding their paths cross.  The film comes in at around 3 hours, but it is time well spent.  'The Best Years' is not only perceptive and clever, with some great scenes, but also is innovative in some of its cinematography, thanks to the great Gregg Toland, master of the deep focus.",10,69,89,11 July 2003
Ocean's Thirteen," the flashiest Casino sting yet
","'Ocean's 13' is the first of the trilogy I have seen, so can't comment on whether it is any better than 12 or 11. I am familiar with the original Sinatra/Rat Pack movie, and 'Ocean's 13' certainly nods back to that. 'You shook Sinatra's hand. You should know better' is a payoff line near the end.Plot? Well, a Casino gets scammed. Big time. You do have to understand how blackjack, roulette, etc work to start with to appreciate the intricacies of the sting (and I got lost now and then), but the ideas are audacious and inventive, and fun.Our villain this time is Al Pacino, looking rather orange and playing nasty with relish. His sidekick is the purring and flighty Ellen Barkin, all pouts and wiggles like an ageing Marilyn Monroe. Amongst the heroes, the gang who pull off the scam, are George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Eddie Izzard (absolutely atrocious acting), and more.Performances are generally OK. Effects, especially an earthquake, are well-done. In-jokes and laughs are there too, and the film fairly drips with the Hollywood gloss polished all over it.'Ocean's 13' is OK. It's probably worth your time to spend a couple of hours in the cinema if that's your thing. It is formulaic and does what it says on the tin. There's no tension or doubts, really, but a slightly muddled ending lets it down a bit. I'd rate it average.",7,1,4,18 June 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," the devil is a bit of a bore ...
","Good enough in its predictable way, 'The Devil Wears Prada' doesn't haven't anything new to say about the shallowness of fashion, and only has two good performances - Meryl Streep as Miranda and Stanley Tucci as Nigel - to recommend it. Anne Hathaway, not particularly interesting at any time, is as wet as a fish here, adding nothing to the old tale of an 'Ugly Betty' made good with a bit of Chanel and Dior.All the clichés are here - the sulky, supplanted assistant; the ordinary Joe boyfriend; the glamorous other man who is after something for something; right up to the contrived ending, which any viewer could see coming a mile away. The film is OK for one viewing, but won't tax your mind or surprise you in any way.",6,0,2,13 July 2008
Romeo + Juliet," kitsch updating of the Bard
","This new and lively version takes a bit of getting used to, as the opening few minutes are in the style of a fast-moving, MTV style, news report, on gang warfare in Verona.Against this backdrop are Leonardo di Caprio and Claire Danes, both doing their best with the staring and sloshing around their characters have to do. Neither can speak the verse brilliantly, although both manage to be effective, perhaps because they have youth and beauty on their side.In support are Miriam Margoyles, Pete Postlethwaite, and others.  All adequate.But the best things in this Romeo and Juliet have nothing to do with Shakepeare.  First, there's the music - a lovely theme for when the lovers first meet, a drag performance for Mercutio with the disco classic Young Hearts Run Free, a church choir singing When Doves Cry - and the gorgeous visuals (the final sequences are in a shining gold palace of kitsch, there's a fishtank with lovely coloured fish, there's a large pool which helps move the balcony scene along ...).Don't expect a straightforward classical adaptation.  There's plenty of them around.  This is fresh and different and ultimately brilliant.",6,2,4,17 June 2003
The Passion of Joan of Arc," absolutely stunning

Bridget Jones's Diary," not really that interesting
","The overrated movie of Helen Fielding's newspaper columns and later book, 'Bridget Jones's Diary', flops onto the screen and never really goes anywhere.Renee Zellweger plays the annoying singleton who drinks and smokes a lot, mimes (badly) to junk like 'All By Myself', and thinks life begins and ends with a man. She gets two to choose from - love rat Daniel Cleaver (her boss, Hugh Grant, who flirts with her by email in the office) and sensible Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, in a part which gently sends up his Pride and Prejudice role of a few years earlier) - but, being Bridget, can't make up her mind.Is Bridget Jones an interesting character? No. She's a silly and empty-headed character, not even funny. I can't see the attraction. Grant and Firth are OK but both are playing clichéd characters. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are good as Bridget's parents, with Honor Blackman as a tarty co-worker, Sally Phillips as a journo who swears a lot, and Neil Pearson as a horny TV editor. There's just not much here of interest. It even snows conveniently at Christmas. Bridget Jones is something of a bore. I couldn't have cared less by the end of the movie who she ended up with and won't be rushing out to see the sequel.",Null,1,2,14 November 2004
10 Things I Hate About You," Taming of the Shrew for the teen generation
","Modern versions of Shakespeare can often fall flat on their faces, and there were times while watching this when I thought '10 Things I Hate About You' was one of those failures.Bianca and Kat, transposed to American high school and aiming to go to the Prom, mirror Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' characters to a point - however, this Kat is just a sarcastic, roll-eyes, typical teen we've seen hundreds of times before.This film's Petruchio becomes Pat, an arrogant rebel (played well by the late Heath Ledger in his debut movie role in the US). At first he pursues Kat (spiky but effective Julia Stiles) as a bet but, guess what, the path of true love ...One of the best scenes is the 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' song in the stadium, but even that becomes a cliché and despite its charm, doesn't really work.This film is OK. It has its moments and some touches (Kat's poem instead of her 'big speech') which work well, but in the main it suffers from the usual teen movie problems - bad language, cardboard background characters, tedious back-plots (which have little to do with the Shrew source).As Shakespeare for the masses it is fun, pacey, and fairly true to its theme. And perhaps that is all it should be judged on.",6,0,1,4 April 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," as good as you'd expect
","So, cutting through all the hype, and considering it as both a book adaptation and a film its its own right, has the Fellowship come up to scratch.Seeing lots of trailers and posters for this through the last half of the year, my first reaction was 'hmm, looks good'. I've always counted the trilogy LOTR as my favourite book(s) and so I couldn't possibly miss this film adaptation.Casting: I had reservations about Elijah Wood - for one thing, he's too young. Frodo was in his fiftieth year before he even went on the quest. *But* having said that Wood does convey some of the feeling that a small half-size hobbit would probably feel in dangerous surroundings - he acts a lot with his eyes and by the end of the film you are really interested in this little creature and his destiny. Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee as the old wizards were perfect - I really couldn't imagine better casting and if Sean Connery really was ever in the running as Gandalf then the producers must have been mad. Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean as the mortals - I always had a bit of a thing for Aragorn and this version is just fine; and Bean's portrayal of Boromir by the end of the film (actually an event from The Two Towers) works very well. The other hobbits and the elves are not drawn as well, perhaps this will be rectified in later films. But John Rhys-Davies's Gimli is just as you would imagine a dwarf to be in the pages of Tolkien. And the girls (Arwen - Liv Tyler, Galadriel - Cate Blanchett) are a bit more than the token decoration they were in the original book. Ian Holm is an acceptable Bilbo - again I had some doubt about his casting but I needn't have worried.Script - is fairly strong and moves along well. The only sticking point was 'let's go hunt some orc' but you can forgive a tiny lapse. Most of it is poetic, compelling, etc etc. All the major clichés when you really can't fault something.Camera-work and FX - exceptional. That sweep over little villages, the battle scenes (the opening battle even better than the fire throwers in Gladiator), the colour and the sense of the piece. I couldn't fault the Shire, Rivendell, the dark mines, or any of the rest of it.In conclusion, this lives up to the hype and more. It misses the humour of the opening chapters of Fellowship in part, but this is a small quibble indeed for such a great movie which could eat Harry Potter for breakfast. Go and see it. I can't praise it any higher than that.",8,2,4,18 January 2002
Grease," empty-headed 50s pastiche
","John Travolta's high voice and Olivia Newton-John's impossibly tight trousers as sweet Sandy Dee is on a mission to romance slick-headed jerk Danny ... the plot of 'Grease' is simple and mindless and the characters flat and one-dimensional.  The film is shot in the manner of an oversized cartoon and the caricatures played out by the cast (Jeff Conaway, Stockard Channing, Didi Conn in particular) are laughable.The music though does grow on you, although it has an artistic value of about -100.  Everyone knows 'Summer Nights', 'Greased Lightning', 'You're The One That I Want', and 'Hopelessly Devoted to You', although personally I like the wit of 'Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee' (often omitted from TV showings of the film), 'Beauty School Dropout' (drippily sung by former teen idol Frankie Avalon).Movie old timers Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Joan Blondell (her last film) are in the cast, and add a lot to the proceedings.  Otherwise it is fun, colourful, but totally empty.",7,5,12,11 January 2004

Apocalypse Now," 'Hearts of Darkness' flipped
","Whether you're viewing the original version of Coppola's Apocalypse Now', or the Redux version (which restored an hour of deleted footage from the 1979 release), there are certain things you remember:  the mad colonel shrouded in shadow (Marlon Brando in perhaps his last great movie role); the showy performances of the actors travelling through Vietnam (Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and especially, Martin Sheen as Willard  who replaced Harvey Keitel in the role and probably did it much better than he would have done); and the music  not only Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, but also one of the most effective uses of a single song (in this case, The End', by The Doors, which is just perfect).There are other images, too, of the war-torn province, the soldiers coming to terms with the ripping open of their souls  this is a war movie, pure and simple, yet there is much more going on here than is instantly apparent. Much better than Platoon' or The Deer Hunter', perhaps because it takes more risks and ultimately has a more lasting point to make?",9,4,5,18 May 2004
Being John Malkovich," unclassifiable
","I'd love to be able to pigeonhole this film, but I can't.  It really is that good.  The basic premise - a portal in a filing room on the 7 and a half floor of an office building leads into John Malkovich's head - is crazy, surreal, and weird.  Ok - this could never happen.  But, like Craig the puppeteer and Lottie his curly headed wife (Cameron Diaz!), we slowly come to believe in it.  Well, kind of.  Key to this is the participation of Malkovich himself, who at least shows he sees himself with some humour. Catty Maxine proves a draw for the man and the woman visiting the portal, which gives rise to all kinds of green-eyed situations (and a knock-out and extremely moving ending).  To get from A to B is hilarious, uneasy, and unlike anything else you're like to see.  Work of genius.",Null,1,2,31 March 2003
Gandhi," mesmerising biopic
","This film from Richard Attenborough was the second 1980s success story for British cinema, and rightly so, winning Oscars including Best Actor for Ben Kingsley - playing Gandhi brilliantly here.  Even if you don't know the story of Gandhi and where he was coming from, you can gain some understanding of and empathy with the man through this film.Famous faces appear in brief roles throughout, including Edward Fox, Trevor Howard, John Mills, John Gielgud, and Saeed Jaffrey.  Weightier roles go to Candice Bergen, Geraldine James, Roshan Seth (as Nehru), and Ian Charleson, and all have a chance to shine.  There's also a brief early appearance from Daniel Day-Lewis as the chap who hassles Gandhi for walking on the pavement in the company of the white reverend.A lengthy film and one which, of necessity, focuses on the politics of the time and the liberation of a state under the thumb of imperialist rule; but 'Gandhi' doesn't shy away from showing its subject as a human being and a man of integrity.",8,10,19,3 August 2004
Quantum of Solace," Bond goes Bourne
","After the brash and fresh take on Bond which appeared with 'Casino Royale' two years ago, expectations had to be high for 'Quantum of Solace'. But setting it as a sequel taking place immediately after the earlier film is bound to alienate some viewers, as well as causing confusion in later years when it is shown on TV as a standalone film.Daniel Craig is a gritty and tough Bond, with enough charm to reel in the ladies, but his fatal flaw in the context of the Bond series is his lack of humour. Rarely even a smile cracks those determined features. As an action man, he's probably the hardest nut of all the incarnations of the character. But action films are ten-a-penny, and the Bond franchise should be something that bit different to the likes of the Bourne trilogy.The Bond girls in this are OK, although one of them has little to do other than allowing 'Quantum of Solace' to take a nod to Bond history and 'Goldfinger'. The other is a tough cookie who has her own score to settle, giving her a shared motive with Bond for tearing up the world and blowing away the villains. 'M', in the person of Judi Dench, is worth watching as usual, being given a bit more to do this time.And, looking at Bond history again, was Vesper Lynd really the only woman he ever loved? Wasn't there a wife who was killed on their wedding day? 'Quantum of Solace' has lots of action sequences and a fair amount of gore, but it lacks energy and fun, and is therefore just that bit disappointing. I like Craig in the role, but next time I'd like to see a self-contained story with a bit more humour mixed amongst the bullets and the punches.And the theme song is awful!",7,3,5,23 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," Still the best film ever made
","This has to be my number one - sure, it's kitsch in places, sometimes it is like a bad soap, but its tragic, funny, romantic, epic and everything that has already been said.  I think the main four could not have been cast better and were probably giving their best performances (certainly it is on a par with Vivian Leigh's role in Streetcar and DeHavilland's role in Snake Pit).  Wonderful colour, music, atmosphere ... a four hour wallow I'd highly recommend!",10,3,4,12 August 1999
Mamma Mia!," A strong soundtrack, casting against type, and a few laughs
","As a musical, pure and simple, 'Mamma Mia' has the briefest and silliest of stories, backed up by a large selection of Abba songs (Super Trouper, SOS, Voulez Vous, Gimme Gimme Gimme, Money Money Money, Dancing Queen, The Winner Takes It All, Lay All Your Love On Me, Our Last Summer, Mamma Mia, etc.).Meryl Streep has a daughter about to marry, and a cloudy past which has left three possible dads - Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). Now you can imagine that when Brosnan was James Bond he never thought he'd be cavorting along to Swedish pop on the big screen - but despite his weak voice, he does OK - the same can be said for Firth, who seems to choose roles with such little discrimination it is no longer a surprise to see him in anything.Donna (Streep) also has two friends to support her - Julie Walters and Christine Baranski. Walters is as fun as ever, cavorting in her headscarf and singing appallingly; while Baranski is another Samantha from Sex and the City - chasing young barmen and struggling in her high heeled boots. Their scenes together and apart are hilarious - and Streep's singing cannot be faulted.Is the film any good? It is hard to tell. It is certainly fun, and funny. The direction isn't particularly inspired, nor is the screenplay clever or profound - but then, neither is the music of Abba. Taken purely as bubblegum, feel-good cinema, it does OK, and isn't as bad as you might have expected.",7,6,8,13 July 2008
Lawrence of Arabia," impressive
","This David Lean epic is often classed as a movie for the boys' but it has a lot to offer a mixed audience  topping his other lengthy work such as Dr Zhivago' and A Passage to India' this biopic of TE Lawrence took a gamble in casting the then relatively unknown (and extremely striking) Peter O'Toole in the lead role alongside Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer, and Anthony Quinn.  I think I am right in saying there are no women to be seen anywhere in the three hours plus of this film  it is to Lean's credit that the viewer doesn't necessarily notice this.Remembered for its strong visuals  the mirage scene in which Sharif appears from the desert mist, for one; the scene when Lawrence returns in Arab garb and is cheered by his army colleagues as a hero, for another  and stirring musical score (certainly among the greatest ever written)  this film doesn't shrink from presenting Lawrence as a rounded character with human failings like everyone else.  The longer cut released in the last few years underlines this complexity even more; and it still remains probably the best performance ever achieved by O'Toole.You do however still wonder what a version starring Dirk Bogarde would have been like (an abortive attempt some year before this version fell by the wayside).",10,1,4,16 April 2004

The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shimmering colours in places.  Loved it.",Null,0,1,5 December 2003
JFK," king of conspiracy theories
","The buzz created by this 'what if?' questioning of the Kennedy assassination led to a lot of negative press junking Oliver Stone's film as overheated tosh.  Using the real-life theories of Jim Garrison (played winningly here by Kevin Costner) the movie delves into all sorts of conspiracy theories involving multiple gunmen, duped decoys, split identities, and government cover-ups.Taken as a whole the film is watchable and pervasive, sowing serious doubts on the 'lone gunman' explanation of the murder.  Lee Harvey Oswald (another memorable performance from Gary Oldman) is seen as a patsy who died for the will of a much higher power; his murder so soon after that of Kennedy smacks of fanaticism and a need for the real killers to sell him out as the sacrificial lamb.  This is where Garrison's story is coming from.In the cast we find Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland (in an electrifying and impenetrable cameo), and Sissy Spacek all contributing to a tightly written drama of disparate theories that don't quite come together.  As entertainment, all this works fine.  As an attempt to rewrite history, it is perhaps too unwieldy to be of any real use.",7,3,16,16 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," the middle section keeps focus
","Film two in Peter Jackson's immense trilogy based on the Tolkien novel, which follows the various factions of the Fellowship following their split at the end of film one.  Frodo and Sam rely on Gollum (a superb CGI character based on the real movements and vocalisations of actor Andy Serkis) to take them on the last and most dangerous stage of their journey  to take the ring into Mordor.  The ring continues to expand its influence and drain Frodo of strength, changing his personality. 
Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas save the kingdom of Rohan from enchantment and destruction, culminating in the battle at Helm's Deep (itself a triumph of the work of the Weta Digital workshop, with a believable set of digitally created soldiers and miniatures).  And Pippin and Merry find themselves in trouble, first in an Orc attack and then with the weird treebound Ents in the forest of Fangorn.  Gandalf also makes a spectacular reappearance as we discover just what did happen after the Balrog snatched him from the cliff in Film one.Two Towers' is faster paced than Fellowship', as makes sense as the action moves closer and closer to the evil domains and away from the comfort of the Shire.  This transition has its effect on hobbits, men, elves, dwarves, and wizards alike.  Of the actors, Elijah Wood continues to impress as Frodo, drawn ever onward by an impossible quest.  Sean Astin gives the character of Frodo's faithful friend Sam a quiet dignity, while Dominic Monahan and Billy Boyd provide much-needed comic relief in appropriate places.  Also impressive are Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen, who let Gandalf and Aragorn develop into key characters in the drama.For a film that has no real beginning and no ending (but an interesting cliffhanger in the Frodo strand of the story) it holds the attention surprisingly well and sets the scene perfectly for the final instalment of the trilogy.",Null,0,0,29 November 2003
Schindler's List," how one man made a difference
","The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work.",7,9,14,25 January 2005
Stardust," is this a comedy or a fantasy?
","I had high hopes of 'Stardust' mainly because of its cast, and because of interesting preview trailers. However, now I've seen it, I'm a bit underwhelmed.Charlie Cox isn't the most interesting leading man in the world, and his quest to find a fallen star (Claire Danes, who has grown up a lot since Romeo+Juliet) for his 'one true love' Victoria (a tiresome Sienna Miller) is confusing and a bit silly.Many cast members are underused, notably those who play the sons of the King, and prospective heirs to the throne. Some casting is plain odd (is there ever a reason to cast Ricky Gervais?), although there is a nice turn from Robert de Niro as the pirate Captain who may not be all he seems.Special effects pale a bit to other fantasy films (Narnia, Harry Potter, LOTR) but they're OK, and it is always nice to see Michelle Pfieffer in a leading role.It just doesn't live up to its promise, perhaps because it can't make its mind up whether it is a send-up or the real thing.",6,1,4,4 April 2008
Amadeus," should it have been 'Salieri'?
","This film of Peter Shaffer's play is fairly successful once you get past the clunky opening scenes where Mozart and his intended frolic under the tables and swap indecent puns with each other.From a very tight stage production, Shaffer opens out the action to include real-life scenes and scenarios rather than the theatrics of the dukes in the chorus. Salieri is the key character here, the title of the film notwithstanding, and is gloriously played by Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham. Curious that Abraham didn't go on to get the meaty roles that should have been there for him.As Mozart, Tom Hulce is - in the early scenes - an irritating hyena, an overactive child. By the time of the Requiem and the closing scenes his acting talent truly comes to the fore, doing justice to the story and to the wonderful music. Elizabeth Berridge plays his wife Constance very well, while Roy Dotrice is a memorable Leopold (father of Wolfgang Amadeus). Jeffrey Jones is a twitchy Emperor ('too many notes!') and Simon Callow, Charles Kay, and Martin Cavina make their mark in smaller roles.The true star of this film though, is the music, and you get to hear lots of it, thanks to Sir Neville Marriner and a team of great musicians.",8,2,4,19 December 2004
The Longest Day," all-star war goodie
","In its original black and white (not the colourised version), 'The Longest Day' is a fine war story, a classy movie with a starry cast featuring the likes of John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, alongside Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Tommy Sands and other trendy pretty-boys of the time. The contrast between the featured actors works well.D-Day, the battle on the beaches of Normandy, has become the stuff of legend, the type of derring-do which makes as good a rattling adventure yarn as it does a warning sign against the mindlessness of warfare. In 'The Longest Day' we see small stories, and big ones. We see Americans, Brits, Germans, and view the conflict and the issues from all sides. There is pathos and humour.Directed with a sure hand by Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton, this film represents one of the best of its kind. Well written by Romain Gary and James Jones, it makes you think about what really happened during those momentous days of World War II. And for those of us who had family members who were involved in D-Day, this film does its bit towards making us proud of their contribution.",6,5,7,4 January 2005
Moulin Rouge!," weird
","Seeing this after all the hype had gone down - the moment you see the conductor over-enthusiastically going along with the 20th Century Fox theme you know 'this is going to be silly'.  The rapid visuals can be startling and quite amazing at times (although the speed is hard to take in on one viewing).  The songs in the main are well-chosen - Your Song, Roxanne, One Day I'll Fly Away, Like a Virgin, Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend - and well-performed.  I particularly like the way several sequences draw on other films and the way they were shot.  McGregor and Kidman are the performances you'll remember, although Jim Broadbent was fun.  A film of odd great moments (and an awful lot of, well, awful ones).  Something a bit too busy to want to see too often, and I think it will fare badly on TV.  Not the best film ever (and not Luhrmann's best either, Romeo and Juliet came out better) but not bad.  Interesting.  And definitely *very* weird.",Null,1,2,18 December 2001
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Outstanding Christmas animation
","'The Nightmare Before Christmas' has hints of A Christmas Carol about it, with its tale of The Pumpkin King (Jack Skellington) and his attempts to hijack Christmas in true Grinch-style.It's a musical animation, beautifully realised, first as Jack discovers Christmas, and then plans to destroy it ... but will be succeed? Some lovely set pieces including the flight over a Christmas Eve sky, the Bogeyman's gambling lair, and the Edward Scissorhands-like desolation of empty spaces, work well, alongside more obviously comic pieces involving Jack's dog Zero, with the red nose to light up the sleigh.This being a tale in the true festive spirit it does have the inevitable character development and redemption we have come to expect from versions of Scrooge over the years.

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The power of the people ... or of TV?
","It is interesting to watch this film alongside the more hysterical and consumer-driven 'Network', as both are concerned with the autonomy or otherwise of network news divisions.'Good Night and Good Luck' centres on the McCarthy trials and the witchhunt against Communist sympathisers in positions of influence and/or power. Few people or occupations which had security or public facing roles were left untouched by these hearings, some of which are presented within the film in archive footage.Presenter Ed Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly stuck their necks out to start a crusade against McCarthyism, while being castigated as pinko sympathisers by the right-wing media. Their intervention led McCarthy to be investigated by the Senate, and set the cornerstone for in-depth, impartial journalism.Filmed in black and white, and using several songs of the period to scene-set and balance out the wordy script, 'Good Night and Good Luck' manages to portray a period in time when television was becoming the new opium to the people, capable of influencing and skewing debate and popular opinion.Like 'Network', it seems that at first freedom of speech is to be sacrificed to the whim of advertisers and corporate sponsors, but Murrow and his staff took a gamble, a huge one, in giving screen time to the issues of civil liberties for the individual.Clooney's film is tightly written and devoid of any modern camera trickery. It just presents a good, strong story, without gimmicks. In the current vogue for CGI and action, this can only be a good thing. And every performance is textbook perfect. Well worth watching.",8,0,1,4 March 2007

Her husband (played by Sam Neill) is a man without  much understanding, who tries to break the connection between his new  wife and her piano; in contrast to him is the wild illiterate Baines  (played by Harvey Keitel), a tattooed loner, who reaches into Ada's  soul and helps her to regain contact with her emotions and ultimately,  her voice too.  The film is visually compelling, with its muted colours and wide open  spaces, and uses the soundtrack by Michael Nyman in such a way so all  the elements fit together. Keitel and Hunter give excellent  performances within a sensitive and sensual screenplay, while Anna  Paquin is impressive as Ada's wise daughter, always watching and always  aware. Campion managed to make the story touching, involving, and sexy,  and it well deserved the plaudits heaped on it.",9,56,86,4 March 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," a successful remake!
","One of the better films to come out of the remake factory, Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's beloved book is an unqualified success.Setting aside memories of the 1970s Gene Wilder Willy Wonka, here we have Johnny Depp with ghostly pallor, squeaky giggle - altogether a more creepy and weird prospect (and very like Michael Jackson, whether this was intentional or not).Charlie Bucket - cute little Freddie Highmore - is so obsessed with Willy Wonka and his factory that he has built a replica in his house. he only gets one choccie bar a year but hopes to find the elusive Golden Ticket which will get him into the factory. The first four tickets are snapped up by stereotypical kiddie horrors - Angustus Gloop, who just eats and eats; Veruca Salt, a spoilt brat from Buckinghamshire; Violet Beauregarde, gum chewing, kick-boxing American champion; and Mike Teavee, obsessed with the flickering box in the corner of the room and his noisy Playstation.Of course Charlie gets his ticket, too (it wouldn't be Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if he didn't) and off we go into an inventive trip around a magical, crazy place populated by numerous identical Oompa Loompas (lots of computer generated Deep Roys singing and dancing in formation). The fun as ever is seeing how the horrid kids get their just desserts during the trip.Illustrious casting (James Fox, Helena Bonham-Carter, David Kelly, Liz Smith, Christopher Lee) and fabulous special effects (the Great Glass Elevator; the river of chocolate; the trained squirrels; the Oompa Loompas), together with Dahl's dark humour, make this a confection to be savoured.May be a little scary for the smaller child, but this is a surprisingly good film. Wonka's character is a little more developed than in the earlier film, and although the ending has been tweaked in true American saccharine fashion, it works. It has the feel of a Christmas release rather than a summer blockbuster, but there's nothing wrong with that.I especially loved the Oompa Loompas' different musical styles for the songs, from disco to heavy metal - inspired!",9,5,8,21 August 2005
The Insider," Crowe and Pacino together
","Forget Russell Crowe's performance by numbers in 'Gladiator' (good though that film was), and enjoy his acting talent here alongside Al Pacino.  Both men give inspired and classy masterclasses in how to put a character across. 'The Insider' is unusual, it is long and wordy (not often the case in modern movies), it has a superb soundtrack - 'Sacrifice', in particular - and it makes you involved, makes you care.Curious, then, that a Roman epic outshone it.  A good epic, but not in the same class.",Null,63,94,9 July 2003
The Dark Knight," dark, daring, and dynamic
","The hype has been OTT, but for once it is justified. 'The Dark Knight' is all you've been led to believe, and more. Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, the vigilante looking after the streets of Gotham by night, and this time he has a new and dangerous foe, The Joker (played by Heath Ledger, of more later). This nemesis takes the Batman series into chilling territory, far beyond the bam! bang! of the old 60s series with Adam West. It's never been quite this dark before.Is this a film for under-twelves, as the British certification suggests? Absolutely not. For a start, it is wordy, with an intelligent script and involving characters, which might get little ones fidgeting. Then there is the violence - mostly implied, but unpleasant and set to give shivers down the spine nonetheless. You see some gore and through jarring music, sound effects and shaky video footage you can imagine a lot more. The worst thing in marketing this film to a young audience is glorifying knife killing, if you view a psychopath as a hero.Bale is OK, a little dry as Bruce Wayne, but more than adequate. Michael Caine reprises his role as Alfred and is not bad at all, although someone prepared to do another accent might have been interesting. Maggie Gyllenhaal is slightly annoying as Rachel, but since her character isn't there to do much, it doesn't really matter. And Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman are solid in support as Harvey and Gordon.Back to Heath Ledger. The publicity surrounding his performance in this has reached ridiculous heights due to his early death at the beginning of the year, but he really does steal the film and pull off an amazing performance as a truly nasty villain who manages to be comic in the blackest of ways as well. Whether walking away from a blazing hospital in a nurse's uniform with a detonator that keeps jamming, or taunting police officers from the floor of a jail, or standing in the path of a motorbike bellowing 'Hit me' his performance is absolutely electric and by far the best thing about this film.Could another actor have made the same impact? I doubt it. And that's what gives 'The Dark Knight', for me, the edge over other blockbusters this year. Seen on IMAX screens, it is also mind-blowing in its effects and scope.",9,9,19,17 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," something is missing in this film but I can't decide what
","This is the first Harry Potter film I have seen, with no prior knowledge of the series or the books. Perhaps not the best place to start, but with the considerable recaps of what has gone before, 'The Order of the Phoenix' proved reasonably easy to follow.What's missing is an emotional core. Daniel Radcliffe does not convince as Harry, a superwizard in waiting. He may be without his full powers but he does appear weak and unchallenging, with moments of bravado which do not sit well with the rest of his character. Having a child character carry a film is always going to be a problem - as it was for the Chronicles of Narnia as well - and in comparing Harry Potter with, say, Frodo Baggins, they are worlds apart.The plot is in some ways derivative of the classic good vs evil battle - as seen in LOTR, Star Wars, and others. The flashbacks are overdone and the characterizations sometimes too much like a cartoon - particularly Imelda Staunton's Doleres Umbridge. And is that really Emma Thompson in thick jam-jar glasses? And Ralph Fiennes without a nose? The classy cast is perhaps the biggest draw for mature viewers of the Harry Potter series (we have Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, David Bradley, Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, etc.) but with a few exceptions, they didn't really convince, only made me think of other roles they've done which were so much better.Special effects - the class conjuring up rabbits and horses and the like was impressive, as were the final scenes of fight and destruction, and the twins' firework display. But the miniatures were sometimes obvious, which is a shame.In pace, the film drags for long periods and gets bogged down in pseudo philosophy or silly jokes. The two strands don't really fit together.",6,2,5,25 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," its all a bit weird
","You don't need me to go over it all again, the Blue Danube, the monkeys, the embryo, the singing computer.  It all comes together so well in its strange little way.  The first time you see 2001 you come out confused, remembering the way the music and the images fused together, how space travel comes out as a cross between biblical allegory and psychedelic trip, but you want to go back and see it again.  Yes, it can be slow in places.  Yes, the ending is open to interpretation and probably makes no sense.  But the very fact you remember it must make it a good piece of work.",8,2,5,27 November 2001
Pride & Prejudice," Jane Austen at speed
","Another adaptation of Austen's most famous novel makes it to the screen, with a mix of nationalities in the actors, and a fair bit of cropping of the plot.Matthew Macfadyen is an excellent choice as Darcy, a bit more vulnerable and a lot less pompous on the surface than earlier portrayals of the role have been. Keira Knightley is good as Lizzie, as is Rosamund Pike as Jane. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, although strange choices for the Bennet parents, do very well.As with every version of a much-loved book, there are bits which come off better than others. The trip to Darcy's estate, the rejected proposal, the ball scene, are all very good.And the locations are excellently chosen and beautiful.Just avoid the US ending - yeuch.",7,3,5,2 May 2006
Singin' in the Rain," truly terrific
","'Singin' in the Rain' is rightly regarded as one of the most fondly regarded musicals of Hollywood's golden age.  Not only does it contain four superb performances (Gene Kelly as vain silent screen idol Don Lockwood, painfully making the transition to sound; Debbie Reynolds as Cathy Selden, a chorus girl who wants to be a great actress; Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown, the dependable friend who puts fun into the movie; and Jean Hagen as the screechy Lina Lamont, Don's erstwhile co-star) but is an affectionate tribute to the birth of the talkies.The best scene of all is of course, Gene's dance down a rain-sodden street, much anthologised and by far the most technically accomplished and totally joyous piece of musical cinema.  I also have to mention the Broadway Melody sequence, featuring the great Cyd Charisse - perfection itself.",8,4,7,21 June 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," curious, perceptive, memorable
","Charlie Kaufman has another hit on his hands here, with a sprawling and unusual screenplay about two characters who 'erase' each other from their minds, only to find what they were searching for in the first place.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are not my favourite film actors by any means but they both turn in performances which fit within the weird fabric of this story.  Carrey plays Joel, a misfit who doesn't entirely fit with the world; Winslet plays Clementine, with unusual hair and ideas.  They fit clumsily together.  The process of erasing any memory of someone completely from the brain raises a number of interest questions: would anyone want *any* memory to be completely wiped?  Can the technique be used for purposes of abuse?  What does the brain really retain as 'a memory'?  The nature and depth of relationships with others is also examined within the chaos of images which move backwards and forwards, into vague and defined memory, and between reality and fantasy.The film is cleverly put together, both funny and perceptive, and I'm glad to say, very good.",Null,1,3,7 May 2004
Chariots of Fire," the British were coming ...
","At the Oscars when Chariots of Fire did exceptionally well for a British film at gong handing out time, writer Colin Welland announced 'The British are coming!' and predicted a renaissance for the UK.  We might have had the odd success since (notably Gandhi the following year) but nothing on the scale expected.  So, is Chariots a good film?  Viewing it again recently, I think it has held up well since 1981.  Everyone in it is really good, the music of Vangelis and Gilbert & Sullivan fit as soundtrack at various points, the story of the two students running for their own personal reasons (Harold Abrahams because he feels an outcast as a Jew in a predominately Gentile world, Eric Liddell because he feels his talent is a gift from God and runs in God's name) is an interesting one, and the intelligent script and rounded characters give the film some backbone.  The only cast members really to benefit from this film long term were Ian Holm (already known from films and theatre) and Nigel Havers.  The others have tended to drift and occasionally surface in small roles, and sadly Ian Charleson, Brad Davis, and Jeremy Sinden are no longer with us.  The ongoing popularity of this film is a tribute to their memory and showcases their talents well.",9,2,3,14 May 2003
A Clockwork Orange," a disturbing film
","Kubrick had veered towards the disturbing in his movie plots before (the paedophilic in 'Lolita', the insane and corrupt in 'Dr Strangelove', the menace of technology in '2001').  In 'A Clockwork Orange' he takes this to the limit in his story of Alex Burgess, a cultured psychopath (he listens to Beethoven and speaks in an unusual patois to his 'droogs') who is seen carrying out various attacks, rape, and eventually murder over two nights, before he is sent to prison and added to an intensive programme of torture and rehabilitation.  The first third of the film deals with the atrocities he carries out before his arrest, but the bulk of Kubrick's vision centres on the methods employed by the state to turn Alex into a reformed character, incapable of response and filled only with the desire to do good.  After release he leaves only to find further torments await. 
The characters, apart from Alex (played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell), are little more than cyphers, cartoon characters on the periphery of his life.  These include Warren Clarke as one of his 'droogs', Adrienne Costi and Miriam Karlin as his victims, Steven Berkoff as a police thug, David Prowse as a sinister carer, and Clive Francis as the oily lodger who has taken Alex's place in his parents' flat.  Only Patrick Magee as the liberal writer who plays a pivotal role in Alex's life early and late in the film has a meaty role amongst the remaining cast.  Is the film any good, and worth the hype after all these years of officially being unseen?  Hard to say.  Kubrick uses music again to good effect as he had throughout '2001', and the message from Anthony Burgess' original novel comes through.  However, 'A Clockwork Orange' has to be viewed with mixed feelings, both for the subject matter and for the antihero himself.  My guess is the final jury will remain out for a long time yet.",Null,1,2,8 June 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Proves Tom Cruise is no actor
","I admit that Mr Cruise is not my favourite screen star by any means, and this is the only film of his I forced myself to sit through to the end, mainly because of the fact it was Stanley Kubrick's final film.Using a celebrity couple to play the leads doesn't work at all, and the soon-to-split Cruise and Kidman have no chemistry whatsoever in what is trying desperately to be a daring, racy plot.  Trouble is, it is neither. The best bit was probably the orgy scene and that reminded me of something from The Story of O anyway (where it would have been done much better).A huge disappointment, Eyes Wide Shut meanders all over its three hour running time and goes nowhere.  By the end I didn't care enough to tie up loose ends.  Far from Kubrick's best.",Null,1,4,14 July 2004
Pretty Woman," not a bad role for Julia Roberts
","Julia Roberts is irritating at the best of times, but in 'Pretty Woman' she is even watchable, as is Richard Gere.  It isn't a great film, perhaps not even a good one, but it is enjoyable fluff - empty-headed plot, silly twist on the Cinderella story - which uses two assets (Roy Orbison's title song, and 30s star Ralph Bellamy as the guy who runs the firm Gere is after) very well indeed.  My favourite bit though is when Roberts goes shopping and turns from tarty hooker to high-class escort lady.  And of course, as this is a fairy tale we can guess the ending pretty early on, no paying attention required!",Null,1,2,14 January 2004
Some Like It Hot," the girls in the band
","A comedy classic from Billy Wilder which regularly comes in at the top or near the top of 'funniest of all time' lists, this feature has many assets. First, there's a sweet and infectious portrayal by Marilyn Monroe of the lonely singer Sugar, on the hunt for a rich man.  Then there is the chance to see Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag for much of the movie - Lemmon, as daft Daphne, looks a fright but puts in a great, bubbly, comic performance as the girl who really does snare her own millionaire; while Curtis, as the overly made-up Josephine, sashays about with some style, while also appearing as a mock playboy who talks like Cary Grant (allegedly).George Raft is the gangleader the 'girls' are running away from; while Joe E Brown is great as Daphne's beau Osgood, a man who after lots of marriages to show girls will marry just about anyone!  The script piles on the laughs thick and fast, while Marilyn gets to sing songs like 'I Wanna Be Loved By You', 'Runnin' Wild', and 'I'm in the Mood for Love'.",8,3,5,2 May 2004
Pulp Fiction," pulp trash that put Travolta back in the money
","The world of movies did not begin and end with 'Pulp Fiction' and Quentin Tarentino is not a genius.  That aside, and taking this movie as what it is, a penny dreadful on the screen, it does become perversely enjoyable. 
There's the cafe where 50s idols serve dinner (Buddy Holly, Marilyn Monroe, Mamie Van Doren, Jayne Mansfield) and where Mia (Uma Thurman) and Vincent (John Travolta, undergoing a renaissance after years out in the cold) dance the twist to Chuck Berry's 'It was a teenage wedding ...'.  There's Vincent's hip black partner Jules (a sleek and cool Samuel L Jackson), and the town's big guy - and Mia's husband - Marcellus (Ving Rhames).  And then there's Butch, who gets the film in an interesting twist part way through, and he's Bruce Willis, who was everywhere the time this movie got made.And there's the inept hold-up duo - Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer - as 'Ringo' and 'Honey Bunny', the really chilled Mr Wolf (Harvey Keitel), and a cameo from Tarentino himself as Jimmie.  Does all this mean the movie is any good? Well, there's a body in a car without a head, and an o/d to Urge Overkill's 'Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon', and Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.  It's a comic party with f words.  Salivating kids may boggle at this and call it the most influential film ever - it isn't, but it is one of the most referential.  'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Jackie Brown' didn't come close, and 'Pulp Fiction' is, for what it's worth. QT's best to date.",4,9,24,8 August 2004
Titanic," Titanically Awful
","'Titanic' looked so promising, but personally I would say it is the worst film ever made.  Not only does it lay aside any consideration of real stories that happened on the ship, but it constructs a piece of ridiculous class-divide mush instead!Leonardo di Caprio (excellent in Romeo + Juliet) and Kate Winslet fail to convince as Jack and Rose, a boy from steerage and a girl from first class. And Billy Zane was downright embarrassing as Rose's stuck-up fiance.  There were some good performances - Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, even Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose - but they are few and far between.The biggest problem I had with the film though was the god-awful script and scenes.  Corny lines ('as we walk through the valley of death'/'could you walk a little faster?').  The scene in the car where the windows mist up just at the crucial moment.  The ridiculous pose at the head of the ship. And perhaps worst of all, the clean water and the fact that Winslet keeps travelling in the lift - downwards - as the ship floods.Watching 'Titanic' for me was a total waste of over 3 hours and an excruciating experience.  May I never have the misfortune to see even a minute of it again.",2,4,13,11 February 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," moments of magic and imagination make this a superior movie
","Overshadowed by the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring when it was first released, this opening entry in the Harry Potter franchise is quirky, magical, and full of charm. Daniel Radcliffe, as Potter, shines as the boy wizard just beginning to realise his potential and his fate.Special effects are memorable - the constant stream of letters luring Harry to Hogwarts, the snake pit, the colour changes of house colours, the game of Quiddich. And the acting is stellar from veterans Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris (when comparing his Dumbledore to Michael Gambon's it would have been fascinating to see both actors tackle the character at all stages in the series to see how their interpretations would develop; sadly Harris died after film two, necessitating a cast change).Not as stunning as LOTR, nevertheless there is plenty in the first Harry Potter to interest adults and delight children.",7,0,1,12 September 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," Attaboy, Clarence!
","One of the all-time Christmas classics, this excellent piece of work from Frank Capra focuses on George Bailey (James Stewart, in one of his career-best roles) who is stopped from jumping into the river in despair by a friendly angel called Clarence (Henry Travers). We then see in flashback what has brought George to the brink of suicide and key events from his life - saving his brother from drowning when the ice breaks; alerting his chemist boss to a fatal mix of drugs; courting and marrying his childhood sweetheart (the winsome Donna Reed); and dealing with the film's token bad guy, Mr Potter (brilliantly played by the crusty Lionel Barrymore). Clarence then shows George what the sleepy town of Bedford Falls would have been like without him and proves that you're never alone if you have friends around you and if you make a difference.Interestingly, two direct influences from this film were on the poetry e-zine 'Zuzu's Petals' (George Bailey's little daughter, who leaves some flower petals in his jacket); and, so it is said, on the children's TV programme, Sesame Street (Bert and Ernie, the mad puppets, who are the names of the cop and the taxi driver in this).And let us not forget, when you hear a bell ring, it means an angel has got its wings!",5,8,17,1 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Year 2: dark, intriguing, and with a touch of comedy
","High marks again for the special effects in this second instalment in the Harry Potter saga. The three leads are reasonably OK, although Emma Watson's Hermoine tends to grate on the nerves just a bit and Rupert Grint's Ron is always wide-eyed and frightened, odd for someone with magical powers.Still, there is fun to be had here. Kenneth Branagh's Lockhart is good value, as are the Malfoys, while Harry's snake charming and Myrtle the ladies' loo ghost provide some distraction from proceedings at the school. Also excellent is Dobby the CGI house elf, who manages to cause havoc just by trying to save Harry's life.Flying cars, numerous spiders, a plot against Hagrid, and the wisdom of Dumbledore (sadly the final appearance of Richard Harris in the role, who then died and was replaced by Michael Gambon) bring life at Hogwarts to life again, while moving on from introductions to bring a touch of menace into the drama.",6,0,0,31 October 2007
All Quiet on the Western Front," pure excellence in the war movie genre
","From the fact it was made in 1930, you could class 'All Quiet on the Western Front' as a war movie museum piece, but Lewis Milestone's film is a seminal piece of anti-war propaganda, focusing on the Great War from the perspective of a group of German soldiers, in particular Paul Baumer (Lew Ayres).  Ayres gives a sensitive and powerful performance: by the 2nd World War the actor chose to serve as a medic, where he gained distinction.Remembered for the sequence with the butterfly at the end in particular, this early talkie manages to set its scene and transmit a powerful message. An involving and clever film which on its recent restoration and cinema re-release has taken on new significance in the 21st century.",10,50,59,2 March 2004
Love Actually," superficial, actually
","**Spoiler Alert**Another step down the road of disposable bubble gum British film, creating a fairly enjoyable, if lightweight, way to pass the time.  Eight stories weave around the barriers to true lurve (language, age, class, gender, etc etc) and place their top-notch cast in a rather disappointing confection.Best amongst the cast are Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister (his dance through 10 Downing Street to the Pointer Sisters' 'Jump' is a hoot); Colin Firth as a writer who meets a Portuguese girl while holed up to finish his novel in France; Alan Rickman as a bored, unfaithful office manager, with Emma Thompson as his long-suffering wife; Liam Neeson as a widowed father coming to terms with his changed circumstances; and Bill Nighy as a truly awful has-been singer making a comeback with a cheesy cover of Love is All Around.  Rowan Atkinson also features in a nice cameo as the shop assistant from hell.The soundtrack is pretty good, too (Nighy's effort aside) and includes the gorgeous 'Both Sides Now' by Joni Mitchell.  There are also many cultural references (Ant and Dec, Michael Parkinson, Blue, Britney Spears) which will no doubt puzzle future movie-goers.  Still, fluff like this isn't built to last.  It's predicatable, trashy, naff, and - grudgingly - impossible to dislike.",Null,3,7,2 December 2003

The final scenes are just perfect.  Clever stuff indeed.",9,0,1,29 June 2000
A Hard Day's Night," fun movie
","Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, this is the least pretentious of the Beatles' movies, more or less mirroring their own story and featuring many of their most popular songs  along with the title track (even if it does bring back memories of the crazy send-up by Peter Sellers), there is I Should Have Known Better', All My Loving', Can't Buy Me Love', and She Loves You'.Alongside the mop-tops playing themselves, this energetic movie also features Wilfred Brambell (Albert Steptoe) as Paul's grandad, as well as John Junkin, Victor Spinetti, Deryck Guyler, and  eek  Lionel Blair.  The boys themselves can't really act but can at least play themselves  getting fan mail, giving performances, dealing with kooky fans, a typical day in the life'.  A Hard Day's Night' is fun and perhaps the most accessible of their films to non-Beatles fans.    I still can't say I rate Paul McCartney though  all eyebrows and enormous ego  the others come out of this movie better.",Null,15,22,15 August 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," very very good version
","Have to say it, I wasn't sure I'd like this movie and in fact have been avoiding seeing it for several years.  But, on first viewing - it's terrific.  I have the Lugosi oldie and I love that too and the book also, but this adaptation had beautiful visuals and music, great performances (oh, except Keanu.  Sorry), and was in turn horrific, quite frightening, raunchy, sexy and incredibly moving.  One of those films where at the end you take a moment to come back down to reality.  Never thought I'd rate Winona but she really delivers the goods in this one and of course, another great performance from Gary O in the days before blockbusters were the only time you saw him (damn).  I was impressed by a film that can be so beautiful and so thoughtful and so well done in an age of noisy rubbish full of action and effects.  So 9 out of 10 :)",Null,2,4,18 December 2001
Jaws," Horror meets Moby Dick
","A genuinely scary opener.  John Williams' tremendously effective score. Spielberg's masterly direction.

Never a boring moment - great cast, unique experience.",9,0,1,5 November 1998
The Wrestler," the surprise festival film slightly underwhelms
","Showing at the London Film Festival as the surprise entry in the programme, 'The Wrestler', a film I would have avoided had it been listed by title, has interest purely because it provides 80s favourite Mickey Rourke with a powerful leading role. And he's good as ageing extreme wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson.It's just a shame that a/ the storyline is somewhat predictable: central character with medical flaw which could curtail his life? check; tart with a heart as a kind of love interest which doesn't really go anywhere? check; sulky teenage daughter with goth clothes and hate in her eyes? check ... b/ that there is as much gore shown as there is. I didn't think it was justified, although of course the subject matter means we have to see some of the life in the ring.So it gets five stars for five things. First,some memorable scenes - Randy in the deli having fun with the customers, Cassidy and Randy shopping for a present for his daughter, Randy and his daughter dancing in a derelict building on a catch-up trip, the contrast of the sheer violence of the ring with a little kid playing with his doll figure of 'The Ram'. Second, a pulsing AC/DC soundtrack which really works. Third, Rourke's performance, which is excellent even if the film isn't. Fourth, for its style and energy. Fifth, for keeping exactly to a scenario we could see coming from the opening few minutes, but doing it in such a way that it isn't necessarily boring.Not my cup of tea, then, and too violent in places, but 'The Wrestler' is a solid enough film of its type. Just not my type - but it is good once in a while to see something outside of your comfort zone.",5,7,31,27 October 2008

His only friend is a little grasshopper, until a mysterious ship lands and leaves his a potential mate, EVA.Great animation and a lovely, if unusual, love story, make this cartoon a little bit special.

Blade Runner," all hail the director's cut
","Intelligent sci-fi.  Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a replicant exterminator (or is he?); the replicants are Daryl Hannah, Sean Young, Brion James, and best of all, Rutger Hauer - who gets the best closing speech, all that guff about lights and stars.  The other replicants are ok, particularly Hannah with her wild hair and her acrobatic attacks.Blade Runner looks great in its futuristic, claustrophobic bubble, and even Ford's cardboard acting can't spoil the mix.  The director's cut removes his dull narration and is the better for it.  This movie is reasonably intelligent science fiction, involving and interesting.  It has images which linger long in the memory years after seeing it.",7,2,4,15 March 2004
Ben-Hur," epic to end all epics
","What other film can keep the attention for the best part of four hours? It's terrific, well-written in that usual Hollywood glossy style, and everyone's mentioned the chariot race already.  There's quieter moments which are well done too - the lepers watching their son/brother from the shadows, devoted little Esther, the sequences with Christ ... after 40 years it is still the best of the epics.  I loved the silent version too and recently read the book for the first time.  I'd recommend all three.",9,1,3,4 December 2001
Casino Royale," Bond reinvented for the iPod generation
","I approached this film with mixed feelings - I've seen most of the Bond films over the years (but missed out, largely, on the Brosnan-era titles) and was not sure where this one would fit in.The sixth Bond is Daniel Craig, previously known for TV series 'Our Friends in the North' and art-house films such as 'Love is the Devil' (where he played the sadomasochistic lover of Francis Bacon) and 'The Mother' (where he had an affair with a much older woman played by Anne Reid). While much of the reaction to his casting centred on him being the first blond Bond, what counts is can he deliver? The answer is definitely yes - this Bond is sexy, unhinged, psychotic, and complex. He's a Bond for the short attention span so perfect for the new generation of fans this series will surely gain.'Casino Royale' (no relation to the David Niven spoof) adapts the first Ian Fleming novel so is in many senses the starting point for James Bond, 007. However, setting it in a post-Cold War period removes all the history of the previous films and proves that Craig's Bond is a fresh start for a series which was getting tired and silly. There are precious few jokes in this movie, although some of it is as improbable as ever, and there are the usual breathtaking stunts (at least as assume much of it was real stunt-work and not CGI).The rest of the cast are largely forgettable. Eva Green plays the female interest, banker Vesper Lynd, and she is as pretty as any other Bond girl, perhaps as tough as Carey Lowell was in 'Licence to Kill' or Honor Blackman was in 'Goldfinger'. But the character of Lynd seems a little two-dimensional and adds confusion to the plot which is not necessarily needed. Better is Mads Mikkelsen as the villain of the piece, a money-lender with odd-coloured eyes who weeps blood. And Judi Dench returns as a prickly and watchable M.Much more violent than the other Bond titles, this does not automatically feel like it belongs in the series (even John Barry's signature theme is missing from the opening credits - which are, incidentally, spectacular), but even with its faults (a confusing plot, an ending which stretches credibility, too many characters, and a leg-crossingly dangerous torture scene) and with that poker game which is impossible to follow, it retains the interest mainly because of Craig - who, yes, does come out of the sea dripping wet just as Ursula Andress did in 'Dr No', and very easy on the eye he is too.The Bond formula can only benefit from having an excellent actor in the lead role, and Craig seems to fit the part like a glove. I only hope he continues to work in the smaller, more challenging movies as he would be a great loss if he moved on to the Hollywood blockbuster.",7,0,1,9 December 2006
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," bit of a mixed bag but visually impressive
","The long-awaited sequel to 1998's 'Elizabeth', and using some of the same cast (notably Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I and Geoffrey Rush as Francis Walsingham), this film scores on visual splendour but fails to engage in its battle scenes.As Sir Walter Raleigh in an upgraded part that doesn't pay much attention to history, Clive Owen is OK but nothing spectacular. If anything his characterisation is overwritten for such a dull person. Smaller parts fare better in a muddled story which involves court intrigues, Mary Queen of Scots (played quietly and with dignity by Samantha Morton), Catholics, burning ships, and the Spanish Inquisition.Kapur's direction does not fail in the scenes of regal spectacle - the Queen is never anything other than stunning - or in the more intimate and thoughtful scenes - but something is missing, and the gung ho pirate-like Armada adventuring is a bit of a misfire.A worthy sequel, but not as good as you might think, and not as good as the first 'Elizabeth'. It will probably repay a few viewings to make sense of the complicated plot.",7,1,4,8 November 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," a fine close to the trilogy
","The core of the final film in Peter Jackson's mammoth 'Lord of the Rings' series is Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring, assisted by Sam and opposed by the ever-desperate Gollum.  At the end of 'The Two Towers', Gollum had sworn to kill the hobbits and take the ring for himself - at the start of this film they (or at least, Frodo) still see him as a friend.  So there's scope for conflict there which is exploited admirably.The other main storyline concerns the quest of Aragorn to reclaim his crown - will the king overcome all enemies and claim his birthright?  'The Return of the King' is darker and more bloody than the preceding films as the full force of Sauron and the enemies of man, elf, dwarf, and hobbit regroup and find their strength.We see a decaying Gondor lost somewhere in time, with Denethor (powerfully played by John Noble) wandering in distain of his surviving son, Faramir, and mourning the loss of his great child Boromir.  We see the young hobbits Merry and Pippin both grow up and serve with distinction in battle, while Gandalf, now the all-powerful white wizard, rallies the armies to victory.Four scenes stand out for me - Aragorn and Legolas commanding the hidden armies to join their king one last time; Frodo's battle with the spider; the final confrontation between Frodo, Gollum and the Ring (although I was disappointed at the decision to make the last key fight an invisible one); and the final grateful bow of Aragorn to his little friends.Is 'Return of the King' exciting?  Yes, there are many meaty battles and situations here.  Is it involving and touching?  Yes - with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin giving their all as Frodo and Sam, and even Pippin making good. Not to mention the resolution of the story of Arwen and Aragorn.  Is it the best film of the three?  I'm not sure.  For me, the huge scale of the first film, the beauty of Rivendell, the innocence of Middle Earth, the heart-stopping appearance of the Balrog, possibly had the edge.  Is this version of 'The Lord of the Rings' really worth the hype?  As a nine-hours plus film, undoubtedly.",9,2,3,4 July 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'zany madcap humour'
","Arthur, King of the Britons, who doesn't have a horse and instead bangs coconuts together to fool his subjects into thinking he has, decides to amass a rag-bag of knights to his Round Table - the daredevil Lancelot, the pure Galahad, the foolish Bedevere, the cowardly Robin.  God (in wonderful cartoon form) then challenges him to find the Holy Grail - cue the split stories as each knight has their own 'adventure' whilst trying to locate the precious relic.This being Python it is obviously going to be very silly.  The Knights Who Say 'Ni!' are one of the highlights, as is the exceptionally camp prince (Terry Jones) who is in a tall tower waiting to be rescued, the killer bunny rabbit, and Sir Robin's band of minstrels.  Graham Chapman plays Arthur in a quasi-Shakespearean fashion which at least makes the character memorable, and there are neat cameos from the likes of Connie Booth and Carol Cleveland, both honorary Pythons from the BBC TV series.It isn't a perfect movie and isn't consistently funny - however as a send-up of historical epics it does the job very well.",6,6,11,10 August 2003
Happy Feet," tap your flippers for this penguin piece of fun
","'Happy Feet' is a bit of a one joke short stretched out to feature length, but you can't really complain when it is done so well. Fun, cute, and full of music (Elvis, Prince, Aretha, you name it), this tale of a penguin who doesn't fit in because he can't sing his heart song (but can tap a tune with his feet like nobody) has a fit of the cutes and almost comes to a halt until the appearance of some funky boogie-ing birds and a sojourn away from the land of ice.It's minor, but it has some lovely animation, high production values, and a few memorable characters (Memphis, the dad penguin, Mumble, the tap dancer, and Lovelace, the guru). And I really laughed at the appearance of Mumble, who bore more than a passing resemblance to LOTR's Frodo (and of course, Mumble is voiced by Frodo himself, Elijah Wood).",7,0,1,18 August 2008
Gladiator," proper epics are back!
","What can be said about this?  It was pushed as a bloke movie, but it isn't. Its been suggested it is a mindless action flick, using computer effects to take attention away from a flimsy plot - not so.  The script is fine and a hundred times better than the last epic I was unfortunate enough to see in the cinema - Titanic.  Gladiator has a lot of heart and yes, the story may be a little hackneyed, there may be reminders of everything from Ben Hur to Caligula, but the acting is superb, the effects (which don't detract from the story) are great and the whole piece is very enjoyable.  Proof that the epic isn't dead and that Hollywood can still make decent thoughtful films when it wants to.  Excellent.",9,0,0,14 June 2000
Donnie Darko," Twisted and dark cult film
","With more than a touch of 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Harvey', albeit with a decidedly odd twist, Richard Kelly's debut feature is a clever and thought-provoking piece of sci-fi.Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager in therapy, a schizophrenic with imaginary friends - Frank the evil rabbit - and aspirations to travel through time. Add to this bodily projections carving out each person's path through life, a mad old lady always checking her mailbox, portals, Graham Greene's classic short story 'The Destroyers', a creepy self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze), and a girl dance troupe, and gel it all together with an 80s score and that famous cover of 'Mad World', and you have a recipe for success.But does it work? From the strange opening premise, as destruction comes to the Darko house in the form of a fallen jet engine, through to the bleak and haunting finale, it's a valiant try, but for all it's good points, it feels a little sterile and undeveloped.Familiar faces such as Katharine Ross (The Graduate), Mary O'Donnell (Dances With Wolves), Noah Wyle (ER), and Drew Barrymore add interest, but the focus is strictly on Donnie himself, and he ultimately leaves us baffled.",7,0,1,7 August 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Junior's last stand?
","This film, last in the 'Trilogy' until the search for the crystal skull nineteen years later, is perhaps the best, and certainly the funniest, and. despite special effects that look rather simple in today's CGI world, it does manage to convince.Indy is joined in this film by his father, Henry Sr (played with panache by Sean Connery), and fellow academic Marcus Brody (the dapper Denholm Elliott). Together they search for the Holy Grail and try to outwit the Nazis (which leads to other humorous scenes, particularly one involving a priceless diary and Adolf Hitler).Fast-moving, colourful, high on tension, and with a fun opening section with Indy as a teenager (the much-missed River Phoenix), this film finished off the saga brilliantly, and the tension between Jones Senior and Junior is both fun and sentimental.",7,0,1,31 May 2008
The Wizard of Oz," MGM's much-loved classic
","Based on L Frank Baum's first book in his Oz series, and using the songs of Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, with the talents of several directors including Fleming and Vidor, 'The Wizard of Oz' was the high point of MGM's 1939 output, despite originally losing money and almost losing its greatest moment, Judy singing 'Over the Rainbow'.Dorothy Gale is a pre-teen girl caught in a storm and magically transported, with her faithful dog Toto, from her Kansas backyard to the magical world of Oz, with its yellow brick road and Emerald City.  On the way she meets a scarecrow without a brain, a tin man without a heart, and a lion without courage, as well as some rather scary midgets and some flying monkeys.  Her journey with her odd new companions to see the grand Wizard of Oz takes the form of a musical odyssey to the green gates.As Dorothy, the young Judy Garland is exceptionally good ('lions and tigers and bears, oh my!'), while the roles of her three companions are ably filled by Ray Bolger (DVD outtakes show him to be an extremely agile scarecrow in the dance sequence cut from his first meeting with Dorothy); Jack Haley (replacing Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man and fitting the role to a t); and the incomparable Bert Lahr as the outrageously larger-than-life lion.  The music is a trifle repetitive at times (especially the reprises of 'We're off to see the Wizard') but the bright Technicolor of Oz and the spirit of the thing wins over its audience.  Love it.",6,10,24,7 September 2003
From Here to Eternity," Monty Clift's greatest role?
","Fred Zinnemann's epic about the lead-up to Pearl Harbor, featuring excellent performances from young Montgomery Clift and Donna Reed, a knockout role for Sinatra, and that roll in the surf for Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.From Here to Eternity is a potboiler which wears its heart on its sleeve. Would it have been the same with Joan Crawford instead of Kerr?  Hard to say.  I think the heart of the film is Clift, who gives perhaps his career best as ex-boxer Prewitt, the sensitive bugle player fighting his demons. Lancaster is a close second, a hard-boiled officer with no time for love.One of the best of the 50s, and well worth watching.",9,38,53,8 July 2003
The Godfather," Mario Puzo's soapy Mafia saga
","Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s.",8,14,24,23 February 2005
