Blade Runner 2049," A visual masterpiece but fails to be a masterpiece
","Visually stunning and perfectly balanced with sounds effects and music. I like slow movies, especially when the story evolves gradually with a beautiful atmosphere. But I found some parts of the movie unbalanced or unnecessary long... I also have the feeling that the end was wrapped up too quickly comparing to the rest of the movie. It is developing a story for 2h30 minutes and then suddenly in less than 15 minutes things happens in a hurry. I have the impression that the blue-ray version will be longer so the transition between some scenes will be more coherent. It should have been 20 minutes shorter OR 20 minutes longer to be more consistent. I can not give more detail to not spoil the plot.I liked it but I can not give 9/10. As an example from the same director I found The Arrival more balanced.The cast is great.",7,6,22,5 October 2017
