Iron Man 3," Okay I've slept on it for 2 days and I still feel the same - Iron Man 3 sucks!
","I will keep it short and sweet and wont go into all the other points others have already made about the why doesn't his suit do this and what not. What a pity Director Shane Black was not really skewered by the alien in the first predator all those years ago, that way we would have been saved from yet another comic book movie failure. This suffers the same way as the transformer sequels, too much comedy and not enough seriousness and feels more like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Lethal Weapon. No matter how much danger any of the good guys are in, you know there is always an easy way out. I really wanted to like it and after the poor Iron Man 2 and the action packed Avengers, I was really hoping for something epic and the beginning of a great rivalry between Stark and the Mandarin, but like I said I have now slept on it for 2 nights and I still think there is little to redeem this movie, it really is poor. I dread to think was is involved for Avengers 2 or Iron Man 4.",1,20,41,7 May 2013
