The Mask," Quite possibly the perfect Jim Carrey role
","Rubber-faced Jim Carrey lands a role where the character's face undergoes amazing motions and expressions, etc., via special effects. What could be a better fit?When Stan Ipkiss (Carrey) finds a Mask, he finds that when he puts it on at night he is transferred into a rubber-faced superhero. Hang on for a wild ride! (and I do mean WILD)Watch for Ben Stein (Ferris Bueller, clear eyes commercials, etc.) as the psychiatrist who writes a book about 'how we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking.' And the beautiful Cameron Diaz is worth the watch too.*** out of ****",Null,0,1,18 March 2001
Million Dollar Arm," good sports movie
","This was a decent feel good sports movie based on a true story. A struggling sports agent travels to India to check out cricket bowlers in order to convert them into baseball pitchers. The two 'winners' are taken back to the States and baseball spring training camps. Imevitable culture clashes, misunderstandings, and hilarity ensues.
I loved the scenes in India, the 'tryout' scenes, and where the scout stumps the guy in India with a basic baseball question.
This is a good family sports movie that will satisfy anyone. I enjoyed it.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," dragging on...
","This movie tries hard, and it does what it can, but I agree with the reviewers that this is getting a little retread. I think the stories are good, but this can only be done with so much, and it does lead well into the 'second sequel' as Catniss does battle with old and new tormentors and features new scenes and scenarios for the Hunger Games. You will need to have seen the previous two movies to get this one. It's an OK film for action film fans and fans of the series. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence turns in a terrific performance, and there are lots of good action scenes and a decent plot. It's a pretty good timekiller.** out of ****",7,0,1,2 January 2017
Vertigo," classic hitchcock
","This is classic and typical Alfred Hitchcock. A detective (Jimmy Stewart) loses a lady on a chase scene where he tries to rescue her, and as he is dangling off a high-rise wire, she falls to her death. He then develops a fear of heights where he gets dizzy even standing up on a stool. He spots her exact double and becomes dangerously obsessed with her and starts pursuing her.If you are a classic movie fan and a fan of Hitchcock in particular, you will love this movie. I sure did. It fits in the 'classic' genre of films. I won't give anything away. The ending sure was great though! It was certainly a tour de force for Stewart and the rest of the cast.*** out of ****",9,1,3,11 July 2015
Walk the Line," Go Johnny Go!
","This was a remarkable film. I have always liked Johnny Cash and his music, and I knew I would like this film. You know what? I was right. It was excellent in every way. I learned more about Cash, such as his time in prison, drug use, and aspects of his family life. I loved Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's performances, as well as the musical score. It kept me hooked all the way through. If you like the Man in Black, you will love this movie. The music and scenery were both excellent, and I'm glad I saw it. If you get the chance, definitely see it yourself.*** out of ****",Null,1,4,8 December 2005
Gremlins," :-)
","I guess you could rank this one as a 'holiday classic.' A kid gets a Mowgwi (against the original owner's advice) from his father, a klutzy inventor, as a Christmas gift. All hell breaks loose when he inadvertently breaks the 'rules,' especially the one not to feed the pets after midnight. One of the offsprings jumps in the pool, reproduces like mad, and the next thing you know, the peaceful little town isn't so peaceful anymore. I loved the mischief played by the creatures and the attempts to get everything back to normal. My favorites:the scenes with the mean old lady and the line 'You hate Washington's Birthday and no one thinks anything of it but if you hate Christmas they think you're a leper.' This ranks as one of my all-time favorite movies-I loved it! You will too.*** out of ****",9,1,3,3 December 2013
Antz," i liked it
","This was a good animated movie. While it followed a formula, I still liked it. I think it had a great voice cast, and the story and animation were good as well. In it, a worker ant named Z is getting bored with his humdrum existence and becomes smitten with an ant princess who sneaks into a bar where Z hangs out one night. Z then convinces a soldier ant named Weaver to switch places with him so that he can try to woo the princess. (named Bala) Of course, Z and Bala wind up getting lost together, and they have to find their way home.I think there were many memorable scenes (such as the 'wrecking ball' scene, the scenes in 'insectopia', the battle scenes with the termites, and the ladder scene towards the end), and overall the movie was good. I recommend it.*** out of ****",9,0,0,22 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," disappointing
","With all the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting much more. Not all that bad, but not terrific either, or at least up to the other saga film's standards. You will need to see this movie to get an opinion for yourself, but I wasn't terribly impressed. ** out of ****",Null,2,5,5 September 2000
The Equalizer," decent
","I never watched the TV series, but based on what I read about it, this is a not-too-bad movie version of it. Denzel Washington is well-cast in the lead as a man with a mysterious past and a drive to help people in need-and he meets one in a hooker in trouble with Russian hit men. He pulls out all the violent stops to help her as she gets beaten up in the process. Chloe Grace Moretz is good as the hooker who tries to better herself.This is not for the squeamish due to all the persistent violence, but I like the good substories and the leads. Get it if you are a Denzel fan. (Who isn't?) The acting and shooting (cameras and guns) are all good.*** out of ****",8,0,1,12 December 2015
Ali," awesome
","This was a terrific movie, if a bit too long. It boasts a great performance by Will Smith in the title role. It focuses on not just Ali's more controversial moments (refusal to be inducted into the army, being stripped of his title, etc.) but also on his personal life, crowning achievements, and civil rights activism. It was well done, and the boxing scenes are well choreographed.*** out of ****",Null,0,1,22 January 2002
Source Code," excellent!
","This movie was a top-notch thriller, and I'm glad I saw it. Jake Gyllanhaal opens the movie on a train and doesn't know how he got there, and is puzzled why the lady across the way from him calls him 'Sean' when he knows that's not his name and that he's actually a soldier with a different name. He's even more puzzled when he looks in a bathroom mirror and sees a different face. It seems that he's part of a military experiment to investigate the fact that this train is about to blow up as part of a massive terrorist conspiracy, after which he will wake up in a pod-like interior, where he can communicate with other military officials. He can be sent back a bunch of other times to pick up more clues, but the catch is that he can only be sent back for eight minutes at a time due to constraints. I found elements of such movies as 'Minority Report,' 'Back to the Future,' and 'Groundhog Day' in this film. I loved it and guarantee you will too. It was well acted, directed, and written-overall very well made. Kudos all the way around.*** out of ****",9,0,1,10 April 2011

The Hangover," hilarious!
","This is one of the funniest movies of recent years-much funnier than the sequels. Four friends head out to Las Vegas for a bachelor party before one of them has a wedding. They wake up the next morning-with no memory of the previous night, one friend and one friend's tooth missing, and a tiger and a baby in the room. They spend the remainder of the film trying to piece together the events of the previous evening.My favorite scenes are the ones in Heather Graham's apartment, the one with Mike Tyson, the one where ZG tries to make 'blood brothers' with them, and the wedding scene. Overall, this was marvelously funny with great cast chemistry.*** out of ****",9,1,2,4 February 2014

United 93," you must see this film
","This movie is perhaps the best non-fiction film I have ever seen. Even though you know what is going to happen and the fate of the people on the plane, the suspense keeps up and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Every moment of this movie was well-crafted and perfectly done. From the opening sequence featuring the terrorists praying through the messages at the end of the film, the filmmakers knew what they were doing and the film was flawlessly executed.Even though you didn't learn more about the characters, that doesn't matter. The emphasis here is on the action on the plane and the events of 9/11. It was obviously well-researched as the passengers' phone calls and counterattacks on the terrorists were portrayed with perfection. The scenes where they planned their strategies, pounced on the terrorists, rushed the cockpit, and let their loved ones know about their actions were the highlights of them film. Anyone affected by 9/11 and Todd Beamer's words 'Let's roll' will be captivated by the sequences of action and conversations. (planning and otherwise) *** 1/2 out of ****",Null,3,6,16 May 2006
It," Decent
","I liked this version, and it would be interesting to compare it and its sequel to the 1990 miniseries to see which one you liked better. I think I liked the 1990 version better by a slightly slim margin and the sequel better than this one. This movie was good and loaded with good shocks though. I liked the sewer and bar mitzvah scenes. If you are curious and a fan of Stephen King films, you might like.** 1/2 out of ****",8,0,1,27 December 2019
Minority Report," excellent!
","This was a great science fiction flick that milks the most out of its premise. The year is 2054, and murders can be predicted and successfully stopped in time if acted upon. Everything is going well, until the agency's top cop (Tom Cruise) is predicted committing a crime. The chase begins.There was good use and explanations of the pre-cogs (the beings who had the premontions of the murders) and good character development. I liked the movie as a whole.*** out of ****",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
If I Stay," good adaptation
","This was a good adaptation of the book by Gayle Forman. I think the movie captures it well, as does the cast. I like the way the movie flashes back and forth in between the hospital scenes and the story behind the love interests' story. Chloe Grace Moretz is a good choice to play the lead as a gifted cello player who gets an audition for Julliard, and it causes friction between her and her boyfriend, who's the lead singer in a band. Her father was in a band too. Chloe is involved in a horrific car accident and has an out-of-body experience and learns how much everyone cares for her, the fate of everyone else involved, and the hardest decision she had to make. This is a movie about love, sacrifice, and decisions. I loved it. *** out of ****",9,1,2,8 December 2016
Training Day," brutal,not your typical Denzel role
","It you come to this movie expecting to see the usual Denzel Washington role, you will be disappointed.

The Big Lebowski," a cult classic!
","This is a cult classic, and deservedly so. 'The Dude' had officially taken his place in American culture. This movie is a good example of how good writing, acting, and character study can really carry a movie. In the movie, 'The Dude,' as Jeffrey Lebowski refers to himself, is targeted by mobsters because he has the same name as a wealthy businessman whom they are REALLY trying to get. Violent and hilarious situation ensues as The Dude, who is a carefree beach bum who also spends a great deal of time at the bowling alley, enlists his gun-toting pal Walter and friend Donnie to defend him.This film is filled with terrific situations, quirky characters, and unforgettable moments. You will never forget it or 'The Dude' or John Goodman's character of Walter.*** out of ****",9,0,1,10 November 2017
Unbreakable," incredible
","This was a surprisingly good movie. I didn't know what to expect when I went to see it, and I was genuinely surprised. Taut direction, top-notched writing, good use of symbolism, and first-rate performances in the leads by Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson make this one a must-see.Willis survives a train wreck unscratched, and is soon being hounded by Jackson, who doesn't have a bone he hasn't broken due to a disease he is born with. The two soon become entangled with each other's lives, as Jackson connects them with comic books, with which he has an obsession.SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD! (did I happen to mention that there is a spoiler ahead?)Willis turns out to be a real-life superhero, as he has never even been sick or injured in his life. Jackson, in an interesting plot twist, turns out to be his 'arch-enemy' who has caused numerous catastrophes to test Willis. I liked this final twist, and should have made the connection sooner, as Jackson had been making the continuous comparisons. I thought this was truly memorable.END OF SPOILER! END OF SPOILER!

Star Trek," outstanding
","This was a perfect start in the 'prequels' for the Star Trek films. It is perfectly cast (it even has Leonard Nimoy thrown in as the 'older Spock'), and well shot and made. It takes some time to get used to different actors playing the roles, but once you do, you will love the movie. The movie starts with Jim Kirk's birth, then flash forwards thru a couple spots with key moments in his and Spock's childhoods, and then to where they 'inherit' the Enterprise with Christopher Pike still as captain. You get to see their first adventure together as they meet and how the crew is assembled. I think this movie was terrific, as are the majority of Star Trek movies-you even to to hear a 'I'm a doctor, not a...' line from McCoy. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise.*** out of ****",8,1,3,8 May 2016

This movie was a little more violent than it needed to be, and it conveyed the book's idea well. Basically, it was a dystopian future and their watching their version of reality TV. North America was divided into various sanctions, and people were chosen to do battle with each other until one person was left alive. LAST PERSON STANDING!

42," incredible baseball movie
","This was the perfect baseball movie for anyone interested in baseball history and the exploits of one man-the one and only Jackie Robinson. It starts off with the narration of blacks being excluded from Major League Baseball in the first part of the 20th century and having to form the 'Negro Leagues' and then switching to Branch Richey looking for one of those players to be the first black player in the Majors. He settles on Robinson-'a player with a future.' Robinson agrees and is subjected to horrible treatment (from fellow and opposing players, other people such as customer service people who are also bad to the team in general) prejudice, fans shouting racial epithets at him, and other bad treatments. He endures and eventually wins everyone's respect. It would be interesting to watch this and the original Jackie Robinson Story movie back-to-back (in which Robinson played himself) to see how they compare. I saw that one too and liked it-this one holds its own. Any baseball fan will love this.*** out of ****",9,1,3,22 September 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," good entry
","This was a good entry into the 'prequel' sets of the Star Trek series. Kirk has been assembling the old crew and finds himself doing battles with old enemies, and one in particular. I love the way they set up the character of Khan and the scenes with the Klingons. The allusions to Star Trek II and the scenes with Leonard Nimoy are also well done. I think the cast is excellent and works well together-I especially like Alice Eve as Carol and that allusion to the other movie. This movie works on all levels with action, humor, drama, and combines them perfectly.*** out of ****",9,5,10,17 December 2015

Ryan Gosling overhears everything and proceed to 'coach' him on approaching women in bars. Meanwhile, his son has a crush on his older babysitter who has a similar crush on Carrell, and Emma Stone thinks she's getting somewhere with here beau. I especially liked Kevin Bacon's role.I think this was funny from start to finish.

Ted," good film
","This was a funny film. A word of advice:despite the ever-precense of a cute teddy bear, this might not be for kids, and if they do see it, make sure the parents are with them due to the persistent crude and drug-related humor.The movie starts off when an outcast kid wishes his new teddy bear were real, and of course it comes true. The bear becomes a celebrity overnight, which unfortunately fades out soon. Many years later, the kid is an adult in age only, the bear is still his friend and constant companion and is also foul-mouthed and loves to dabble in drugs and rather gross stuff, and it tests the guy's 4-year relationship with his girlfriend. Of course, a bad guy and his son have their eyes set on Ted, and Ted pushes his owner to his limits, and the owner does the same to the girlfriend.You will love the ending. It is very satisfying. The special effects were nothing short of amazing, and I loved the Leonard Maltin review. Overall, not bad.*** out of ****",8,0,2,26 December 2013
Spider-Man 2," great sequel!
","This was a worthy entry in the Spiderman movie franchise. It actually is as good as its original-a rarity in films nowadays. Tobey Maguire was a good spiderman, and Alfred Molina made a good villain. Molina plays Dr. Octavious/Doc Oc (the octopus), who, like Peter Parker, is affected by something involving science. The difference is, the doctor is driven insane by the change and takes people hostage, pushing Spidey to the limit as Spidey tries to thwart him.

Upon the suggestion of a co-worker, he goes out on several 'man dates' before meeting Jason Segel at an open house, whom he befriends and agrees to serve as best man.I think this movie was overall funny throughout. I think Segel's dog was very cute, and Lou Ferigno's role as himself was hilarious. The parts where Rudd and Segel bond were terrific, and my favorite scenes include where people yell at Segel for not 'cleaning up' after his dog, the L.A.

Of course, their plans go awry and chaos ensues. I liked it. The two stars had definite chemistry, and it was a likable chemistry. It was well written. I think there were many memorable scenes, such as the Knicks games and the black tie party. Hudson especially gave a terrific turn as the magazine writer who does her 10 day thing for a magazine article she is working on, and gives a good over-the-top performance.

","This was a decent entry in the Terminator franchise. It was the first not to feature time travel, as well as the first one not to star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Earl Boen! It basically focuses on the battles between John Conner and the Terminators created by Skynet. It also focuses a great deal on the characters of Conner, the teenage version of Kyle Reese, and a mysterious drifter who debuts at the start. Of course, they couldn't resist throwing in the famous lines, 'Come with me if you want to live' and 'I'll be back!'

Dennis Quaid was great in the lead, and Jake Gylenhaal was good in the lead. The movie features a good supporting cast, too, with good performances from Sela Ward and Emmy Rossum.I loved the scenes in the library where they tried to keep warm, the extreme flood scene in the streets, Quaid's trek scenes, and the views from space.

Everyone is addicted to the world anyway so they agree. Lots of fun ensues as Tye Sheridan's character relentlessly pursues it.The cast is great as it alternates between the real and virtual worlds.

Molly's Game," good biopic
","A drawback to this movie:it kind of drags with the dialogue and some of the scenes. Other than that, this is a good movie based on the book written by Molly Bloom about her gambling establishments after her skiing career is ended by a horrendous accident. It also talks about growing up with her strict father. I loved the gambling scenes and Chastain's performance as Molly. The scenes between her and the lawyer were first rate, and you also got to learn about some of the people who participated in her games. This was a good movie from start to finish with excellent performances.** 1/2 out of ****",8,0,1,17 June 2018
Crash," very well done
","This was one of the most powerful movies I have seen in a long time. It basically explores the prejudices just about everyone has and has a message-no one is immune. It starts off with a car accident involving two people of different ethnic backgrounds, then shifts to two black guys complaining to each other that they did not get sufficient service in a restaurant due to their skin color and then carjack Sandra Bullock's car, and then proceeds from there, never letting up and pickup up steam as it examines each character's various fears and prejudices. One such example of where no one is immune is when Ryan Philippe's character complains to his superior that his partner (Matt Dillon) is a racist, and then later finds himself in a racial situation which he handles the wrong way. Dillon's character also contradicts himself when he pulls over a black couple for no reason and feels up the wife during the interrogation. Later, he has to rescue her from a burning car. A Persian man who owns a shop also goes after a Hispanic locksmith who tries to fix his door after his store is vandalized and tries to blame him for it, leading to near-tragic circumstances.No character is underdeveloped in this brilliant movie. I found myself thinking about my own life and reevaluating my values after watching it. I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture.*** 1/2 out of ****",Null,1,6,24 May 2006
The Bodyguard," ok at best
","This was one of those movies that was trashed by the critics but loved by the audience. I rank it somewhere between.

Horrible Bosses," hilarious
","Has anyone ever wanted to get revenge on their bosses like this? I dare anyone to compare this movie to 9 to 5. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudekis all hate their bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anison, and Collin Farrell) for various reasons but can never stand up to them. Finally,one night, in a drunken stupor, they devise a so called 'perfect' plan and get con man Jamie Foxx involved. They discover a major conspiracy involving Spacey's character, and, as you can imagine, things don't exactly go as planned and hilarity ensues.I loved Foxx's scenes, the parts at Spacey's mansion, Aniston sexually harassing Day and trying to bribe him out of telling on her, the police scenes, and everything else in this brilliant film. I hear there's a sequel coming out;I just hope it's as good as this one. All the comedy relies on slapstick, chase scenes, improbable situations, and good performances. Spacey especially plays his role well.*** out of ****",9,0,2,24 August 2014
Elf," good holiday fun
","This was a funny holiday film with great performances all around. Will Ferrell gives one of the best performances of his career (and one of the funniest) as a human raised by Santa and his elves. When he was a baby, he crawled into Santa's sack, which explains how he got there. Now that he's an adult and six feet tall, he realizes he's no elf. He gets Santa's permission to go to New York and find his father, who is on Santa's naughty list. Once he arrives in New York City, however, he has a tougher time adjusting to the 'human' world than he ever imagined. He tracks down his father (well played by James Caan) and convinces him of who he is. Initially a jerk, having Buddy (Ferrell) in his life makes Cann make some changes in his life and priorities. He is originally totally immersed in his job. I think this was a wonderful family film for the holidays and really recommend it.*** out of ****",Null,1,3,11 December 2005

It deals with the 1970 plane crash that killed the Marshall football team, its coaches, and boosters, and the team had to rebuild. The movie focuses not just on the games but on the human aspects of the tragedy and the university and how the new coach how to handle it.

21 Jump Street," decent
","Not many people of today's generation realize that this was a TV show! People of my generation remember it fondly though. This was a decent 'update' of the show as former high school foes graduate from the police academy, screw up a drug bust, and get assigned to the newly revived (re-jumped?) jump street program, and their first assignment is to infiltrate a local high school by their overbearing chief to investigate a drug bust. Of course, it isn't as easy as it sounds.Overall, I think this is a decent movie with a decent blend of drama, comedy, action, and surprising (and amusing) cameos. The drug taking scenes are hilarious. See the old TV show if you're not familiar with it. You'll like that too.** 1/2 out of ****",9,0,2,9 November 2012

The movie contains plenty of good action scenes, and my favorites include the musical scene, the showdown with Red Skull, and where he crashes into the glacier and wakes up 70 years later.

","This is the type of movie that will make you think twice about what you see on the news. It starts off with Lou Bloom (Jake Gylenhaal) stealing stuff from a construction site and then trying to get a job there, and not that you can blame him but the supervisor tells him he doesn't hire thieves. He later steals a bike and pawns it for a camera and police scanner and uses them to find stories and accidents so he can be there to record them and sell them to the local news stations. He finally fins a willing buyer in Nina. (Rene Russo) Lou's stories become more sensational each time, and he eventually winds up staging them! This goes to show how far people will go, and Gylenhaal's performance is nothing short of brilliant. I absolutely loved it.*** out of ****",9,0,0,15 November 2015
Justice League," good superhero movie
","Any DC comics fan will like this movie. It's not perfect and drags sometimes, but it plays its part well as it picks up where Batman Vs. Superman left off and blends in the Wonder Woman storyline well, and brings in Cyborg, Aquaman, and the Flash, and the cast works together well as enemies search for 'boxes that will destroy humanity.' You will need to see the movie to get that.There is plenty off action and good special effects and good jokes. I like the way they add in the new superheroes-this is a good contiuation of the stories.*** out of ****",8,3,4,3 April 2018
Man of Steel," decent
","This was a decent entry in the never-ending series of Superman movies, as it attempts to reboot a never-ending movie series. It starts off well, with the story everyone knows of Krypton exploding and the infant being jettisoned off into space. It varies the theme in Clark's childhood and adolescence as he tries to 'fit in' with his powers while his adoptive earth father tries to help him. He finally learns how to harness everything as everything 'comes together' with Lois Lane, etc, in adulthood. This movie relies a little too much on chase scenes and special effects, but it's not too bad. I loved the scenes in the classroom and the interrogation room. It might satisfy you if you are a Superman fan.** 1/2 out of ****",7,1,1,21 May 2017

North by Northwest," classic & typical hitchcock
","This was one of Hitchcock's best. It was also one of his typical films-a am is framed for a crime (read:murder) and trapped by the circumstantial and other evidence. There were several classic scenes in this movie, like the chase scene on Mount Rushmore, the diner scene (watch for the little kid to plug his ears BEFORE Eva Marie Saint reaches into her purse pulls out her gun and shoots Cary Grant-classic mistake in a classic scene in a classic film), and the crop duster chase scene. I loved it when they dumped alcohol into him, made him drive, and when he returned they hid and staged everything. Pierce Brosnan referred to this in Remington Steele. Watch for Hitchcock's cameo at the very beginning. This was representative as to how Hitchcock did his films and how good filmmaking should be done, even if the camera-work and other stuff is obviously severely outdated. You will love this movie.**** out of ****",9,1,3,11 March 2011

Being dark can contribute to a movie sometimes, but not here. Imagine a dark 'Married...with children' and it being more of a drama than a sitcom. The family is becoming dysfunctional with the father going after his American dream and developing a sexual interest in one of his daughter's friends, with the daughter doing the same with the boy next door, much to the chagrin of the boy's homophobic father.

This movie is worth checking out if you like comedies and the stars and original ideas. I sort of liked it. Not for the easily offended though. I like the leads and Yasmine Bleeth.

","I came into this movie expecting not-too-good things about it, and might I say I was surprised. It involves a drug smuggler who has to run a job across the Mexican border for a dealer. Knowing he'd look suspicious by himself, he puts together a makeshift 'family' with three people he's familiar with:his stripper neighbor, a teenage girl runaway, and a horny teenage boy. They fly to Arizona and rent an RV. Hilarious complications ensue. Despite their characters and predicaments, they are shown to think fast on their feet with the bad guys sometimes, and the bad guys manage to track them down after they get the drugs, and some DEA agents find them and wind up accompanying them on their trip.90s songs and allusions pop up during this movie.

Shia LeBeouf plays a teenager whose father is killed in a car accident in a well-played-out opening scene. In the next scene, Shia pops his Spanish teacher when the teacher makes a comment about what the father would think of it and, because he is still a minor, Shia winds up under three months house arrest. One of the police officers is the teacher's cousin and enjoys torturing him with this. There are news stories about a serial killer, and when David Morse moves next door, Shia begins to suspect that this might be him. A gorgeous teenaged girl also moves in to the other house next door, and they start spying on him along with Shia's best friend, and they also frustrate Shia's mother and spy on neighbors as well and receive torture from the pesky kids, including the 'flaming poop bag' trick. Boy, do they get revenge. I enjoyed watching this movie. It was very suspenseful. You will like it too. The suspense never lets up.

It turns out her mother went thru the same thing.The movie features decent action scenes and good performances as well as some good scenes where they try to 'scare' the people trying to get into dauntless.

Just about the only weakness I thought was that it tended to get over the top in the action scenes, especially the climactic chase scene (Mr. Maltin's other 1/3?), but I didn't really mind. Wondering what would happen next kept me hooked, and the acting was good. Imagine wearing your archenemy's face. Then imagine him wearing yours. That, my friends, is the gyst of this film.

The schtick is, they execute a heist and, instead of keeping the money, they distribute it to 'needy' audience members. Interpol member Mark Ruffalo and debunker Morgan Freeman are hot on their trailer.This movie works to an extent, mostly due to the great chemistry among the 'Horsemen.' I liked Woody Harrelson in it.

She meets divorce lawyer Patrick Dempsey who is divorced himself and can't figure out why these marriages don't have 'happily ever afters.' Meanwhile, the evil queen sends her goons to kill her, and her prince follows her too. The sexual innuendos turn out to be fine for a Disney movie. I loved the allusions to other Disney films too as Giselle (Adams) tries to adjust to this totally unfamiliar world-the real world- and Dempsey tries to adjust to her, figure her out, and explain things to her.

Years later, when he is in college, he reads his journals and finds he can go back in time and alter the circumstances. Unfortunately, the outcome leaves a lot to be desired, especially where Kayleigh is concerned. In one altered outcome, she winds up committing suicide, and in another one she grows up to be a prostitute. Evan keeps trying though.

Of course, his plan goes awry, and he winds up learning that you don't need to win a medal to be hero in someone's eyes.I absolutely loved this movie. It features cameos from some of my all-time favorite video game characters like Pac-Man, QBert, Sonic, and their respective villains. I also like the mention of some other classic games like Frogger, Centipede and Asteroids. I also loved the 'group therapy' scenes with the villains, the character of Wreck It Ralph, his game, other characters, the 'new games', and the action scenes. This was very delightful John C. Reilly was the perfect choice in the lead. I grew up in the 'video game craze' of the early 80s and knew all about the games, so I was able to catch some of the stuff. Let me know if you need any explanations, especially of some of the games I talked about. QBert was a great game. This was a great movie and perfect for the entire family! **** out of ****",10,3,4,16 January 2013
Blue Crush," great surf scenes!
","This was an average film about three friends who want to compete in a surfing contest in Hawaii. Kate Bosworth was perfect in the lead as Ann Marie, and they managed to build a love story into the surfing competition storyline. I liked it, and the surfing scenes were awesome. It was mostly a drama with a little humor mixed in. If you like this kind of movie, you might like this one. My favorite scenes included the high wave surfing scenes and the hotel scenes where they worked as maids, where some of the humor was used. I loved the scene where they tried to clean up the vomit and found a condom in one room.** 1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,3 October 2004
Non-Stop," outstanding action
","Liam Neeson shines as an alcoholic marshall who gets a text on an airplane saying a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes if demands aren't met. He is also set up in the news to look like the bad guy, and non stop action ensues as he looks for the bad guy and a bomb on board.If you are into movies like this, you might like it.

Tucker and Dale vs Evil," :-)
","This movie was brilliant! It was basically a comedy built on misunderstandings and on 'role reversals'-the good guys misunderstood the motives and attacked the 'bad guys.' Some preppie college kids and a pair of hillbillies are travelling to the same part of the woods in separate trips. They stop off at the same gas station, and one of them approaches the ladies and tries to make friends with them with disastrous results. Later one night, the hillbillies are fishing at the same lake where the kids are skinnydipping, and one of the girls sees them while she's taking off her clothes, slips into the water, and gets knocked out. The hillbillies rescue her and take her back to the cabin, and the other kids think they kidnapped her. Hilarious complications and situations result and abound. I love the hillbillies' performances, and this was a good movie. See it if you've got time to kill.** 1/2 out of ****",8,2,3,10 December 2011
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," those dinosaurs!
","This sequel to the smash Jurassic Park was a pretty good movie, though I liked the book better.

Cars," marvelous
","This movie had it all-terrific animation, a first-rate voice cast, humor, action, and a great story. (The last one was too reminiscent of Doc Hollywood, but who's counting?) The story concerns a hot-shot rookie race car who desperately wants to win the Piston cup. After finishing in a three-way tie for it, he has to travel to California for the tie-breaker. Unfortunately, on his way there, his truck (voiced by John Ratzenberger:have you ever noticed that he has done voices for every Pixar movie?) falls asleep, and accidentally spills out Lightning McQueen (the car). McQueen then gets stranded in a run-down,one horse town which is populated by equally rundown cars. He is convicted of speeding and sentenced to repaving the roads. During his time there, he of course learns life lessons.I think this movie is great for kids and adults alike. I loved it.*** out of ****",9,0,0,10 January 2008
Bolt," hilarious
","This was a great Disney animated comedy, and adults and kids will love it equally. It features a dog who's the star of a TV show that features him as a 'superhero dog' who has a super bark, can melt metal with his eyes, and do a lot of other things. The problem is, this is the only world he's ever known, and when he accidentally gets shipped off in a crate cross-country, he thinks his powers are real and doesn't know how to function in the so-called 'real world.' He gets teamed up with a cat and hamster in his quest to reunite with his 'person,' Penny, and hilarious situations abound as he tries to enact his 'superpowers.' As you can imagine, towards the end, I won't reveal it, but he does wind up in a situation where he has to be the 'hero.' There are also situations I've seen in films like this.Overall, this was a funny and good movie with a great voice cast, including John Travolta as Bolt. Any fan of animated films will love this.*** out of ****",9,2,3,12 October 2014
Schindler's List," a masterpiece
","This is truly a remarkable film, definitely deserving of the best picture Oscar it received.Films based on historical fact can work if they totally absorb the audience, and this one does. The power of the movie, Mr. Schindler's full 180 from Nazi to helping the prisoners, and some of the images (such as the little girl wearing a pink coat in an otherwise black-and-white setting) contribute.Being Jewish myself, I was especially impressed and moved. This movie is not to be missed. I think it will become a classic and be mentioned in the same breath as such movies as Casablanca and Gone With the Wind. It is that good.**** out of ****",Null,9,18,14 March 2001

(a little credit for that!) This time, they get sent undercover to a college to investigate a WHYPHY drug operation. There are more than a few surprises in store! The two leads work well together, and I love Ice Cube as their superior. This works well as far as sequels go. You will love the stuff over the ending credits-it's hilarious!

When he gets a phone call for his roommate regarding a teaching job, he decides to impersonate him (along the lines of Tootsie and Soul Man) and turns his class into a rock band.

Ghostbusters," a classic comedy that survives to this day-never lets up
","This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again. I first saw this movie when it first came out, and I still enjoy it today. Bill Murray and company are a bunch of out-of-work paranormal professors who go into employment for themselves as 'Ghostbusters.' Business is slow at first, but when gorgeous musician Sigourney Weaver (on whom mousy & nerdy neighbor Rick Mouranis has a crush-think Steve Urkel and Laura from the show Family Matters) contacts them about a 'vision' she has in her kitchen and they beat it, business starts to boom. Pretty soon, strange things start to happen, and all hell starts to break loose. Who ya gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS! The only guys who can save the day of course!

","This movie features excellent action and chase scenes and special effects. If you are a Spider Man fan, this is the movie for you! If you know anything about the comic book story, you will recognize what happens towards the end. I think Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone work well together as Peter/Spidey and Gwen Stacey. Jamie Foxx was also good as Electro, and the guy playing Harry Osborne/Green Goblin was good too. This was as good as sequels go, and fantastic as far as superhero flicks go. You will definitely feel for Peter's character throughout, and Harry Osborne's villain was good. One other thing-a coherent story!*** out of ****",8,1,2,14 November 2016

Jackson orders his men to fire upon a hostile crowd in a third world country which he believes is an army. He soon finds himself on trial for firing upon unarmed civilians, and an ensuing drama unfolds, as perjured testimony, hostile witnesses, and covered-up evidence abound. I found the story to be first-rate, and everything about this film was top notch and in fine form.*** out of ****",Null,1,3,17 September 2001
Garden State," great film!
","This was the type of movie that needed the actors to work well together and give terrific performances. Fortunately, they did. Zach Braff stars as an aspiring actor who goes back home to attend his mother's funeral. While there, he runs into some old friends, and at a doctor's appointment, he meets Natalie Portmann, who plays a free-spirited lady who shows him around and how to have fun in his life. (kind of like Penny in The Big Bang Theory.) The main highlights of this film are Natalie Portmann's performance and the effective balance between drama and humor. I love the scene where Braff and Portmann meet and the blind lady's dog-that was terrific. This wasn't too bad a way to pass your time. You might like it! *** out of ****",9,2,3,24 August 2013

Among the ants is a well-meaning but bumbling member named Flick who always messes things up. (I can relate!) That seems like the type of role John Candy used to play. When he goes out to find 'warrior bugs' to help fight the grasshoppers, he unknowingly recruits a circus troupe. He fails-and succeeds!

Heath Ledger offers a fabulous performance as the psychotic joker, and Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Aaron Eckhart is really good as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. The overall dark atmosphere both contributes and retracts from it. I think this is a good movie with superb action scenes and good performances, but can be way too dark at times.

Mama," scary
","This is one way to make a scary horror film. A while I wrote a review for Scarecrows, and I would rank both these movies as examples-with shocks and thrills. Leonard Maltin was right when he called this film 'genuinely scary.' This movie deals with a father and two small children who survive a car accident in the woods, and they find a cabin, and the father gets 'dragged away.' Five years later, the father's brother finds the cabin and the girls-feral, filthy, and like wild animals. He and his girlfriend (part of a rock band) take them to a psychiatric facility, where they reveal that someone (or something) named 'Mama' has been looking over them. They then get charged with looking over them.What happens next is unforgettable. I loved the creepy atmosphere, the scenes with the slugs, the holes in the wall, the 'creeping hair,' and the shadows.

Mark Wahlberg plays a bartender who tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and redefines the word 'long shot.' However, sometimes long shots work out, and he makes the team. After a rough induction into NFL life when, while playing on special teams, he freezes up and gets chewed out by the coach, he winds up making decent contributions to the team.

He does indeed find clues in dollar bills, while also getting them from letters written by Ben Franklin which his father has donated to a museum and various landmarks located in Philadelphia.

Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan first meet in college and run into each other several times over the years, gradually forming a friendship and eventually a romance despite Ryan's assessment that a man and a woman 'can't be friends.'

","This film could draw comparisons to Tender Mercies-in fact, Robert Duvall was in both of them! Jeff Bridges plays a faded country singer who is fading in life too. He gets one more chance in romance (he had a bunch of failed marriages) with reporter Maggie Gylenhaal) but starts to blow this one too with a classic scene with her son.I think this deserves the Oscars it got. Jeff Bridges certainly gave a terrific performance, and Collin Ferrell was good in his role, as was Maggie. The concert scenes were way above average and the main highlight. The excessive cigarette smoking might have been a bit much, but I think you can get past that.*** out of ****",8,2,3,15 March 2014
Hercules," an epic indeed!
","This Disney film provides a good twist on the Hercules legend. A good voice cast strengthens things, and I loved the music and writing in it. Danny De Vito was great as Phil, and Tate Donovan shined as Hercules. If you are in the mood for a good Disney film, give this one a try.*** out of ****",Null,1,3,5 April 2001
Burlesque," decent
","This movie sort of reminded me of Coyote Ugly-a small-town girl moves to the big city with big dreams, winds up working at a place with a bunch of hot girls who dance a lot, she is flat broke (especially after her place gets broken into!), she finds love, and she helps her boss out. This was mostly a showcase for Christina Aguilera and Cher, both of whom actually turn in decent performances, as does most of the cast, especially Alan Cumming! Aguilera, desperate, joins Burlesque, first as a waitress, then as a a singer/dancer, and the lady she replaces (of course) tried to sabotage her. The place is in serious financial trouble, and she helps Cher-the owner-try and rescue it as the bad guys close in with plans to demolish it and set up other buildings on the site. Overall, I think this was thoroughly enjoyable, and not just for all the dance scenes. It was very well executed, the love scenes were good, and you might enjoy it too!** 1/2 out of ****",8,1,2,8 March 2012
Die Hard with a Vengeance," terrific!
","This was a perfect conclusion to a great trilogy. They varied the film from the other two films, as this time John MacClane (Bruce Willis) and a shop owner (Samuel L. Jackson) are led on a chase across New York City by a terrorist (Jeremy Irons), who leads them from place to place with various tantalizing clues. I loved the performances and suspense in this well made sequel.*** out of ****",Null,2,3,25 September 2001

","Non-stop action and an actual plot! I liked this movie! Nicolas Cage is finally parolled after being released from prison where he was wrongfully incarcerated, and the action starts from there and never lets up. If you like this type of movie, check it out. Great performances all around by Cage, John Malkovich, Colm Meany, John Cusak, Ving Rhames, and the ubiquitrous Steve Buscemi. *** out of ****",Null,0,1,12 November 2000
Stranger Than Fiction," remarkable
","This was quite a change of pace for Will Ferrell. While he will always be remembered mostly as a comic actor, this film proves he can handle a dramatic role as well. The story was certainly unique-a man all of a sudden hears a voice narrating his life and every action and soon finds that it is a writer putting together a book about it. He soon learns that she is going to do something drastic and tries to prevent it. I found underlying themes in the film such as appreciating life, not taking anything for granted, and being aware of your surroundings. In that sense it was a little bit like the Queen Latifah film 'Last Holiday.' Coincidentally, she is also in this movie. Will Ferrell was excellent in the film. It had a good cast, which worked really well together. Not just Ferrell and Queen Latifah, but Dustin Hoffman, Linda Hunt, and Emma Thompson. Everything in the movie was good. I really liked it, and I guarantee you will too.*** 1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,23 February 2008
The Green Mile," two thumbs & two big toes up!
","This movie was fantastic! It might remind you a little bit of the classic to kill a mockingbird, but this rather faithful adaptation of Stephen King's novel left me breathless. It might be too long, but I didn't really mind. The best parts were the performances turned in by Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan. The latter gave a terrific show.

At the end, there are just about three things that you'll remember most about the film:1)those skimpy cheerleading outfits;2)Kirsten Dunst's smile, and;3)the cheer: 'BRRR! IT'S COLD IN HERE!

Lord of War," decent film
","This was a pretty good movie about an arms dealer. Nicolas Cage plays the role and does quite a good job with it. The movie starts off with him standing over a hill observing a bunch of weapons, and he turns around and makes some comments about how 'There are enough weapons for one out of every 12 people. The question is, how do we arm the other 11?' The rest of the film is told from the early 80's to the present day. The character played by Cage was an interesting one, as we learn more about his background as an immigrant to ascent as an arms dealer and married man with a child. He marries a girl he has a huge crush on. There is much ado about the moral implications of such a career and the impact it has on his family life. It caught my attention throughout.

The Waterboy," good role for Adam Sandler
","This movie was a good part for Adam Sandler. True, the jokes tended to misfire a bit, and you'll be annoyed with the way Sandler talks during the movie (You'll understand what I mean if you've seen this), but I liked it. Sandler gives a funny portrayal of a waterboy-turned-linebacker who is taught to take out all his frustrations for everyone who's ever given him grief when he tackles- and boy does he TACKLE!*** out of ****",Null,4,8,7 September 2001
The Terminal," excellent film
","This was typical Tom Hanks-but it's a good type of typical. It's like Big where he's an innocent character caught up in an unusual situation. He plays a foreigner who travels to the U.S. (New York City to be exact) and is denied entry due to the fact that his native country has embarked in a civil war, and the airport does not recognize his visa anymore. For obvious reasons, he can't go back home, so he has to live in the airport, and he makes new friends, tells stories, finds work, and finds love in stewardess Catherine Zeta-Jones.This was a marvelous and touching story. I wonder how much United Airlines got pain for 'product placement' in this though. Tom Hanks was his usual great performance, and I liked it. See it if you get the chance-you will like why he came to New York City! *** out of ****",9,0,2,26 December 2012
The Blind Side," marvelous movie
","This was an A+ movie about the true story of Michael Oher, a boy who goes from life on the streets to football star. All he needs is a little love and a family to support him, and he gets that in the Tuohy family. Sandra Bullock deserved her Oscar in her role as the matriarch of the clan. You will love the transformation 'Big Mike' undergoes as he goes from lost both in the streets and in life, found by the Tuohys, taken in, enrolled at the Christian school, educated there (where he learns the game of football), tutored by Kathy Bates, and taught about life. We also learn about his old life, with his old neighborhood friends and mother. I loved his Friday night game debut scene. Controversy ensues as he makes his choice of colleges. You will love all the scenes where the coaches come to visit as well as the inspirational movie in general. See it! *** out of ****",9,0,3,13 October 2010
Wonder Woman," good superhero movie
","This movie was good. It could have used more plot and character development, especially, with Chris Pine's character, I'll admit, but I think it nailed it with the back story with Wonder Woman's character, the backstory, the Lasso of Truth, and the action sequences and storyline. I loved the opening sequences, the 'no man's land' scene where she goes against him and climbs up and defends against the bullets,and the 'fish out of water' scenes where Pine's character is on the island and where Wonder Woman first visits London. By the way, did anyone ever notice that the words 'Wonder Woman' were never spoken in the film? If you are a fan of superhero and action movies, this is a good movie for you.*** out of ****",8,1,2,27 December 2017
Back to the Future Part II," WHOA!!!
","This is an obvious 'middle movie.' No real beginning & no real end. Just the same, you'll probably like it. Fox & Lloyd continue their portrayals of Marty and Doc, going from 1985 to 2015 to a dark and different alternate 1985 to 1955, and so on. If you are a fan of the trilogy and liked the first, you might like it. ** 1/2 out of ****",Null,0,1,7 September 2000
Carrie," scary
","This review might contain a spoiler.This was a really good adaptation of the Stephen King novel, and it has earned the term 'classic.' The final scenes were the scariest and the best, as Carrie unleashes her powers and gets her revenge. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were perfect for their roles, with Sissy as the tormented Carrie and Piper as her religious fanatic mother. Carrie was tormented both at school by the cruel other girls and at home by her religious fanatic mother, and when she is finally pushed over the edge, she really gets her revenge. I think this was a great film, and I highly recommend it. It was well cast, well written, and well acted. It will remind you of what you felt like doing when you were tormented in high school.*** out of ****",8,3,4,18 February 2007
Shrek," funny and cute
","This movie was wonderful. It had great lines (i.e., 'I've got a dragon and I'm not afraid to use it!') and was a wonderful spoof on fairy tales. An ogre gets sent by a king to rescue a princess, after the king has banished all fairy tale creatures to the ogre's swamp and promises to remove them if the ogre is successful. The princess, however, turns out to be something else.Watch for cameos of fairy tales and otherwise (i.e. the gingerbread man, pinnochio, the three blind mice and others). Heck, just watch the movie.

Vanilla Sky," interesting premise, too long a movie
","This is another one of those movies which explores the thin line between reality and dreams. I thought it was interesting, but things got confusing after a while. The impressive cast (Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell) did a credible job, but I found myself trying to figure things out. Apparently, the first half of the film was real, and the second half was a dream, or something like that. I was very confused.** 1/2 out of ****",Null,0,1,5 April 2002
The Dark Knight Rises," Not bad
","This wasn't too bad a conclusion to the Dark Knight Trilogy. It is interesting to note that Christian Bale spends far more time as Bruce Wayne than he does as Batman.

This was a fabulous movie for Batman, superhero, and DC comics fans.*** out of ****",9,1,2,28 October 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," not too bad
","This basically serves as a lead-in to the recent Justice League movie, even featuring 'computer files' with characters from that movie. The movie title refers to a battle coerced by Lex Luther between the two title characters, and the psychological battle between them too. It also focuses on Earth people's reluctance not to have Superman on the planet as an 'alien' and Batman prowling as truly the 'Dark Knight' as a vigilante seeking justice. Wonder Woman also has a major role. My favorite scenes are the major physical battle between Batman and Superman and the opening action scenes. It might not satisfy everyone, and it isn't great, but it is an ok movie.",7,0,2,27 May 2018
Mr. Holland's Opus," a gem
","This was one of Richard Dreyfuss's best roles to date. He gives a terrific performance in the title role as the film covers approximately 30 years in his career as a high school music teacher, a job he reluctantly takes when he can't seem to get his music published. (He is originally a composer, his 'dream' job.)The ending might not be totally satisfying, but the entire movie is more than worth it.

Casino Royale," Decent
","One small problem:Daniel Craig isn't quite suave or debonair enough to play Bond. He still gives a good turn in this movie. This film gives what you'd expect of a Bond film with action scenes, spectacular stunts, villains, and the usual characters. The coherent plot (sort of) also helped. I also like the exotic locations of Nassau, Miami,and the Czech Republic, among others,and I also liked the poker game. You might like Craig as Bond and the movie in general.**1/2 out of ****",8,0,3,2 October 2018
Toy Story 3," marvelous!
","This was a marvelous sequel in the Toy Story series. It seems that Andy is all grown up now and off to college and no longer has any need for his toys. (Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the rest of the gang.) They are now starting to feel left out, and after a misunderstanding by the mother, wind up in a 'retirement home for toys' headed up by Lotso-well voiced by Ned Beatty. Things seem pleasant enough. Unfortunately, things aren't what they seem, especially Lotso. Woody escapes to be back with Andy, but then has to go back to get the other toys and rescue them. This is overall a terrific film and a worthy entry in a great Disney series. I recommend it to anyone who likes Disney films and computer generated movies. By the way, watch for Sid from the first film in a cameo appearance. The voice cast in this film is first rate, and so is the story and the ending.*** out of ****",9,0,1,10 January 2011
Space Jam," a modern-day classic
","This is a great film aimed at children, but adults will love it too, especially if you like Loony Tunes and basketball. It combines action and cartoons, like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and both films are equally good. Aliens arrive on Earth, zap the talents of real-life basketball stars like Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing so they can beat Bugs Buuny and the Loony Tunes gang at SOMETHING, and Bugs and the gang recruit Michael Jordan so they can have a fighting chance.My favorite scenes are the basketball game showdown (that's hilarious! watch for the 'men in black' reference), the golf scene where they 'recruit' MJ, and Jordan's baseball scene. Everything about this movie is thoroughly enjoyable, and everyone will love it. Guaranteed. i loved Bill Murray, Wayne Knight, and Larry Bird in it! *** 1/2 out of ****",9,1,1,24 January 2016

Flight," washington & aviation showcase
","This is mostly a showcase for Denzel Washington and the airplane scenes, but it works. Washington shows up for a pilot's duty after a wild night of sex, booze, and cocaine, and, after the plane hits turbulence, makes a heroic effort and manages to crash land it with minimal loss of life and damage and is praised for his efforts. However, things change after an investigation.I think this movie shows how people can rise and fall and can be both a hero and a goat in the public's eye, especially after much scrutiny. Washington's performance was first-rate, and the cast was good, and everything works. It might not work for everyone, though.** 1/2 out of ****",8,1,2,6 November 2016

The survivors start dying in creepy (if unnecessarily gory) ways.This movie will scare you. I recommend it.*** out of ****",Null,1,3,25 April 2001
Rear Window," a true classic
","This was classic Hitchcock in its extreme. It was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, and I'm glad I did. It got me into his films. In the film, Jimmy Stewart plays a photographer who is cooped up in his apartment due to a broken leg. There was no such thing as the internet back then, so he has to spend his time spying on his neighbors. He swears he sees one of them (Raymond Burr) commit a murder. He tries to get his lady friend involved. Hitchcock knows how to build the suspense. Those scenes are done with subtlety and with what is not seen, and that is as effective as what IS seen.Spying on the neighbors is fun, like the lady getting undressed, the lady with the dog, and the pianist. Try and catch Hitchcock's cameo in this film-he makes one in most of his movies. The final showdown scene is tense and suspenseful. Not only is this the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, it is also one of my favorites.This is a classic, and the theme has been used many times, like in Disturbia and in an ALF episode. I'm sure I (and you) can think of other examples. This is Hitchcock at his best! **** out of ****",10,0,3,16 March 2011
The Purge," decent
","I'd rank this as a 'high-concept' film that asks a question:if you could commit a crime without having to worry about getting caught, what would it be? The concept is that in the near future, America has a severe prison overcrowding problem, so, one night a year, all crime, including murder, with a few exceptions, is legal. Everyone, to keep safe, observes this with a 'lockdown' at their house. (Can you really blame them?) Sociologists and Politicians thoroughly agree with the Purge. The action takes place at Ethan Hawke's house as he locks down, a stranger appears at his door and gets in, and gangs start 'purging.' You find yourself wondering what you would do in a world like this and if you were in Hawke's family's shoes. I think this was an outstanding film. Watch it if you get the chance.** 1/2 out of ****",8,0,1,14 October 2014

Carrey delivers a terrific performance as a man who (unbeknowenst to him and only him) is the star of a 24-hour, 7 days a week soap opera which chronicles his life as a plot.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," decent
","This wasn't too bad a sequel to Hunger Games, as it mostly continues the story of Catniss and her lover from the first movie and the saga they have to continue as being victors from the 75th Hunger Games. This features lots of action, romance, and a decent amount of character development, and some new characters, but it does go on a bit long and tends to drag a bit. If you are a fan of the series, you might not mind those last too bits. Jennifer Lawrence is once again a good choice in the lead role, and the cast does click, as it did in the first movie. If you are a fan of the series and Jennifer Lawrence, you might like this.** 1/2 out of ****",7,1,1,2 January 2017
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," hilarious
","This is what 80s films were all about! At least what a 'brainless comedy' should be. The movie features two guys who will have an enormous impact on the future with their band-the problem is they're about to flunk history, and one will be sent off to military camp as a result, so George Carlin gets sent in a time machine from the future to help them. (The Terminator as a comedy in reverse!) The two guys in lead are practically brain dead and need the help. They are given the time machine to round up such historical figures as Napoleon, Billy the Kid, Socrates, and Joan of Arc and give a truly excellent report! My favorite scenes are at the Circle K and when they get Napoleon and Billy the Kid. If you need a movie with mindless laughs...you will love this movie! *** out of ****",9,1,1,18 April 2017
Godzilla," outstanding
","I liked this one better than the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick, simply because it reverts to making Godzilla the 'good guy' monster again and shows him battling the 'bad guy' monsters in the vein of the classic Godzilla films. You might prefer the originals because the cheesy special effects were what made them fun (or because of nostalgia), but this was a good entry in the series. It starts off with a scientist having to shut the door to cut off a nuclear cloud at the expense of his family while investigating some strange 'goings-on' in the Philipines. 15 years later, his son is in the Navy with a family of his own, and is called to Japan because his father has been arrested, and monsters are being investigated. Of course one of them is Godzilla. Nuclear explosions are to blame, they reach San Fransisco, and epic battles ensue as our hero's family is in danger.I think the monsters' battle scenes are a main highlight, and the vast majority of this film was well done.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is such a Looper, and he is sent back on a mission. He encounters his future self and someone who will do something horrible in the future-who is a child in this present.

Olive-the main character-lies to her friend about a weekend fling with a college guy. Unfortunately, the high school prude (who is a devout Christian) overhears her, and the rumor mills start cranking. Olive starts using this to her advantage to gain popularity with the boys, but things unfortunately get out of hand, and she learns how things can ruin your reputation-the hard way with a boy one night, and she tries to fix it. Fortunately, she has the right friend and family member. I love her podcasts and the scenes with Amanda Bynes. Lisa Kudrow's character was also good.

He makes them sign a contract requiring them to maintain a 2.3 GPA, show up for all their classes, and wear a coat and tie on game days, among other things. He wants them to earn the title 'student athletes,' with student coming first. When they break the terms of the contract, he locks them out of practice and games until they get their priorities straight, which I thought was the right thing to do.

From the opening sequence to Fox's being chased back in time to his convincing Lloyd he's telling the truth to Biff's flubbing the old sayings (why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?) to the dance to the suspenseful scene towards the end-hey, what's not to love?A great movie!*** out of ****",Null,1,2,22 October 2002
Back to the Future," terrific
","Here is an excellent movie. This benefits from a tricky subject (time travel), great characters, and good acting. For those of us who have ever wanted to go back in time and change something or strike back at our tormentors or who just want to WATCH A MOVIE, this is for you. Michael J. Fox travels back 30 years and accidentally interferes with his parents' initial meeting. He then needs to fix it in a week or before he disappears from existence-whichever comes first. Christopher Lloyd is terrific as the mad scientist. Everyone else is fine too. *** out of ****",Null,1,2,7 September 2000
Goodfellas," first-rate
","A first-rate gangster movie that is great in every aspect. Terrific acting, especially in the leads (Liotta, De Niro, Pesci, and Bracco). The story will keep you hooked all the way through. I thought this was a great film.*** out of ****",Null,0,0,6 June 2001
The Proposal," predictable but good
","You know how this movie is going to turn out, yet it's still watchable and funny. Ryan Reynolds plays a writer in a firm run by the hard-nosed and unliked Sandra Bullock, whom no one really likes as a supervisor due to the way she runs things. When she learns that she is about to be deported back to her native Canada because she didn't renew her visa, she says she's engaged to Reynolds, and complicated situations arise. They visit his family in Alaska for a relatives' 90th birthday and start to bond. Complications arise with an ex-girlfriend. You can probably figure out what happens next.The best part of this movie is the hilarious opening sequence and the chemistry between the two lead stars.**1/2 out of ****",8,0,0,6 July 2017
The Birds," for the birds
","One of two Hitchcock movies that will terrify you-the other is Psycho. The Big Year is a comedy about birds-this isn't. This movie is about bird attacks in the San Francisco area. Memorable scenes include the birds popping up, little by little, on the metal structure, the scene at the gas station, the gull attack on the lady, and the 'swarm' at the end. Watch for Hitchcock's cameo at the beginning. This is one of his classics. I loved it. Prepared to be scared if you watch it-especially if birds terrify you! The cinematography was a big plus too-especially of the bird swarms.**** out of ****",9,1,4,2 December 2016
Sully," superb
","A heroic, true-to-life movie done right. Sully, the pilot of a US Air flight who had to crash the plan into the Hudson after crashing into a flight of birds and then rescue the passengers, is brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hanks, and the movie and all the other performances and cinematography are first rate. I also loved the 'recreation scenes.' Even you know what's going to happen, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seats!*** out of ****",9,0,0,3 November 2019
Jurassic Park," big as the dinosaurs!
","The main stars of this film are the dinosaurs. They were first rate special effects and one of the main highlights of any film. The movie features your basic 'capture-escape-pursuit' plot as the dinosaurs get loose on the island designed as a theme park with them as the stars and wreck havoc, pursuing human prey.All in all, I thought this was quite good. The performances were wonderful, and the action and suspense rank up there with the best.*** out of ****",Null,0,1,8 September 2001
Draft Day," good sports film
","I think this movie serves as a good sports film and a good vehicle for Kevin Costner. As you watch it, I dare you not to think of 'Trouble With the Curve' though-the similarities are striking. The movie takes place entirely on NFL Draft Day as Costner's character-the Cleveland Browns' GM-pulls off a huge trade with the Seattle Seahawks, and the 'big prize' is a big-named quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy. He has hours to decide what to do, and he is also impressed with a linebacker who is eligible for the draft.After wheeling and dealing with some other surprising moves, dealing with the difficult head coach and the other employees, and some hard thinking, Costner finally does what I somehow figured he would. Other things he later did surprised me though.Any sports fan will like this movie. I think it gave a reasonably realistic and good portrayal of what happens 'behind the scenes' on draft day.*** out of ****",8,5,10,15 April 2014
Dodgeball," decent comedy
","This was a pretty good comedy and typical of the humor used by stars Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. The movie starts off with Vaughn and Stiller as fitness gym owners in close proximity to each other. Vaughn's gym is pretty run-down and in deep financial debt and about to be taken over by Stiller's more 'high-class' gym. He has to come up with $50,000 to pay him off. Fortunately, Vaughn has a devoted group of regulars, and one of them finds a dodgeball tournament in Vegas, and one guess how much the big prize is worth? Of course they enter it! So does Stiller and his gym of devotees.My favorite scenes were the ones with the girl scouts, the uniform mixup, and the final showdown and the final scenes. This was pretty funny fare mostly all the way through. You might like it if you are a comedy fan and like the stars. The tournament scenes were terrific!** 1/2 out of ****",8,0,1,12 February 2017
Up in the Air," Good movie
","This was a good movie about an executive who lives a nomadic life style via airplanes. He finally finds a good companion in Anna Kendrick. Clooney finds more to life than flying, his job, and firing people. This movie 🎥 is good at characters, story, and is well acted and makes you think 🤔 about things that are important in life. Clooney was exceptional. Great cast too.*** out of ****",9,0,0,10 February 2019
The Island," interesting concept-almost well executed
","This movie featured an interesting concept-clones in a compound who are being kept there as 'insurance policies' for their human look-alike counterparts. Basically, they are being kept there for their organs, which will be transferred to their counterparts when they start to fail in an effort for that person to live longer. The clones think they're real. There is a lottery in the compound where they will be taken to an island paradise should they win, which is actually a cover for something more sinister. Two of the clones discover the truth and escape, trying to find their counterparts. I think this was a good film on the science fiction and action level. It was also laced with a little humor, as the scenes with Steve Buscemi's character and on the outside in the 'real world' as they tried to adjust and were exposed to new things were actually pretty funny. There were a couple gratuitous chase scenes (which seem to be mandatory in films like this) which strained credibility and I feel like the film could have done with out or at least could have toned down a little bit. Other than that, the film was good. You might like it. I recommend it if you like this sort of thing.** 1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,31 December 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," good one
","This was an interesting concept. A Coen brothers version of the Oddyssey. It was enjoyable and funny all the way, with Clooney and Goodman (among others) perfectly cast in their roles. I loved this movie and recommend it.If you remember the Oddyssey at all from literature classics, try to catch all the 'updates' in the movie. I'm sure you'll catch them. I did.

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," hilarious
","This is a truly hilarious movie starring Will Ferrell, one of his best. I have read things other people said about the movie where they said it wasn't very good or that they were offended by some parts in it, so I guess it's all a matter of taste. I thought it was good. The racing scenes, the parts with Ferrell rolling around in his underwear thinking he's on fire, the subsequent scenes in the hospital, the part where the French guy tried to break Ricky's arm, and the Applebee's scenes ranked among my favorites. I think the cast had great chemistry, especially between Ferrell and the guy who played Cal. The gay French character was hysterical. If you like Will Ferrell and his over-the-top roles, you will love this movie.*** out of ****",8,0,2,28 April 2007
