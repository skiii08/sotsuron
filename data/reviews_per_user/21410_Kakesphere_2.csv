It," Horror with Soul
","Whether you're a fan of the novel, the original miniseries, or both, you'll find something in this film to refresh your interest.The kids are spectacular. The scares are well-produced, even where the CG is heavy-handed. The spirit and flavor of the book, the heart of it, is very much intact for anyone willing to look.For detractors who see a Stranger Things scapegoating, I'd ask you to consider that the book was published over thirty years ago with characters who were meant to be contemporary. Setting aside the budgetary issues involved in encapsulating both the fifties and the eighties (production design for It 2017 didn't cover proper packaging in the pharmacy scenes, whether by choice or not), sticking to the original timeline would have obstructed the story itself. It would be less accessible, and with more time wasted making the touchstones of generation upon generation ring true. Time moves on, and these characters have moved with it.That said, It was incredibly well-crafted by people who seem to love and understand the source material, both its profanity and its divinity. I'm more excited for Chapter 2 next month than I've been for any horror release in memory.See you in Derry.",9,1,2,13 August 2019
It Chapter Two," What exactly happened here?
","I have looked forward to ITC2 since the credits rolled on the first, and thought the spirit of IT 1 matched the best parts of the novel and the miniseries.I am so sad to, at this point, be unable to recommend the second. (Ymmv, as I was toggling between the events onscreen and the voice in my head that kept thinking things would get better.)The 'worst' parts of the first film, the episodic beat of the encounters with Pennywise, as well as the CG, are writ larger in Chapter 2, with graphics being the worst offender. (Where there were just a couple tetchy moments in IT 1, there are gobs in 2.) Together these two elements bloat, neuter, and generally disable this movie from about 30-40 minutes in all the way through to the end.The adult losers are all fine actors, but the vocals (accent/dialect/whatchamacallit) could've been coached much better than they were for those from across the pond. Sadly this was true even for a particular actor who's got to be among the best in the biz. Muscle-memory-wise, I felt like Isaiah Mustafa and Andy Bean (however little he was on screen) matched the performances of their Chapter 1 counterparts the best. But due to script choices and the abundance of flashbacks, some other characters/actors never even got the chance.And oh, the flashbacks. I'd read that they had to budget to de-age the kids, but even with help those differences were distracting. Had they reduced these scenes instead of mainlining them throughout, it wouldn't have been an issue for me.In all, Chapter 2 felt like a different film entirely, which I get is what was supposed to happen. But rather than two apposite halves that somehow make a whole, this half felt blander, safer, more cynical, and about as energetic as a tree snail.Will I still get it on BluRay? . . . I plead the fifth.",6,0,1,7 September 2019
