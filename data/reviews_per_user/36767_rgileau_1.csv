The Devil's Advocate," How did I not see this sooner?
","Amazing movie, the only reason I didn't give a 9 or 10 was because of the poorly done southern accents. Otherwise, the story, moral, and acting throughout the whole movie was top-notch and very entertaining. This is a movie I wish I would have seen decades sooner.",8,0,0,7 July 2020
