Hereditary," Need to watch it again
",At first viewing didn't know why exorcist comparisons and what the fuss was about than few weeks later watched it again DAMN IT HIT ME ALL AT ONCE BRILLIANT great movie I thought as horror and a thrilling ride of a movie third time round the movie scared the crap out of me no jump scares in this one guys THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A DAMN HORROR MOVIE,10,2,3,27 June 2020
Passengers," Good production and great scenes
",But the action taken by our lead is selfish and inconsiderate also theres just no way anyone wanting to get away from it all could ever get so lonely,4,1,1,27 April 2020
Us," The end simply throws it all away
",I'm torn about this one sure it's a new telling of the old doppelg√§nger concept however it's done well what makes it weak is the explanation as to why the teethers were first killing everyone and second even needed to murder people hmmm. Don't expect this to come anywhere close to get out. Never the less as a one off horror movie job well done,8,1,5,23 May 2019

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Could have been cool
",It's not like Disney can't produce a great movie with this they just didn't bother or care enough. They hired a pretentious director and it all went downhill from there. Thanks Disney for ruining Star wars,6,1,8,18 March 2020
Justice League," A much better film than critics would have you believe especially the wrong kind
",If you like super hero movies Marvel DC or any kind than you need to chill relax sit back and get rid of any preconceived notions and watch this movie like it's a comic book and than like me you will find this to be a damn good movie the problem with DC fans is that they go into a Marvel movie expecting it to be like a DC movie and the problem with Marvel fans is that they too go into a DC movie expecting it to be a marvel movie and the big problem with critics is they expect too much from a comic book movie. This movie seriously got a bad break it's an amazing film if you watch it as a superhero comic book film,7,5,7,28 May 2019
The Shining," Best example of film making everything done to perfection
",There's many remakes of this movie don't be fooled into watching any of them before this because No matter how many times they try and no matter who tries to direct they will never be able to beat this great achievement in film making ever. Best adaptation of a Steven King book ever put to film,10,2,4,28 May 2019
The Lion King," Not as great as the original but worth a watch

What We Do in the Shadows," I was wrong this film is amazing and very funny
","Back when this came out I gave it a miss because it sounded dumb but few years later I realised it got a bit of a cult following so checked the trailer again I got put off than I watched the amazing Thor Ragnarok and found out it was directed by the same guy and so 2019 I finally got round to watching it and boy was I wrong, the film blew me away I went into it knowing absolutely nothing about it and yet start to end I was hooked and laughed throughout the movie the jokes were wow and did not get old and though the plot was weak the movie made up for it with great characters excellent humour and a tremendous final",10,0,0,25 May 2019
Minions," A series of scenes of minions doing things
",No plot no character development no point in watching this garbage calling this movie an animated comedy is insulting our intelligence,2,0,0,27 May 2019
