Black Swan," A disappointment
","I have to sort of agree with valkyria4. Although Portman certainly was excellent, and I believe deserved the awards she got, the movie itself was a disappointment for me, but Portman's performance was why I even gave it a 2 instead of a 1. It started out okay, and then got just plain silly. I mean really silly. I cannot see why this movie got such rave reviews. Yes, the ballet scenes were wonderful to see, and the acting was superb, but the story disintegrated into a 'psycho gobbledygook' reminiscent of a cheap horror movie by Roger Corman. It's my opinion that those who rave about it were sucked in by the hype provided by the studio, and loved by the same people who buy modern, abstract art...it became simply a prestigious thing to hawk above us stupid masses who just don't get it.",2,0,2,5 May 2011
The Hunger Games," I walked out
","This is probably one of the most boring movies I've seen in years. Very seldom do I walk out of a movie, but I'd had it after about 2/3 of it transpired. I just couldn't take it anymore. I had no curiosity at all about the ending...because, even if you hadn't read the book, you knew all would be well. I'm so saddened that today's youth is so attached to werewolves, vampires and ridiculous sci-fi stories. I hope all those who make these stories so popular all text and drive too. We are losing our culture to crap. Crap on the TV. Crap in literature. Crap at the movies. Even an old fogey like Betty White (on her new show), has given in to the basest of humor to get a laugh, and unfortunately, she gets them. I'm glad I'm an old fogey too, so I won't be around when the declining morals and taste of this country bring it down...and it will. You young ones will be there when it happens. Hope you enjoyed your ride.",1,40,57,25 April 2012
