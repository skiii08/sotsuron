Requiem for a Dream," Couldn't watch but I couldn't look away
",The last fifteen minutes of this film was some of the most horrifying yet gripping scenes I have ever seen.  As the credits rolled I sat there motionless with my mouth agape.  Everybody must see this movie.  I wanted to look away so bad but yet I couldn't stop watching.  Mesmerizing.,8,2,3,7 July 2001
