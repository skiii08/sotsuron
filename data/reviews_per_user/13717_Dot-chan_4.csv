Alien 3," The Passions of Joan of Arc + flesh-dissolving alien (spoilers)
","No, really. I saw _La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc_ with my roommate. Nearly all of the camera angles involving Ripley were copied from that movie, including:    1. The head shaving scene    2. Lots and lots of closeups of Joan's/Ripley's face    3. Being surrounded by bald, angry men    4. Death by fireAnd notice that Ripley first wakes up in a place that could easily be the cell of a monastery (what in the world are stained glass windows doing in a prison colony anyway?) and the abundance of crossed-shaped objects.As for the AIDS thing, I didn't quite see that, but my roommate commented that the entire Aliens series seemed to be playing on the fear of pregnancy. (There's something _living_ inside my abdominal area! Aah!)",Null,2,3,27 September 2000
Akira," You'll either love it or hate it
","Akira is a Sci-Fi/Horror about the dangers of playing with technology beyond our ability to understand or control.  Animation quality is amazing, especially considering all of it was completely hand-drawn.  It occasionally gets a bit excessively gory and some of the plot is cliched, but still a good movie to watch.  Read the manga if you have the chance, too--the ending is vastly different and very surprising.",Null,0,0,18 January 2000
American Psycho," Did He Really Do It Or Was It All In His Head? (Massive Spoilerage)
","At first the movie sets things up to make Patrick out to be a cold, calculating murderer who does his grisly deeds by night and mingles in his upperclass yuppy society by day.  (By the way...'Norman', 'Bateman'...these two names ring a bell?)But then the clues start clashing.  People claim to have seen Paul Allen, Patrick's first victim.  The population of New York begins to thin out until only Patrick and his targets remain.  Women begin to act like the clueless screamer's they're portrayed as in the horror movies that Patrick watches.And then Patrick's world falls apart entirely.  He goes through an eerily empty city, shooting everyone he sees, and walks away without a scratch. The next morning, the detective on his trail has mysteriously vanished, Paul is safely alive in London, and not even Patrick's lawyer is willing to buy that Bateman is a murdering lunatic.So...Is this a movie about one man's decent into self-gratification and vicarious thrills through some really disturbing fantasy? Or a morality play about the lengths people can be driven to when they stop caring?I dunno.  I'd probably have to watch it twice.  I'd recommend it to those who can stomach the violence, and definitely for anyone who can appreciate a multi-layered tale.  I'd say it's worth watching for Christian Bale's scary, scary performance alone.",Null,0,0,18 October 2000
Ben-Hur," Worth watching for the music alone
","I don't get emotionally affected by movies often, but every time I watch -Ben Hur- I get a lump in my throat.  The musical score for this movie is one of the best and most appropriate that I've ever heard.  That, combined with genuine acting, fleshed-out, believable characters, and a great script, results in a movie adaptation which many believe to be superior to the original work.  Those 4 hours go by a lot quicker than I thought because I was so absorbed by the movie.",Null,2,5,20 March 2000
