The Avengers," Don't care what the masses might be saying...
","...this film wasn't good at all. With the exception of the excitement of seeing all these leading characters in one movie, I fail to see why everyone has been running and running to this movie. First of all, the acting is terrible, led by Chris Evans as a far-too-earnest Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth as a heavily accented Thor with dialogue that made sense hundreds of years ago, but not in 2012. Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Scarlett Johansson are decent enough, but no Academy Award nominees there. The plot and many of the sub-plots were difficult to follow, as the primary purpose of this movie was to show cars, buildings, and people being blown up. I understand that I'm not in this movie's target demographic, but the X-Men series and Iron Man were far more intelligent and interesting than this. Yes, I know this will be one of the highest grossing pictures of all-time, which is why I wanted to know what all the fuss was. Yes, I know there will be many sequels generated from this, which makes sense. Just count me out from going to see them.",4,7,18,26 May 2012
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Blindsided
","This film was a huge and pleasant surprise for me to see, and I'm sorry I didn't see it in 2012 when it had originally come out. The critical reviews were good but not great, and when there's so much out there, you try to make the best choices you can on the information that you have.I didn't see the surprise end coming at all. It really blew me away. Emma Watson was also extremely compelling and charismatic in this film. And while of course there were a few lines spoken by high school students in the film that were a little too mature/clever for their ages, it doesn't go overboard like in Juno or Brick, and of course movies are made to entertain.I really thought they 'got' a lot of what high school was about and being that age. It's been awhile since I graduated from there, and I still thought it was great, so I feel confident saying this movie has the potential to please just about any age group.",9,0,0,28 January 2014
Ghost," Anyone who's able to make me like Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg in a Movie Must be a Genius
","The most interesting thing about this movie before it was released in the Summer of 1990 was that there was no hype about it. I remember that Premiere Magazine did their annual Top 20 prediction list of what would gross the most money that summer, and Ghost wasn't even in their list of 20. But the critical reviews were high, and the word-of-mouth was so strong, that it ended up being the #1 summer flick that year. As I said in the Summary Title, anyone who can make Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg come off as being likable and sympathetic is a genius, whether that was the director, the editor, or maybe just a little bit of both.",9,4,5,17 July 2017
United 93," But is it entertaining?
","This was definitely a film worth seeing, and very intense. However, it is a double-edged sword when you make the movie so 'documentary-like.' On the one hand, it treats the subjects with an enormous amount of respect, stays as objective as it can, and appears to be an accurate portrayal of what happened on that incredibly sad day in America. On the other hand, it's a little slow and dry, as there are no other 'dramatic' sub-plots, etc. This film actually reminded me a bit of 'Downfall' (Der Untergang) which came out last year and showed Hitler's last days. In the sense that it's extremely meticulous and informative. But is it entertaining? Not very much so. Someone could successfully argue that a film like this should NOT be entertaining, and I would probably agree with them. But if we're gauging our like/dislike rating on a 'satisfying film experience,' I'm not sure United 93 deserves all the acclaim that it's getting.",7,3,7,13 May 2006
In Bruges," Already will probably be on my 'Best of 2008' list.
","Clearly this film was influenced by 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.' Really funny...I guess some people find humor in the 'f-bomb' being dropped and some don't. And with the exception of the remake of 'The Ladykillers,' I guess I find that to be funny. As others have noted, all the acting performances are great...I happened to think Farrell did the best job, but one could make the successful argument that Gleason and Fiennes did just as good if not better. Great snappy dialogue...had it gone too far, it would have been too over-the-top like in 'Juno,' but it was reigned in just enough to make it delightful. How any 'professional' critics are deriding this film is beyond me. They should be fired from their gig for being so clueless.",8,4,9,24 February 2008
Rocketman," I felt like I was watching an episode of 'Glee'
","Anyone expecting to see a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' version of Elton John's story will be sorely disappointed. This movie has very little linear structure, and breaking out into song and dance in the middle of a scene made me feel like I was watching an episode of Glee. The other major mistake of this movie was having Taron Egerton sing the Elton John songs, rather than Elton himself. Why?The proof is in the pudding...Bohemian Rhapsody did far better than Rocketman at the worldwide box office, despite better critical reviews of Rocketman and arguably, Elton John was a much bigger act than Queen worldwide. I would assume that future biopics of rock stars will follow the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' model rather than the 'Rocketman' model.",5,2,3,5 January 2020
Gravity," Making Out with George Clooney
","I saw this in the movie theater and watched it in 3D, so I certainly saw this movie the way it was preferred by those responsible for Gravity.The film is decent but nothing special. The story is interesting, but didn't translate well by the director, who probably focused all his efforts on the visuals, rather than the story. The visuals are interesting, especially in the first 15 minutes, but after that, you're used to it (at least I was), and it's less impressive. Still, I'm sure it's going to get nominated, and probably win lots of Academy Awards in the technical categories. So why the critical slobbering over this movie? For whatever reason, film critics are obviously so in love with George Clooney that it really doesn't matter what he does...they're going to hail it as a masterpiece. I'm sure he's a nice guy and everything, but is this the reason why they adore his films? Do they think if they give a good review to his movie that Clooney will let them hang out with him and get them laid? I made the mistake of watching Up in the Air, and couldn't believe how bad it was. I avoided, 'The Descendents,' because I knew I wasn't going to like it as much as the critics, and after I saw it on HBO (or one of those pay channels), I thought it was OK, but nothing special. But with the nearly unanimous high acclaim that this film received, I felt I had no choice but to see what all the hubbub was about. I guess I shouldn't see any of Clooney's films anymore unless I can rent it or watch it on HBO.",5,1,3,16 November 2013
Argo," Decent, but...
","In general, I liked this film, as well as the other films that Affleck directed - Gone Baby Gone, and The Town. The problem at this point with Affleck is that his films start out very strong, but like a Grisham, novel, he has problems closing them.The opening of the film, which purports to show the storming of the American Embassy in Iran is amazing, and sets the tense tone of the picture. The rescue, back story, etc. are all amazing, and I can see why this became such a hot project to be attached to.My problem with this movie is the ending. Now I know that they are saying that this movie is 'based' on a true event, rather than the actual event. So that gives them some poetic license. But in this movie, their escape onto the plane is literally seconds away from being blown in multiple instances, and I'm sure while this escape was daring, stressful, etc., I'm sure it wasn't this razor-tight. For me, even if boarding the plane was more uneventful than shown, I still would have liked it, and probably thought it was more faithful to what really occurred. I didn't need to be hit over the head on how dangerous this operation was, and how courageous all the operatives were to get this done.",7,18,32,15 October 2012
Juno," Too cool for school
","Normally, there is always one film each year that not only do I think is overrated by the critics, but is actually a BAD film. After watching the first half of this movie, I thought I found it this year in 'Juno.' IMHO, this film would have worked much better had they dialed back the oh-so-clever dialog just a little bit so that it could have been a bit more plausible and real. The first half of the film had the most unrealistic, heightened dialog I had seen in a film since the ridiculous 'Brick' of 2006.Thankfully, the second half came back more to the plot, and I found it to be surprisingly sweet at the end, and it salvaged the film for me.I also find it interesting that as I write this review, the majority of negative user comments are more recent. This makes sense to me, because as more and more 'mainstream' film goers watch this film, I think they're going to dislike many of the things that I also did not care for.",5,21,47,24 December 2007
Milk," Authentic, but derivative
","Sean Penn does an excellent job, and deserves all the acclaim he is getting. But the film itself? Sadly (and I haven't seen this noted very much in the Comments section), this is extremely derivative of the 1984 documentary, 'The Times of Harvey Milk.' On the one hand, this makes it extremely authentic, but on the other hand, what was the point? The only point I can see (aside from making money, of course) was to tell Milk's story for mainstream audiences to see. Apparently, most have not yet seen the original documentary. For those who loved 'Milk,' I think you'll be shocked to see that it copied/recreated many, many parts of the documentary, including (but not limited to) the following:1. Each film opens with Dianne Feinstein's announcement of the Milk and Moscone assassinations. 2. Each begins quoting from Milk's recorded will that should only be released if he were to be assassinated. 3. 'Milk' recreates the scene of the press interviewing him the night he finally won election to the Board of Supervisors 4. 'Milk' recreates the scene where Briggs gives his '21 Gun Salute' diatribe.And on and on, and on. So this made it a bit of a disappointment to me. If I had never seen the documentary, I may have rated this higher. But I did see the documentary, so I was less impressed with the movie.",7,2,8,2 January 2009
The Hateful Eight," I don't even know where to begin...
","Normally, I wouldn't bother adding a review on IMDb, when so many have already been written. However, this film was shockingly bad, so I wanted to add my two cents as well. As others have previously noted, the problems with this film are numerous: 1 - Length - When I see a bad film that is 90 minutes long, well at least it didn't drag on and on. This film is close to 3 hours, and is endless.2 - Nothing really happens for 3 hours.3 - The clever, snappy dialogue that is in most Tarantino movies is missing.4 - Overrated acting from everyone, including Oscar nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh, who looks like a cross between the possessed Linda Blair in The Exorcist and Sissy Spacek in Carrie. Is this why she's gotten such great acclaim? It can't be for her performance. There was none. Also of little note is Tim Roth in the 'Christoph Waltz' role.5 - Over-the-top graphic-ness of violence. I'm not a prude, but in many, many instances, it just wasn't necessary.I think Pulp Fiction is a great film, and I enjoyed Jackie Brown as well. Since then, I haven't liked much of his stuff, but since I was so pleasantly surprised with Django Unchained, I thought this one could be really good. Boy was I wrong. You think because you have the clout to make a film in Panavision that I should be impressed? Next time, make a good movie to go along with it.",2,5,12,26 April 2016
Capote," Does Hoffman deserve the Oscar?
","'Capote' isn't great, but isn't all that bad. And in 2005, when film releases have been so bad, that's a pretty stirring recommendation to see this film.There is no doubt that Philip Seymour Hoffman does an incredible job as Truman Capote. However, I am concerned that what may be happening now in Hollywood is that awards are being given to people who do the best impression of a famous dead person. Re: All the awards Jamie Foxx won last year for 'Ray.' If this happens this year for PSH, I'm afraid this will become the formula for winning/being nominated for Oscars. Is it a great impression? Absolutely. Is it a great acting performance? I'm not so sure.I also was intrigued by Catherine Keener's turn as Harper Lee. I didn't realize until I saw the movie that they had worked together.As others have noted, the main negative is that this film was very slow at times.",7,2,5,23 November 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," One of the best films of the 2000's!
","...and also one of the rare cases where the movie is better than the book that it's based on, and I think the book is very good. Helen Fielding wrote both, and her screenplay is very funny, and very clever. Zellweger is of course fantastic as Bridget Jones. There are so many great scenes, but my favorite one is probably the dinner party sequence where she's the only single person, and the overly enthusiastic pregnant couple makes her feel really bad about being single. But then Mark Darcy comforts her, and tells her that he likes her 'just as you are.'",10,1,1,18 July 2017
No Country for Old Men," Well-crafted, but...
","It seems that every single Coen brothers movie is going to be well-received by critics...have they ever been rated poorly? Accordingly, I go to the movies, but I know I may not like it very much. I respect the Coens, and I admire that they try to make so many different kinds of films. This is a very well-crafted film, and at this point, I think Bardem deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. That being said, the film was excruciatingly slow at many points, and simply lacked any soul.I tend to like their movies with humor, such as Fargo and Raisin' Arizona, but even that doesn't guarantee a good film (I hated O'Brother and Ladykillers). Their more serious films are technically very well-done, but usually lack any soul.",6,3,5,8 December 2007
The Illusionist," I figured out the plot twist early (but NO spoiler)!
","Normally, I'm too stupid to figure out a movie's plot twist. Yes, I figured it out early for 'The Usual Suspects,' but was clueless until the end for 'Angel Heart,' 'The Village,' and 'The Sixth Sense.' Accordingly, if I can figure it out earlier than I'm supposed to, how difficult can it be? I figured this one out about 20 minutes before I was supposed to.I don't think 'The Illusionist' is a bad film, but it's certainly not anything special. The acting is uniformly strong, but the story just isn't very good or interesting.I'll be interested in seeing how the 'professional' critics rate this, and how well it will do at the box office when it is released.",5,6,28,5 June 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Wet Dream for Hollywood.
","I thought this was better than another left-wing political film of a few years back with Joan Allen called 'The Contender,' and if that film got nominations (and it did), I can't see 'Good Night, and Good Luck' not getting a whole slew of nominations, especially in such a lackluster film year.The film had it's moments, and it's interesting to be reminded how much people smoked back then. But it's quite mediocre. Nevertheless, this is the kind of film that Hollywood liberals get all hot and excited about, as they self-congratulate themselves on how 'enlightened' they all are.Also, can someone please tell me why Hollywood loves to hire ex-drug addict Robert Downey Jr.? Why does this loser continue to work?",6,4,13,26 October 2005
Inside Man," Overrated
","With all the positive press this film was getting, I was really looking forward to this movie. What a mistake on my part. 'Inside Man' is above average at best. Where are the problems? 1. The 'twist' ending. We sat there for more than 2 hours, and then we see this weak-ass twist? 2. Great cast, but horrible performances. Especially by the great Jodie Foster, who has this smirk on her face for the entire picture, and I have absolutely no idea why. 3. Just about everybody spoke in such a clever, heightened, but completely unrealistic way that I thought I was watching John Hughes' 'Some Kind of Wonderful,' the absolute record-holder in that category.With the dreck that came out in 2005 and now this, I've finally realized that the vast majority of movie reviewers are shills for the film industry, who tout and 'root' for films that just aren't very good. Why it took me so long to come to this realization just shows how naive I was.",5,1,4,9 April 2006
There Will Be Blood," Maybe it was P.T. Barnum who made this film?
","Each year, there is one movie lauded by the critics as the best thing since sliced bread that not only don't I think is very good, but I truly think is bad. And the winner this year is...'There Will Be Blood.' I honestly don't understand why people adore this film so much, and I was someone who wanted to like it...I'm a big fan of Daniel Day-Lewis. The first two hours were OK, but the last half hour or so was so ridiculous and so over-the-top that it swayed me to give this film a poor rating.I think it's time to officially say that the great 'Boogie Nights' by P.T. Anderson wasn't the start of a great director's career...it was a fluke.",4,12,29,9 January 2008
Downfall," Meticulous, thorough, but not entertaining.
","Can I possibly be one of the first Americans to comment on IMDb about this film? Oh well...I don't pretend to represent all of America...just me. Although I'm sure that those from Europe will have a much different perspective of this movie than me. This film was seemingly very meticulous and thorough, but not at all entertaining. I'm just really surprised at how much American film critics liked this movie. 'Downfall' was almost documentary-like in form. And there's a reason why most documentaries don't do well at the box-office. They're just not very entertaining. So now I know what Hitler's last days probably looked like. Educational? Yes. Informative? Yes. Was I entertained? Nope.",6,8,29,13 April 2005
Whiplash," Very disappointing
","The film isn't bad, but nowhere near what I had expected in a movie that won Sundance among many other things. Yes, JK Simmons is fantastic, but I want to know who the producer convinced that Simmons should have been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category rather than Best Actor in this movie. He's in plenty of the picture. Of course, he couldn't have won Best Actor, but he'd be a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, which he won in spades.Towards the middle and continuing to the end, the plot became ridiculous. Getting smacked by an oncoming truck where your car flips over, and then running to make your concert? Physically attacking your teacher? Going back to play drums for the instructor that you despise, and then how does he not know a certain song will be played, when everyone else does? Didn't he have to practice with them...like ever?",5,9,16,26 April 2015
Hitch," Surprisingly good!
","I had absolutely no desire to see this movie, but went with a date last night. Wow, was I surprised how very good and very funny it was! Normally, I don't laugh out loud in movies, but I found myself laughing out loud a number of times, despite the fact that so many of the good parts were already seen in trailers! One film that I haven't seen this movie compared to is 'How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days.' To me, both films were very similar to each other.I also thought that the shots of Manhattan were gorgeous, and it's been awhile since a filmmaker has so lovingly showed this city! One criticism though (here's the spoiler, so turn away!). At the very end, you knew it was going to be a happy ending, but it was so contrived that the guy with Eva Mendes was not her boyfriend, but nobody says anything until later in the scene! Would that happen in real life? Definitely not. I'm sure the guy would have said something like, 'I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the brother-in-law.' Other than that, I really enjoyed this film, and if you're thinking about seeing it but are still skeptical, I'd say go for it!",8,0,2,10 April 2005
Ray," I Seem to Be Less Enthusiastic About 'Ray' than most of the others commenting here.
","I feel a little guilty criticizing 'Ray' in this forum, as it seems that just about everyone is in 'crazy love' with this movie. I thought Ray was definitely worth seeing, but it's NOT one of the best pictures of the year. I felt the film dragged on a bit too long, and the drug scenes at the end were hackneyed and clichéd. Of course Jamie Foxx is terrific in this role, although I still think that Johnny Depp in 'Finding Neverland' is more Oscar-worthy. To me, the best scenes in the picture were the flashbacks when Ray was a little boy with his Mom. That scene where he trips and falls down crying, and his mother remains silent to see how he will pick himself up and take care of himself is just a great scene, and one that I think will stay with me for a very long time.",7,3,7,19 December 2004
Live Free or Die Hard," Ridiculous
","Went to see this movie because the reviews were generally positive. Although this film had it's entertaining moments, the action scenes were ridiculous. The film actually reminded me of 'Eraser' that came out a number of years ago with Arnold, which was similarly ridiculous.SPOILERS: I guess John McClane must be Superman in disguise for taking all those hits and falls, and getting up like nothing happened. The most ridiculous one of them all was when he leaps from the helicopter, and the piece of road is used to break his fall. The other ridiculous moment (non-action) is when the bad guys rescue his daughter from the elevator. And before she gets out, she goes, 'Can I see some ID?' Now, what would happen if they didn't have ID? Is she going to run away? Is she going to stay in the elevator? It's OK to ask that when you're protected by your house. But in a stuck elevator with no one else there? I also didn't like Justin Long as the snarky Generation Y kid. It was fun to see Kevin Smith in a role other than what he does in his own films, but I doubt someone would be that flippant when the country is being destroyed.Only Maggie Q was especially good. But she also must have 'Superman' genes in her final fight scene, when she kept staying alive no matter what happened.",4,4,8,13 July 2007
Cinderella Man," Unfair to Max Baer
","This film is definitely worth seeing, but is also definitely NOT in the class of 'A Beautiful Mind.' While I'm usually a Russell Crowe fan (as an actor, that is), I wasn't overly impressed with his performance, although I think he did a good job. As someone from New Jersey, I was particularly impressed with Zellweger's dead-on accent, which made her sound like my Aunt! That being said, I was stunned at the 'poetic license' taken in a completely unfair portrayal of Max Baer. I don't think anything I've ever read or seen has ever portrayed him in such a negative light. I understand why it was done in this movie, but it also makes me wonder how many other parts of the movie didn't really happen, but were shown for 'dramatic effect.' I'm not asking for 100% accuracy (see Hitler's last days in 'Downfall'), but playing this loose with the facts hurts 'Cinderella Man's' credibility.",6,2,3,19 June 2005
Up in the Air," Stunk
","Sometimes I may not like a film, but I can understand why others appreciated it. Not 'Up in the Air.' This film simply wasn't good. This film is extremely cynical, and I suppose if you like that, you'll love this film, but I rarely care for cynical films.Now I don't know George Clooney, and maybe he is a really good guy, but that doesn't mean that critics should treat him (and the Coen Brothers, for that matter) with such kid gloves, and that everything they do is a masterpiece. How this film has already won so many Critics awards, and may win Golden Globes and Oscars is stunning to me.Before I saw this movie, I heard raves about Anna Kendrick in this role. Whatever for? I can see the whipper-snapper Cornell college graduate thinking she knows more about how to terminate people than the 'adults,' but there's no way someone at that age has enough life experience to be advising George Clooney about how he should be living his life, as well as all the other countless insights and observations her character gave. I felt like I was watching 'Juno' all over again.",4,3,9,27 December 2009
