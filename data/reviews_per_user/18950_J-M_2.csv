The Blair Witch Project," Not as scary as critics say
","Okay, what could I say about this movie? Well, when I went to see it, I knew what sort of flick it was going to be. The starting point is kinda interesting, but the movie, in my opinion, is not scary at all. The critics says it's like the creepiest movie made in a while... Yeah right! All you see, is three teens walking, saying that they are f**king lost and finding some strange stuff in the woods. It's like if they don't say anything except 'f**k' and 'we're f**king lost'. I thought it was pathetic.Not to mention that the end is deceiving. If you want to see blood or stuff like that, this movie is not for you! Actually, it's not that bad, but I didn't enjoy it. You'll adore or hate it. If you have guts and that you're used to go camping, you shouldn't be scared and you shouldn't bother seeing at all. Still, I'd give it 4/10 for the story(and the effort), who looked promising at the begin...",Null,0,1,18 August 1999
Blade Runner," A great sci-fi/detective movie
","Blade runner is a classic of sci-fi for sure.First of all, the story is damn cool.  In a near future, there are robots called Replicants that are illegal on Earth and there are those Blade runners who are trying to track them and kill them for money.  In the movie, Harrison Ford is an ancient blade runner who's being forced by his ex-boss to investigate about a small group of fugitives replicants.Now, the great things about the movie are the realisator's job and the music.  Scott created a cool work who always seems dark and it's always raining...  The music score by Vangelis is fantastic: it's hard to imagine any other music for this music.Another thing is that this movie doesn't gets old.  What I mean is that there are not a lot of special effects like lasers.  So this movie could actually have been made just a few years ago. But the movie is a bit slow and almost poetic in some scenes... Anyway, if you like sci-fi and detective stuff, you should love this flick.I give it a 9/10",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
