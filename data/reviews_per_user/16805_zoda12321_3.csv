Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not the least bit interesting
","The problem with Borat was not that it was offensive or that it inspired prejudice, it was clearly making fun of prejudice in a round about way. That's not what made this movie so bad.I personally find nothing at all wrong with getting a good laugh out of something which holds some truth, offensive or not. Personally I didn't find this movie very offensive though ti did have its share of non-politically correct humor. Borat wasn't a bad movie because it was rude, it was just a bad movie because it wasn't funny or thought out.With the exception of a few scenes, Borat just wasn't interesting. I felt like anyone over the age of 7 could have thought up a much more clever plot. Borat's character was an attempt to impersonate middle easterners while pointing out some of some of the flaws in their culture such as sexism. While there may be flaws in these societies, there is much more ignorance about their practices. Throughout the movie Borat attempts to to understand and become Amercian. The comedy is based around how Borat is an unethical middle-eastern man. The funniest part of the movie is that most Americans (admittedly including myself) couldn't tell Borat from a real Kazakhstani or anyone else from the mid-east.The same reaction of laughter would probably come from a Kazakhstani who was watching a French man dressed up like Micheal Jordan impersonating a Kazakhstani. The character could go around Kazakhstan eating Hot dogs and wearing a turban (or maybe wearing a towel) over a cowboy hat while running around in an army suit doing a horrible fake accent.. Wouldn't that movie be hilarious? Well the only difference is that we're watching an English man impersonating a Kazakhstani impersonating an American.The humor in this movie is based around the fear and misunderstanding Americans have over Middle Eastern, what we can't understand we fear or make fun of. It's the same mentality of bully's in school yards. The amount of praise this movie is getting makes me ashamed to be American. It could have been funny if done right, but it wasn't. I doubt that people in other countries would find this movie funny. Nor would anyone 15 years from now. It's timely and regional humor that is unfortunately very telling of America's current frame of mind -fear.",1,42,86,15 November 2006
Inception," What is Inception? An idea, without substance.
","There's a lot of intellectual snobbery going on with fans of this movie. Everyone seems to think it's incredibly deep and crafted to intelligent audiences and that the only people who wouldn't like it are 'idiots who don't get it.' I understood it perfectly well and the idea of going into dreams is fantastic, but an idea doesn't make a movie. This movie failed to deliver a good plot, characterization, and most importantly the climax was one of the least interesting parts of the film! This film has all the ingredients to be great: Christopher Nolan, Leonardo Dicaprio, Ken Wantanabe... Unfortunately it ended up being more like a bad rip-off of the Matrix than something great.The idea behind this movie is that people can enter dreams simultaneously through some sort of unknown technology/methods. Great idea until you get into the details.Dreamers enter dreams are designed by 'the architects.' These 'maps' were very ordinary places with the only exception being a few changes of gravity and a few extra special effects. My problem was that even if these dreams are designed, they are still dreams. The dreamers only addition is the 'projections' which were all people who existed in the dreams. I don't know about Leonardo Dicapro and Chris Nolan, but my dreams contain numerous 'projections' which are not only out of the ordinary, but often bizarre. The idea that somehow people are allowed to be created, but not anything else what so ever is pretty mindless.The movie really went downhill when you realize that the team is on a mission to go deep into the sub-conscious of a billionaire who is about to inherit his father's company. Their goal? to split his company apart. Why? To make one of the characters more powerful.The background story about the main characters life with his wife and the dream world he constructed with her is by far the best part of the movie. I' would have much rather watched a movie all about this then what Inception really was. The entire movie leads you to believe there the main character's story will somehow end up in a typical Nolan scene where something spectacular happens -it doesn't. The only thing that happens with his wife is exactly what you could have guessed as soon as you find out about why she acts the way she does.The movie ended one that ended up being more of a cheesy action film then something with substance. What a waste! This movie was still better than a lot of the junk that Hollywood puts out, but after seeing Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and the Dark Knight, I really expected more.",4,4,9,21 July 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A book made into a film, and back again.
","I have a really huge problem with picking favorites, but this movie would have to be one of them. Flawless conclusion to the trilogy. Nothing is wrong with this movie.the acting, the dialog, the plot, the narrative, the cinematography, the costumes, the visual effects, the sound effects.My favorite thing about these movies is that they are science fiction, but nothing about them is difficult to believe. It would be hard to come up with a solid genre for Return of the King because it is a drama, it is an action movie, it is a thriller, it is a romance, it even has it's moments of comedy. It goes, here, there, everywhere, and as Bilbo Baggins would say 'back again.'",10,1,3,15 November 2006
