Orphan," Interesting horror movie
","The early part of the film seemed a bit boring. I didn't feel my appetite. Until the 'little girl' was brought home by couples, I didn't want to put down my mobile phone when he made various 'small actions' that are incomprehensible to ordinary people. From the revenge on bullying her classmates to the school, to the killing of the nuns in the orphanage, the ruthlessness of the means of crime has become more and more dazzling. The superb acting skills shown by the female lead at a young age inspired my emotions: it was anger at the role of adoptive father. In fact, when the adoptive mother discovered the girl's actual age, she was not very surprised. Details explained from the front It can be seen that girls' attitudes towards adoptive fathers are quite different, and their understanding of sex is not what they should be at this age.For example, the girl who just arrived at the orphanage talked in a way that attracted him. The night after the thunder, the reason why she was afraid to ask to sleep with him, and the couple peeked aside while the couple were in the kitchen, and girl Stolen mother's clothes, etc ...I think there is another super-performing technique in the movie that is successful. When the fans slowly guess the truth, they feel anxious and sympathetic for the adoptive mother to recognize the true face of the girl in front of her. Righteous and angry. So see the last adoptive mother put the girl, no! When this fierce woman kicked KO, she screamed inwardly: cool!",7,0,0,31 March 2020

My Neighbor Totoro," innocent and cute
","The whole story is like a fairy tale, full of innocent and simple breath, making people feel a breath of nature on their way. Although the story is simple, it does not mean that the plot is bland and the plot is a bit twisty, but it is not a trick. You can easily appreciate the sincerity of the production staff. This may be the main reason that I will be moved every time I watch Miyazaki's animation.The protagonist is a pair of sisters. The maturity of the sister contrasts with the naive or naive of the sister. But both were innocent. It is worth noting that the little boy in the film was shy when facing the girl, teased the girl, and finally let go to find his sister together. These processes show the maturity of a little boy. When I saw it, I felt: Isn't this me?",9,0,0,29 March 2020
Life of Pi," Worth thinking
","The ultimate point of the story is that human directors in a cruel environment are extremely bright and beautiful. The ridiculous pictures may want to tell us that under the beautiful appearance, this cruel truth is often hidden. It is also possible that the director wants to tell us that even in the face of an extremely cruel environment, the goodness in our hearts will support us to overcome cruelty.

We are often not the genius of one ten millionth, and we explore on the road of life. In addition to courage and intelligence, perhaps more importantly, persistence and loyalty.

LÃ©on: The Professional," Gentle killer
","The film is full of artistic atmosphere, and even the scene of the killing is as unique and beautiful as the artwork. The director expressed more criticism of some ugly things in life in reality. In addition, it also talks about the friendship between strangers and the spirit of devotion to love.There is real danger and drama throughout the film, yet it never becomes merely an action film - the characters are too significant for that. I love to appreciate the movie that people have thought great and classic. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is the themeof this film. The director Luc Besson, as always, both makes the film look beautiful and builds plenty of atmospheres into it. He is clever at directing the figures and the psychology. Nobody can make more success than him, that's why I appreciate him.
This is a wonderful film. The story, which at first glance is unrealistic and silly, actually becomes gripping and emotional in the hands of the skilled Jean Reno and that little girl. The characters are sympathetic and cute, and one is touched by the depthof the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. The character of their enemy, Norman Stansfield, is scary and insane.
The story tells us that Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl. She has a misery life. Her father is involved in handling drugs for a crooked cop called Norman Stansfield One day, Mathilda encounters Leon (acted by Jean Reno), professional hitman, the little girl is out shopping for Leon when Stansfield kills the rest of her family, and fortunately she takes shelter in Leon's house, .It is that Matilda went straight to Leon's when she saw her family was killed.It is thatLeon saw in the keyhole that Matilda",9,0,0,20 March 2020

Life Is Beautiful," hope and love
","Life is beautiful use black humor to describe the joys and sorrows of Guido's family in the Nazi concentration camp, showing Guido's vision of a beautiful life.
'Life is beautiful' is characteristically optimistic in a brutal environment. Unlike any other world war II movie, the film is a dark comedy that takes on the history of world war II in a new and unconventional way. Roberto bernini gave all those wounded in world war ii an injection of painkillers from his own perspective.
'Life is beautiful' is not a tragedy, and Guido's hilarious appearance at the beginning shows that director Roberto wants to create a comic atmosphere, but definitely not to undermine the film's ideological content for the sake of kitsch. In fact, on the contrary, benini did this in order not to fawn on the vulgar, in order to express the deeper thought, not to let the audience indulge in the shallow touch.
Benini just wanted to tell all the people who really love life through this film, the nightmare is temporary, believe that the beautiful life is forever. Even in the camp, Guido kept a smile on his face.",9,0,0,19 March 2020
