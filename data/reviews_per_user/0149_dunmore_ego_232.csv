"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Running Gag.
","I have a newfound respect for that unfunny dork, David Schwimmer, after RUN FATBOY RUN.Schwimmer directs Simon Pegg as Dennis, a man who ran from his pregnant bride at the altar five years ago and now decides to win her back by beating her current boyfriend at his own game - marathon running.The plot only seems ludicrous until the performances take hold. Once Pegg (as the titular 'fatboy') and Dylan Moran (as his friend, Gordon) find their comedy stride, so to speak, there are no stops for any pisses by the roadside in this quirky buddy flick disguised as a romantic comedy, where one buddy betrays the other while getting naked at every opportunity.Thandie Newton is the jilted ex and Hank Azaria (gloriously body-shaved) is the current rich, athletic - yet shallow - boyfriend. (Azaria's roles sweep the gamut - from his Guatemalan housekeeper in THE BIRDCAGE to his French scuba instructor in ALONG CAME POLLY - and amazes here by showing he can actually play straight.) Written by a solid American comedian, Michael Ian Black, and tightened up by Simon Pegg himself, RUN FATBOY RUN is very much a 'British' movie (set in Britain, peopled by Brits) with very little dumb American slapstick; only rarely do we feel Schwimmer's stupid FRIENDS fingerprints sullying the production.In the Training Montage (which involves tiny short shorts and spatulas), the filmmakers tip their hat to Trey Parker and Matt Stone by having a TEAM America poster in the background (a movie in which The Montage is satirized wickedly by the SOUTH PARK team).Though the movie foists its poignant messages and silly character arcs on us (Dennis has never committed to or finished anything in his life; with the marathon he has the chance to change his destiny!), it actually ends on a note of possibility rather than blah marriage blah Hollywood. Like I said, 'British' sensibility, regarding the audience as marginally intelligent, rather than popcorn automatons.Why do women regard a man running from the altar as cowardly and impotent, but a woman running from her responsibilities as a bride 'adorable'? Answer me that and stay big-mouthed, Julia Roberts.The irony is: the best aspect of Dennis's shiftless character might actually be the one thing they all vilify him for - running from that altar!--Review by Poffy the Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,0,1,15 February 2009
The Avengers," Hero-Palooza
","Shakespearean lightning and thunder arrows, red white and blue shields and golden armor, emerald rage and badass Morpheus long-coat, and Scarlett Johansson's leather Pearbottom. Oh AVENGERS, how sweet thou fury! The god Loki (Tom Hiddleston, Brit-leering and still looking like Data from STAR TREK GENERATIONS) has come to Earth from Asgard to conquer and destroy. And Earth's mightiest heroes are there to punch him a lot.Seems kinda ineffectual and unimaginative that against literal magical/divine foes, the best retaliation that can be mustered by the writers of this mega-superhero tale (Zak Penn and Joss Whedon) is that the heroes 'punch' demons flying around on bad motor scooters. (Even the grand resolution, though a jaw-dropping sequence, is nothing more than the old 'destroy-the-source-to-destroy-the-minions' gambit.) And what does Loki want with Earth anyway? As we saw in THOR (2011), Asgard was a pretty bodacious LSD-colorized dazzlegarden. Is he here for the fabulous Grilled Prime CÃ´te de Boeuf at Spago? Is Loki after our Arab oil? Our blood diamonds? Our white women? Taking his cues from Dick Cheney, his plan seems to be conquest for the sake of conquest, no exit strategy, no goal. And he's using a cutting-edge science concept to do it: the tesseract (or hypercube theory), a wormhole joining two distant points in space-time. Loki allies with a croaky guy named The Other (whose helmet looks like it was fashioned from dog turds) and they order their demon-riders to spurt through the wormhole to Earth and break things. Some plan! Dim plot aside, THE AVENGERS is overseen by Marvel (the studio that can do little wrong when pumping out A-List superhero blockbusters) and fashioned by writer-director Joss Whedon (the man from FIREFLY, who can also do little wrong with his iconoclastic approach). Highly enjoyable movie experience ensues.Not only are there big stupid CGI things and Pretty Orange Explosions aplenty, there is heart and poignancy and humor, uncertain alliances between heroes, petty arguments, snappy dialog, human frailty and godlike wrath. And Scarlet Johansson's leather Pearbottom.Whedon does it again - imbues this ostensibly kickapoo punch-em-up movie with real personality. Even if you did not meet the individual heroes in their own films over the past few years, they are each presented as a throbbing personality crisis, no emotion spared. Except maybe for Captain America (Chris Evans), whose wooden delivery makes us suspect he landed this job on the cerulean dreaminess of his eyes. You see, he's frozen his facial muscles in place, for fear that if he moves them one iota, he'll stop looking super-pretty. And Jesus! - look at the size of his biceps! And then we see Chris Hemsworth's biceps - and they're even bigger! Hemsworth once again brings the hammer as thunder god Thor on mad steroids; half-brother to Loki, and therefore forced to speak in a British accent (for an Aussie, that's an eternal annoyance).Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark/Iron Man, now plonking his ginger assistant Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow cameo), and bequeathed the best dialog; so cheeky, arrogant and sarcastic that Brad Pitt called from OCEAN'S ELEVEN and wanted his insouciance back. His armor is the damned coolest thing about this movie, and when he is flying up into the wormhole firing his hand-blasters at demons, his power is awe-inspiring. Now if only he had an iron Pearbottom...Bruce Banner/Hulk is dork-cool Mark Ruffalo. Love that guy; perfectly cast as the most unruffled guy in the room (unruffaloed?), even though harboring the most internal rage. In this third major movie featuring the Hulk (after HULK and THE INCREDIBLE HULK), he can apparently change green at will. 'That's my secret - I'm always angry!' (Hey, I must be a Hulk!) Banner and Stark exchange much tech jargon that means absolutely nothing, but their quiet moments are powerful. Matter of fact, all the heroes have their portion of quiet time, which director Whedon effortlessly makes compelling, and their dissent is the most interesting element of the movie. Marvel Comics were always canny at setting up Marvel Team-Ups where the moral ambiguity of the situation set heroes at odds with one another - and Whedon somehow captured that lightning.Down the list, we have archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who can apparently claim superhero status because he has good aim and his arrows explode. I guess Rambo can fill out that application form then. Hawkeye and thigh-jitsu expert Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have been re-rendered by this movie franchise as two CIA assassins with a spanky sexual tension. One would think these two mere humans would get lost amidst the super soldiers, iron men and gods, but again, Whedon gives us even their little patticake moments and doesn't lose our interest. And did I mention Scarlett Johansson's leather Pearbottom?Samuel L. Jackson's role as Nick Fury, director of SHIELD (some kind of unnecessary homeland security contrivance), has been elevated from that of annoying eye-patch cameo during the stinger of Marvel movies, to annoying eye-patch starring role; wearing his custom leather, flying around in his invisible aircraft carrier, and constantly whining that Earth can't handle these threats so we have to assemble a team that can. May I suggest Angie's List? Clark Gregg appears for the umpteenth time as SHIELD Agent Coulson, now with a first name, Phil, and a predilection for Captain America trading cards (like the rest of us he-men, going bi for Cap's biceps).Cobie Smulders is here as eye candy. I guess one leather Pearbottom just wasn't enough.In the final telling, THE AVENGERS will thrill with its stunning action, thoughtful characterization, and the simple fact that Marvel managed to cram all these colorful icons onto one bombastic piece of celluloid. And did I mention Scarlett Johansson's leather Pearbottom?...--Poffy The Cucumber",8,9,20,2 January 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," I'm going to take a Treasure Bath!
","For all its contrived clue-solving and annoying coincidences and tiresome car chases, and even Nicolas Cage's mourning face, NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS is a lot of fun.Maybe producer Jerry Bruckheimer had something to do with the fact we can hardly take a breath before the next relentless action sequence derived from chalky historical jargon disguised as clues to something only the inventor of Sudoku can understand.Sequel to the less-fun NATIONAL TREASURE, this film finds Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) mourning-face-deep in another treasure hunt for a Mayan City of Gold. Pointless outlining the roundabout manner in which the Mayan City becomes his goal, suffice to say the clues involve McGuffin piled on McGuffin piled on Abe Lincoln's assassination with Ed Harrison top like a cherry.Harris is villain Wilkinson, who also seeks the City for his own reasons. It is a thankless role, for he imbues the obvious 'villain' with many layers. His motivations are not evil, though his actions are, and there is always doubt on how far he is willing to go for his 'noble' cause. It is a subtly shaded character that all villainous actors can learn from.All the principal cast return, Jon Voight as Ben's dad, Justin Bartha as Riley (given a little more to do this time round than just whine), Diane Kruger as Ben's girl and Helen Mirren (three times older than Diane Kruger and twice as sexy) as Voight's estranged wife, for feisty comedic arguing. Even Harvey Keitel returns, to mill aimlessly on a professional basis.Written by The Wibberlys (which sound like a couple of furry things from another planet) and once again directed by Jon Turteltaub, BOOK OF SECRETS takes our intrepid adventurers to Paris (where - so it says in the Foreign Director's Handbook - the Eiffel Tower must be in every shot), to London, to the White House and into the Oval Office itself, to the revelation that 'Mount Rushmore is a cover-up...' Nic Cage gets his Gom Jabbar moment when he puts his hand blindly into a rock orifice; the cast gets to tramp around blindly in labyrinthine passageways, but the coolest sequence by far is a Mayan death trap - a gigantic, tottering square slab that they must all balance, using each other's weight as counterbalances.The Book of Secrets is supposedly a Presidential tome - a captain's log, if you will - of all the nation's secrets tabulated by presidents for presidents, covering Area 51, the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing, etc. Movie plays it like a gag (with Bruce Greenwood as Pres) but we all know there are secrets that only one president may pass onto the next, maybe not in an all-encompassing book, but surely in documentation which, if exposed, would lead to impeachment, jail or worse.When Candy Crowley of CNN asked newly-inaugurated President Obama in 2009 whether he had seen anything in his new job that had 'given him pause,' he simply shot that gleaming smile at her and refused to comment. Why? Because he saw the real world analog of that Book of Secrets.Yet the biggest mystery remains: What exactly is Harvey Keitel doing in this movie? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,2,3,21 September 2009
Angels & Demons," Dopey Popey.
","Another fine mess the Catholic Church has gotten us into! Tom Hanks returns in ANGELS & DEMONS as Robert Langdon, atheist symbologist from THE DA VINCI CODE (2006), a little trimmer, a little wiser, a little more action man and a little less Vitruvian Man.The Pope has just died and the archbishops next in line to be God's Bottom Bitch have been kidnapped by the Illuminati, who threaten Rome with implosion by anti-matter if they don't stop being irrational religious fanatics - 'science obliterating religion.' Well, Rome can't stop being irrational religious fanatics, so the Vatican shamelessly calls on Robert Langdon again despite that business with The Da Vinci Code where it covered up the truth about Jesus's ancestors after he unearthed it. Undermining his authority wasn't enough, now the Vatican wants him to save its unholy ass, enlisting his aid to decipher the location of the anti-matter bomb, for which the Illuminati have left clues that only a cunning atheist symbologist could follow and there's none of them around-- oh, dash it all! What are the odds?!! Through his staggering knowledge of religious symbology, arcane scripture, medieval history and a fair share of gobbledegook that writer Dan Brown has made up off the top of his head, Langdon crisscrosses Rome following the trail of murdered archbishops, before locating the bomb and letting Obiwan Kenobi dispose of it.And just like it did when Langdon uncovered the Da Vinci Code, the Church then issues another press release undermining Langdon's participation (and bribing him with a precious Galileo text to keep his mouth shut), lying that it was The Victim in an unwarranted attack by extremists - not one of the news reports mentioning The Illuminati, or the fact that the Illuminati's vendetta with the Catholic Church is blowback for the Church unrepentantly torturing and killing Illuminati in medieval times. Langdon outlines quite clearly how the Church resisted the Illuminati 'illuminating' the Church's superstitions with rationality.And then Christians have the temerity to question how 'God' can allow bad things to happen. Keep in mind these people use a CRUCIFIXION as their symbol of peace and love.Armin Mueller-Stahl is an archbishop with designs on popehood; Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd is head of Vatican security, with such a big puss on his face he might as well have 'Red Herring' tattooed on his forehead; Pierfrancesco Favino is a cool Euro detective who just screams Nice Guy; composer Hans Zimmer evokes the right level of religious scariness with his dark, cloudy, ominous score; provides the right level and Ayelet Zurer is the hot chick scientist responsible for creating the anti-matter (or should that be 'un-creating' it?), a plot point which brings in 'science' only as a whipping boy.Ewan McGregor is the Pope's consiglieri, a post called the 'camerlengo' (which comes down to us from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, meaning 'murderous religious zealot' or 'Jedi'). He gives an impassioned speech demeaning 'their new god, Science,' like it is an alternative religion trying to replace Christianity's myth-based religion with its own myths.MacGregor's priest is meant to be a misguided ignorant character - trouble is, in their own ignorance, Christians in the audience AGREE WITH HIM.Science is not a religion, science is not a deity, SCIENCE is a METHODOLOGY based on EVIDENCE; it is an EVER-MORPHING PROCESS, constantly replacing outmoded theories or facts with newer ones based on EXPERIMENT and RESEARCH.I'm not sure Dan Brown and the people who made this film and the people who watch this film are discerning exactly WHO the villain is here...Langdon clearly explains: 'The Church forced the scientists out because they were trying to bring intelligence to the Church... 1668, the Church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists and branded each of them on the chest with the symbol of the cross, to purge them of their sins, and executed them; threw their bodies out onto the street as a warning to stop questioning the Church on scientific matters. They radicalized them; the purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati bent on retribution.' Not only does the Church definitively prove it is against the methodology of science - which Christians erroneously embrace - it terrorizes those who bring that intelligent methodology to it. The Church is not just the villain in this movie, but the villain to civilization itself.'Be careful - these are men of god.' --Assassin, to Langdon.Langdon dodges the question of belief in God - because he's Tom Hanks, America's sweetheart. When Obiwan asks Langdon point blank, 'Do you believe in the Dark Side of The Force (i.e. God),' Langdon suddenly gets unnecessarily eloquent, 'My mind tells me I will never understand God... and my heart tells me that I'm not meant to. Faith is a gift that I have yet to receive.' A simple no would do, Forrest.I appreciate the fact that Robert Langdon is smart, but someone call 1-800-EMOTION and get this guy a charisma transplant. Or at least buy him a few vodkas. Hanks gets this close to toppling Nicolas Cage for the Mourning Face of the Year Award. Usually I welcome powerful minds (as in V FOR VENDETTA), but Dan Brown's writing under Ron Howard's direction has a knack for annoying even the scrappiest Crossword fanatic. Things lead to other things that have so little to do with the former things that we just throw up our hands on the convoluted plot and simply hope the hot chick will get her knockers out. As much chance of that as an angel dancing on the head of a lightsaber.",6,0,0,20 July 2010
Changeling," A Mother's Son, Undone.
","CHANGELING is based on a true story, but I think it's fiction. I mean, come on - Angelina Jolie with only ONE child? Clint Eastwood directs Jolie as Christine Collins, a working, single mother in 1928 Los Angeles, who comes home one day to find her son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith) missing.As unbelievable as it sounds, the police (headed by Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore) deliver an impostor child to Christine six months later in a public political display, insisting it is Walter - against all the protests of Christine. They tell her that because she is the missing child's mother, she is therefore 'in no position to be objective'! Christine takes this lying down. Now we're getting closer to Angelina...The police department, reeling under accusations of corruption and incompetence - from activist, Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) - prove the accusations correct, by desperately shoving Christine's case down the public's throat as a feather in their cap. They even send Christine a Consultant for Juvenile Services to spin their lie right in her face like a cheapshot Republican. The consultant says he will 'put it all to rights,' yet as soon as he looks at the boy, 'He's got your eyes... and a little of your nose as well.' To refute Christine's claims that the impostor is circumcised and Walter was not, 'he must have been traumatized and submerged the memory of the circumcision'; as to why the impostor is three inches shorter than Walter, 'his spine shrunk during his trauma...' It's a little hard to accept that even the 10-year-old impostor (Devon Conti) could be in on the conspiracy. When this mother is pouring her heart out to him, beseeching him for the truth, how is he so well-versed in the Clint Eastwood Method of saying nothing? At such a young age, is he already indoctrinated with the spirit of the times that would regard women as inferior enough not to answer her? He also seems to take a leery pleasure in seeing Christine squirm. And how does he fool Walter's friends, their neighbors, the school teachers? These questions are touched on minimally, but ultimately cannot be explained by the movie format, so leave us unbalanced - in this age of ultra-media that could disprove lies instantaneously.Screenplayed by J. Michael Straczynski, CHANGELING is a strange blend of flopsy first act and then terrifying second act, involving a child-killer. About the time the police department are wrongfully dragging Christine into a mental institution for insisting the impostor is not her child, Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) is stumbling on a ranch in the Los Angeles desert, where he arrests a stray boy (Eddie Alderson) who tells him a bizarre tale...Two stories run congruently as Christine is traumatized and mistreated in the sanitarium, while Ybarra hears the stray boy's testimony to being an accomplice to kidnapping and murdering numerous young boys with his uncle, a man named Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner, who looks like a skinny Hugh Jackman).The two stories intersect when Walter Collins's name comes up in the boy's story. We never discover whether Walter was one of the murdered boys or one of a few who managed to escape.Writer Straczynski was inspired (is that the right word?) by the True Crime events of the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Yet there was another True Crime enacted in this case - that of the police department.If we find it hard to believe how a whole department can lie so brazenly, we only have to look to modern politicians - Hillary claiming she 'landed under fire' in Bosnia, McCain claiming 'the race is tied with Obama' - the only reason those 1920's liars got away with their outlandish mendacity was that there was no DNA testing, no domestic photography... and no YouTube.Once again, Eastwood's film making is impeccable. We never question we are in 1928, with the surroundings, social mores and misogyny of the time; when women were treated like lower-class citizens, or at least like the hysterical, emotionally-unbalanced gender that Freud and others postulated they were.Women were so subjugated and downtrodden that when Christine tearfully demands that the police captain keep looking for her son after she is given the impostor, she then apologizes to him for doing so. He maintains coolly, 'Why should we keep looking for someone we've already found?' Christine once told Water, 'Never start a fight. Always finish it.' Of course, that credo is the body and soul of Clint Eastwood. He said it flat out in WHITE HUNTER, BLACK HEART and each of his Avengers lives it to the bone. Christine (with help from her ally, Reverend Briegleb) would devote her life to exposing the police who handed her a changeling, finishing a fight they should never have started.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,2,4,13 May 2009
Frost_Nixon," ...and the Truth shall set you bleed...
","Peace/War. Life/Death. Truth/Lies. Frost/Nixon.Based on Peter Morgan's stage play of the same name, from the stunning real life interviews that ex-president Richard M. Nixon granted British television host, David Frost in 1977, Ron Howard's compelling FROST/NIXON does what Oliver Stone's milky W. never could - it gets the job done.What job is that? Putting Richard Milhous Satan's Vagina Nixon in his place, in that exclusive niche in history reserved for the lowest of felonious, unrepentant bottom-dwellers who were never tried and fried like the criminals they were. After the courts never did their job in convicting Nixon, after President Ford pardoned the son of a whore (with the public disapproving 2 to 1), after America thought he had slimed out of their grasp, it took a Brit TV talk show host to corner Nixon into a roundabout admission of guilt in the Watergate scandal.FROST/NIXON opens in 1974 with Watergate all over the news. Author James Reston (exasperated Sam Rockwell) echoes American sentiment regarding Nixon's 1974 resignation, 'Instead of satisfaction, I got angrier! There was never any admission of guilt!' Brought onboard the Frost team for his passion, this underlying theme fanned Reston's engines and gave the Frost interview team a goal.Michael Sheen plays David Frost as a playboy television host by way of Austin Powers ('Yeh, baby!'); Frank Langella plays the marble-gargling Nixon by way of Satan's Vagina, though not without a touch of pity - which we should never succumb to after considering Nixon's laundry list of premeditated crimes. Both men reprise their roles from the stage production.By this movie's account, Frost wanted to interview Nixon purely as a marketing ploy, seeing the sky high ratings Nixon's farewell address garnered and wanting to capitalize on that viewership. It sounded good enough on paper to accrue his ambitious, dedicated team, but Frost's profile at the time was that of a low-rent television host whose shows were flagging, so advertisers and sponsors were almost impossible to entice.Nixon's agent (a smarmy Toby Jones) demands an unprecedented $600,000 for the interview, which Frost accedes to, paying Nixon the $200K deposit from his own money. By the time of the actual Nixon interviews, Frost was still in the financial hole. And from the initial interview rounds of Nixon besting Frost, everyone believed they would die a gurgling death there.At the time, Nixon was seeking a sympathetic forum (or at least an affable one) where he could re-render Watergate in a favorable light. Ironically, Nixon's agent accepted the Frost interview because everyone thought Frost would be a pushover ('easier than CBS, a big wet kiss, pitching puff balls').On March 23, 1977, the first Frost-Nixon interview was taped. Frost thought he nailed Nixon with the very first question, 'Why didn't you burn the tapes?' Unfortunately, it was Frost who got burned as Nixon gave rambling, 20-minute answers and 'controlled the space.' So it went for three out of the four tapings, Nixon never letting Frost edge in, while Frost's team cringed in their green room and Nixon's team (including a stolid Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan, Chief of Staff) quietly sniggered in demonic contempt from theirs.The interviews were conducted over the course of a month, the last taping on April 22, 1977.For dramatic effect, movie portrays the final interview as the most damning for Nixon, as Frost wears him down with copious notes and repeated phrases 'cover-up' and 'obstruction of justice'; pushing Nixon to admit the Watergate actions were not 'mistakes' but 'crimes.' From righteously spewing 'There was no cover-up, it was political containment,' Nixon eventually relents begrudgingly, 'I let down my friends. I let down the country. I let down our system of government and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but think that it's all too corrupt,' and 'I gave them a sword and they stuck it in with relish.' The killing stroke came for Frost when he badgered: 'Are you really saying that in certain situations the president can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?' and elicited from Nixon, 'I'm saying that when the president does it, that means it's NOT illegal!' And the world stopped spinning...What is the purpose of reviving Tricky Dick in our minds only to re-bury him? Why re-destroy the man who devalued the American presidency and simultaneously alerted America to the checks and balances that needed to be imposed on the 'imperial presidency'? Because it arrives at an apt point in history when the only other politician deserving of Nixon's exclusive criminal niche is doing exactly the same thing; you know him as The Oil Idiot of Texas, that moron cowboy coward with the skunk-weasel demeanor and non-functioning neocortex - George W. Bush.With his December 2008 'exit interviews' to gutlessly compliant news-folk, Bush desperately seeks to salvage his diarrhetic legacy - almost identical to Satan's Vagina: devaluing the American presidency, mismanaging wars, criminally forging an imperial presidency - only wasting America's time. Those who know the truth are not listening.Nixon's approval rating was in the low 20s when he resigned in disgrace in 1974. Bush's approval ratings at the end of his illegally-won two terms - exactly the same.David Frost has interviewed seven American presidents, including George W. Bush. When interviewing Bush as 'president,' Frost would have only been allowed puff balls. But Bush is no longer president...It's been a long time since Frost commanded ratings like those for the Frost/Nixon interviews. He made his money back a thousandfold and gained a rep as a wrecking ball interviewer. To out-rocket those ratings, may we suggest, Sir David Frost, inking a deal for Frost/Bush?Oh, what wonders of felonious, unrepentant bottom-dwelling truth could Frost dredge from THAT hellish vagina...",8,2,5,26 December 2008
Walk the Line," Blues for The Man In Black
","I was introduced to Johnny Cash by my older cousin, via 'A Boy Named Sue' and Cash's take on being led to the gallows, '25 Minutes To Go'. This was before I discovered a boy named Alice (Cooper) and Led Zeppelin's 'Gallows Pole', subsequently leading to deserting the previous generation's outlaws (like Cash and The Beatles) and going all long-haired, ripped-jeaned and anti-socialite. (To scallywags under 30: yes, respected and seemingly harmless icons were once regarded as threatening and subversive.)'Walk The Line', though lauded as a Johnny Cash biography Â is not. As a movie, formulaic; as a biography, a sordid 'Behind The Music' episode at best. Focusing on only a short period of Cash's life (from boyhood until 1968), and then only on Cash's infatuation with vocalist June Carter, 'Walk The Line' paints the prolific and determined young man as a neurotic stalker Â of a woman who is seemingly as mixed up as he is (if June's two failed marriages and intermittent dalliances with Cash are any indication). Who would've guessed this Grand Olde Pioneer's goals and destructive actions all revolved around The Getting Of Panty from June Carter? Noticeably missing was the scene where he holds up a boombox playing 'In Your Eyes' outside June's bedroom window.Joaquin Phoenix is J.R. Cash (as Johnny liked to be called) and, though not a physical chameleon akin to the Day-Lewises or Oldmans, is a chameleon in *essence*, metamorphosing into every character he bequeaths his movie-going audience. An acting marvel, who should have been accruing awards since being 'terribly vexed' by Russell Crowe, this role, whilst not his best, is at least on par with the Academy's provincial (and hypocritical) leanings towards 'serious' thespianism. In singing all Cash's songs himself on the soundtrack, though he lacks the trademark weather-worn baritone, Phoenix nonetheless causes us to double-take on a few magic moments, superimposing the soul of Cash over his onstage persona. His vocal sync is near perfect (nailing that Cash sideways-mouthing), and with most of the songs adhering to simple I-IV-V progressions, the git-tar wrangling should not have caused many brain tumors with the actors-playing-musicians (though Phoenix likes holding that C chord a lotÂ).'Folsom Prison Blues' is played upon considerably, especially that infamous line, 'I shot a man in Reno / Just to watch him die.' Powerful words indeed, for a 23-year-old kid from Arkansas in 1955, cultivating the outlaw image which would render the eventual Man In BlackÂ I once kicked a man in the Chattahoochee, but I don't think that counts. Jutting-jawed Reese Witherspoon, suitably perky and delicious enough to moon over, is June Carter, Cash's regular touring buddy and *raison d'Ãªtre*, who pulls him from the depths of drug addiction and marries him after a final onstage plea from Cash - in a climax that debases everything Cash created. In making this love affair the movie's engine, it implies Cash would have been relegated to 'Would you like fries with that?' without June, but he was already a success on his own terms before she was his 'inspiration'. We see that, after all the 'biographical' misdirection, this is nothing more than a chick movie clothed in black and blues. Thankfully, the film neglects to show us that June turned Cash to Christianity Â being born once is enough to make some people annoying, but being born *twice* makes them unquestionably intolerable. Robert Patrick is Cash's unsympathetic father, Ray, who unrelentingly badgers Cash even into adulthood Â for the first time in cinema history, a lifelike rendition of parenthood! In their eyes, you never do Grow Up. Ray's hurtful digs play a large part in Cash's drive and despondency in this movie, yet a passive (and unrealistic) reconciliation at movie's end demeans this subtext, with Ray begrudgingly giving Cash his due, 'You're the one with all the stories.' Almost a backhanded compliment, the only reason this silly smoothing of hostilities was placed at movie's end was to wrap it neatly Â like a movie Â once again departing from any semblance of 'biographical' intent. Cash's use of amphetamines propped him up during grueling tour schedules, yet we never hear exactly how scheduled he is. At times, Cash's real life itinerary grew to 200 cities in as many days Â quite an astonishing tidbit - yet the movie is content to have him away from home just long enough to rouse the ire of his Bitching Movie Wife.There's an easier way to watch a man die than shooting him in Reno Â marry him off to a small town girl. If there is one inherent message Â one thread in all these musician biographies - it is that the first girl you marry is going to be the Whining Byatch of the bunch.The death of Jack Cash, Johnny's older brother, was so telegraphed, you could see his table-saw mishap coming while watching the movie 'Ray'. Speaking of Taylor Hackford's and Jamie Foxx's 'Ray', comparisons are inevitable Â seeing as 'Walk The Line' is the same story rewritten with a white guy. Already the trend solidifies in delivering pop star biopics: as long as there are enough drugs and groupies and deaths in the family, it will assure an economically viable film Â all things being equal, 'Ray' is a more fully-developed character study, thin as it is. 'Walk The Line' is anorexic. Fans will love the full versions of Cash songs (performed by Phoenix), but are gonna Cry, Cry, Cry at how the film's creators did *not* Walk The Line with the finer details and, like the Boy Named Sue, may want to search the honky-tonks and bars for the men responsible and give them 25 Minutes To GoÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",6,2,6,6 December 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," For Make Laugh on Jew and Retard
","This movie is retard. Either or audience is retard for not stop laughing.Never has been a movie exposing more people so red of neck or so mong of loid. We may see these stereo of type in your America Undercover, your 60 Minutes or your The Jerry Springer Show, but here compendium of bigots, ass-faces and rapists not only from working class, but bourgeoisie alike.Storyline of Borat is - how you say? - incidental - and more like excuse for get movie funding than actual script; could have been written on back of napkin, like plans to glorious Kazakhstan City Square. Borat's quest: to woo the Pamela Anderson from the Baywatch and have sexy times in her 'red water panties' then take back to Kazakhstan as wife. Crossing America in ice cream van with producer and suspicious friend, Azamat (Ken Davitian) is thread that join disparate - how you say? - vignettes.Sacha Baron Cohen (who play Borat Sagdiyev), like Ashlee Simpson, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush, has lack of 'shame' gene, but unlike other moronis, his put genetic deficiency to good use in Borat, as eponymous Kazakhstan TV reporter, who, through him apparent ingenuousness and ignorance of America way of life, tease out the black side of Americans they keep to hidden even from themselves.From Texas rodeo to high class dining, from driving instructor to 'humor expert,' Borat somehow finds way to expose deepest prejudices, darkest social phobias and his own hairy anus.An expert on obfuscating people's rhythm (big word for me - rhythm), Cohen pushes boundaries as well as he pushes buttons: as soon as upper class lady mention that 'it won't take too much to learn Borat to American way of life,' he turn up at dinner table with bag of pooh, asking what to do; at television station, WAPT 16 News, Borat (being television performer Cohen himself) know exactly how to throw the small-town television newscaster, standing up out of frame and continuing speak to newscaster, then butting into weatherman's forecast on air; a 'Humor Expert' decrees Borat's story of incest between his retard brother and prostitute sister taunting him with her 'vagine' would not be considered funny in the America - yet here it is - being funny in the America.Leading the witnesses into unintentional foot-in-mouth on racism, jingoism, sexism and homophobe, Borat's biggest target are the Jews, the gag being that Sacha Baron Cohen is, of course, a Jew. In gun store, Borat ask owner, 'What is best gun to kill Jew?' And owner, whether not understand question or simply too red of neck to care, answer sincerely.When Borat meet frat boys in trailer, one Nazi-shorn whiteboy stood out as biggest loud-mouth, jingoistic, sexist troglodyte. He so brash and fearless about his neanderthalism that envision only one career path for him after college - United States Marine.Direct by Larry Charles (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm), laughs come thick and fast and dirty (morbidly obese Azamat pushing naked balls onto face of Borat in position of 69, head is hurting from laugh of insane), but there is horrifying subtext that Cohen has exposed with Borat and could have not come at a more serendipitous time - on heels of this movie that show real racism as comedic, in grandest irony, a real racist show he is anything but comedic. One word: Kramer. Michael Richards, of most famous your Seinfeld, while on stage at comedy club, call heckler bad word for black man.Despite media having the thrive on euphemisms as 'n-word,' 'f-you,' and 'a-hole' (as if replacing words actually negate racism and swearing), Borat's success may be due, oddly enough, to American Kramer Gene: racism is alive and well in good ole Yew Ess Ov Ay - for by promulgating the euphemisms, the bile is retained through another generation. And you all become what Borat rightfully disparage: retards.Borat implore in movie trailer, 'Please! You come see my film. If it not success, I will be execute.' Too many Jews and racist and retard in audience - so Borat in no danger of being execute.I go now. Je quiy.",8,3,8,30 December 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk movie - Smash!
","Don't make himÂ hungry! You wouldn't like him when he's hungryÂ Bill Bixby's infamous caveat, once again comically bastardized; in Ang Lee's HULK (2003), Eric Bana delivered it in Spanish at movie's end; now in 2008, Edward Norton delivering pidgin Portuguese - badly.Neither a sequel nor an origin tale, THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an adrenalized shot to the sternum Â if it doesn't knock you black and blue, it will at least slap you and call you Susan.The intro sequence reveals the origin back-story, allowing movie to hit the ground running, with skinny Edward Norton as Bruce Banner hiding out in an old-world Brazilian village, text on screen, 'Days without incident: 158.' Our first impulse is 'Wha-?' This is Edward Norton after all, of renowned Thespian fame; maybe a tad overqualified to deliver lines like, 'Hulk smash!'? Then Â it hits: it's EDWARD NORTON, no stranger to Dual Personality Â from his breakout schizoid role opposite Richard Gere in PRIMAL FEAR (1996), Norton delivers 'second personality' like second nature.In Brazil, Banner works in a bottling factory, performing body control exercises with a meditation guru who thrills in bitchslapping him incessantly; monitors his heart rate via a wrist readout and, unlike the rest of theworld, tries NOT to 'go green,' awaiting an antidote to his Hulk genes from an online mystery man in America named Mr. Blue, before he dares return home. (Banner's code name... Mr. Green. We didn't see THAT coming.) And running gags about stretchy pants aboundÂBut General Ross (William Hurt) wants Banner's genes to utilize as military weaponry, so single-minded that he would risk his own daughter's life to attain that power. Typical pathological military jug head Â nothing we haven't seen in the real world. There's crazy. Then there's Army Crazy. Ross enlists the aid of hard army grunt, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), injected with a super-soldier serum (wink to Captain America fanboys) to take on the Hulk mano-a-mano and capture him for lab experiments which probably include examining the magical material in his pants.The Hulk's first appearance is well-staged, in glimpses and silhouettes. When we see Hulk in full battle daylight, it is astounding! Not just due to the effects team (Gentle Giant Studios, among many) melding him with 'reality,' but because of the innovative motion-capture technology of Giant Studios. When the Hulk and the soon-to-be-birthed Abomination move, they are smoothly human; walking upright casually, interacting with debris, machinery, people, water rivulets cascading off flexing musclesÂ and though his name reflects the 1962 Marvel Comics creation, no more is Hulk a bulky blob, but a svelte man-machine with a sexy v-shape. I especially like the way these creatures run full tilt, with the desperate lean and violent arm-swing of slim sprinters.There are innumerable canonical nods and winks: Stan Lee as an unwary office guy who drinks a soda tainted with Hulk blood; Bill Bixby in a TV snippet from COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER; the *Lonely Man* theme from THE HULK TV series, where Bixby walks the lonely highway in snazzy bell-bottoms that will be shredded by the next episode; a cameo by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) to synergize the Avenger Initiative; and Â not least, Lou Ferrigno! When Banner gets back to the U.S. he looks up his old girl, the daughter of General Ross, Betty (Liv Tyler), who, like every woman whose love-of-her-life is on the lam, is time-serving with another guy. Of course, the part-time boyfriend is a complete dork who looks like Casey Kasem in a vest. (It's never a David Lee Roth circa 1980 Van Halen.) When Betty accidentally encounters tragic Bruce, she's all over him like a thousand-dollar hooker. If only all women were so devotional as to curl around you so urgently and intimately after years of separation. That's why they call these things 'fantasy.' Betty and Bruce seek out Mr. Blue (Tim Blake Nelson), who has been hoarding Hulk blood samples like geekboys hoarding back issues. Mr. Blue doesn't really help Bruce, but he helps the plot, when Emil Blonsky, insatiable for monstrous power, forces Blue to inject him with Hulk blood; apparently, mixing super-soldier serum and Hulk blood creates a big vomit-colored, bone-splintering monstrosity called The AbominationÂ which precipitates the TRANSFORMER moment: that point in any film where you realize everything on screen is computer-generated and that this eye-candy battle between two big things might as well be a video game Â and you're sitting here watching it even though you're over 30.Still, the action surprisingly contains heart. Hulk becomes Hero. No matter the many incarnations that portray Hulk as brainless or fogged with gamma-amnesia, this Hulk retains a sizeable chunk of Banner-brain, and his fierce compassion bleeds right offa the emerald giant's computer blips. We sense that Hulk's most compelling battle is not with big things that go boom, but with himself. And as good as Hulk's battles are, I don't think many of us over 30 would complain had we been given more of the great Ed Norton doing introspective and sullen.End frames set up the Avenger Initiative with Stark Â it is no secret Marvel are cross-pollinating their cameos; hope springs eternal that IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK presage a spate of quality Marvel offerings, and that the slated 2011 release of FIRST AVENGER: CAPTAIN America won't be as super-mundane as the 1979 TV series, with Reb Brown gadding about in a foamy muscle suit and plastic bike. As a Cap fan, that debacle made me very angry.Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.",7,2,3,5 July 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Uberhip Underworld
","SPOILERS.Embedded in hip, street-thug canon, there is Scorcese's *Goodfellas*, there is Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction*, there is Ritchie's *Snatch* Â all periodically panned for their film stylings, yet garnering indirect accolades through their wealth of imitators Â but if there is such a thing as 'too hip,' Paul McGuigan's *Lucky Number Slevin* would be choking on its own faux street cred.Sidling past the grandmasters of urban cool, *Slevin* embraces its influences and tilts unashamedly at the zenith of Thug Hip.Sometimes it works, as when danger men like Bruce Willis (as hired gun, Mr. Goodkat) or Sir Ben Kingsley (as crime kingpin, The Rabbi) orate Urban, but sometimes it flails for credibility, as when Morgan Freeman (as opposing kingpin, The Boss) tries to convince he's Bad, or when Boy Hartnett (as title character, Slevin) tries to convince he's Hard.The impeccable Stanley Tucci, as the testy New York cop, edges into hip with his seedy, malign temperament. Lucy Liu is the Girl Next Door (why doesn't the Girl Next Door ever look like Janeane Garofalo?), as titillating yet irritating as a GND usually is, her contribution to hip being a slavish adherence to Gap-generation mismatched clothes; her presence an obvious element required for gratuitous intercourse and Implausible Happy Ending Protocol.There's a sarcasm at work in the title, for at first glance, Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is anything but lucky, being mistaken for the guy whose apartment he is crashing in and whisked off with a twice-broken nose (with nary but a bath towel betwixt him and primal exposure) to visit two of the crime bosses of New York City, and told that he owes them both large. The Boss makes a deal with Slevin to cancel his debt in return for a favor: assassinating The Rabbi's son. But Slevin is not the low-rent thug they think he isÂ And hit-man Goodkat is skulking around, seemingly hired by both The Boss and The Rabbi, for reasons unknownÂ There is something afoot and we can't quite focus our thug-dar for all the misdirection thrown at us by the serpentine style of the film-making and the bass-ackwards nature of the film.A million plot twists later, we discover that *Slevin* is a tale of revenge. The long way 'round. Events go nowhere and twists add up to nothing, but when the layer cake is baked, the Moebius strip winds up making sense - until it tries to make sense of itself. In the last explanatory dialog (delivered by Robert Forster) all non sequiturs are accounted for, with one glaring exception, a mistake on the film-makers' part Â the motivation of a major player is lacking, to the detriment of the film's overall enjoyment. SPOILERS...During the movie, we are led to believe that lethal Mr. Goodkat (Willis) is playing both bosses for his own ends (a role much like Willis' character in *Last Man Standing*, 1996, one of the many inferior remakes of *Yojimbo*) and that he has 'plans' for Slevin, who is in turn being played by the two bosses. In the denouement, it is revealed that twenty years ago, Goodkat was sent to execute Slevin as a boy, but stayed his hand, unbeknownst to his employers. In the present, Goodkat is in fact aiding Slevin's revenge on the two bosses.The question is: Why? What possible reason did Goodkat have to renege on his kiddie execution? If it was to groom Slevin as an accomplice, we'd have motivation, but Slevin is NOT his accomplice Â on the contrary, Goodkat seems to be aiding Slevin for no recompense. We can speculate all we want about Goodkat doing something moral to palliate his nihilism, or that for the past twenty years, Slevin was in fact in Goodkat's debt until the revenge job released him from Goodkat's services. But Â as Sloe (Mykelti Washington) tells Slevin - 'Tell it to the one-legged man, so he can bump it on down the road.' Speculation schmeculation.In all the smash-cuts and filtered film, all the mind-numbing wallpaper and misdirection (making pretty-boy Hartnett not so pretty with a broken nose or prison goatee), in all the flashing forward and backward, all the split-screens and strobed scenes, in all the compositing of dialog from different flashbacks and spine-snapping the chronology for more impactive 'reveals,' director McGuigan and writer Jason Smilovic strangely Â but understandably - neglected to give Goodkat plausible motivation.The movie might have been harder, heavier and hipper were it not for the discrepancy in Willis' character and the silly girl-boy happy ending. Yet it retains its high rating for the obvious effort to create a film more interesting than your average bear - visually, conceptually, linguistically.Best line is Goodkat's reply to Slevin: 'I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead!' because it seems so altogether true - about BRUCE WILLIS. In one scene, Goodkat, in long, tough-guy overcoat, raises two guns straight forward, arms outstretched, furious intent on his face - an image of Bruce Willis as engraved in our minds as Christ on the Cross.Bruce Willis bigger than Jesus? Now that's hip.",7,0,1,26 November 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Heroes for a Loser Class.
","If you've never done hard drugs before, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM will make sure you don't. If you've puked your guts out over your bed, stayed unwashed for a month straight, and sold your mother's TV for a fix, well, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is like last Wednesday.To say Darren Aronofsky's unflinching mind-bender is an intense cinematic experience is to sell it short - it is a scooping out of your intestines and playing with them before trying to squeeze them back into your torso, all while you're conscious.Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly are two young lovers (Harry and Marion) hooked on heroin and dreaming big, nebulous dreams of saving their drug-dealing money to buy a business. Marlon Wayans is their junkie friend, Tyrone, along for the pipe dream.Ellen Burstyn is Harry's pill-popping mother, Sara, enamored with an afternoon television game show enough to hallucinate herself into it.Aronofsky shines his glaring light not just on the emptiness and false hope of heroin addiction, but on the seemingly innocuous addictions of prescription drugs. While Harry, Marion and Tyrone run the gamut of heroin's follies (street killings, their 'savings' dwindling to nothing while promising themselves they'll make it back with One Big Score, being driven to prostitution, gangrene from needle overuse), Sara becomes obsessed with losing weight via pills to fit into a red dress for an imagined TV appearance - by the time the dress fits her skeletal frame, nothing really matters anymore.Burstyn's bravura performance admitting truths about the emptiness of old peoples' lives is scary. It is astounding how deep she goes.When Harry discovers his mum is popping weight pills, he lectures her, 'You don't wanna turn into a dope fiend.' Of course, this hypocrisy falls on deaf ears.Araonofsky is an emotive film-maker. Everything that comes at us from the screen is geared towards stirring our innards, presented in the most jarring manner possible. Yet Aronofsky does not try to shock with the actual taking of the drugs, like TRAINSPOTTING; instead, whenever his characters fix, it is purveyed in a few crash cuts of iconic visuals. Makes it all the more effective, focusing on the consequences.With the Kronos Quartet soundtrack evoking darkness and disturbia, REQUIEM touches nerves we thought we'd wiped from our memory in young rock bands and college parties and street denizens spouting all the same inanities, like listening to people in jail holding cells, all saying the same things so many times ('What are you in for?' 'It wasn't my fault.') that it becomes physically nauseous.In most movies when down-and-out characters proclaim they're going to Buy That Store or Make That Score, it serves the story arc to achieve their goals - in REQUIEM, the characters are doomed to fail. That's the way junkies are built - all the platitudes in the world cannot change their nature. As a reformed alcoholic once told me: 'Every alcoholic is between drinks.' Which doesn't bode well for the inherent nature of humanity. Two years after telling me this, she proved it.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is about the incorrigible ones, those who self-fulfill the prophesy of their weakness. It is a noxious paean to losers the world over. And a horrifying warning to the rest of us who used to get sucked in to driving these losers around to 'a friend's place' and waiting for one hour in the car while they just went in 'for two minutes to pick up something.' Mr Garrison from SOUTH PARK put it best: 'Drugs are baiyd. Mm-kay.' --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",9,0,1,2 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Legend Unravels...
","Twenty years ago, I liked Michael Jackson. Everyone did. Twenty years ago, I liked STAR WARS. Everyone did. Look what happened to Michael Jackson. Look what happened to STAR WARS.Both these entities were done in NOT by lack of funding, backstabbing competitors or unbalanced advisors. Ironically, they brought their downfalls on themselves through a surfeit of funding which removed them from any competition and tipped them into insular universes within their own strangely shaped heads.All that said, STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE is simply amazing. It is absolutely astounding how much nothing this much money can buy.Now remember, PHANTOM MENACE was birthed into the world long after the STAR WARS canon entered world vernacular, like red corpuscles in the Earth's bloodstream. So it is all the more painful to see the cancer of The Prequels eating our childhood dreams away.George Lucas (Mr. Insular himself) writes and directs and ruins as he goes. If he had just surrendered his choke-hold on his writer's pen and precious director's chair, we wouldn't have this facsimile of a movie sullying the legend that he himself brought to life 20 years ago.An Even Longer Time Ago...Movie opens with two Jedi Knights, young 'padawan' Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his 'Master,' Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson, with a THUNDERDOME mullet), on a diplomatic mission to resolve a Trade Federation dispute. Immediately, we are lost: not only because George Lucas thrives on cloaking the simplicity of his stories with obfuscating politics, but because no one will admit that the Jedi translation of 'padawan' is 'bitchboy.' Qui and Obi immediately get into trouble, like a couple of intergalactic Gilligans; light sabers sizzle, robots frizzle, and the two flat-faced aliens who sent the robots realize they are neck-deep in shizzle.This opening sequence is actually the best part of the movie, as we get to see real Jedi in action - their prowess spoken of in three films and only marginally displayed by neophyte Luke, smug Darth and doddering Alec Guinness.Master and Bitchboy then flee the T-Fed conference after blowing things up and land on a planet where they meet Jar Jar Binks. Proof positive that George Lucas hates his fans.Meanwhile, Natalie Portman is learning her lines to play Queen Amidala, reciting them without a shred of emotion, and Lucas is filming all her rehearsal takes in funny wigs.Qui, Obi and Jar crash-land on Tattooine (something to do with the hyper-drive that no one ever fixes properly) and meet an irritating slave boy called Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and his virgin mother (Pernilla August). And here, ladies and gentlemen, is George's greatest casting mistake ever, even worse than non-actor Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, even worse than non-actor Hayden Christensen as teen Darth, even worse than that non-actor Empire extra with the phony looped dialog, 'Holding her is dangerous. Word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate' - here is the future Darth Vader, a puling, smart mouth, blond American non-actor kid who looks like a refugee from a '70's sitcom, playing the icon that haunted our nightmares as we slept on our Star Wars bedsheets.By now, Liam Neeson is not even phoning it in - he's faxing it, his eyes so glazed over with boredom he never once focuses on all the imaginary CGI fluff around him, his inflection never rising above audition level.Padding ensues with a pointless 'pod-race,' and the Jedi win the slave boy's freedom. Before they can leave the planet with him, they are attacked by Gene Simmons - my mistake, it wasn't Gene, just someone from the KISS Army, Darth Maul. Really mad about something - maybe that KISS did that reunion tour without him.Political intrigue ensues, our eyes glazing over like Qui-Gon's in front of a green screen. The Darth boy annoys the crap out of us. R2-D2 goes Action Trashcan Hero. C-3PO is naked. Samuel L. Jackson (as Jedi Mace Windu) tries to sound Shakespearean and still sounds like Jules from PULP FICTION - seems you can take the pimp-master out of the PULP, but you can't take the... And Yoda floats around on a hover-chair like some hedonistic Bob Dylan, quoting platitudes until we vomit like abandoned children.No two synopses for PHANTOM MENACE can agree on what PHANTOM MENACE is really about, except that it introduces to cinema the most annoying kid in the world and claims he's Darth Vader. What can really be learned from these Prequels, except that there was a lot more sky traffic - and the Empire seemed to have cleared up that problem by EPISODE IV.Big Government. Who needs it? We do. If they can clean up sky-traffic like that, go right ahead and keep phantom menacing me, I don't care - as long as I can get across town for a Hefeweisen with a buddy without busting a blood vessel stuck in the belly of a steel snake and giving the finger to ten jerks who drive as if they owned the skies like the Trade Federation...And like Big Government, PHANTOM MENACE talks too much, dazzles with special effects, overdoses on misdirection - and says nothing.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",4,11,21,13 May 2009
3:10 to Yuma," If you're thinking' of bein' my brother, it don't matter if you're black or white...
","'Every way of man is right in his own eyes.' - Wade quoting the Book of Proverbs, 3:10 TO YUMA.Every modern Western released after Eastwood's mighty 1992 elegy has laid hollow claim to 'The best western since UNFORGIVEN.' 3:10 TO YUMA is.That's because - like UNFORGIVEN - YUMA is not a 'Western,' but an operatic tale set in the old west, balancing themes of honor, cowardice, heroism, paternalism, on the simplicity of the road movie, the buddy movie, with magnificent performances, nuanced, subtle, graceful, uncompromising.Phew, my thesaurus is bloody...A crippled rancher, Evans (Christian Bale), must escort notorious captured outlaw, Wade (Russell Crowe), miles into town to put him onboard the 3:10 p.m. prison train to Yuma... With all hell on their trail in the form of Wade's gang, led by maniacal Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), pursuing his boss with a single-mindedness bordering on homosexual.Set in the 1880s, shortly after the Civil War, we meet rancher Evans (Bale), down on his luck, one foot lost to the war (in a heroic battle, he tells his sons), barely supporting a wife and two boys, staring into the abyss of a drought, while the local authorities constantly try to run him off his farm to make way for a railroad...While Wade (Crowe) nonchalantly robs a bank stagecoach, letting his men do the misdeeds while he draws pictures and moves in after the bloodletting. The savagery of his men washes over him without effect; he is well on his way to nihilism. Their loyalty means nothing: he emotionlessly guns down one of his gang taken hostage by the stagecoach driver, to remove the driver's advantage - then he guns down the driver...Wade is so arrogant about his power and indifferent about his fate that he calmly rides into the town where the stagecoach was headed, has a drink and uses the fact that he looks exactly like Russell Crowe to seduce a bargirl into bed.The lives of the outlaw and the rancher intertwine when Evans happens to be in town when Wade is captured, and accepts $200 to join the posse to escort Wade to the station. ($200 was exactly the amount the army paid for his shot-off foot.) Peter Fonda (renowned for his iron horse, here riding a real one) is bounty hunter, Byron McElroy, so tough that after getting shot and having the bullet removed by a veterinarian, is ten minutes later taking Wade into custody and riding out of town with the posse.3:10 TO YUMA is not about the train trip or the train - it is about the journey of the outlaw and the rancher, by road and by soul.Remade from the 1957 film of the same name (with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, from a short story by Elmore Leonard), director James Mangold (from the great COP LAND to the not-so-great WALK THE LINE) elevates the somewhat clichÃ©d 1950s characters to multi-dimensional, complex people.Wade is not the sneering black-hat villain of the original, and it is no accident seductive Russell Crowe plays him - charming, principled, educated; in a stopover at Evans's homestead overnight, Wade easily wins over the rancher's wife (Gretchen Mol), 'I once knew the daughter of a sea captain. She had the greenest eyes I ever saw. Like yours.' The only way we can even identify Wade as the 'villain' is - ironically - his black hat.Evans is not the respected, upright do-gooder. The town officials resent him for not surrendering his land and his family regards him as less than manly. In impassioned desperation, he tells his wife why he needs to endanger his life accompanying the outlaw to the train Â redemption: 'I'm tired of the way that my boys look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't.' Nuance reaches a zenith in the film's final scenes as Wade admits to Evans that he has been to Yuma prison twice, and escaped twice, and the ghost of a knowing smile flits across Evans's face... He would win back his respect this day.The 2007 YUMA ends on a more powerful note than the original and Mangold and new screenwriters, Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, create a moral dilemma where Wade and Evans realize they are more like each other than each would dare admit - principled men - and were it not for the circumstances they might well have been friends. A reckoning looms - the gauntlet run through the town, the rancher and the poet villain, the rancher's boy, and the mad homosexual - and somehow, Wade and Evans both find redemption in the tragedy that unfolds.In the scenes where Wade and Evans flee through the town, dodging bullets from Wade's gang and the townsfolk alike, we step outside ourselves and think, 'Jesus Christ - it's Christian Bale and Russell Crowe! - megastars together on screen!' Amazing how they lost themselves in their characters so completely. A Brit and an Aussie playing two Wild West Americans. How does that grab ya, Yanks? Guess it's still not as offensive as Chuck Connors playing GERONIMO.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",10,2,4,4 March 2009
50 First Dates," Fuggedaboudit!
","Another Adam Sandler movie. Another Chick Flick. Another romantic comedy. Another film that Rob Schneider appears in. All in all, another Spectacular Waste Of Time.50 FIRST DATES is almost as painful as the brain injury it makes fun of.Henry (Sandler) is a marine biologist at a SeaWorld in Hawaii. (If you can conceptualize Adam Sandler as a marine biologist, the rest of the outlandish and offensive concepts in the movie should just clack into place.) He's a philanderer, bedding women on vacation in Hawaii and forgetting them the next day.I see an ironic twist coming like a wrecking ball shaped like stupid.Henry falls for Lucy (Drew Barrymore, her lisping out of control from overdosing on coquettishness). Little does he know she suffers from short-term memory dysfunction - when she goes to sleep every night, her memory wipes clean. She retains memories up to the point of the accident that caused her condition.So when Lucy sees Henry the next day, she doesn't know him. Who can blame her? Don't we all try to wipe Adam Sandler out of our minds daily? So begins Henry's odious quest to make Lucy remember him. Again. And again. And again. It's GROUNDHOG DAY for retards, i.e. Adam Sandler fans.Written unthinkingly by George Wing (his first movie) and directed adequately by Peter Segal, the premise of 50 FIRST DATES is a lecher's wet dream, a sick exploitation. It is not even tragicomic - it is flatly simply a tragedy. You can sophomorically pass it off like a GILLIGAN'S ISLAND episode, but the reality is that this woman has BRAIN DAMAGE! Movie about a disabled, fecund chick and the genetically-dysfunctional, horny philanderer trying to screw her. What makes anyone think (audience and movie characters alike) that Henry has 'changed' since we met him as a slut? What has come to light is his pathological eccentricity in pursuing this woman whom he has no possibility of having a future with.If he was sincerely trying to cure her brain problem, we might excuse his randy 'courting' - but he's simply trying to get into her pants - on the pretense of 'noble love.' He wants Lucy to regain her memory to remember HIM, not to improve her quality of life (even though we know that in his warped head, he is considering her memories of him as that very improvement).Then there is the tragedy that is Sean Astin: from starring roles in three of the most renowned films in moviedom (Peter Jackson's stunning LORD OF THE RINGS series), here he slips backwards, downwards, almost too comfortably into the filth from whence he came - his Z-character niche - as Lucy's lisping, ambiguously-masculine brother, Doug. The mesh belly shirt doesn't help. Or maybe it helps too much.Doubt that Henry would be so intent on pursuing Lucy if she looked like Sean Astin in the belly shirt.And Rob Schneider. At least Sandler tries for cred - with reputable roles in SPANGLISH, REIGN OVER ME, PUNCH DRUNK LOVE - but Schneider (playing Henry's idiot friend here - no surprise) has never chosen one redeeming role in his sloppy-seconds career. A one-trick pony with two broken legs.Blake Clark plays Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd slaps down a cameo as Lucy's doctor.Henry's major breakthrough in bedding Lucy is creating a video, which Lucy must watch every morning, outlining her life from her accident to that point in time, including the bilious parts about her falling for Henry.He gets his wish, gaming it so badass one day (one of the many days he has nothing better to do with his life) that he scores third base. Of course, no one questions the morals or gullibility of a woman who would watch a video, be convinced she is the victim of a memory-loss accident and then fall for the guy on the video who is telling her that she loves him.Henry eventually sails off to 'find his dream' but realizes Lucy retains some shred of him in her memory, so - talk about 'dreamkiller' - he returns to port, to find that Lucy has been made Art Director of a Spastic Institute (is the movie trying to be ironic?), surrounding herself with her drawings of Henry, not understanding why an image of this ugly guy who looks like Adam Sandler is in her mind.But how does she remember she is an Art Director every day? How does she perform her administrative job with no memories of the previous day? What's this Post-It on my desk? Where did I put my file of symposium attendees? Are the audience as stupid as we think they are to fall for this? The movie's message is noxious and disturbing. There is no badness in Henry - he is not exploiting her or taking advantage of her - it is the opposite: his innocence in wanting to 'love' her is a genetic mutation, and that's the disturbing part, because the movie tells us his behavior is laudable. But there is no evolutionary reason for Henry to try this hard with Lucy when he already has the game to impregnate hundreds of other females. The psychology of growing closer to your partner is linked with 'shared experiences.' Lucy is never going to share any experiences with Henry, except those of a stranger within a 24-hour period. And even her day-to-day relationship with him is predicated on the fact that every single day she must believe she has lost her memory in the first place.What does it say about Henry that he also must re-acclimatize himself with her confusion every morning?

","What happens in Vegas... uhhh, what happened in Vegas?...It's not exactly BACHELOR PARTY (1984), but THE HANGOVER is a raunchy surprising stab at lewd, crude, nude immortality.Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are three friends who wake up in a Vegas hotel room the night after throwing their pal (Justin Bartha) a bachelor party. The room looks like it was just visited by Hunter S. Thompson, there is a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and they can't find the groom.THE HANGOVER reeks of two writers (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore) getting hammered one night and trying to talk their way out of getting bitchbeaten by Chinese gangsters. Which is kinda what THE HANGOVER is - one long excuse, wrapped in a rationalization and pinched on the bottom of ludicrous. Todd Phillips (co-writer BORAT) directs this descent into surrealism.Justin Bartha, who had nothing to do in those Nicolas Cage movies, here finds that even in a movie where he's got something to do, they can't find anything for him to do, as he disappears for most of the movie.Through tiny successive clues - a hospital bracelet, the fact that they've got a police car instead of their hire car, receipts from various vendors, the name of a wedding chapel - the three friends work their way backwards, revealing their night of debauchery piece by piece.They discover they were victims of the 'date-rape' drug, 'roofies' - which their doctor calls 'Ruphalyn' (upon looking it up, it is called Rohypnol or Flunitrazepam) - which accounts for their lack of memory.The three friends have such a tight dynamic we feel we've seen them before - and we have. The Three Stooges. The smart, nominal leader, Phil is obviously the Moe of the bunch (I've not seen Bradley Cooper in a more funny, more likable role, proving he's got the A-List chops to carry a movie), the wacky cuddly pudding bear Alan is Curly (Galifianakis uses every ounce of his over-weight to milk the hilarity, also shooting his star into A-List territory), and the middle one - er, whatsisname - is whatsisname here-- uh, Stu, the redheaded child of the bunch, proxy for literal redhead Larry (and like Larry, Ed Helms does nothing special except bridge the other two).But he does marry Heather Graham. She's the stripper who owns the kid in the closet. (And guys, she gets her knox out for mammary purposes.) Mike Tyson cameos and shows us why he's still not an actor.In a laugh out loud movie reference, when they need to buy back the groom from Chinese gangsters (Chinese kingpin played ever so scrotumly by Ken Jeong), Alan convinces them to gamble for the money, so descends to the casino dressed like Rain Man. (To make it come full circle, Justin Bartha did play a retarded guy in GIGLI. Now it all makes sense!) Rob Riggle (THE DAILY SHOW) as a taser-happy cop with the best line, as he calls for a 'volunteer' from our friends, 'Come here, handsome,' and chubby, bearded Alan steps forward - 'No, not you fat Jesus, slide on back there.' Shot in and around sunny Las Vegas, with its snappy dialog and breezy, insouciant verve THE HANGOVER exudes a heady excitement and an overall feeling of blissful meaningless fun - after all, we all relate the Vegas skyline to good times; few of us work there, and even if we had bad experiences there, the boundless possibilities of Vegas still stir our blood to boiling.And thankfully, as the friends drive into Vegas, with perfunctory aerial establishing shot, the source music is NOT Elvis's obligatory 'A Little Less Conversation'; instead 'Can't Tell Me Nothing' by Kanye West. Someone alert Nicolas Cage. The Elvis song, awesome and apropos though it is, has become such a clichÃ©, that for this original departure alone, THE HANGOVER can date-rape me any night.",7,1,2,26 July 2010
United 93," United They Fall
","Oh, stop whining! *United 93* was bound to bring out the bitch in politically-gutless 2006 America: any issue that invokes the oh-so-hip splash-appellation '9-11' is like a hog call to every uninformed swine with two cents worth of a knee-jerk opinion.But beyond the whines of 'too soon' and 'disrespect' and 'exploitation' is the sheer raw power of this breath-defying film experience. *United 93*, unlike its detractors or those too disturbed to enter a theater without first checking Terrorist Alert colors to concede more usurpation of their civil liberties, displays no histrionics, no flag-waving and no political stance.Here's a suggestion: shut up and watch.Writer-director Paul Greengrass delivers a film like nothing you will ever see regarding that fateful day of 2001 - there is no structural arc, no foreshadowing of events, no statements made that in hindsight will hammer home portent; no character studies, no stereotypes and no movie stars. We feel as alienated on the plane Â amongst those vaguely familiar aspirin ad faces - as both passengers and terrorists.Like any Titanic or Jesus movie, everyone in the world knows the ending. Yet every minute, every second is compelling. Greengrass somehow still convinces us that we are boarding a plane on a routine flight from Newark to San Francisco on September 11, 2001. When it is hijacked, we are almost as surprised as the passengers.Four Muslim hijackers dispatch the pilots and aim the plane on a suicide course at (it is presumed) the White House. Through clandestine cell-phoning, the hostages become aware of the WTC Tower attacks, and deduce that they too are on a fuel-laden suicide missile. From innumerable accounts (from family of the deceased, military bases and air traffic facilities) Greengrass has pieced together this tale of what might have transpired after the hijacking. Though the passengers (we again presume) fought valiantly to regain control of the aircraft, it crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania field, 150 miles northwest of the Capitol. No one survived.What is *United 93* trying to achieve? Is it an entertaining piece of fiction? A docu-drama? A tribute? A eulogy? As with all art, the answer seems to be different in the eye of each beholder. There are as many views terming it all these things, as there are those who misconstrue its purpose and then criticize it for not achieving what *they* wish it to achieve. For example, those considering it a 'tribute' castigate Greengrass for intercutting scenes of the Muslims praying to their god with scenes of the Christians praying to *their* god, thus tarnishing the 'tribute.' But Greengrass has crafted an altogether neutral account, an objective document of that dazed and confused day of infamy.Greengrass effects aloofness with non-intrusive hand-held cameras, flitting about the action and crash-cutting over reams of small talk and daily routine Â from airport control towers, to the Muslim hijackers, to passengers, to military control bases. Considering many of the air traffic controllers play themselves (most notably, Ben Sliney, FAA National Operations Manager), there is no slouching in the acting department, each performance evoking an on screen sincerity long forgotten by politicians and movie stars.John Powell's understated score bleeds intermittently through the tension, and at one point, is heart-wrenching: in a long shot showing the North Tower billowing smoke, there is a single orchestra stab as Flight 175 slams into the South Tower. And then there is silence. That one stunning second is the only archive footage used in this film. It will wring the breath from your body. Whilst watching the awestruck participants on screen, in their unmitigated shock, that day-mare becomes real all over again.There are those that maintain the passengers 'gave their lives in the name of freedom'; that they were 'heroes.' No. They gave their lives in the name of trying to save their lives. And a 'hero' is a person who has OPTIONS and yet chooses the hard road. These people were brave (maybe), courageous (maybe), but heroes? No. Yet there is nothing less noble in what they achieved - appending a falsity to their motivation is to make those left behind feel better about themselves.Even at the most obvious juncture to create Hollywood Heroes Â Flight 93's eventual crash Â Greengrass avoids the temptation judiciously, also wisely eschewing gratuitous explosions (even the shots of the WTC Towers afire are almost incidental). Tastefully and powerfully, instead of a Michael Bay yellow-vermilion fireball cut from four angles and tweaked to Hiroshima level, the aircraft's final impact scene is viewed from the inside of the cockpit, as passengers madly grapple with the Muslim pilot, as the plane tilts earthward, turbines and people screaming, and amidst arms and bodies frantically entangled, the ground swells up sickeningly fast with a gut-wrenching cut to black.By dambusting past the occlusions thrown up by the government with this simple and direct film, *United 93* jarringly opens the nation's eyes, bringing the unresolved Taliban holy war to the forefront of our consciousness once more.Remember Osama Bin Laden? The original Bad Guy in this conflict (who actually *took the blame for the WTC attacks*)? Initially exploited as an excuse to manufacture fear and pillage civil liberties, Bin Laden was quietly reshuffled to the bottom of the deck by the Republican administration in order to keep their pockets padded and their consciences black as the insides of rectums. Like AIDS and The Environment and Gay Marriage, an unresolved platform garners so much more political leverage. And it's just plain rude to arrest your business partners while you're still doing business with them...Yet there are no causes explored in this film, no reasons explained and Â most refreshingly - no moralism attached. *United 93* may be nothing more than an unstructured fiction based loosely on fact, but it may achieve nothing less than a nationwide catharsis.(Read this unabridged article at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/United93.html)",10,2,4,25 May 2006
Casablanca," We'll Always Have Overacting.
","Leonard Maltin calls CASABLANCA 'The best Hollywood movie of all time'; it won the 1943 Best Picture Oscar; voted #2 film of all time by the American Film Institute; Roger Ebert effuses, 'Casablanca is THE movie'; it boasts one of the most regal Hollywood stars in Ingrid Bergman (in the movie that would catapult her to stardom), and the cynical founder of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack, Humphrey Bogart, one of the eras manly sex symbols, even though his face resembled the underside of a running shoe.Some movies were great back then, and stay great: CITIZEN KANE, SEVEN SAMURAI, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Poor CASABLANCA has dated badly - due to censorship at the time not allowing the filmmakers to solidly portray a married woman cheating, censorship on what could be shown on screen to denote 'passionate affair,' contention over the nihilistic lead character necessarily having a heart of gold, the faults go on. After decades of progress in American film, CASABLANCA, though it has insinuated itself into popular vernacular as a 'great film,' is nothing more than a talky cardboard romance thriller, with overacting threatening to send us into a melodramatic swoon and enough soft-focus on Ingrid Bergman to make us cross-eyed.During World War II, Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) had a steamy love affair in Paris, which involved lots of kissing with their mouths closed and lots of hugging with their clothes on. Years later, Rick runs a gin joint in Casablanca, The CafÃ© Americain, a stopover in Morocco for refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe on their way to America. It's kinda like the Cantina in STAR WARS, except all the aliens are illegal. Peter Lorre cameos as Chewbacca, and Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) plays As Time Goes By by flapping his hands up and down on the keys like a seal. 'You badly synched it for her, you can badly synch it for me.' When Ilsa and her activist husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek egress through Casablanca to The States, they seek out Rick at his CafÃ© ('Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks her pointy bra into mine'), knowing he has Letters of Transit that would confuse the Nazi stormtroopers hunting them due to Laszlo causing a great disturbance in the Resistance on Tattooine. 'These aren't the droids you want. Move along.' And Rick and Ilsa reignite their love affair by meeting in dark rooms and talking a lot with their clothes on. Rick's refrain, 'We'll always have Paris' makes us wonder why he doesn't tear off her pointed bra and make Casablanca the new Paris. Everyone constantly drinking and smoking, yet no one ever gets drunk enough to have a Sexy Party. Censorship, thou frigid mistress.Claude Rains is an unscrupulous, stylish weasel of a frog, a French officer who is nonchalantly AC/DC when it comes to helping either Rick or the Germans - whoever can benefit him the most. Conrad Veidt is Nazi Strasser, bedecked incorrectly in a Luftwaffe uniform.Evidence abounds that CASABLANCA would not make it through today's muster onto the silver screen. Based on the play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, Everybody Comes to Rick's, IMDb trivia tells us 'in 1980 this script was sent to readers at a number of major studios and production companies under its original title. Some readers recognized the script but most did not. Many complained that the script was 'not good enough' to make a decent movie. Others gave such complaints as 'too dated,' 'too much dialog' and 'not enough sex.'' According to actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, Bogart and Bergman themselves 'thought the dialogue was ridiculous and the situations were unbelievable...'Yet the movie remains a classic for most film aficionados. Back when they were starstruck kids it was 'the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' Ah, to me, 'the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill o' beans in this crazy world.' I couldn't have melodramatically stated it better, Humphrey.",6,5,12,17 December 2010
In Bruges," Quentin Tarantino's THE ODD COUPLE.
","Humor so black and ironic, it's like stabbing nuns with the same ruler they used to rap your knuckles during piano lessons. IN BRUGES. It's in Belgium.It's where mismatched hit men Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are sent by Harry the Boss (Ralph Fiennes) to lay low after a hit, to await his phone call for their next step.Like a Guy Ritchie version of Laurel and Hardy, Ken embraces the touristy Ã©lan of the picturesque Bruges (pronounced 'Broozh'), while Ray turns his collar up against the cold and bitches about waiting around with nothing to do.A telegram arrives from Harry, which uses the f-word as noun, verb, adverb, adjective, qualifier and preposition. Which lets us see into the tender soul of the man. Ralph Fiennes as uber-cockney Harry the Boss, is a cross between the ferocity of Daniel Day Lewis in GANGS OF NEW YORK, the rarified unculture of Phil Daniels in QUADROPHENIA and the unmitigated rape-clown cuntery of Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST. Though Fiennes was also ferocious in SCHINDLER'S LIST, his character there was not tempered with any humor - here, Harry's pure evil hits you like a rubber chicken to the temple. An evil rubber chicken.While Ray is on the town making time with some tasty Euro blondness in the form of ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy, and befriending a dwarf (Jordan Prentice) with a penchant for tall hookers, and generally getting into another fine mess with his A-type personality, Harry phones Ken with the next hit: Ken has to whack Ray.Ken refuses. So Harry must travel to the fairytale city to get the job done himself. As this journey towards doom progresses, we see into the crazy, twisted principles of all these men - and they are not unlike the best in all of us, with the worst tacked on to allow them to do their jobs.While trying to shoot down Ray, Harry is blocked by the pregnant hotel owner, whom he does not simply kill, instead, asking her to move aside courteously, telling her, 'I'm not going to go through you and the baby - I'm a nice person!' Harry then makes a deal with Ray that he won't shoot at him until he runs outside. They both them agree on which direction to run.At the height of its darkness, there is shocking levity - IN BRUGES is actually laugh-out-loud funny. And brutally sad: Ken meets a disturbing end in sticking to his principles and trying to save Ray from Harry's vengeance.IN BRUGES is such a seamless, effortless shock to the system, you'd never realize this was only writer-director Martin McDonagh's second directorial effort; with its lightning dialog, intertwining plot and symbolically heavy themes.On their touristy travels, Ken and Ray encounter Hieronymous Bosch's The Last Judgment, something they can both agree is evocative and disturbing. Bosch symbolism appears throughout the film, with Ray's dwarf friend and a Mardi Gras street fair playing a pivotal role in the film's surprising, gut-wrenching finale.Carter Burwell has such a knack for music score that spanks the nerves at just that right crossroads of pathos and humor; evidenced so brilliantly in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, now here, in this same type of crucible where darkness and levity collide.Take a holiday from the Hollywood humdrum. Visit IN BRUGES. Bring a gun.---Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",10,1,3,17 August 2009
Star Trek," All-New, All-Improved, Same-ole Same ole.
","If this don't keep the fan-boys happy, nothing' will.How do you approach a movie as sodden in mythos as the STAR TREK franchise? The approach must be as trepidatious for film makers as it is for geek-boys and weekend viewers alike. Every inch of a production under the STAR TREK aegis would reek of esoterica and legacy. How could anyone possibly circumvent the pitfalls and launch another TREK into warp drive without twisting someone's seven of nine? Here's how: STAR TREK 2009 - a grand homage to a dubious institution. (Some may immediately take issue with 'dubious' - but let's be frank, the original 1966 series was no SPACE: 1999; it was cheap, relatively unsuccessful and aggressively fey. The legend has more cred than the product.) Funny that director J.J. Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have recreated Gene Roddenberry's idea exactly as it has always been - simple story set in space, where English is still the Universal Language, where unknown crew members with different colored tunics always die when they go EVA with the stars, where sparks still fly out of consoles to signify damage being done to a hyper-sophisticated starship.The homage and reverence of TREK 2009 comes in two parts: Fully 50% is the efx. They've really taken this seriously. The surroundings of the 23rd century are stunning in their detail - Iowa is still a bleak, flat landscape but in the distant haze, hulking city-scrapers loom, rising into the lower stratosphere like ocean liners tipped on their sides; we see the NCC-1701 USS Enterprise in all its maiden glory; jaw-dropping space scenes, which sometimes lapse into total silence during exterior shots, lending the vacuum of space its long-sullied reverential, foreboding air. These latest boastings in special effects technology outdo Lucas - they are the best you will see at this point in history.The other 50% is the casting. Perfect. Chris Pine is James Tiberius Kirk, looking like Ray Liotta Junior and as fulla beans as we remember the shirtless Shatner; Zachary Quinto is the closest thing to Spock as body oil is to Shatner; Karl Urban channels Bones hilariously, his famous disclaimers scattered passim: 'Goddamit, I'm a doctor, not an engineer!'; Anton Yelchin soft-v's all over the place as Pavel Chekov; Simon Pegg as Scotty steals his scenes (but then Simon Pegg can make even a David Schwimmer film palatable, how could he NOT steal his scenes in a well-made movie?); John Cho (yes, KUMAR) is Sulu; and Zoe Saldana as Uhura spreads her pheromones over Spock like chocolate duck butter.A fitting re-launch of the STAR TREK franchise. And all thanks to Leonard Nimoy! In a wizened cameo as Spock Prime, he is responsible for some kind of time-paradox-anomaly-panty-twist, so these young characters we see are supposedly the same characters we know - but in an alternate time continuum, forging new destinies.The irony is TREK 2009 shows us the well-loved TREK characters when they were young, but we've already seen the characters when they were young - and they looked nothing like these guys! Well, except for Spock... amazing what a pair of pointy ears can do.At film opening, we meet the USS Kelvin, populated by Captain Arab Guy and his crew of Teen Models, under attack from Eric Bana as the vengeful Romulan, Nero, directly tied to the time paradox plot. One of the models is Kirk's father, who makes the ultimate sacrifice for his unborn son's escape, in the film's most touching, human scene, as the mother describes via radio her newborn son - James Tiberius - to the father, as his ship impacts. Birthed during a battle, conflict would follow J.T. all his life like green-skinned babes in space bikinis.While on planet Vulcan, young Spock, conflicted with emotions from his half-human heritage, is invited to attend Vulcan Academy and declines. For emotionless Vulcans, these guys sure display a lot of emotion - when chastised by the elders, Spock gives the 'Live Long and Prosper' salutation not in comity, but in sarcasm. Excellent.The best aspect of TREK 2009 is that it makes the Enterprise crew and the starship Enterprise powerful, not just in reputation - in action. We see Sulu (whose combat experience is in the seemingly innocuous art of 'fencing') do sword battle like Toshiro Mifune, we see the might of the Enterprise's big guns; we see Spock give the nerve pinch - to Kirk.Though there is not much space between explosions and stunts for characterization, TREK 2009 explores well, albeit briefly, the conflict between Kirk and Spock over the captain's post onboard the Enterprise, also playing up a bemusing 'romance' between Spock and Uhura. The plot involves Spock Prime re-booting history by accident and Nero traveling through time to nerve-pinch him, with the Enterprise crew being caught in the crossfire and having to rescue their captain (Bruce Greenwood) from Nero's ship.And the moment we all wait for: Quinto meets Nimoy and engage in some tasty Spock on Spock philosophy. (Might I make a prediction? Other players in this movie franchise will come and go - Zachary Quinto will be forever Spock.) Nimoy's closing voice-over is the immortal intro to this immortal series: 'Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life-forms and new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before.' Again.",7,0,5,20 June 2009
As Good as It Gets," A man-size Jack in a girl-size film.
","Saw this movie at the cinema with a male friend. We were two men - men who discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and brawn. And AS GOOD AS IT GETS blindsided us.The marketing was smart. Yes, Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson were probably going to end up a 'romantic couple,' but the trailers appealed to the man of brawn in each of us, showing us off-kilter Jack; an obsessive-compulsive author who tells it like it is, insulting and alienating himself along the way with men, women and other social castes; he didn't step on cracks in the footpath AND he put the weaker sex in their place. It looked biting. It looked cruelly funny. It looked... manly.But in the film's final moments, Helen Hunt spews a line that only a Girly Movie can't be criminally prosecuted for, 'Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend?' Isn't she a little old and cynical to be using that juvenile term? And is that all this farce was aiming towards? The pabulum of girlfriend/boyfriend-ism? Cuba Gooding Jr. had to play feyer than a hairdresser for this? Greg Kinnear had to be a gay artist and get bashed and robbed by Skeet Ulrich for this? Helen Hunt had to be a waitress and have a sick kid which fortified her against Jack's insults for this? Jack Nicholson is someone's 'boyfriend'? And suddenly - it didn't feel so comfortable sitting next to another man in that theater. We gulped hard, hoping no one would see us two men attending this Chick Flick with no girly dates having dragged us here. Uh, we came to see Jack, really we did; we came for the insults and uh, the insouciant philandering and uh, the lies that make chicks cry inconsolably and uh - how about them Dolphins, hey? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,3,7,1 November 2009
The Birth of a Nation," The Bitch Of A Nation.
","Back when there was no internet or breast augs or Conan O'Brien, people got their entertainment by watching the first moving pictures. D.W. Griffiths's THE BIRTH OF A NATION is one such 'movie.' Nearly a century after its release (1915) it stands today on the horns of a grand dichotomy: that of being a pioneering film - and a racist piece of poop. Griffiths lifted the story from a play and a novel, both written by white supremacist and reverend (no contradiction there!) Thomas F. Dixon Jr. - The Clansman and The Leopard's Spots.THE BIRTH OF A NATION comes in two segments, the first dealing with the friendship between a family from the North and a family from the South, and how the Civil War forces them to take opposing sides; the tragedy reaches its zenith when the two families' sons meet bayonet to bayonet on the battlefield. The second half of BIRTH deals with Reconstruction - and the magnificence of the Ku Klux Klan in keeping African Americans at bay as they were on the verge of taking over White Civilization. No kidding!With BIRTH's historical place in filmdom is pretty much unassailable, it is hard to rail against this progenitor of today's trillion dollar industry. It is a massive achievement - there are epic battle scenes, split screens, process shots, special effects (tinting the filmstock) and cutaways (a brave new technique) - D.W. Griffiths showing the industry the heights that film 'making' could scale. On the other hand, whenever a movie promotes hypocrisy, ignorance or wrongheadedness, the movie rates low, because it misuses a great artistic tool to further idiocy. And BIRTH's second half is freakishly hypocritical, provincially ignorant and overwhelmingly wrongheaded. Movie is 'bad' because ignorance and hypocritical Christianity are held up as sanctimoniously right. The last frames show the Ku Klux Klan not allowing blacks to vote at gunpoint, and then an overlay of Jesus with a fake beard overseeing a town of frolicking people - frolicking WHITE people - a text overlay blurting, 'Dare we dream of a day when the Prince of Brotherly Love shall rule.' Uh, over just us Whiteys, of course. After the Civil War, a subplot grows to fruition - Silas Lynch, a mulatto (a white guy face-painted in Light Darkie - it just keeps getting worse, don't it?), starts a black congress, which immediately starts acting like Whitey thinks a black congress would act - boozing and arguing, with their shoeless feet up on the tables, making laws that Whitey should salute them and that they pass the right to intermarry... It's all patently ridiculous - yet here it is, in a motion picture of the time.When I heard THE BIRTH OF A NATION was racist, I thought, 'How bad can it possibly be?' This black congress is reprehensible, but I've seen worse. Remember those Shirley Temple movies?! Well, think of the most racist thing you can think of - say, Rush Limbaugh - and then multiply by the Ku Klux Klan. Add Glenn Beck. Stir.Then it gets REALLY racist - as blacks overrun the town, vandalizing and chasing white women in uncontrolled bestial lust (which the sophisticated Christian whites would *never* do!), and one of the young milky-faced stars from the first half of the film (the one they call 'Little Colonel' - pertaining to his white manhood, mayhaps?) gets the idea to form the Ku Klux Klan... with white man-hoods... Black soldier Gus (Walter Long - another white guy in blackface) pursues one of the virginal white chicks until she jumps off a cliff rather than be molested by him. Gus is executed by the Klan, beginning a race war. And then - the Hero Shots. As the whole town is ransacked by blacks (and white guys in blackface), Little Colonel rounds up Klan members and rides thousands strong like the Cavalry coming to the rescue. The Ku Klux Klan is unequivocally the hero - there is no gray area, it IS all black... and uh, white. These guys are so serious, even their horses are covered in white sheets! There are literally thousands of white-sheeted Klanfolk, all gutlessly bedecked in their hoods, which in those times were white helmets with long spikes on top - in another of those great scenes that Griffiths sets up, but for the promotion of ignorance! I've never seen so much amassed redneck in one place. Except maybe a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. Lillian Gish is probably the only actress worth mentioning here. She plays a girl who at first hated Little Colonel for his involvement with the Klan. But she is not displaying ethics; it is only a character trait so she can arc to loving him when he saves her in his sheet. Also proving the utility of being a Klan member - chicks dig it. After the rousing parade of Klansmen through cheering city streets, we dissolve to the next election, where we see blacks coming out of their homes and being greeted by armed Klansmen on horseback with guns drawn to stop them from voting. In that great American tradition of: One White Man - One vote. THE BIRTH OF A NATION is the closest thing to an Emmett Brown time machine; a window not just on how people used to live, but the intellectualism of the time, and also the stunted attitudes of 'All men created equal - except black people.' If this is THE BIRTH OF A NATION, I want an abortion.",4,0,3,27 July 2010
Memento," The Reverse Genius Principle
","9) And that's when we realize we could never be sure of anything to begin with.8) When Leonard eventually thinks he has found his wife's killer, eleventh-hour reveals shock us with the possibility that his whole crisis may be nothing more than delusion.7) Editing this movie must have been like navigating inside Las Vegas hotels with no watch or compass: sex and drug distractions, deprivation of day or night, no signposts or exit signs, and of course, nauseous on cheap shrimp and hairy tequila. Untold credit to editor, Dody Dorn, for shuffling the deck as confusingly as possible, yet weaving the tale as tightly as a sanitarium wicker basket.6) But every few minutes, the movie twists back on itself, each flashback a segment of Leonard's life that happened just before the segment we have just seen Â and with each flashback, we realize just how wrong Leonard is about who his friends are, his past life, clues to the killer, his quest *in toto.* By about the fourth paragraph we realize: this piece is running backwards.5) From Jonathan Nolan's short story, *Memento Mori*, we meet Leonard mid-investigation, slumming it in a cockroach motel, having lost his job as insurance consultant, looking disheveled (as Guy Pierce can do so natchelly), and optimistically on the trail of the murderer; hanging with gregarious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), and involved with hot bod, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), both of whom seem to be aiding Leonard catch his killer.4) Leonard's last 'new memory' was the murder of his wife. During the scuffle with his wife's killer, a blow to the head caused his memory faculty to shut down. Whether this is truly biologically possible (if you cannot make new memories, how do you even shop for food and water or pay the rent?), for the movie's purposes, it means Leonard must piece together clues to his wife's killer through copious notes, tattoos on his own body and Polaroids. But the truth will forever elude him and the clues that lead to the killer are mere wraiths, the products of his own 'selective' reasoning.3) The harder you strive for something, the harder it is to grasp. But what you care least about - or that you were never striving for Â falls into your lap. Some call this the path of least resistance, but it's actually called The Reverse Genius Principle. And Leonard - all ephemeral ideas and misplaced action Â is a Reverse Genius in full throttle.2) Guy Pearce is the memory-challenged Leonard, who is trying so hard to move forward Â to find his wife's killer, but unable to create 'new memories' to retain info - that he ends up moving backward. Thusly, writer-director Christopher Nolan has crafted a film where the clues to a murder fall neatly OUT of place. Backwards.1) *Memento* opens with a killing. We don't know why. We don't know who.",Null,19,25,28 November 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Gloriously Bastardly.
","Quentin Tarantino loves cinema. Even the characters in his movies talk cinema. And the ones who aren't talking cinema still seem to realize they're in a damn fine piece of it. And the major plot point of Tarantino's latest cinematic masterpiece, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, revolves around the screening of a movie! Tarantino knows cinema so intimately, he smashes a conglomeration of styles together to arrive at BASTERDS; we could trace the lineage of Kurosawa, Woo, Hitchcock and Leone, but unless you're a film scholar with your hand down your pants, you just wanna get to the Jewish ultra-violence.That's where Brad Pitt comes in. As half-breed hillbilly Apache Aldo Raine, he recruits vengeful Jews during Hitler's Holocaust and takes the fight to the Germans. His mission: 'killin' Natzees.' Ambushing, scalping, mutilating, baseball-batting... terrorizing. These blood-mad Jews become known as 'The Basterds.' Their ultimate plan involves strapping bombs to themselves and blowing themselves up in a cinema packed with Nazi high command, including Hitler (Martin Wuttke) and his Minister for Propaganda, Goebbels (Sylvester Groth), who was also a real life film producer (leave it to Tarantino to uncover that nugget).But Pitt is here purely for marquee muscle. His screen time is minimal. And though he puts in a fine performance, impressing us with how long he can hold that constipation face, he does little else, except spouting a few lines of dialog which are far from Tarantino's most luscious work, trying to perfect a redneck drawl that sounds like it's coming from a guy who's making a constipation face.This movie belongs to Christoph Waltz.As SS officer Hans Landa, 'The Jew Hunter,' Waltz's chilling performance will make your testicles shrivel. Every foreboding appearance he makes as the death-dealing interrogator makes your sphincter tremble in fear. Landa knows when you're lying. And even if you're not, you feel like you are. Because you probably are. It is such a fearsome tour de force of fatal charisma and nerve-wracking trepidation, it's like Waltz did all his acting training with Goebbels.INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is unconventionally structured, in Four Chapters, four tenuously linked story lines eventually intertwining for the payoff. And what a payoff! A catharsis for Jewdom. DEFIANCE (2008) showed us Jews who actually fought back during World War II, in a story Inspired By Fact. But writer-director Tarantino, unbound by facts, rewrites history without any compunction (let's face it, like every American war movie about Viet Nam, Korea, WWII, only without pretending historical authenticity) and takes his WWII fantasy to a level that can only be described (by producer Lawrence Bender) as 'a Jewish wet dream.' It's the Nazis who burn now, not the Jews; it's the Nazis whose flesh is marked by the Jews as a sign of contempt; it's the Nazis who tremble at the brutality of the Jew 'basterds.' Movie opens like a Leone western, officer Landa inviting himself into a desolate farmhouse of a poor farmer and his trembling daughters. He is looking for Jews that the farmer might be hiding. The tension that follows is like the best of Leone, hard closeups of the two faces and master shots that never budge. We are so gripped by the movie in these opening minutes and into the following Chapters, we never even realize its unconventional structure. Proving that good story wins out every time over a Hollywood system atrophying in its glossy rut.It's like four TWILIGHT ZONE vignettes strung together; every time the screen goes to black to end a Chapter, we find ourselves exhaling in relief and needing a neck massage from a nude female provider slash dancer. And as every new Chapter opens, we are thrust spittle-mouthed and unbreathing into the tension-driven second act of something that started before we arrived. It's Total Tarantino.In the Chapter 'A German Night In Paris' we are introduced to MÃ©lanie Laurent, who plays Shoshanna, doing Clint Eastwood as a sexy French, blond, green-eyed avenger. (This is what Alison Eastwood, daughter of Clint, should have become, instead of the C-Movie junkie she ended up as.) Eli Roth is Donnie Donowitz, 'The Bear Jew,' who gets his kicks beating Germans to death with a baseball bat. (Roth is the writer-director of HOSTEL, 2005 - any wonder he loves the ultra-violence? In a German interview, when asked to justify his character's bloodthirstiness, he was outraged, 'This movie is nothing but magic tricks, but your grandparents turned my ancestors into furniture! Into lamp shades!') The characterizations are formidable, each actor embodying the French and German and British characters they play. Noteworthy is August Diehl (as Major Hellstrom), another German-born actor, who - like Karl-Otto Alberty and Anton Diffring before him - scares the hell out of us like a real life Gestapo officer. And Diane Kruger also impresses with her effortless bi-lingual German tongue.Being a Tarantino film, there's bound to be a scene where everyone is pointing a gun at everyone else. How Tarantino arrives at this situation is the true wonder; how it all makes perfect sense by the time everyone is pointing a gun at everyone else WHY everyone is pointing a gun at everyone else.INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is that rara avis - a dialog-driven war film more intense and exciting than any driven by pretty orange explosions.",9,2,8,26 July 2010
Underworld," Overwrought Underworld.
","Guns, Gore and Grrrrrls in growling leather.UNDERWORLD gives a shot in the arm, so to speak, to the vampire and werewolf iconographies, updating both to be in an ongoing millennia-aged war that is escalating, plopping them in modern day Europe (or somewhere with underground rail transport and rain that won't quit) with automatic weapons and computers. And leather.Selene (Kate Beckinsale, who would soon marry the director - luckiest man alive, Len Wiseman) is a vampire Death Dealer, with guns bigger than her acting abilities and leather so tight and curve-hugging my Carnal Nerve nocturnally emissioned. She's a lethal stalker and killer of werewolves (natch 'lycans' in sexy new street cred).Story is interesting twist on the legends, yet if you enjoy werewolf slash vampire movies, this may or may not be your cup of blood. You see, whereas all other werewolf and vampire movies have been correctly slotted into the horror genre, UNDERWORLD is an 'action' movie whose characters happen to be Vamps and Thropes. We're in THEIR world now, so their intrinsic alienness is the norm, rather than an anomaly. Movie can get on with the shooting and running and blood-fests as common occurrence between the two 'races' (just as any two given races on Earth at any given point in history will engage lovingly in shooting and running and blood-fests). Subsequently, dialog is childish, and action is filmed in that style that suddenly slams into slow motion to accentuate the flounce of capes and the thrill of tight butt-leather, with no meaning other than for the sake of capes flouncing and butt-leather bouncing.Latent werewolf, Michael (Scott Speedman) is bitten by a vampire - to breed a hybrid race that will win the war for the lycans, who are jealous that the vampires have such cool leather. Even though he's a trans-gender, Selene inexplicably falls for Michael. Because he's hot, I'm guessing. But vampire-werewolf love cannot be. So it is written in the ancient scrolls of the TV Guide. For advice on her love life, she calls on the Dr. Phil of vampires, their sleeping king, Viktor (Bill Nighy), who in hibernation looks like a zombie husk of a mummy, until he is revived by fresh blood, whereupon he looks like Bill Nighy (i.e. a zombie husk of a mummy).Casting Kate Beckinsale was not a mistake. Garbing her in such tight leather is. Because I am blinded to anything else when she is on screen. She is just too breathtakingly beautiful, too achingly sensual-- Those pointy incisors; those devil-blue eyes-- Look at that cutie go! Two-fisted gun barrels blazing, Hard Guy Overcoat flouncing, rain dripping pruriently from hand-grab spinner waist in leather-bound corset, spike-heeled boots and porcelain-creamy neck and-- Uh, what was the question again?--",7,5,9,21 July 2010
Amistad," Re-educating the slaves of perception.
","AMISTAD, one of the modern hammers to beat whitey upside the head for his past racism. No metaphors, no allegories, no analogies - this is straight up, in-ya-face, naked mea culpa racism for all the world to be ashamed at.Director Steven Spielberg's powerful, 'serious' AMISTAD suffers from the usual problem associated with 'Based On A True Story' movies - it simplifies Story until it is nowhere near the True it is supposedly Based On.There are many more complications in the actual True Story, but IN THE MOVIE: African slaves overrun their Cuban slave ship, La Amistad, and sail it off course in their attempt to get home. Captured by a United States naval ship, they are taken to an American port and treated like property until politicians and courts figure out their backstory.It is 1839 and the days of slavery are numbered - as we see many 'free-men' (blacks in positions of relative respect). So with none of the Africans able to speak a word in their defense, the legal fine print demanded the courts try to discern whether they were descendants of slaves (which would make them guilty of murder onboard Amistad) or kidnapped from Africa (which would justify their attempted escape). Yet they were held in prison - even though they technically stood outside the American legal system.It takes ex-president John Qunicy Adams to turn the provincial perceptions of American white folks to understanding that no matter their technical definition, in another land, these black folks were a free sovereign people; their detainment was not only moot, it was reprehensible.Djimon Housou is lead slave, Cinque, in the mandingo performance that shot him to international recognition. Matthew McConaughey is Baldwin, a young lawyer who initially treats Cinque's people as property (which is the right thing to do to win their case, in a blinkered court that cannot see them any other way), but he must relinquish the case to bigger guns. We would think this might be Morgan Freeman as Joadson (an African-American, heh, 'free-man'), but Freeman, usually a font of conscience, gravitas and bravura (or at the least, gritty voice-over) seems to do nothing in this movie except wander around in his big Batman coat. He cedes all his usual duties to Anthony Hopkins, as John Quincy Adams, who steals every scene (he is, after all, Anthony Hopkins!) and gives the final rousing, epic speech that Morgan Freeman just WISHED he could've done as a gritty voice-over.When Adams delves into the minds of the Africans, in particular, Cinque's conquering of a lion terrorizing his village, the audience and cast alike start to realize the fabric and depth of the people they have been holding; simultaneously driving home how dishonorable white law actually is. Cinque cannot disguise his ferocity towards the duplicity of white man legalities; he screams in his Mende language, spittle flying, fiery backdrop glazing his naked ebony: 'What kind of a place is this where you almost mean what you say? Where laws almost work? How can you live like that?!' (Philosophy for the men, naked ebony for the laydayz...) Before they are 'human' we are shown how these kidnapped people were treated onboard La Amistad - shackled in the hold of the ship, naked, fed gruel, adults trying to hold babies above the crush of bodies; when food runs low, twenty men and women shackled together are simply thrown overboard. It is horrifying.The visuals in AMISTAD are disturbing, the psychology even more so. The orchestra-swell happy ending does not signify only this winning case, it heralds a sea-change in the perception of those people who actually sat on the bench and owned slaves. The morality of denying a fellow human their rights was being realized. Anthony Hopkins makes the conscience bleed (while Morgan Freeman stews).And the triumph of AMISTAD is not that it portrays the horrors of slavery - a million movies do that - it liberates the modern audience from viewing slaves as one-dimensional peons. It does for our minds what Cinque shouts for his people in court: his shred of repeated English, an anguished, feral cry that shivers our souls: 'Give us, us free!'",9,1,4,20 November 2009
Coraline," Alice in Wonderland meets Alice Cooper.
","This movie scared the pants off me. Which in turn, scared young children and women with small hips, as I walked out of the theater, pantless.With CORALINE, the MPAA once again proves how little grasp it has in correlating asinine Ratings to actual content. Even as I entered this PG-13 '3D stop-motion' animated movie, there were lines around the block for the premier of the R-Rated Friday THE 13TH, yet I cannot imagine how axe-killing teens could be more chilling than a parallel world where people have sewed-on buttons for eyes! From a celebrated book by Neil Gaiman, director Henry Selick (director, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas) brings us this morbid tale of a cute little blue-haired girl who goes 'through the looking glass' (actually, she crawls through a small door in the wall) to a mirror world where her parents do not ignore her (like her real writer parents who are always hunched over computers), feed her delicious dinners (instead of glop), and lavish love on her (instead of what seems like barely tolerable babysitting). Everything is the same but opposite in this Other World - except her Other Mother and Other Father have buttons sewed on in place of eyes.That in itself is something out of a medieval torture tale. But it gets worse. Much worse. And by worse, I mean better.Coraline, the wide-faced, blue-haired girl, is voiced by Dakota Fanning, her parents, voiced by Teri Hatcher and 'the PC Guy,' John Hodgman. They move into a townhouse complex in the desolate country, where the neighbors define wacky (probably because they're so isolated in the first place); Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French (ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, dahling!) voice two frumpy old actresses with cute Corgis smoothly gliding about on feet covered by their long fur (who keep their dead Corgis stuffed on a shelf, dressed in angel wings); Ian McShane voices a stick-thin old circus performer with a beachball belly who rears performing mice. And Coraline meets a local boy with a terribly insecure stoop, Wyborn (Robert Bailey Jr.), whom she starts taunting darkly with her nickname, 'Why-Were-You-Born.' Coraline finds a doll in her new house that looks like her, except with buttons for eyes. She calls it Little Me, and its secret is revealed soon enough when Coraline discovers her eerie utopian mirror family.There are fantastical musical numbers in this Other World, an especially stunning piano interlude by Other Father (performed by John Linnell of They Might Be Giants).The ultimate 'crossing over' for Coraline would be to let her Other Mother sew buttons in place of her eyes!...CORALINE is not for little kids. Unless we ourselves have foisted on them so much vanilla for so long that we don't realize kids are actually intelligent enough to handle terrifying visions like a piano with hands holding a man's mouth shut to stop him from revealing secrets, a ringmaster's suit being animated by hostile rats from within, despairing ghost children trapped behind a mirror with missing eyes...The dark marvels come at us unrelenting, one amazing spectacle after another; it's not even 'darkly funny' - it's just freakin' DARK.This movie is apparently the first to be made with this new 3D Stop-Motion process. It is astounding to look at. This is not your LITTLE DRUMMER BOY stop-motion (1968, Rankin-Bass), or even Nick Park's superior WALLACE AND GROMIT (1989) - although an honorary mention must go to the man who made stop-motion an art form, Ray Harryhausen - CORALINE is smooth enough to be a 3D cartoon, yet retains that suggestion of jerkiness that lends it an organic feel. The use of lighting is amazing: shadows moving across a field as if clouds are passing in front of the sun, use of darkness and fog and three-dimensional background turning two-dimensional.We've been subjected to the advertising for so long that we imagine it's 'Tim Burton's' THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, but now we see the darkness might not have been all Burton's; it was Selick all along who brought the darkness to the celluloid that Tim Burton expressed on the written page.The parallels with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS are many: the talking cat, people trapped in mirrors and snow globes; the crazy characters having tea, a wicked matriarch, a grin sewn onto a boy's face... even the clever trick of Coraline's name (reverse two letters, it is 'Caroline')...But it's the parallels with Alice Cooper that are the reason why I need to go back through the looking glass to find my pants.--Review by Poffy the Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,4,11,19 February 2009
Iron Man 2," Jumping the Stark.
","The first IRON MAN movie was a planet-crusher. IRON MAN 2, well, maybe it could crush a small moon or something. It's still a full-fledged, fun-filled ferrous romp, but, like all superhero sequels, suffers from cramming us with characters and classic story lines in its desperate need to impress. My hole feels stretched. Not in that good way either.IRON MAN 2 opens in exhilaration: over AC/DC's Shoot To Thrill, Iron Man jets through night skies over city lights, camera/we on his steel shoulders, feeling the weight of the armor, the gut-thumping power of the afterburners in his boots, inhaling the burning breeze as he plummets like a missile into a packed amphitheater, landing onstage in a pose that can only be described as THOOM! You don't applaud an entrance like that. You throw panties.Machines clack his costume off his body as an Iron Chick chorus line (in tiny faux-metal undies) dances behind him. Billionaire playboy Tony Stark emerges (Robert Downey Jr., once again bringing his breezy brio) to open the Stark Technology Expo.Half a world away, in a dank Russian lab with no windows, Ivan Vanko (scary Mickey Rourke, body-tatted like Motley Crue and still pumped from his WRESTLER role like a balloon float gone awry) plots revenge on Stark for Stark's dad stealing tech ideas from Ivan's dad. He becomes supervillain Whiplash and scares everyone by carving Tony's racing car in half with his electric whips and showing off his puffy muscles.Everyone wants a piece of the Iron. Garry Shandling, excellent as a snide congressman, impotently orders Stark - who doesn't take him seriously - to turn over the Iron Man technology to the military; while sleazy Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the government's tech bitch, tries to duplicate the armor for military use, i.e. killing. (Of what other use is the military?) Hammer allies with Whiplash to unleash an army of robots which ultimately keeps the effects team up all night rendering CGI Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's military liaison and best friend. And gets to kick ass as the heavily-armed 'second Iron Man' called War Machine.Stark's power source has been updated from the comic books: he used to plug into the wall like a regular old toaster, but here he has power cells that click into his chest piece - the same chest piece which keeps his heart beating yet is killing him softly through blood toxicity. Desperately seeking a cure, Stark nonetheless becomes fatalistic and bequeaths Stark Industries to his blond helper Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, forever pining after the playboy she will never have), and stumbles upon the alcoholism plot point very conveniently.And this is where the film stumbles as well. In the Marvel comicbook series, serious plot arcs like alcoholism gestate and develop over weeks or months ('Demon in a Bottle' was first published in 1979, then Stark fell off the wagon proper in 1983, forcing James Rhodes to don the Iron Man armor, precipitating War Machine), lending the story gravitas and 'realism.' While in IRON MAN 2, Stark goes lush, Rhodey croaks the damning key line, 'You don't deserve the suit!' and commandeers the War Machine armor all in a few hot minutes, making it seem, well - ironically - like a comicbook. Or at least what people think comicbooks are - shallow, vacuous and unrealistic.I wrestled for a long time with the problem of why IRON MAN 2 is not as effective, not as compelling a film as the first one, and I realized: this A-list feature film falls into the shark-jumping phenomenon of the Cousin Oliver Syndrome - introducing new characters to replace well-worn ones. But this is only the second IRON MAN movie - we haven't yet grown bored of the original characters! And none of them have aged enough to look as bloated as Cindy Brady.Shark-Jumping: younger, sexier assistant in the form of Natasha (Scarlett Johanssen); a second Iron Man (War Machine); Avengers Initiative foreshadowing at every turn; Sam Jackson as Nick Fury, with so few lines of exposition they could have been said by anyone on a smaller salary; Captain America's shield; Thor's mighty Mjolnir, post-credits; 50 other Iron Men flying around making my CGI nerve twitch.I'm sick of them telling me that I'm sick of characters - when I'm not! I would have loved more scenes with Sam Rockwell spouting his inimitable patter; would have relished more turbo-charges like the opening flying scene and what we wouldn't give for more Russian-tainted cheese with mighty Mickey and his puffy muscles! The climactic battle between Whiplash and the two iron men is robbed of its impact by having to put Mickey Rourke into an Iron Suit and then on top of that ignominy, to have him remove his mask so that we can see him (the Spider-Man Mask-Removing Syndrome - ensure the ignorant audience knows who is behind the mask and then ensure the dumb dumb dumb audience can see the emotions on his face).Movie ends with a true metal song, with a true metal singer - Bon Scott's true AC/DC, Highway To Hell.Despite its overwrought overpandering, from its titanium thunderware to its tiny metal underwear, IRON MAN 2 delivers, but says nothing we haven't heard before in loud metal clanks.",7,0,2,30 December 2010
12 Monkeys," 'Brazil' meets 'Back To The Future'
","Like BACK TO THE FUTURE II with Biff in charge forever.Another Terry Gilliam dystopian vision, 12 MONKEYS (inspired by French short film LA JETÃE and modeled after Gilliam's own inimitable BRAZIL), is a claustrophobic, strangling, time-paradox action stunner; like all Gilliam's films, it's also completely off the rails.A subterranean Orwellian Earth culture in the year 2035 sends a prisoner back in time to observe and report on, and perhaps stop the spread of, a human-created virus that killed 90% of life on the surface.Bruce Willis is prisoner James Cole, serving his government overlords by being sent back to 1996, the time in Earth history that the alleged 'Army of the 12 Monkeys' supposedly released the virus. Cole ends up getting sent back time and again, either years too early or too late, often meeting psychologist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) and then being dragged Back To The Future, as it were, and becoming ever more dazed and hallucinatory as to what is real, what is memory, what is past, what is future, and what the hell Brad Pitt is doing.Brad Pitt is Jeffrey, who meets Cole in an insane asylum (in an extended sequence that obviously builds on the primal fear created in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST - that of being sane and accused of being otherwise with no way to prove it). Jeffrey may be connected with the Army of the 12 Monkeys or may just be a twitchy wacktologist. Pitt is a keg of dynamite, frenetically showcasing a mad dog performance, his pretty face a carnival monster here through his own contortions and his crazy-eye. Alongside Willis's characteristic underplaying, Pitt is like an explosion in a German cheese factory.David Morse is one of the ominous future scientists; Frank Gorshin (The Riddler from the 1960's BATMAN) is a doctor in the asylum, and Christopher Plummer makes an appearance as Jeffrey's millionaire dad.The only performance lacking is that of Madeline Stowe as the confused psychologist, who aids Cole in his quest to reveal the 12 Monkeys insurrectionist group. With Willis and Pitt and every day player conveying the film's sense of Damoclean doom, Stowe cannot embrace the necessary gravitas required for her integral role. She becomes more a plot device than a character - the person who fills in information for Cole when he needs to know the year or a street name. (Some A-List director or movie exec once described Madeline Stowe's beauty: 'Even if she opened her legs, you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off her face.' Wow, what a compliment!... I think. Praising a woman's beauty by invoking visions of her open labia. Well, if she's proving such a lazy actor, I guess she's still got her face and labia to fall back on.) To outline the story's beautiful circular construction would be to reveal too much; suffice to say that Cole remembers, as a boy, seeing a melee at an airport, a lady screaming, a man gunned down. His future will be inextricably linked with these events time and again. And the desolate soundtrack (by Paul Buckmaster) complements well the grim story of a man forever manipulated into a tragic time-loop.12 MONKEYS is rife with interesting ideas, such as Railly's lecture on prophets actually being time travelers; dÃ©jÃ  vu, in which a future event is 'remembered' by Railly and Cole as it happens to them; the Christ mythos, in the form of James Cole (J.C. huh?) who sacrifices his life for the salvation of humanity...Under different circumstances, the title theme would be considered a quirky, cute accordion line, rather than evoking a disturbing monkey jumping around on your brain.Does your minkey bayt?",8,0,2,22 July 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Shiver me fey timbers.
","Johnny Depp as some kind of transvestite, in a swinging, swordfighting fey-quest over the high seas of The Caribbean, with Orlando Bloom as his blacksmith girlfriend, and Geoffrey Rush as a grumpy old man in a Halloween pirate costume. Keira Knightley's square man-jaw causes untold distraction; Jonathan Pryce gads about in a wig slightly smaller than Dee Snider's hair during the Stay Hungry tour, and Jack Davenport tries to take it all seriously, for which I'm sure everyone laughed at him behind his back.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is as entertaining as it is ambitious, as rollicking as it is ridiculous, as boyish-action-movie as it is gender-bendingly-ambiguous.Supposedly based on the boring Disneyland boat ride of the same name - without all the gender bending - if anyone ever has this much fun on that dank, irritating boat ride, I'll eat my triangular hat. Somehow, Disney's accursed homogenizing hand could not stultify this film's pure adrenalin bumrush.Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, who rocketed out of left field with his mascara on overdrive and his personality on sideways; he alone imbues this movie with its unique charm. For some reason, his aggressive effeteness lends an authenticity to the swashbuckling that none of the other 'Halloween pirate' performances can. His drunken, insouciant braggadocio drives the film like a 1st rate Ship-of-the-line, beating to windward, guns blazing (and I do mean 'blazing').Matter of fact, there were secret talks held with the Oxford English Dictionary on whether to replace Anthony Hopkins's picture with Depp's, next to the meaning of the word 'fey.' Filmed in the Caribbean (St. Vincent and the Windward Islands of the Grenadines), PIRATES somehow avoids looking anything like the Caribbean. Must be that homogenizing Disney touch.Geoffrey Rush is aye-me-hearties Captain Barbossa who stole Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl, which Sparrow spends the whole movie trying to steal back.Keira Knightley is Elizabeth Swann, daughter to the Governor (Jonathan Pryce), betrothed to a stoic British Commodore (Jack Davenport), but in love with Jack's girlfriend, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom).Director Gore Verbinski frames Knightley's opening shot from an angle that makes her look busty, rather than her sad reality of being flatter than the Earth Before Columbus.Her pancake ironing board pecs are probably the reason that with all the kidnapping she undergoes by pirates, not one of them thinks to drag her into the hold and rape her - they must think she's a skinny boy. And since none of them are Catholic priests, she's not considered sexual property.It looks very eerie cinematically, but with all those holes in the sails, how does the Black Pearl ever sail? Oh, that's right, she's supernatural. Then why does she 'sail' at all? Why engage in a 'chase' to 'catch up' to the Commodore's ship? Why not just appear alongside in one fell swoop? For once, the work of four writers looks justified (Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, Jay Wolpert) with the wealth of ideas on screen. Bold, brash, criminal adventure, involving Aztec blood amulets, hidden treasure, lots of yo-ho-ho barrels of rum, double-crosses and triple-crosses (Sparrow: 'Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly') and fencing the likes of which we haven't seen since Basil Rathbone and Errol Flynn (which does get tiresome when everyone is fencing for no reason, i.e. if you can't kill each other by fencing - due to being supernatural beings - why bother?) Bouncy-bouncy music by Hans Zimmer, moving us like the shifting deck of a schooner: coy, ominous, frolicsome, and rope-swinging-across-chasms epic, transporting us out into the salty breeze and briny seas - or at least to a water tank in San Francisco.I'm sure the PIRATES movie has made the Disney ride infinitely more popular - though no less boring.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,1,3,3 January 2010
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The Lyin,' the Snitch and the Whored Road.
","Four bloodless, pasty-white British kids on an adventure in a magical wardrobe.Set during WWII, young teen and pasty Brit, Peter Pevensie (William Moseley) and his younger, pastier siblings, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, discover a wormhole in a wardrobe, leading to a land of eternal winter and constant special effects called Narnia. Two factions battle in this land (where every animal speaks English and is either CGI, or a human in heavy makeup): 'good' animals pander to Aslan the Christ-y Lion (voice of Liam Neeson, who does more acting as this lion's pixels than in all his screen time on PHANTOM MENACE), and 'bad' animals aid the White Witch (Tilda Swinton, badly in need of a boyfriend or a vibrator).The pasty Brit kids join Aslan, except for Edmund (Skandar Keynes), who is tempted to the side of the White Witch with Turkish Delight. (If there was any more evidence needed as to how infrequently these pasty kids get out in the sun or get out of the house at all, I think that Turkish Delight scam should tell you all you need to know.) Also starring James McEvoy as Mr. Tumnus the Faun, James Cosmo as Father Christmas, Rupert Everett as a Fox, Jim Broadbent as Professor Kirke, and Ray Winstone as The Beaver (yes, I meant it to sound like that).There are spectacular sights in CHRONICLES - centaurs and moving statues and mythical muscled beasts - which will no doubt entice the kids, but the messages of good versus evil come across loud and unclear. Just like a Disney movie on steroids, the contradictions and all the insufferable prophesy just make us feel stupid and dirty and insulted.For example, Edmund constantly betrays his siblings, yet is brought back into the fold after Aslan gives him a stern talk. We don't hear the conversation, but we'd like it to go something like, 'You do this again and I will rip your limbs from your torso and make you watch me bitchslap you with your own limp wrist!' but we know it would be closer to, 'That was very bad, Edmund!' No lessons learned in earning absolution, or even getting the snot kicked out of you as retribution for being an utter Benedict Arnold.It is no secret that author C.S. Lewis was an indoctrinated insane person, i.e. someone who believed fervently in Christianity. So no surprise when Aslan gets all allegorical and sacrifices his life for the sins of others - and is resurrected. How very Jesus of him. And then there's Santa Claus - the OTHER Jesus.Father Christmas (called 'Christmas' even though Christ never visited Narnia) bequeaths the Brit kids weapons, even though his credo is 'War is an ugly affair.' Thanks, Santa - leave the hardware and sod off! When Christmas hands an archery set to Susan (Anna Popplewell), and she asks, 'What happened to 'War is an ugly affair'? he just chuckles and changes the subject! Piling stupidity on stupidity, these 'magic' weapons supposedly 'work every time,' so why does Susan bother 'getting in some practice' with them? And if they are NOT magic, getting in ten minutes of practice is not going to save your pasty British arse.But we find that standards are pretty low out here in Narnia - all it takes for Peter to be knighted by Aslan is for a wolf to jump at him and for his sword to be in the way. Suddenly he's 'Sir Peter Wolfsbane.' Now... if the weapons are magical, then what credit should Peter take for the sword killing a wolf? These kids don't earn one whit of their 'battle' experience, yet they are lauded throughout the story as prophesied saviors of Narnia.How come, in any prophesy-heavy fiction (REVENGE OF THE SITH, LORD OF THE RINGS, The King James Bible), no one ever admits to a prophesy being unfulfilled, thereby proving what a load of bunkum it is? The fact that the White Witch's wolves speak the King's English makes them less scary. It means they can be reasoned with. That doesn't seem to stop the kids doing one stupid thing after another: in an effort to stop an ice floe from melting, Peter stabs his sword into the ice to use as a handhold - but wouldn't stabbing the ice make it split exactly where he stabbed it? Instead, they all hold onto this lever and ride the rapids away from the wolves.When they exit the freezing river, Peter, who was holding onto little Lucy by her jacket, now only holds her jacket and has lost Lucy. Susan looks at Peter and cries out, 'What have you done?!' as if he meant to lose her on purpose. While I'm busy looking at Susan, all wet and cold, looking pretty damn hot - in a stuck-up, Catholic School kinda way.Silliness continues to the end of the movie, director Andrew Adamson hoping he can sweep it under the banner of 'kid's movie' and throwing action battle at us like beaver at a strip club. But like Disney's debacles, the treacle runs so thick it will choke children on unreality before they can enter the real world, wholly unprepared to be choked by its reality.Like LEAVE IT TO BEAVER with better special effects. And actual beavers.---Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,1,1,22 August 2009

","'Ooh, look out, you rock and rollers! Pretty soon now you're gonna get older.' --David Bowie, Changes. Even though THE ROCKER is about a middle-aged rock drummer who sees a second stab at fame with his young nephew's band, it is mostly for nerds who need to get laid by pretending to be rock stars. Rainn Wilson, fresh from his stint on Steve Carell's inferior-to-Gervais's THE OFFICE, does a bang-up job as drummer Robert 'Fish' Fishman, whose 70s hair-band, Vesuvius, cracked superstardom soon after they kicked Fish out of the band. The opening scene of Fish being sacked is unnaturally funny (featuring Fred Armisen - 'Obama' on Saturday Night Live - as the bassist in Vesuvius), its over-the-top lunacy promising a film that laughs in the face of arena rock and loogies on the Aquanetted hair of fame. Instead, THE ROCKER turns down the volume as if the neighbors are complaining. Twenty years after his sacking, Fish is jobless, living in his sister's attic (near Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), watching bitterly as Vesuvius is on everyone's playlist with yet another chart-topping album. Fish finds an outlet for his hair-metal flamboyance and inappropriate nakedness in his nephew's band, A.D.D. - who ask him to drum for them out of desperation only to find their boring GenX style does not quite mesh with Fish's energy and excitability.A.D.D., led by Fish's nephew, dork keyboardist Matt (Josh Gad), is a study in everything wrong with kids today in bands, i.e. they don't have a clue. (Did I just say, 'kids today'? How old must I be to say that with impunity?) And it hurts my skull how it is so obvious the film-makers (director Peter Cattaneo and writers, Maya Forbes, Wallace Wolodarsky and Ryan Jaffe) don't have a clue on how to make these youngsters seem like they have a clue. Without turning on PlayStation 3. Keep BBRRETENDING, kids - wait until you get onstage and find out you can't watch a TV screen and press buttons to make music; wait until you realize you have to learn songs and practice to make a band go; wait until there's a crowd staring blankly at you and you have to ad-lib something off the top of your head; wait until you put your mouth to a mic attached to a real P.A. and it picks up every breath, every subtle missed note, every nuance, every pop and sssibilance sibilanccce...At least the movie represents that it's hard to get a gig. Because it is. And the band only score a national tour through a chance YouTube debacle involving The Naked Drummer. Rainn Wilson can really play his drums, so looks comfortable behind a kit onstage, and I would wager he's beaten the boards in his share of star-grasping bands; yet none of the other players are worth throwing tomatoes at: lead guitarist/ songwriter/ vocalist, Curtis (Teddy Geiger) is a real-life artist, but never puts his mouth close enough to the mic onstage to obscure his pretty face for the director; Josh Gad drives keyboardists down dweeb highway back into the dork ages, with his useless miming and gutless personality; and bassist Amelia (Emma Stone, SUPERBAD) channels Tia Carrera from WAYNE'S WORLD with her faux-picking and arbitrary non-chords on the bass neck, while completely forgetting she's on Earth only to look hot and procreate, not pretend to have talent. Christina Applegate is already a MILF! (The shelf-life of women as hotties is so short! And Sean Connery is still man-meat!) She's Fish's love interest - the mom who improbably falls for the shiftless hooligan who refuses to grow up for no reason other than the script says so. A remixed, meaty version of Twisted Sister's I Wanna Rock heralds the start of the band's road trip, which culminates in a big concert supporting Fish's old band, Vesuvius, who are now so successful they speak in British accents. A.D.D. goes onstage as a support act with the full lightshow - since when have asshole headliner road crews been so supportive?THE ROCKER touches briefly on its promise in many places - it's at least as enjoyable as watching Poison have arguments onstage - but delivers a sappy ending that ruins every promise of comedy, reality and faith in humankind. With lame, angst-ridden GenX songs ten years too late to be fashionable, there is every indication A.D.D. are on their way to superstardom - because the script says so.Fish gets the MILF, the dork keyboardist gets his virgin organ smoked, and guitarist Curtis falls for bassist Amelia, as if they are some kind of soul-mate pairing, rather than the high maintenance headache Curtis has just derailed his career with. I can see the long road head: he spends time writing in his studio, she complains she has needs; he screws her every night, she complains he only wants sex; a groupie looks at him sideways, she won't talk to him for a week; he doesn't look at other girls, she complains he is too attached to her; he writes a song with another girl's name in it, she refuses to play it; he pays all the bills, she gripes she feels like a prostitute; they go dutch, she whines that a 'real man' would pay for everything; he wants to go on tour, she wants to have kids...This ain't rock and roll. This is - genocide!",5,0,2,27 March 2009
Public Enemies," Small time crooks painted larger than the criminals in any given corporation.
","An insipid telling of the fast life and crooked times of America's first Public Enemy Number 1, John Dillinger.PUBLIC ENEMIES makes all the right moves, with all the right stars wearing all the right hardguy overcoats, but it somehow lacks grip.Set in the 1930's Chicago crimewave during the Great Depression, movie opens with John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) breaking his pals out of jail (back in the day when a hoodlum could pose as a guard bringing in Dillinger, then both take the jail by storm - an idea obviously stolen from 'a long time ago' when a wookiee infiltrated a Death Star prison the same way).Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is the lawman assigned to bring down Dillinger, using all the new-fangled technological methods like telephones and cars. Billy Crudup is heinous warlock J. Edgar Hoover, who started the Federal Investigation Bureau, so that police could chase bad guys like Dillinger across state lines.From the book by Bryan Burrough, 'Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34,' directed by Michael Mann (LAST OF THE MOHICANS, THE INSIDER), PUBLIC ENEMIES dutifully goes through the paces of Dillinger's bank robberies (back when it could be done with three men in hardguy overcoats, big hats, and getaway car with lots of posing space on the running boards) and just as dutifully shows Purvis chasing Dillinger with his coterie of Keystone Cops. Neither Depp nor Bale create anything memorable with their characterizations, dialog or posedowns on running boards.PUBLIC ENEMIES makes the same mistake as American GANGSTER - it makes the criminal too sexy to envision as an anti-social thug. Dillinger was notoriously popular and a charmer, but the man was also a sociopath. In a scene lifted from one of Dillinger's real life breakouts, he uses a plastic gun and manhandles each successive guard past each gate in such a way that none of them discover his ruse until he raids the gun rack for real guns. A man with that kind of force of will and resolve would have something really dangerous inside him that would override his charm. To look upon him would be to fear him. Yet how can we fear Jack Sparrow? While J. Edgar Hoover declares Dillinger the very first Public Enemy #1, the rest of the world is declaring him The Sexiest Man Alive.Dillinger's heyday was in a transitional age, when physical bankrobbers like himself were slowly being overtaken by virtual bankrobbers. Phil D'Andrea plays a mob bookie whose telephone exchange brought in as much during a day as Dillinger could steal from one bank. Which should make one rethink the title of Burroughs's book - America's Greatest Crime Wave was not during the early '30s, it is now: AIG, Lehman Brothers, The Bush Klan and the Savings and Loan Scandal, et al...Dillinger's friends - scattered around the country in safe houses and brothels - deserted him as the heat was turned up under him. The world crept away from Dillinger in the space of a short lifetime.Dillinger takes a floosie (Marion Cotillard) as his squeeze and she seems to relish the life of worry of a gangster's moll. We never really connect with her until the film's last moments when Dillinger sends his last words, 'Bye bye, Blackbird.' Delivered by Stephen Lang, in a small role that packs that last emotional punch.His final moments, Dillinger watches Clark Gable in MANHATTAN MELODRAMA delivering sage advice from the screen, 'Die the way you lived - all of a sudden - don't drag it out. Living like that doesn't mean a thing.' After spending 10 years in jail from age 19, it is a wonder how Dillinger's rep grew so fast into the blaze of glory it would become. And he went out the same way he lived: sexy.",6,0,0,13 July 2010
Madagascar," Mad at Gascar
","There is a conceptual flaw baked into the fabric of *Madagascar* that ruins all its enjoyable moments and good intentions.The action is loud, slapstick, colorful and Â unless you are eight Â generally unfunny. But the lemurs are hilarious and the penguins are priceless.A lion, a zebra, a hippopotamus and a giraffe are best friends at the Manhattan Zoo. The zebra dreams of frolicking free in Africa, the others revel in their star status at the Zoo (except the hypochondriac giraffe, who, being a hypochondriac, doesn't enjoy much, but is nonetheless more fulfilled being a hypochondriac IN the zoo than OUT of it).Once again in a 3D cartoon, *real* voice-over talent is slighted in favor of marquee stars (Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith and David Schwimmer as the above animals), who provide the necessary box office clout to divert the audience's attention from this movie's ignorant evolutionary gaffes.Through events that can only be described in these vapid kiddie vehicles as 'wacky,' the four friends soon find themselves crated on a barge to Africa. They fall overboard and wash ashore in Madagascar (which they refer to as The Wild Â a dig at Disney's upcoming film of the same name? - featuring both a lion and giraffe in lead roles as well). Missing his regular Zoo steaks, the lion reverts to his instinctual carnivorous state, regarding his best pal, the zebra, as lunch.THIS - my dear puritans and fundamentalists, concerned parents and animal activists - is called Nature.THIS - is the movie's baked-in flaw, for the zebra was fantasizing 'freedom,' but upon his friend the lion attaining that freedom, the film missteps in the other direction entirely, treating the lion's carnivorism as a *regress*, a relapse, rather than a reversion (or uplifting) to a natural state; an undesirable condition, like alcoholism or mental incapacitation, rather than his genetic heritage. The lion even refers to himself as a 'monster' for wanting to eat the zebra.But he would be a 'monster' in the true evolutionary sense (i.e. a deviant) if he did NOT want to eat the zebra.The zebra consoles, 'You're NOT a monster!' But his consolation is for the wrong reasons! The zebra believes that the lion's friendship towards him will win out over the somehow UN-natural state of regarding him as prey.So even though the lion is now complying with his niche in nature more so than he ever did when friendly with the ungulate, we are force-fed the attitude that killing live prey and eating meat is tantamount to eating your friends.Of course, kids watching this herbivorist bigotry readily accept its validity because they do not equate those plastic-wrapped, square-shaped steaks from the grocery store as murdered animals. Disguised behind industry and packaging, our society conveniently forgets what we ourselves consume for sustenance. Meat: dead animal flesh! And the hypocrisy of this cartoon is perpetuated without any irony at all. And without any realization that it's hypocrisy.This movie's obnoxious message against the life and death relationship we all share with every other creature on earth has become acceptable simply because of its ubiquity, not through any logic or common sense. The lion needs the nutrients supplied by the zebra's flesh to live Â if he does not eat what his metabolism has evolved to process for energy, he is going to die. And his species would not have made it this far if they were all this genetically attuned against the Circle of Life.Yes, I hear the peanut gallery, with hands over their children's ears, yelling, 'Lighten up! This bollacks is merely entertainment!' Granted there are entertaining vignettes: head penguin, Skipper (voiced by co-director, Tom McGrath, sounding uncannily like Billy West doing *Futurama*'s Zapp Brannigan doing Phil Hartman) is a scream orchestrating his military maneuvers; Sasha Baron Cohen steals the movie voicing king lemur, Julian (sounding uncannily like Robin Williams doing Peter Sellers doing an Indian) and offering a tiny supercute lemur up as constant scapegoat. But the hypocrisy and paradox in this movie are at odds with its own story and plot.Either the lion knew all along that he was suppressing his urges to dine on the zebra through friendship, or he should never realize it. His succumbing to instinct and then being regarded as a deviant displays the highest form of ignorance in the film-makers (writers Mark Burton, Billy Frolick, Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath; directed by Darnell and McGrath).A few stupid men annul this four-billion-year-old planet's circle of life, and those who purport to love the Earth (especially in this faddish new *zeitgeist* of politically-motivated faux-concern over global warming) reveal their intrinsic contempt for the planet in blindly accepting the twisted message in this movie.In a final act of turning carnivores into pansies, the penguins solve the lion's lunch problem by preparing sushi for him. Whereas in *Finding Nemo* (2003) all the fish were as cognizant and sentient as the mammals in *Madagascar*, in Madagascar, apparently - they're just sushi.",3,6,8,16 April 2007
Balls of Fury," Kung Fu Ping Pong Panda
","BALLS OF FURY is not about ping pong. It's about Being a Man. It's about Honor. It's about uplifting the Human Spirit with--ah, who am I kidding? It IS about ping pong.Starring Dan Fogler, George Lopez, Maggie Q, and the guy who does the second best Christopher Walken impersonation in the world â Christopher Walken (dressed like a geisha slut and sporting a 'do more audacious than Gary Oldman's in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula).Walking that fine comedy line just above Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell, BALLS OF FURY is so wilfully asinine it succeeds.Directed by Robert Ben Garant and written by Garant and Thomas Lennon (renowned for his Officer Dangle on TV's RENO 911, with a penchant for wearing tourniquet-tight shorts) BALLS is a journey deep into the dark heart of underground ping ponging, where Feng (Walken) gathers the best players from around the world to take part in a sudden death (literally) competition for--well, I don't think the plot-writers got further than that.Lopez is the FBI 'Secret Agent Man' who enlists the aid of ping pong prodigy and Def Leppard fan, Randy Daytona (Fogler, a child star now grown lazed and portly on Vegas matinees) to infiltrate Feng's operation and nab him - for what, I still can't remember.Excellent performances (especially from Fogler) and a highly stupid script keeps BALLS on its toes: James Hong as the blind mentor; Jason Scott Lee as a fried-furious kung fu antagonist; Diedrich Bader as a fruity courtesan, Thomas Lennon as a wild-eyed German champion who's wardrobe choices somehow emulate Officer Dangle's - hip-hugging leotards and shorts so tourniquet-tight we can see his balls of fury.",6,0,0,12 September 2008
Spider-Man 2," Spider Sense-tingling.
","Grander, faster, slicker than its predecessor, director Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 is more action-packed, more thrill-rided, more rollercoastered than Spiderman (2002) - but though its plaudits stretch skyscraper tall, its demerits run Mariana Trench deep.Based loosely on the comicbook episode Spiderman No More, plot finds Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina, in strapping scenery-chewing mien) 'tampering in God's domain' (as they used to say in 50s B-Movies) trying to subvert the Second Law of Thermodynamics (as they should be saying now, if it weren't for science riding backseat to Jamaican 'psychics' and George W. Bush's mongoloid church administration - the second law being that you can't get more energy out of a system than you put into it).Of course, everything goes to hell with big explosions and 'Doc Ock' natchelly ends up a supervillain - with four steel-belted, evil arms fused to his inner Manson.And Spidey must save the day.But Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), perpetually mooning over Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst's Breasts), experiences a psychosomatic loss of powers and renounces his web-slinging in favor of the geek life. Thus - Spiderman No More.It is only when Doc Ock threatens his breasty bimbo that he realizes he must reconcile his inner freak with his outer geek.Overall, Spiderman 2 sells its product, but falls down in niggly details: Peter loses his job as a pizza delivery guy because he couldn't make good on a '29 Minute Guarantee' - but what kind of insane, coke-addled pizza parlor would make that kind of guarantee over a 42-block radius in the heart of New York City?; Doc Ock robs banks to buy the components for his evil machine - but why not grab a supervillain nut (whilst cutting out the middle man) and simply STEAL the parts? Visual clichÃÂ©s to grind your teeth by: Peter at a high-class soiree, having every last hors d'oeuvre picked out from under him (it worked for Peter Sellers); bride running through streets in slomo (it worked for Julia Roberts); shot of Spiderman costume hanging decoratively out of a trashcan (worked as a comicbook cover - lame as a live action); there is even a grandiose 'Noooooo!' scene with Doc Ock - this movie has everything! And can we stop with the screaming? That convention of B-Movie Screaming Damsel is now officially getting on my nerves. From hospital nurses to hot chicks, from Mary-Jane to Aunt May - every woman in Spiderman 2 screams exactly the same way; whether a flat-bellied model or Peter's septuagenarian aunt, they all somehow capture that identical frequency of high-pitched, nerve-fraying, cochlear irritation. And frankly, I'm sick of it! Who screams that way in real life? If I were to become a superhero by some freakish radioactive ferret bite to the buttocks, and I had to save some supermodel damsel in distress, I'd insist she cease that confounded insensate shrieking if she valued her taut, Body-by-Jake ass.And Spiderman takes his mask off too much. Why? Because he can't emote through the fabric. When his powers fail, it is more effective to pull off the mask and look dumbfounded than let the mask tilt its head and say, 'Huh?' And how much more effective to stop a train, mask-less, straining with neck-bulging effort, rather than letting his round-headed alter-ego smoothly halt it? That astounding train sequence. The thought and detail that went into that scene rivals that of any movie ever made - so many minute details all working together to create a breath-stopping experience - and plausible, in that world where these super beings live. As just one example of those thousands of details - when Spiderman smashes out through the train windows sideways, he shoots his web with both hands back at the body of the train and pulls himself back onto the side of the moving train.Unlike the Batman movies, we always see Spiderman CLEARLY - especially in the elevator (riding with Queer as Folk's Hal Sparks, a real life comics aficionado in a riotous cameo).Spiderman's theme - that horn line, which always makes me stifle a tear - is epic in its sweeping poignancy, tastefully regal, a superhero's theme. And the web-swinging tears the breath from your lungs with its breakneck daredevilry.Peter reveals his identity to Mary-Jane in the most auspicious of heroic deeds - he holds up a building that is about to topple on her. Isn't it every schoolboy's fantasy to meet a girl that way? And I love that his head is the exact, correct roundness.",7,0,1,7 January 2008
The Fifth Element," Slammin', Glammin' and Hammin'.
","*The Fifth Element* has spawned so many negative reviews (even whilst admitting to enjoying it) that I get the feeling critics are jealous that Euros can pull off an action blockbuster with as much brainless flair as Americans Â with twice the guilty pleasure.In a future society realized in eye-fatiguing detail by writer/director Luc Besson, a race of aliens who are half Guardians of the Universe and half turtle, entrust a secret to generations of humans Â four carved stones representing the four elements of Water, Fire, Earth and Air, which, when combined with a mysterious Fifth Element, will keep Ultimate Evil at bay. This Ultimate Evil apparently threatens the Earth every 500 years, the most recent attack being in 1987 when Jethro Tull won the Grammy for Best Heavy Metal Album.Never mind that of the 116 confirmed elements, the fifth element is boron (its atomic number being 5, denoting it has 5 protons in the atom's nucleus Â sorry, I forgot the majority of people still believe in angels and astrology and in superstitions dating from 500 BC which identified only four elements that constitute the cosmos Â didn't mean to bring SCIENCE into a fiction based on scienceÂ), in a world where supermodel Milla Jovovich fights evil whilst being 96-percent naked, I'll run with her being the Fifth Element.It's up to THE SLAMMIN' Bruce Willis, playing Korben Dallas playing Bruce Willis, an ex-army, devil-may-care flying-cab driver, to keep nekkid alien Leeloo (Jovovich) out of danger and out of clothes. Hitching a ride to Planet Phloston Â for seemingly no reason other than to flex Digital Domain's special effects muscles - he must battle aliens that look like bulldogs, put his hand into the innards of a singer who looks like a vacuum cleaner and try to avoid - THE GLAMMIN' Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), an interstellar DJ who looks like a transsexual Chris Rock.Then there's THE HAMMIN' Gary Oldman: he's done a junkie Pistol, he's done a gay playwright, he's done a deaf Austrian composer, he's done a blood-drinking undead version of Brad Pitt; here, he is Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, an interstellar black market arms dealer with a Bible Belt drawl Â is there anything this actor can't do? To bring about the end of existence as we know it, The Ultimate Evil must work through Zorg's company, for which Zorg charges the usual agent's fee of 10-percent. 10-percent of the end-of-existence-as-we-know-it works out to about Canada.Even though the mysticism of a prophecy engines this movie's plot, Besson has unabashedly crafted a popcorn-and-bullets action-adventure comedy and obviously regards it as such, never for an instant threatening to tread philosophical, scientific or preachy ground; paradoxes, non-science, plot holes and cheap neoperene monster makeup flying hither and thither.There's something for all three sexes here: Korben Dallas for the ladies, Leeloo for the guys and Ruby Rhod for the girly-men.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",7,10,17,12 July 2006
127 Hours," Arm-ageddon.
","It's primal fear time.Betcha when Aron Ralston started his canyon hike that Saturday morning, he didn't think that by 10 a.m. he'd be swimming in a subterranean cavern with two hot chicks, that by Wednesday he'd be drinking his own urine and that by Thursday he'd be carving his own arm off...127 HOURS is the intense shock-rock account of how young adventure-seeker and canyoneer Ralston (James Franco) got his right hand and forearm trapped under a rock in Blue John Canyon near Moab, Utah in April 2003, having not told anyone where he was going, and of how he survived for five days and ultimately escaped his 800-pound stone cufflink.127 HOURS is like a gruesome car accident - you don't wanna look, but you can't turn away.When Ralston falls down a gulch and realizes his arm is trapped under a falling boulder, his dismay is soon overcome by frustration when he can't shift the boulder or pull his arm loose. He screams, 'This is insane!' as we all would, because in this modern world, things like this not only don't happen to us, but CAN'T happen to us. Like the abandoned couple in OPEN WATER, we think we're too technological, too evolved, too sophisticated for these menial mishaps. Ralston peers up at the sliver of blue sky above the gulch and sees a faraway plane. It's surreal that in this world overrun by people, not one other soul knows where he is...He thinks back to his last hours in civilization; how he didn't pick up his mother's call, how he didn't tell his co-worker where he was going, and even how he misplaced his Swiss army knife, saddled instead with a cheap multi-tool, which would have to go above and beyond its call of duty to pull off a gory task.He starts a filmic commentary on his vidcam, one of his first ruminations that his hand has not had circulation for 24 hours, 'It's probably gone.' Horrifying thought! Even if you did escape now, that part of your body is destroyed irrevocably. Then the corollary thought: how long can the rest of your body maintain with one part of it slammed off from regular function? The blood is being squeezed through forcibly-created pathways to avoid that dead junction - how long before the machine busts a piston? On the third day, Ralston starts talking of his heart palpitating three times faster than normal.He starts conserving his food (2 burritos) and water (1 flask); jerry-rigs an ingenious sling to try to shift the rock; chips away at the stone with the multi-tool. He dreams... of his ex-girlfriend, of parties, of being freed - and wakes to stone-cold reality (isn't that the worst, stomach-curdling feeling in the world?); noises in the dark, delirium, wild thoughts...Director Danny Boyle is intent on making us feel everything Ralston felt, force-feeding us his emotional arc, through periods of sanguinity and desperation, frivolity and fear, and his ultimate descent into insanity and then clarity and then a hybrid of both; after all, how insane/sensible do you have to be to realize your only option is to break both the bones in your forearm and carve it off to escape? James Franco goes where few actors have been - no, not down a gulch in Utah - into the mind of a man who calmly assessed self-mutilation for survival. And went through with it! Of course, our own primal fears were awakened long before Ralston made the decision. It is WE who are trapped, it is WE who will die slowly or risk brain-searing pain, and ultimately... it is WE whose arms Ralston is cutting into! Boyle and Franco take us there, capturing not just the mental state, but (with the jolting use of fizzling audio and red meat editing) also capturing that ineffable yet jarringly familiar sensation of electric, teeth-fraying pain, as Ralston cuts through his tendons, nerves exposed. At that point, we would welcome fingernails down a blackboard.When his arm comes away and he stumbles backwards - that blank look - it's like his brain has fried its last cell trying to process what he has just done. What was going through Ralston's mind at that point in real life? The brain as an organ assessing how to cope with a body part suddenly non-existent on its radar? Ralston retained enough peace of mind to apply a tourniquet before the cutting got too deep, retained enough sanity to take one last picture of his cut-off arm; had enough strength to then rappel down a cliff face and walk in the direction of his car before coming across hikers and being rescued.Astonishingly, Ralston retained consciousness through his rescue and hardly even had to be helped walking; a testament to the human body's resilience, that's how fit and/or adrenalized he was. Ralston made it because he was in peak human condition from his extreme sports escapades. It's got nothing to do with his 'soul' or fighting spirit or that stupid 'premonition' of his future son.From Ralston's book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 127 HOURS is pure visceral emotion. It will leave you spent, if you haven't fainted first. The film's coda shows us the real Aron Ralston with wife Jessica - sitting in the sun, relaxed, quiet. A welcome relief from the foregoing intensity. Ralston continues to climb and trek; we see a prosthetic climbing apparatus attached to his missing limb.Still, the most incredible, inspirational thing I took from Ralston was how he kept his three-day growth as a three-day growth over five days. If I could do that, I would be soooo sexy.",8,0,1,19 August 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Claws I Said So.
","What amazes about that boy Wolverine is that over a century of storied adventures, traveling the world, fighting numerous battles, through changing trends and technological advances, he manages to keep that same funky Astro Boy hairstyle.I've lost track of all the 'authorized' Marvel Comics origin tales and 'official' time lines of Wolverine/Logan, although I remember enough to know X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is a consolidation of many strands of the Logan mythos into a cogent origin tale that will itself stand as an 'authorized' version to many.Written by David Benioff and Skip Woods, directed by Gavin Hood (RENDITION, 2007), WOLVERINE is glaringly designed to be Hollywood glossy, studio extravagant and popcorn maximus. Despite all this, it's a pretty good actioner that won't offend too much - unless you're a fan boy.The Logan from the graphic novels broods darkly over his hunted existence, assassin status and homicidal urges. Unlike Peter Parker and Clark Kent, the Canadian mutant with the caress of steel is, like his animal counterpart, constantly subsuming his berserker blood-lust and paying for it psychologically. His complicated loves and losses are tragic in ways that a PG-13 actioner could never define. WOLVERINE might have been one of the great superhero movies had it steered into the curve like WATCHMEN and created a gritty R-rated closeup of a tormented soul. Instead, we get muttonchops sautÃ©ed in popcorn.Aussie Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, his fourth film as this character, still proving himself one of the best casting choices ever made in cinematic history, with his - ahem - razor wit, altar boy charm, brooding superhero irony and playgirl muscles. Oh, dem muscles! Movie follows Wolverine aka James Logan from his youth, when he first discovers bone claws housed in his forearms, through adulthood, fighting in world wars, civil wars, and eventually cajoled into a cadre of mercenaries led by William Stryker (Danny Huston).Through it all, by his side, his half-brother, Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), also a mutant, with ripper nails and fangs instead of claws (who would later become the villain Sabretooth - but that's another x-tale).The opening montage is a movie unto itself - the brothers battling through many eras in world history, each segment filmed in the style of the iconic film that represented that era - at Normandy, the visuals copycatting SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; in Viet Nam, APOCALYPSE NOW. This movie is so big and muscular - like our favorite berserker - we just hang on and hope someone has greased the axles and maintained the transmission while our hearts pump diesel.Stryker's Death Squad features Ryan Reynolds as the katana-wielding Wade Wilson, who can slice an oncoming bullet in two; Will i Am is Wraith the teleporter; Dominic Monaghan is Bolt, handy to have around during a power outage; Kevin Durand is Fred Dukes, who would later become The Blob; Daniel Henney is sharpshooter Zero. Victor loves the ferocious camaraderie in this band of mutant brothers, but unethical missions leave Logan disenchanted and he walks away from this Death Squad, taking his muscles with him.He and his muscles settle into idyllic life in the Canadian Rockies with a girlfriend - no, not Michiko, fan boys - Kayla (Lynn Collins), until crazy-eyed Victor comes gunning for him. Or should that be clawing? Logan and Victor never age or get killed over all those wars. It is artfully conveyed that their mutant ability is superhuman regeneration of their body's cells. So even before he was imbued with the indestructible metal adamantium, Logan was pretty indestructible.And Hugh Jackman looks it, using every opportunity to get down to that tank top and tight jeans. Who can blame the boy if he's worked that hard to get that hard? Back in the 50s and 60s, Superman and Batman movies featured skinny actors in padded suits. Who could have envisioned that in 2009 there would be an actor - not a 'weightlifter' or 'bodybuilder' - who could embody the physique that those weaklings aspired to? And when he comes roaring naked out of that water tank, roped forearms blazing akimbo, adamantium claws snikting in fury, veins bursting through biceps, ferocious torso aglaze with electric runoff... you know every woman in her seat is as wet as he is.That's what it takes to get infused with adamantium - a Playgirl pose-down. And he becomes a true super man. And probably the only comic book hero who never gets into costume, and who fans accept that way.''Cause I'm the best there is at what I do and what I do isn't very nice.' Through double-crosses and betrayals, Logan's purpose eventually solidifies as revenge on Victor and Stryker.Only in this fourth X-MEN movie do we feel the full lethality of Logan's claws, as he slices through everything in his path, from steel walkways to vault doors and Humvees, through cages, choppers and even the bathroom sink! Those claws, as well as all the other mutants' super powers, are utilized intelligently and often. There are never any moments where we roll our eyes because a character is not using their powers effectively - like in all the other X-MEN movies.We meet Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), and a young Cyclops (Tim Pocock), who, like his older counterpart James Marsden, graduated from Teen Model Mannequin University. And Patrick Stewart is a young Professor Xavier, airbrushed like a Playboy Bunny.As a prequel, WOLVERINE acquits itself nicely, answering questions on how Logan acquires his adamantium, interacts with young Stryker; how he loses his memory and how he becomes too sexy for a spandex costume.But it still doesn't tell us how he got that funky Astro Boy hairdo.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,6,7,10 December 2009
That Thing You Do!," That Thing Done Well is a Thing of Beauty Indeed.
","A snappy, exhilarating movie, with a slightly 'down' ending, but which nonetheless entertains, without educating (a staple of American cinema). That's not to say this isn't an excellent film - full credit goes to Hanks (as writer-director) for crafting a vehicle in which he stars, that he is not the star of, focusing on the rise and fall of a rock group ensconced in British Invasion-era America.'Not educating' because this film deals very little in the reality of the business management behind The Wonders' success. Sure, no audience will sit through protagonists sludging through reams of contracts, but an audience can stomach details on the industry process of promoting an artist, because we see The Wonders single rising the Billboard charts, but no one ever mentions how it does this. Hanks puts in clues, but the dots are never joined - which might be construed as treating an audience as 'intelligent' - whoa!, let's not go overboard...The Wonders are drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott, oozing pleasant-ville like a born-again on crank), bandleader Jimmy (an intensely-focused Johnathon Schaech), guitarist Lenny (Steve Zahn, also pleasant - but unbalanced in that non-threatening way we term 'kooky'), and a nameless bassist (Ethan Embry, a wisp of effete lower end). Rounding out the troupe is Jimmy's unappreciated girlfriend, Fay (the gorgeous Liv Tyler).After a few appearances and an indie single, The Wonders 'make it' (see how EASY it is, starving musicians?). In turning them over to a major record label, The Wonders' first Garage Days manager, Phil, portrays a simplistic, 'noble' approach ('My bird-doggin' is done - Play-Tone's gonna take care of ya'), failing to mention that for a major to express that much interest in a band, the label's rep, Mr. White (a high-foreheaded Hanks), must have bought The Wonders' contract from Phil with a monetary offer he couldn't refuse. When Guy expresses how easy it all seems, White smoothly purrs, 'Well, papers will have to be signed and you'll have to get me the master tapes...' Suddenly Reality is served - you could almost see the horns growing out of White's forehead.Hanks doesn't serve up too much of this meat, and by concentrating on the end-result of all the bureaucracy and hard work - the gigs - we are given a skewed view of this 'job.' Seems like it's all just 'fun,' but there are as many rockers who attest that they 'hate their job,' as there are desk-jockeys nine-to-fiving. When it's your primary income, it's your Job - simple. And any job done well will elicit fun. Any job where you cannot cope, becomes not fun.The band guys are perceived as financially secure by movie's end, but a debut artist selling one single - even to Number One - cannot possibly recoup any of the money that the record label advanced to duplicate, promote and distribute the single nationally. As most veteran artists will attest, they had to wait for their fourth or fifth album (not single) to put them in the black fiscally. And The Wonders ultimately reneged on their contract, which meant that any advances assigned as living expenses on tour would suddenly dry up. It's an intimidating, debilitating legal situation that ensues - but the film sidestepped this issue. Rightly so.The crowning glory of this movie is undoubtedly its synchronized soundtrack. Very few movies (including monumental, award-winning productions like Amadeus or Immortal Beloved) pay this much attention to ensuring that musician's manipulations on screen match the audio soundtrack, except maybe 'This Is Spinal Tap.' (Of course, movies about real musical artists don't enter this assessment: 'Woodstock,' 'Gimme Shelter,' 'The Song Remains The Same,' etc. - although the Zep movie has its mighty share of non-sync passages.) When the Eddie & The Cruisers movies surged into cinemas in the 80s, I was humiliated at the lack of savvy the filmmakers exhibited in their portrayal of the rock and roll milieu. A major musical flaw was the set-and-forget production value for all the songs, making them sound exactly the same, as if they were all recorded in one place at one time, with one overall mix - which is what was actually done, of course - but to bring some credibility to the movie, the producers should have assessed the circumstances for each scene and mixed the music accordingly Â which is what Hanks and his audio personnel intuitively did for this movie.Every single time The Wonders perform their hit, the eponymous 'That Thing You Do,' the sound is mixed to reflect the type of stadium, bar or studio they are in; every single on screen frame of the actors-playing-musicians is synched Â Hanks specifically made his principals take instrument lessons before filming began Â down to every single beat of drum-fill on screen being accounted for, down to the guitarists changing to correct chords in correct positions in sync with the audio! If Hanks was brave enough to cast Liv Tyler (a daughter of Rock Royalty), he must have had heady confidence in his team of editors and sound engineers, for to fail at putting across the 'musicality' of this movie (with Steven's progeny willing to be involved in it) would not allow Hanks to show his face in public ever again.Of course there are minute flaws, but none worth mentioning here. There are too many trinkets to keep one sated: Guy's fastidious father, Jimmy's fascination with punning the band's name (spelled initially as 'One-Ders' and subsequently mispronounced 'Oh-NEE-ders' continuously), the well-drawn band personalities (the 'talented one,' 'smart one,' 'quiet one,' 'zany one'), cameos from Peter Scolari (Hanks' old Bosom Buddy), Rita Wilson, Alex Rocco (Moe Green in The Godfather), Kevin Pollak; the subtle romance between Guy and Fay, who are not actually an item until the last few frames of film......and you'll never be able to get that damn song out of your head!",8,10,12,30 September 2003
Hot Fuzz," Buzz Fuzz
","In 2004, the zombie comedy *Shaun of the Dead*, hit us like a shovel to the face. *Hot Fuzz* is like that same shovel Â to the bollacks. Harder, heavier, grittier and gruesomer than *Shaun*, Brit import *Hot Fuzz* throws down action badder than Hollywood's baddest bad boys - and it's a comedy.The same team that brought us *Shaun* (writer-director Edgar Wright and writer-star Simon Pegg) have found their havoc stride with *Hot Fuzz*, which does for law enforcement what *Shaun* did for the dead Â bring it to life just to beat the living clichÃ© out of it.Pegg is Nicholas Angel, a London supercop transferred by the London brass (fed up with him singlehandedly making them look bad) to an indolent Sandford village, which he treats as rigorously as London, adhering to 'official vocab guidelines' and wearing his vest on foot patrol. Ragged by fellow officers for his big-city Ã©lan and partnered with plump, oblivious action-movie fan, Danny (Nick Frost), Angel becomes dubious over the village's drowsy faÃ§ade after three Sandford residents have fatal 'accidents.' His friendship with Danny becomes his only lifeline as he uncovers a provincial conspiracy to retain the village's award-winning bucolic aesthetic Â through murder.Whilst paying homage to Action Film canon (John Woo, Michael Bay, Richard Donner, Clint Eastwood), Pegg and Wright's forte is in taking the vinegar out of the conventions: 'Is it true that there's a point on a man's head where if you shoot it, it will blow up?'; after a villain is dispatched into a refrigerator, 'Did you tell him to cool off?'; a music swell will suddenly cut short when the action on screen takes a turn that the audience and, it would seem, the film-makers were not expecting; or Angel will pull a rugged hero-face into the camera when he screeches a squad car to a halt Â then he will pull that same face when he screeches a bicycle to a halt; or Danny badgers Angel with excitable questions that he believes a big-city cop should have lived through: 'Have you ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?' 'Have you ever fired a gun whilst in a high speed pursuit?' Â all of which happens in due course to the unsuspecting dynamic duo with film-makers' tongues planted wickedly in cheeks.Admittedly, it is hard to follow a surprise hit (*Shaun*) with a 'planned' hit, because we the audience now EXPECT the laughs. And we expect them with a lot more snot and giggles. (In that respect, it might almost have been favorable for *Fuzz*'s intended audience NOT to have seen *Shaun*.) Suffice to say, *Hot Fuzz* seems a tad more 'forced' than *Shaun*. It doesn't help that American marketers insist on giving us ten different thirty-second trailers containing ten gags each, specifically to spell out that *Fuzz* is a comedy, to American audiences whose sensibilities have been blunted by this type of actioner that actually takes itself seriously. Thus, adding the 'expectancy quotient' to the deadened 'advertised gags,' we are left with an uphill battle to jocular nirvana.Which indicates how good *Fuzz* is, to still pull off a goodly wallop of jock.Oft-times, British humor does not translate well to American audiences, the prime example that bridged that gap being Monty Python. But we realize Python did not succeed entirely when supposedly reputable media like *The Hollywood Reporter* still employs empty vessels like Ray Bennett: 'When the two start flying through the air with automatics kicking, you'd bet they would give anything to be in a Robert Rodriguez film and not in a comedy at all.' Uh Â is there any point explaining parody to someone who is not equipped to comprehend it? Danny's character almost represents the fumbling-for-apprehension American psyche, when he blurts explanations to callback gags and specifies the movies that *Hot Fuzz* actually spoofs.Like *Shaun,* editing is performed with the gale-force of ripping gonads, editor Chris Dickens placing *Fuzz* spectacularly and squarely in its actioner genre for maximum parody - if it wasn't a comedy, it would be an A-List B-Movie.Not only do Wright and Pegg knock down movie conventions (Angel elocuting like Eastwood in avenger mode; camera swooshing around the two bad boys like Michael Bay in-de-hizz-ouse), they envelope-push social convention as well, molding Angel and Danny's relationship into an ambiguously gay-ish interaction, yet never actually stooping to facile gay jokes, but skirting the ambiguity itself for the laughs. Angel is also the world's first openly-atheist hero (without that fact involving a plot point); there is also no female love interest forced into the plot for pap Romantic Ending Protocol.British comedic mainstays, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan all cameo in the first ten minutes, then are sadly missed. Replaced in Sandford with other Brit cameos: Timothy Dalton's suspicious grocery store manager, Jim Broadbent's sinister Police Inspector and a double-decker bus load of familiar faces.The allusions are innumerable and definitely require a second viewing for their lightning passage (*Straw Dogs,* Dire Straits' *Romeo and Juliet*), but familiarity with *Point Break*, the *Lethal Weapon*s and *Shaun of the Dead* itself will get you over the 'British humor' hump.And really, if you don't get it by now, after Python and *Black Adder* and *Fawlty Towers* and *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels* and Ali G and *Extras*Â I have here a shovel.Present me your bollacks.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",8,2,4,11 May 2007
Constantine," Inconstantine.
","Beautifully shot in ocher tinge, evoking a mythopoeic superstructure, striking cinematography accentuating iconic imagery and mellifluous art direction, it's a pity CONSTANTINE is such an insensate, half-headed dog of a film.This movie was better when it was called THE MATRIX.Traversing between two parallel dimensions, Neo - I mean, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves, kickin' it arctic cool, by way of Eastwood's Stranger and Ren & Stimpy) is some kind of secular exorcist, a border patrol for illegal demons trying to cross over into our dimension. Since there are already enough evil acolytes walking the Earth - they're called priests - Constantine routes these aliens with extreme prejudice, utilizing rules and laws that have no basis in any mythology.That's the problem with movies of this ilk. No rules. The definition of 'inconstant' is 'likely to change frequently without apparent or cogent reason.' Visually elegant, yet irrelevant.But then, how can it be expected to adhere to rules when its source material is more contradictory and confused than a whore crying rape - the Bible? Simultaneously exhorting us to love our enemies, then enjoining Joshua 'to destroy all that breathes as the Lord God of Israel commanded' (Joshua 10:40).Bring the kids.The writers of the comic book that CONSTANTINE is based on, Hellblazer (Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis), cannot be wholly blamed for CONSTANTINE's befuddlement, as screenwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello consolidated this tale from many Hellblazer episodes.The first demon we encounter enables a young girl to walk up walls. In the next scene, she is tied to a bed, where Constantine exorcises the demon into a mirror and smashes it, thereby killing the demon. If you're going to possess someone, why possess an underprivileged village girl? Why not a person whom the authorities would find financially impossible or ethically uncomfortable to restrain - like Donald Trump or Tom Hanks? (Some might say Trump is already in league with demons, while others might say Hanks is as well, after seeing THE TERMINAL.) And maybe my mythology is rusty, but I believe the clause that covers disposal of demons via mirrors is right next to the one about 'Let he who is without an expressionless movie hero cast the first stoner.CONSTANTINE's brouhaha revolves around the Spear of Destiny - a totally fictitious ornament (mentioned in passing only by John 19:34), which somehow gained credence in catholic vernacular as the 'spear that killed Christ.' And whomsoever 'holds the Spear of Destiny holds the fate of the world in his hands.' Reportedly in Hitler's possession at one time, I suppose that accounts for his domination of Western Europe. So what happened in May 1945? He woke up one day and misplaced it? This Spear is instrumental in birthing the son of the devil - in some contrived plot also found nowhere in any Christian mythologies or apocrypha - where a transgendered angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) betrays god to help the devil's son for a motivation unknown to anyone but the confused screenwriters.Constantine uncovers this plot by sitting in a chair of special effects straight out of the bible. (Remember that psychic chair that Jesus sat in that one time?) This chair is apparently so dangerous that its owner, Midnite (Djimon Hounsou, dutifully cast as the African witch-doctor stereotype) constantly disallows its use by Constantine. When Constantine eventually uses it and his life is threatened, to escape, he need only call out to Midnite, who wrenches him bodily from the chair. Uh, guess it wasn't that dangerous after all.Enter Rachel Weisz, as cop Angela Dodson. Her twin sister, Isabel, just committed suicide and is walking through hell in her nightie. As a cop - a person trained to only accept evidence - Angela approaches Constantine with unquestioning, juvenile belief in his 'gift' of dimensional travel, beseeching him to find her sister and bring a wrap.Constantine promptly breaches hell by putting his feet in water and staring at a cat. Whilst in hell - which looks like a cross between a Heironymous Bosch painting and Downtown Los Angeles at 2:30 a.m. - Isabel runs from Constantine and some half-headed monsters, who all cluster together like N'Sync for a dynamic photo op.Constantine brings back Isabel's hospital tag as 'evidence.' Rachel asks, 'How could this be?' Well, there's this thing called a POCKET which could very easily have hidden that tag until Constantine needed to whip it out and impress your small mind.What would any dumb American film be without the British Bad Guy? Gavin Rossdale (from Bush - the band, not the criminal public official) plays Balthazar, a smarmy Bond Villain type who meanders about for no reason, who can't be killed by heavy artillery, but cowers under the mighty incantations of Keanu's stoner spells.A thousand transgressions of non-rules later, we arrive at the movie's conclusion, laden with effects in lieu of excitement, logic and interest. Constantine meets with Satan (Peter Stormare, clad in angelic white, chewing more scenery than Heston on Sinai) and narcs on Gabriel in the next room, who is using the Spear to bring forth Satan's son. Exactly like in the Bible.Let me get this straight: Satan, omniscient bringer of darkness, doesn't know what is going on in the next room? Directed by Music Video Director to the Sluts, Francis Lawrence (Britney, Janet, J-Lo), the roaring beauty of this movie is tempered by its dangerous stupidities. If audiences could appreciate it as simply an imaginative story, the human race might just survive. Unfortunately, ninety percent of audiences will take it as fact, to be added to their human-penned gospels and already insane mythologies of Christ and hobbits and Islam and space aliens. And as these gullible dupes become the decision-makers in society, billions more murders will be perpetrated for this 'sacred truth' in a never-ending spiral of ignorance.Bring the kids.",3,1,4,9 August 2011
Troy," The Achilliad
","All bronzed bicep, leonine mane and CG soldiery, Troy is a glut-fest of regal posturing and battle-flavored man-stench.Coax golden-skinned, Bally-gymed Brad Pitt into a taut-buttocked mini-skirt in your movie, and Homer's *Iliad* be damned. Compressing the backstory of the ten-year siege of Troy into one week, all deities, dogma and details are eschewed for ant-battles between computer warriors and camera-caressing of Pitt's Achilles.Hardly-shaving Orlando Bloom is Prince Paris, who steals away a plain-ish Helen of Troy nÃ©e Sparta (Diane Kruger), giving King Agamemnon (Brian Cox, elocuting like a serpent) excuse to hurl Greece's full might against the battlements of Troy, the last bastion of the Known World left to conquer.Performances such as Eric Bana's stalwart Prince Hector, Peter O'Toole's doddering King Priam, Brendan Gleeson's ogreish Menelaus, Sean Bean's astute Odysseus, and intelligently crafted fight choreography for the *mano a mano* duels all serve to elevate this movie above that of trite action blockbuster to that of Guilty Pleasure Trite Action Blockbuster.Still wondering why actors in Greek or Roman movies - in an attempt to sound more 'authentic' - adopt a *British* accentÂ Guess Richard Burton has a lot to answer for.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,4,8,19 October 2005
Orphan," The Kid Ain't Kidding.
","Kids are scary to begin with. Little adults with big heads who pretend they don't know what we're saying. They're like clowns: some people find them fun; most know they're evil.So in ORPHAN, when an upscale couple with two children adopt a 9-year-old orphan with scary theme music, familial bliss is not in the flow chart.Vera Farmiga stars as mother Kate, whose checkered history of alcoholism and a miscarriage - big baggage right there! - is exploited by cherubic orphan child, Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) when she is adopted by the family.With a strange Russian accent and outdated clothes, Esther also terrorizes the couple's son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and threatens their little deaf daughter, Max, into becoming her accomplice. Aryana Engineer plays Max in a priceless performance; deaf in real life, conveying intense, complex emotions on her face without words, and cutie cute cute). Husband John (Peter Sarsgaard), seemingly Xanaxed to the gills, never notices a thing.12-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman, mature beyond her years, gives a studied, sinister, Kevin-Spacey-like performance as Esther, making Kate look crazy in all the old formulaic ways: releases the handbrake when little Max is in the car alone, making it look like Kate is irresponsible, cutting Kate's roses around the shrine of her miscarried child, causing Kate to attack her in front of witnesses and - most disturbingly - breaking her own arm in a vice and accusing Kate of doing it.Then things get REALLY psycho. Killing nuns and burning down treehouses and breaking a rival kid's legs... it still doesn't wake Peter Sarsgaard, although he does find enough wankergy to plonk voluptuous Vera - only to get busted by Esther - twice.After she gives Esther merely a few rudimentary lessons, piano tutor Kate walks in on Esther playing Tchaikovsky. 'You told me you couldn't play!' Esther replies: 'No, I thought you would like to teach me. It must be frustrating for a person who likes music as much as you to have a son who is uninterested and a daughter who is deaf.' Unintentionally hilarious because it has been established the son is a Guitar Hero freak, which means - contrary to popular belief - you are uninterested in music.Directed by Spanish Jaume Collet-Serra (whose dubious claim to fame is directing Paris Hilton in HOUSE OF WAX, 2005), the niggling problem with ORPHAN is that only during the neat climactic twist is Esther's motivation revealed - throughout the movie, we watch her perform incredibly dastardly deeds (which includes murder) and wonder what drives her, as she is being treated like a princess. Then again, kids be evil an' all dat...",6,5,6,17 August 2011
Terminator Salvation," The Manchurian Candidator.
","'For ***k's sake, man, you're amateur!' --Christian Bale on the set of TERMINATOR SALVATION.That's the best description *I* can think of for TERMINATOR SALVATION. What more could we expect from writers who penned the silly TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and a director whose claim to fame is the CHARLIE'S ANGELS franchise? James Cameron would be turning in his grave if he didn't just resurrect himself with AVATAR.A story about Heart that lacks it completely.It is 2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) is leader of 'The Resistance' against The Machines who have assumed intelligence and trying to wipe out humankind by shooting at them one at a time. Will someone remind the machines that being such an integral part of humankind's existence, all they have to do to bring humankind to its knees is to stop working - and mollycoddled humankind will start crying like little girls without dollies.Those unfamiliar with TERMINATOR canon can apparently go suck an egg, as there are so many winks at 1984's TERMINATOR and 1991's TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, newbies should expect to be crushed under heavy metal in-gags: 'Come with me if you want to live'; Guns 'N Roses' You Could Be Mine; battles on catwalks, boiling metal, liquid nitrogen, and of course, 'I'll be back' (delivered by Connor at a nondescript juncture)...I know why Bale is so p'd off: Sam Worthington got the best role - as machinesexy Marcus, a cyborg programmed to think he's human, who unknowingly draws out Connor for destruction. Helena Bonham Carter explains the Manchurian Situation via a Marlon Jor-El Brando holo-exposition - coincidentally, like a Batman Villain - that no one asked for and would have served her purpose better to have not explained. Bale is a brilliant actor, a chameleon, an artisan; Sam Worthington is a block of sexy wood - and so, like the original films, the coolest role went to the guy who could act the LEAST.So have they invented time-travel yet? Didn't machines send the Governor back first, forcing John Connor to send Kyle back to stop him? Which would mean MACHINES created time travel. Thanks, Diebold! Humans couldn't find the time to invent it, not with all that hiding and skulking in portable underground labs covered in poo? Trying to tie it all in with canon, Connor narrates at the end that 'the war is just beginning,' meaning that war Kyle Reese rasps about in THE TERMINATOR, even though the Schwarzenegger Terminator was like a toy soldier compared to the techno design of the Worthingtonator, which was so technologically covert it didn't even know it was a Manchurian Terminator. And like George Lucas's prequel-abominations-with-better-effects, the paradoxes and anomalous plotting of writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris comes back 'round to bite them in the butt.The irony of SALVATION is that it is continually yammering about 'strong hearts' delineating humans from machines and 'what it means to be human' and all manner of poignant story element so obviously cribbed from Screen writing For Dummies - and lacks everything it yammers about.Bale brings his Batman rasp and boundless temper; Bryce Dallas Howard brings her three unnecessary names and a spunky red coiffure; looking like Billy Bibbit from CUCKOO'S NEST, Anton Yelchin is young Kyle Reese (in one of those many nods to TERMINATOR fans that means nothing to first-time viewers); Moon Bloodgood brings a sexy disposition for metal man meat; Michael Ironside is Bad Guy emeritus; Helena Bonham Carter goes name to name with Bryce Dallas Howard but beats out Howard on looking like a bloodless horse junkie (i.e. like Helena Bonham Carter); and a bodybuilt guy with a face like an Arnold tips another hat to the fanboys.The production values are as scorching as Bale's temper. There is an amazing unbroken tracking shot 360 degrees around a helicopter in distress, that then tracks INTO the helicopter (John Connor piloting) and stays with the action as the helicopter crashes and lands upside down. John Connor crawls from the wreck and sees a mushroom cloud in the distance, blasted radar dishes littering the foreground and middle background. We know this is all green screen, yet it takes us right into the murderous battle heat of Termytown. Then it gets stupid immediately - as a skeletal Terminator grabs John Connor and throws him. Let me get this straight: this steel-belted Terminator's one directive is to terminate humans, yet having the opportunity to simply clasp its mighty metal claw around Connor's neck from behind and asphyxiate him or snap his neck, it opts to grab him by the shoulder and throw him? Which proves that McG (the McDirector) has a great grasp of constructing action scenes - but don't let him near your story. Unless you're two bitches who wrote TERMINATOR 3. See how it all comes around and bites us in the butt?",5,1,3,21 July 2010
Juno," Verging on Virgin-on-Virgin.
","I know that JUNO was a big hit with the pedophiles and sweaty-mouthed goons trying to catch a glimpse of sugartit, but I just have to get this off my flat green chest: Sorry Ellen, but this movie doesn't exist in a vacuum. Which non-hypocritical planet did you film it on? Early 2010, Ellen Page starred in a series of commercials for Cisco, where she was purveyed as a role model for young girls. In 2007, Ellen Page played the title character in JUNO, a 16-year-old knocked up by her boyfriend, who finds a childless couple to adopt the impending child, tries to seduce the father-to-be, then goes crawling back to her wimpy 16-year-old boyfriend when all else fails. Nice role modeling, Ellen.Just one question: How many GUYS are buying this crap? Oh, we know that 16-year-old girls across America are swooning in wide-thighed empowerment. But how many men over 20 hear Juno's lament, 'I need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever,' and clasp their breasts in romantic abandon? Answer: None more virgins.The splash-reviews squeal, 'outrageously offbeat comedy hit' - the only outrage is the hypocrisy of the American public that would scream statutory rape when 16-year-olds are impregnated in real life and then embrace this movie as 'outrageously offbeat.' 'Delivers huge laughs and feel-good fun' - after dealing with the reality of ostracism at school, sociological intolerance, stretch-marks and ugly baby belly that never quits, psychological implications of abandoning a child for adoption, morning sickness, mood swings, tender nipples, birth screams - when exactly does the 'feel good' kick in? Ellen Page plays Juno with the verve and vivacity that the part requires, and her performance sells the movie; problem is, she's playing it like a woman twice the age of her character. She knows too much. It's not that she's 'mature for her age' - her cultural references are from another generation, all delivered with an irritating cynicism and insouciance that makes her sound like Jim Henson's Tarantino Babies. How many instances of Iggy & The Stooges, Soupy Sales and Dario Argento can she possibly pull out of thin air and remain credible? Writer Diablo Cody giving away her own age? Jason Reitman (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) directs, John Malkovich (yeah, the crazy one) co-produces.J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney are Juno's credible, likable parents, and Michael Cera is the guilty willowy boyfriend, Bleeker (if anyone can imagine his sperm possessing the swimming power to actually impregnate someone), with all the screen presence of an apology.Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner are Mark and Vanessa Loring, the cutesy adopting couple whom we discover have problems living up to their glossy-magazine aspirations. Bateman, though reined in, gets a few good Bateman-isms in there, and Garner, as always, looks and acts like her high cheekbones haven't healed yet.I've got nothing against teen pregnancy. If an organism CAN procreate, there is nothing morally, ethically or psychologically wrong with reproducing. JUNO's makers think they're doing something new, forgetting that the earliest hominids (and many tribal societies today) mated and reproduced when they were slightly younger than Juno MacGuff - without all the egregious societal hypocrisy.After pretending to be 'outrageously offbeat' JUNO safely falls back on that demonstrably stupid message that someone 'meant for you' might have been under your nose all along. This sixteen-year-old with warring hormones and no idea on how to be a woman tells Bleeker, 'I love you' - and we're meant to buy that as sincere. When just yesterday...... under some cloud of hormonal maladjustment she had tearfully jumped in her car, smooshed on lipstick deliberately, and drove out to actively seduce Mark Loring, then couldn't understand why she was doing it. And when Mark told her he was leaving his wife, did any inference seep into her small mind that he was inviting her to be a casual squeeze without strings or guilt? All proving that Juno doesn't know the first thing about relationships, love or sex. So we're supposed to believe her supposed epiphany when she declares her puppy love for Apology? Message To Girlies: That wasn't an epiphany - that's weighing her options and deciding on an Apology. After his smitten blue-balled confession that he thinks she's 'beautiful all the time,' she figures this dorknozzle has his uses as a provider. Wait until they're both 24, after she's squeezed out a couple more kids (who aren't his), and he's between gas-pumping jobs and they can't make payments on the trailer....Movie is made well enough, in that prosaic manner of all American teen comedies, but it is not 'original' or 'delightful.' Juno spells it out just in case anyone missed the sledgehammer message of why this movie was 'different': 'You're meant to procreate AFTER you fall in love, but with us we procreated first.' That's nice, slut.",5,6,11,29 July 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Jack-ing the Sparrow
","*Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End*: a whole lotta something that ends up a whole lotta nothing.Director Gore Verbinski puts so much effort into this summer blockbuster that it boggles the rational part of the brain Â look at that cinematography, look at that set dressing, look at that costuming and attention to detail on every starboard bow and odd bodkin and shivered timber. But pull back and the fault lines appear quickly: once again, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play star-crossed lovers; once again Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush play ham and cheese with lots of dressing, once again Hans Zimmer's soundtrack beats you to a bloody pulp Â in 'Pirates 2' (2006) these elements walked the edge of the tolerable plank, but mish-mash them amongst a wretchedly convoluted storyline and unnecessary, eye-straining, computer-graphicking spectacle and what started as a good idea back in 2003's 'Pirates 1' is now an epileptic nightmare. Written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, *At World's End* opens with the British government repressing civil liberties in the quest to eradicate piracy, not realizing that they become as villainous as the factions they are trying to overcome in the process - quashing the right to assemble, denying the right to *habeas corpus*. We never really 'meet' the characters; more like 'catch up' with them in the middle of a fine mess Â why exposit when there's so much action to get to? From the press junkets, we learn that Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) can only repel the British forces by convening nine Pirate Lords, one of them being Jack Sparrow, who is dead, which presents a problem. Verbinski has been taking film-making lessons from George Lucas. And his film fails in exactly the same ways that Lucas's do. Firstly, there are no rules that this Caribbean universe adheres to: people die but can't seem to stay dead; 'dead souls' abandoned by Davy Jones float by in the water, then are suddenly floating by on little touristy boats; Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) suddenly gains the ability to walk through walls; Chow Yun-Fat is Pirate Lord Sao Feng Â until he bequeaths his title to Elizabeth (it's that easy to become a Pirate Lord? No wonder Jack is one).And there is nothing at stake if you swordfight someone who can't be killed with a sword. And who knew the dead still harbored ambitions to live like the living throughout their death? Making that age-old movie marketing mistake, Verbinski identifies his 'selling point' (any layperson could tell you it is Johnny Depp as madly fey Jack Sparrow) and follows the fallacious market research on summer blockbuster sequels that informs him to then glut the screen with his selling point. After waiting twenty minutes for Depp's Sparrow, suddenly we're wishing he would Go Away, as we find him in Davy Jones' Locker (i.e. Death Â which is apparently an actual 'place' rather than a condition), talking to himself Â literally. Whereas in 'Pirates 2,' Depp exploded out of left field with the half-drunk, half-transvestite, Keith Richards-inspired Jack Sparrow, now the joke has worn thin. And putting hundreds of him on screen - each one feyer than the last - only makes one person happy: George (More Is Better) Lucas.A rock turns into a CG crab. But why stop at one Â when you can have a million? Why should the British armada stop at a hundred ships when you can populate the horizon with a thousand (which all might as well be a matte painting, for all the sitting there and doing nothing that they do)?; and why stop at 'inspired by' Keith Richards Â when you can HAVE Keith Richards?! Keef cameos for twelve eyeblinks as Jack's wayward pirate pater, the irony being that Richards really IS a zombie and wears enough makeup on Stones Tours to make him look alive.The *Pirates* franchise started as a filthy romance between a statesman's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, still flatter than an ironed pancake with a face that never gets dirty, hardened features so enamel-coated you could cut bread on them), and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), while a soldier, Norrington (Jack Davenport), wooed her with 'proper' British etiquette.Then came Jack. And though the film-makers held a semblance of love quadrangle through 'Pirates 2,' here there is just too much bluster for the flimsy chemistry to hold. Elizabeth aches for Jack; Will is her obsolete brother and Norrington somehow pulls off the only 'romantic' parlay of the film, a scant poignant moment where two people actually act like they have human feelings for each other.The unmitigated stupidity of Will and Elizabeth's 'marriage scene whilst dueling' holds not one shred of emotion. Will becomes the New Davy Jones, who must stay seabound and only come ashore once every ten years to spend filthy time with ElizabethÂ but why can he only conjugate with her on land? So is it BECAUSE of her marriage vows that we are meant to believe Elizabeth will be faithful to Will over TEN YEARS of celibacy? And it's quite plausible for her to remain celibate for ten year stretches HANGING AROUND PIRATES.Yes, we know we're meant to take it all like a ripping yarn, but there's just too much yarn and not enough ripping; how many times can people double-cross each other before we stop caring who's on whose side and whether Orlando Bloom will ever get to touch Keira Knightley there? It's not 'fun' anymore - the rascally diversion of the *Pirates* series has turned into a MUST-EARN overblown bombast of money-raking white noise consumerism.Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander), channeling Corleone, constantly qualifies his quest to wipe out piracy by sneering, 'It's not personal. It's just business'.And that, swashbucklers, is why *Pirates* fails.",5,0,2,16 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Really Swingin'
","What an adventure! *Spiderman 3* is a swingin' soirÃ©e; a chill-er thriller lady-killer that tops both its previous incarnations with smooth-headed, web-spangling adventure and vibrant, flesh-colored emotion. Heroes tainted by evil, villains infused with poignancy, lovers circling in triangles and Topher Grace as the meanest metrosexual this side of *American Idol.* Writer-director Sam Raimi bats it out of the super stadium with this spider.Spiderman is now to New York what Superman was to Metropolis Â an actual 'hero,' despite J. Jonah Jameson's (J.K. Simmons) crusade to discredit him through *The Daily Bugle*. And self-absorbed Peter Parker aka Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) lets his hubris blind him to his flame-haired squeeze, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) having lost her baby fat and consequently her unconditional support of his heroic antics. Whereas at the conclusion of *Spider-Man 2* (2004) she exhorted him, 'Go get 'em, tiger!' reality has now settled like a gargoyle on her syrup-flavored romantic notions of being hero-worshipped by a hero and, like every woman whose designs to 'change a man' don't pan out, restlessly looks further afield for the fantasy eunuch she thought she had found in Peter.Enter Harry Osborn (James Franco), MJ's ex and Peter's best friend. The first love-triangle is set in motion (two guys and one girl).Though I chided Franco's talent in *Spider-Man*, *Spider-Man 3* forces a re-assessment of his prowess as actor and character Â I stand corrected, sir! No longer nutless or translucent, James Franco is the embodiment of nuance! His dual role as Harry Osborn and New Goblin is the most challenging of the film - that of hero's friend driven to hate, then amnesiac friendship, then friendship pretense masking evil intent, then sincerely offering friendship once more in a compelling Marvel Team-Up situation, ultimately meeting his end by saving Spiderman's life in the same way that his father, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), tried to take it.As one villain falls, another rises.The origin of the Sandman (an in-shape Thomas Haden Church, with his sad Jagger lips and famous green-striped shirt) is epic and heartrending all at once: after good ol' 1950's radiation comes to the rescue as Plot Device and irradiates Flint Marko into a sentient sand-being, he finds he cannot grasp his daughter's pendant without exerting an incredible force of will to cohere his molecules into solidity. The CGI visualization of the distraught Sandman's sandy complexion is desolation boulevard; the best CG sand effects you will ever see in motion pictures today. He maintains, 'I'm not a bad person. I've just had bad luck.' Spiderman lore is audaciously breached when the film's writers make Flint Marko the real killer of Peter's Uncle Ben (as opposed to that doughy guy with the frosted hair who killed Uncle Ben in the 2002 flick), to raise the emotional stakes, giving Peter further reason to de-sand the Sandman.As if this revelation and his breakup and his rent being late aren't bad enough, Spiderman must face his own inner demons when an alien goop from outer space changes his costume black and his personality to Buddy Love (Jerry Lewis version). (Don't even ask - there are too many years of comic book doctrine for even the movie to exposit this goopy thing properly). This is the only point where it almost gets irretrievably silly: Peter Parker becomes so outlandishly arrogant he struts the streets like Travolta with women sniggering at him like he's, well, Tobey MacguireÂ Thus the second love-triangle coalesces (two girls and one guy), putting a crimp in MJ's first love-triangle, as Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) oozes on Gangsta Peter, planting an upside-down kiss on Spidey in public, giving MJ license to whine like the spoiled byoch she is.In my review of *In Good Company* (2004), I opined, 'One day Topher Grace will learn that 'acting' is not behaving like you're making one big apology.' That day has come. In his role as unctuous photographer Eddie Brock, Topher flies way past the meridian on apologetic and slams into Jugular Deranged in his transformation into one of the fiercest creatures ever to try biting into Spiderman's roundish head Â Venom.The greatest stunt that Raimi pulls in this movie is to imbue both heroes and villains with a wrenching poignancy; amongst the creatively spectacular battle sequences, his human protagonists have not been forgotten. In fact, the most touching scenes involve the Sandman, whether he's tragically seeking forgiveness from his own family or explaining to Peter how he accidentally shot Uncle Ben - look up Sob Story in the dictionary, there's a picture of *this* guy. By the time his Oscar moment rolls around and Peter, teary-eyed, absolves him, we are also weeping into our plastic pizzas (well, at least I was).Movie is long, but doesn't flag Â except for the ACTUAL flag that Spiderman lands directly in front of; an obvious 'Go USA' moment that is perfunctorily used in trailers. You want inspiring? Forget the flag - bring Danny Elfman back (music for both previous films); composer Christopher Young sparingly uses Elfman's grandiose horn line and it is sadly missed.Bruce Campbell in a hilarious cameo speaking Monty Python French; James Cromwell underused; Willem Dafoe as creepy mirror reflection again; and Stan Lee's best cameo in a Marvel film ever.'Nuff said!(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",9,1,2,21 May 2007
Match Point," Unmatched.
","There is such a brilliant hook in Woody Allen's *Match Point* that to say anything about it would ruin its impact.So I'm going to anyway. It's the woman in me.Writer-director Allen leans so heavily on the tennis idiom (from opening the film with a tennis analogy dependent on luck Â a ball nicking the top edge of the net - to the lead character being an ex-tennis pro, to the title of the film itself) that he hooks us wholeheartedly into the idea that any ball that nicks the net needs to go *over* the net to win.Then the movie does exactly the opposite. To say any more would be far too feminineÂ Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is that ex-tennis pro turned instructor at an exclusive London club, where Â as luck would have it Â he befriends a painfully upper-class British tennis student, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who invites him to an opera, and whose sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) then falls for Chris and whose fiancÃ©, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), Chris falls for.In a situation which might have easily degenerated into a tiresome love-quadrangle farce, *Match Point* instead adopts a stance contrary to that of any given formulaic 'American' Love Story. In other words, it is not a complete waste of time, brain cells, funding, resources and talent.How Woody Allen, a steadfast New Yorker, managed to capture the upper-class British idiom so concisely is a wonder. Sure, employing British actors helps, but the writing seems inherently British from the outset. For example, when Nola comments on her fiancÃ© being handsome and asks whether Chris also finds him handsome, without any hesitation, embarrassment, or sophomoric gay innuendo, Chris replies, 'Very.' Decidedly NOT an American response.Further, in crafting the film on location in London, the censorious MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) seem to exert less of a stranglehold on 'injurious' themes, especially their insulting edict, 'no crime shall go unpunished.' When unpunished crime, abortion or infidelity arise in *Match Point*, there is no moralism attached, no proselytizing or justification. Whereas wide-release American movies have reached a point where they must explain or justify every action for their dim-witted, lazy demographic (thereby becoming a collective insult to their own audiences by their very pandering existence), this movie floats free of those strictures, and is crisper, more mature and infinitely more powerful for it.Realizing that operatic themes were nothing more than the pulp fiction of their day, Allen slyly uses the melodrama of opera as a backdrop, enabling him to push the pulp envelope. When Chris Wilton is forced into deciding which woman he wants to retain in his life, the faux-operatic extremities he takes are congruent with the opera soundtrack enhancing the surrealism. Like Mozart's *Don Giovanni*, Chris remains unrepentant; like Verdi's *La Traviata*, his lover is a whore, and like Eastwood's *High Plains Drifter* he's going to resolve the problem in very stylish pants.In true European idiom, Chris thankfully does not assess which woman he 'loves' more; he assesses his future - and acts accordingly. At last: Truth in a movie! Though the American Teen Power Phrase 'Do you love her?' was brought into play for the Great Unwashed to sink their blunted teeth into, it is never dwelt upon, this story intelligently illustrating how codifying or measuring 'love' does not resolve harsh realities. Unlike the formulaic drivel that informs ninety-percent of character motivation in films, Chris' final, fateful decision is not made because he feared losing love, but because he feared losing his enablement.Like a more intense Ewan McGregor, Rhys Meyers' aloof intensity and reptilian charm defines the term 'smooth criminal.' We discover how smooth in the film's final frames.The UK cast Â down to the smallest bit parts Â are flawless, including Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton as Chris' in-laws, and Ewen Bremner and James Nesbitt as flustered detectives.Scarlett Johansson is almost not ready to be placed amongst this cast, as her jarring American acting training clashes irreconcilably with the fluid ease of the UK ensemble. Satirizing Shatner has become passÃ©, for what comedian Kevin Pollak termed his 'pause acting,' yet Shatner merely accentuated a certain American Method. In American movies it goes unnoticed. Held against the naturalistic European Method, it is virtually unwatchable, Johansson's most irritating Shatner occurring during the scene where she opens up to Rhys Meyers after a failed audition, Rhys Meyers' potent uninflected replies colliding with her heavily inflected 'acting' responses. Though she shines with a flirtatious, needy light in this scene, all that keeps springing to mind is, 'Khaaaaan!' Allen's subtexts in this movie are hilarious for their blackness: As soon as Chris' wife makes 'getting pregnant' her *raison d'etre* and as soon as his lover actually *gets* pregnant, they both become insufferable. On one side, mechanical, passionless sex, on the other, maddening whining and threats, to the point where no amount of bra-less t-shirt-wearing will save her. It is unlikely that women will ever glean the subtext: that it is not sex, marriage or infidelity that drives a man to madness Â it is anything to do with pregnancy. Then there is the deeper irony which Woman will refuse to see as long as the species must procreate: that the very thing which she believes seals her future with her mate Â pregnancy - in actuality rends his psyche from hers irreconcilably.Via Woody Allen's magnificent art, that's coming straight from the Man in all of us...",9,2,5,16 September 2006
Yes Man," YES means Mo.'
","In YES MAN, anti-social Carl (Jim Carrey) has been sinking lower into negativity since leaving his girl, Stephanie (Molly Sims), making dumb excuses not to attend any social events with his friends, turning down loan applications at his job, saying 'no' to life in general, spending every night blankly watching DVDs in his apartment. Kinda like you're doing right now...One day he meets a crazy coot friend (John Michael Higgins), whose life has changed drastically due to his allegiance with a group who say Yes to everything. Carl attends a 'Say Yes' meeting - overlorded by guru Terrence (Terence Stamp) - and accepts the challenge to Say Yes, to be a Yes Man.And he finds that saying Yes leads to myriad life-changing possibilities, money, success and, of course, panty, in the form of insipid Zooey Deschanel. (The tryst with his 70-year-old neighbor who insists on 'pleasuring him sexually' doesn't count! Oh, great gums a-mighty! How that doesn't count!) YES MAN marks Carrey's return to his forte - that plastic, elastic, bombastic spastic who refuses to grow up.It is obvious which Carrey movie YES MAN resembles - LIAR LIAR (1997), where a birthday wish from his son forced Carrey to Tell the Truth for 24 hours. No such mysticism here, which is this movie's saving grace. Carl's decisions to Say Yes are made under no duress or magic - just a leering curiosity to see where it all leads.And the explicit message is very succinct - that being positive is better than being negative (just don't tell that to a person with AIDS); that it should not be a compulsion or a rule to Say Yes, but a decision; that it opens up possibilities that might not have been created had you said No. Simple.A light-hearted film which doesn't even annoy me when Carrey and Deschanel trip through the usual romantic arc of 'boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-makes-assface-of-himself-to-get-girl-back' which only proves YES MAN advocates the same tired, insidious message of procreation guised as something wondrous and mysterious.How difficult can it be, Humans? When it comes to sex, just say YES.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,1,2,9 May 2009
Milk," Got Rights?
","Life really did begin at 40 for Harvey Milk.Unfortunately, it ended at 48.MILK follows the short, comet-across-the-skies career of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the first gay official elected to public office in the Close-minded United Hypocrite States of America.We meet Milk in the waning hours of his 39th birthday, picking up a stranger (James Franco as Scott Smith). Breakneck pacing, we see the new couple open a camera store in San Francisco's Castro Street, a gay-tolerant neighborhood with the odd dissenter doing the usual 'Man's Law and God's Law' rant.Milk, who gave good megaphone, came of age in an era when police clashes with homosexuals was at its height, the late 60s.Through a series of homophobic public incidents, the bearded and pony-tailed Milk finds his life's calling in his early 40s, as a gay community activist - the self-proclaimed 'Mayor of Castro Street.' After realizing his popularity in a local election, which he loses, he eschews the Haight-Ashbury look for the clean-shaven, three-piece suit, white-collar criminal look.And is elected San Francisco City Supervisor in 1978.Milk constantly butts heads with fellow politician, Dan White (Josh Brolin) over gay rights, leading us to believe that White is either Republican or secretly wants to tap Milk's ass.After Scott Smith has enough of the megaphoning and politics and leaves Milk, Jack Lira (Diego Luna) becomes Milk's high maintenance bitch.Emil Hirsch (who Penn directed in INTO THE WILD, 2007) is Cleve Jones, a high-level organizer and seemingly Milk's successor to the megaphone.Milk's major success stories are crammed into montages - boycotting Coors, stepping in dogshit (uh, passing a law to clean up after dogs) and passing a gay rights bill, as well as constantly campaigning for gay rights against the close-minded douchebags in power.Affecting the local politics, the national voice: singer and god-whore, Anita Bryant leads a startlingly-white organized campaign against homosexuality, claiming she can't read the bible with gays around. Not surprisingly, America listens.Eventually, Dan White can't keep it in his pants any longer and, using a gun in lieu of a dick, pumps Milk full of hot lead.Harvey Milk (1930-1978).No compelling reasons are shown on how White the Politician tipped into the frame of mind to become White the Assassin - guess every politician is a latent felon. I'm sure we're all in agreement. White would be released after five years in prison, on 'the Twinkie Defense,' his lawyers arguing that overeating junk food made him premeditate murder.Makes you wanna shoot someone, doesn't it? Sean Penn loses himself completely in the character of Harvey Milk; from his body language to his speech inflections, his gaiety is flawless, and we cannot see one trace of the barnstorming politician and roaring public speaker he played as Huey Long in ALL THE KING'S MEN (2006). Matter of fact, the performances of all these straight men is invisible - they do not over-fruit it, yet give every indication they crave meat in the seat. In 2009, after the lauded BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (2005) audiences won't stand for anything less.Ironically, I suspect that from this point, there will be less tolerance for 'brave' yet timid films like PHILADELPHIA (1993), which brought the issue of homosexual AIDS into A-List cinema (ten years too late, I might add), yet with nil chemistry and minimal necking between the gay leading man and his lover (Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas).In MILK, it is heartening to see a film where men kissing seems as natural and emotionally satisfying as seeing any hetero couple making out. These actors are so committed, we never question how challenging it might have been for them to imbue their intimate moments with such passion.Jerry Falwell spinning in his septic grave.All 'serious' films about gay rights in America seem to be regarded by straight tolerant people and the gay community with the same sanctity that anti-gay fundamentalists regard holy writ against homosexuality. Truthfully, there should be nothing special about these movies - or about these people, as brave as they might have been. All those protests and riots that America endured during the 60s and 70s does not reflect the braveness of the rioters or the dissenters, as much as the ignorance of American society. It needed to be told truths already outlined in its Constitution, yet that were obscured by malefactors; it needed to be wounded by its own kind to heal itself.As politicians have realized in 2009, 'gay' is now only an issue with voters over thirty. A new breed of hippie (as in 'hip') has been birthed, a new movement of dissenters and anti-authoritarians who couldn't give a Brokeback Mountain over whether people are gay or straight or anywhere in between.They're called kids - ironically, the demographic that anti-gay people are trying to protect from gays. In reality, they're trying to protect THEMSELVES from the kids who are going to vote them out of power some day. That day cannot come soon enough...The world is becoming smoother and rounder - like a gay guy after an exhilarating body-shave - not so much because tolerance is being learned, but because IN-tolerance is being taught less.Milk saw something deeper than ephemeral personal gain in holding political office, 'I'm not a candidate. I'm part of a movement. The Movement is the candidate.' Lesson learned. Apply to wound.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,1,4,28 April 2009
The Prestige," Nolan's Real Magic.
","Godard's Dictum: The cinema is truth 24 frames per second.' Rejoinder: 'The cinema is illusion, is lying 24 frames per second.' *The Prestige* is everything *The Illusionist* wanted to be Â and claimed to be in its trailers Â an unholy tale of a magician seeking arcane Real Magic.Both films are set in 1899 London, but whereas *The Illusionist* is a whiny bitch that tries too hard to please, *The Prestige* is an egomaniac that criss-crosses veins of intrigue and misdirection, pumping you breathless with half-lies and false truths until its powerful climax.In other words, *The Prestige* is the penis to *The Illusionist'*s vagina.Christian Bale (as cockney as he wants to be) is magician Borden, and Hugh Jackman (as suave as X-Man Logan is not) is magician Angier, friends working as audience plants for an elderly magician, whose female assistant is Angier's wife (Piper Perabo, from the Julia Roberts School of big-mouth bass masquerading as beautiful women). In tying an incorrect trick knot one night, Borden accidentally gets Angier's wife killed in a drowning tank, resulting in he and Angier becoming mortal career rivals.Like a Marvel and DC Comics team-up, it's Batman versus Wolverine and, like their alter-egos from other films, Borden (Bale) is the brooding, genius magician whilst Angier (Jackman) is the showman who lives for the quick strike and audience adulation. Borden develops 'The Transported Man,' a trick of such ingenuity Angier believes Borden has tapped into Real Magic, despite the advice of veteran magician's assistant, Cutter (Michael Caine, here playing a kind of Alfred to Borden's Batman and Angier's Wolverine simultaneously).Scarlett Johansson plays Angier's assistant, Olivia, who flits between both magicians as a double-crossing, counter-spying lover and I cannot discern whether her non-believability is because she is 'acting' duplicitous or because she can't act; Much like Vivien Leigh in *A Streetcar Named Desire*, her false style clashes with the other polished principals; either way, chalk it up to another miscast iPod surfer girl amidst acting giants. (I suspect Scarlett continues to work in movies purely on the strength of her heaving mammii.) Cutter's voice-over describes the three stages of a magic act, all quite self-explanatory: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.The movie itself plays out the three stages, as it Pledges with an opening scene that has us believing Borden has killed Angier in a drowning tank; The Turn takes us deep into Borden's and Angier's notebooks, flashbacks within flashbacks showing us Borden, the financially-struggling magician whose incredible tricks are pearls before the swine of London's working class, whilst Angier thrills the bourgeoisie, making up for half-baked tricks with his showmanship; Borden takes a working class wife (Rebecca Hall) and fathers a child, which stokes Angier's hatred, until - The Prestige, which, as Cutter narrates, 'is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.' If you heeded *The Prestige*'s opening line, 'Are you watching closely?' its myriad mysteries would be laid bare as a Catholic priest's homosexual sins. But, like all magicians' audiences, we're here to be misdirected by the magic.Neil Burger's *The Illusionist* (2006) made the mistake of creating illusions which were too complex to be real tricks, but *The Prestige* goes in another direction, calling upon Science to augment the illusions. As Arthur C. Clarke portended: 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' And the scientist enlisted by Angier is none other than 'the man who invented the twentieth century' Â Nikola Tesla, a real life Hungarian inventor, physicist and electrical engineer (played by David Bowie, in the first real acting of his movie career, burying himself in the brow-furrowed role). (If it were not for Tesla's arcane delving into nuclear physics, magnetism, alternating and direct current - yes, Tesla invented AC/DC before Bon Scott and Angus Young - we would not have those blue 'bzzzz' things for Frankenstein movies (Tesla coils) which graduated to those crimson-blue-lightning balls (Plasma globes), also invented by Tesla Â and duly misused at drunken frat parties the world over since).At one point, Tesla states, 'Exact science is not an exact science.' Though this may sound like ammunition for creationists and other lunatics, it is actually true pertaining to Scientific Method, which never lays claim to absolute truths, rather 'transitional truths' Â as new information comes to the fore, obsolete information must necessarily be updated or discarded. Science is pliable, provable, practical.Still, it is ironic that in invoking the effigy of such a great scientist, the movie takes another Turn and actually breaches the bastion of Real Magic, when Tesla (aided by his Igor, Andy Serkis) inadvertently creates a machine that replicates objects exactly. Angier employs this machine onstage (with blue bzzzz's galore, natch) to recreate Borden's Transported Man illusion as 'real,' appearing in two places simultaneously. The catch is: he must actually murder his replica every time he performs the act Â to avoid hundreds of replicated Angiers. Now that's dark. And disturbingly amoral. And I love it.After the morbidity of Angier's chosen path, the movie ramps to an even darker conclusion, with the beauty of this tale's denouement lying not in its twists but in the manner writer-director Christopher Nolan unties the tale's own inescapable knots and proves *himself* the greatest magician of the film as he artfully dodges glaring plot holes and loose ends with his snake-charming sleight of hand.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",9,2,3,30 December 2006
The Terminator," Rise of the Machine (i.e. Arnold).
","Arnold Schwarzenegger as a killing machine with no emotions, big guns belching, outlandish feats of body strength, delivering his lines in a sinister, robotic monotone - hang on, that could be any of his movies. But this movie made him what he is today. What, the Governor of California?...When THE TERMINATOR was released in 1984, Schwarzenegger was already a superstar - 7 Mr. Olympia titles, five-time Mr. Universe, with the CONAN franchise under his belt) â this movie made him a million-dollar mega-star, a household name, an on screen icon.In this James Cameron actioner, Schwarzenegger is the eponymous Terminator, a cyborg from the future (2029), sent back in time by the machines, to 1984 Los Angeles, to 'terminate' Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton, semi-bighaired, man-faced), who will be the mother of John Connor, the man who would lead the human resistance against the machines when they have taken over society in 2029.The humans of the future have also sent back someone through time - Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) - to stop the Terminator and save Sarah Connor.Excellent concept. One major flaw. No, not that Sarah Connor lives in the painful New Wave 1980s with her brainless, bighair girlfriend, not that the Terminator has no eyebrows, not even that lame Brad Fiedel soundtrack that sounds like Oingo without the Boingo - writer-director Cameron artfully dodges the time paradox flaw created simply by sending the Terminator back through time in the first place.You see, if the Terminator succeeds in killing Sarah, she will not birth the leader of the revolution, therefore the Terminator would have no reason to come back and kill her. Ergo, Terminator ceases to exist in 1984. On the other hand, if the Terminator fails to kill Sarah, it must mean the Terminator itself was terminated (for nothing else could make it fail). Either way, the Terminator ceases to exist. Good thing he's just a killing machine with no emotions, i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger.And how effective was John Connor's resistance anyway, that the machines felt threatened enough to kill his mother so that he wouldn't be born? From Reese's apocalyptic flashbacks, human extermination seems to be going quite well for the machines, with Reese and his pals living like rats in sewers, bedraggled and bitchbeaten.And hey! Has anyone stopped to consider that in 2029, they have Time Machines?! - that actually work! So why didn't humans send someone back to pull the plug on the machines taking over in the first place? These anomalies are explained feverishly by Reese to policemen Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen. But nobody's buying it. Especially not the fey police psychiatrist who looks like he took time off from molesting children to question Reese.Both Reese and the Terminator track Sarah Connor to an embarrassing dance club called Tech Noir, spewing the lamest disco possible to represent that era, the female vocals seemingly stuck on the lyric, 'You've got me burning'!,' pony-stepping whitebread patrons looking like honky refugees from a Pat Benatar video.After the shooting starts, Reese utters one of Terminator-dom's magic lines to Sarah, 'Come with me if you want to live!' This is also the movie where Schwarzenegger coins, 'I'll be back!' In this perfect role for someone with no command of the English language, of his seventeen lines of dialog, these three words would become Arnold's catch-cry forever.And he does come back - again and again, in mighty action sequences where he is gunned down, run over, exploded, yet relentlessly recovering and pursuing Sarah, unstoppable, Reese forever warding off the attacks. Reese tells Sarah: '...it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear' (he's right - seen PUMPING IRON?) 'It absolutely will not stop until you are dead.' While they hide out in a roach motel, Reese puts his future-moves on Sarah, calling her a Legend and strong and brave and anything else guaranteed to moisten her man-jeans. And a pick-up line almost as good as the HIGHLANDER'S move of stabbing himself to bed Roxanne Hart: Reese gravel-whispers, 'I've memorized every line on your face. I came across time for you, Sarah. I love you. I always have.' Cue porn music, nakedness, future sperm... and Linda Hamilton getting her banana teats out for The '80s Love Scene, while looking like a man who's having a hard time turning a socket wrench. The thought surely must have crossed Reese's mind as he saw them bananas, 'Boy, Legends are easy. Comedy is hard.' And then Cameron makes an excellent character move - something which no one would dream of making in later Arnold movies after his star had risen to major box-office draw - he terminates Arnold! The flesh is seared off the Terminator in the last act and we see only the steel machine-man endoskeleton (created by legendary Stan Winston) pursue Sarah. This plot development, though robbing Arnold of screen time, drove home the Terminator's relentlessness; how it would literally stop at nothing, not even its flesh coming off, to complete its deadly mission. These are some of the most terrifying sequences of this modern technological horror tale, clinical, un-human; as Reese's warnings come to metal stop-motion fruition: '...It can't be bargained with, can't be reasoned with...'The dicey closeups of Arnold's prosthetic head nearly land this movie in the B-Movie crap heap, though - but we forgive Cameron and Winston; best anyone could do pre-CGI, without selling their soul to George Lucas.Though the Terminator failed in its mission - leaving the future of mankind in the hands of a semi-bighaired, man-faced eighties chick - with the box office grosses nearly hitting the movie's filming budget on its opening weekend, we can be sure of at least one thing: He'll be back.",7,1,3,11 August 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hell-Tilt with the Wheels Comin' Off
","PAN'S LABYRINTH smashed up against the Cantina Sequence from STAR WARS and Guillermo del Toro rode that bad boy all the way to a town called HELLBOY.In HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY, writer-director del Toro has concreted his gleaming vision, found his devil stride, piling spectacle upon wonder upon bombastic fantastic. From Mike Mignola's comicbook character, music by Danny Elfman, Ron Perlman reprising his red-skinned lead role (his insouciance outa control), and eye-candy enough to choke a fragglewump, we almost touch heaven. Throw in Barry Manilow (*Can't Smile Without You*) and it's hell in a leather longcoat.Sequel to HELLBOY (2004, also del Toro's baby) opens with a prologue on his origin (spewed from a dimensional rift during WWII and adopted by American military as defender against paranormal evil), then into a kooky sequence showing Hellboy as a Âuh, hell BOY (who still, surprisingly, looks like Ron Perlman Â but acts like Beaver Cleaver). As young Hellbie watches Howdy Doody, so too are we treated to a puppet show Â in old-school stop-motion Â as Hellbie's adopted father (John Hurt, phoning in a cameo) reads him a bedtime story Â The Legend of the Golden Army, one of those completely illogical sagas that somehow transmogrifies into as 'history' (like the bible). Suffice to say, the Golden Army should not be woken from their endless slumber. Of course, that's JUST what a crazed albino guy doesÂ Prince Nuada (played with sneering British contempt by accomplished music artist, Luke Goss) is the non-human albino guy so rampantly annoyed at everything we surmise he never got enough hugs as a child. (Yet if he hates humans so much, how come he's always speaking English when everyone in the underground kingdom is speaking Undergroundese?) Kills his king dad for a piece of crown to wake the Golden Army; has to kill his albino sis (Anna Walton) for the last piece, but she lams it with Abe Sapien, who immediately falls in love with her even though she's another species.In HELLBOY, it seemed like the paranormal was battling to infiltrate the Real World: in GOLDEN ARMY, the paranormal exists side-by-side with us. Del Toro tries to establish a MEN IN BLACK nonchalance during the opening scenes, showing all manner of wackiness in the paranormal academy, while Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) and Abe Sapien walk right past these oddities while chatting. MEN IN BLACK did it better.It is too contrived here, especially when introducing Hellboy and his manic-depressive firestarter chick, Liz (still Selma Blair), in a stagey couple-fight that makes us feel dirty. Doug Jones is still blue and gilled and ineffectual as Abe Sapien the fish-guy. They are joined by 'ectoplasmic expert,' Johann Krauss (James Dodd, voiced by Seth McFarlane), who looks like a 1950s movie spaceman.Abe Sapien reminds me of Aquaman from DC's Justice League - unless evil was being perpetrated UNDERWATER, he was pretty useless. Abe is an empath, but he is neither a fighter nor a lover; the mentality of a fifteen-year-old virgin boy, which doesn't help when you're confronting foes like WINK Â Nuada's steel-fisted, ten-foot troll.Movie moves quickly from one spectacular vignette to the next Â many times leaving strands dangling, which is why it has *verve*, but lacks *balls*; from the tooth fairy inundation, to the Troll Market (where even 100 viewings would not be enough to assimilate the visually-drooling alienscape), to Hellboy battling an Elemental (a tree-giant forest god that Nuada unleashes to kill Hellboy when he could have simply knifed him instead).During the tree battle, Nuada almost poignantly entreats Hellboy to Come-To-the-Dark-Side, touching on this movie's theme (that the movie itself runs from like a maniac) Â that the very humans Hellboy protects look upon him warily as an outsider. When the forest god dies, it covers the ground with foliage, planting doubt that the humans might in fact be prohibiting Earth-friendly, natural elements from thriving.Before the dissent can wend its way through Hellboy's filed-down horn-growths, he's hitting something else with his Five-Fingered Mary.When Hellboy's life hangs in the balance, they approach the Angel of Death Â a four-winged, hissing, eyeless thing who warns that if Hellboy is revived, his destiny is to destroy Earth with his mystical rock-fist. So Liz Â thinking with her woman-bone instead of her head, chooses Hellboy's life over the Earth's existence Â mighty white of her! Maybe because Hellboy has been busy with his hell-bone and Liz is carrying his, uh, hellspawn Â so I guess she doesn't want to raise the little devil (literally) on her ownÂ what would the paranormal neighbors say?...The inevitable TRANSFORMERS moment arrives when the titular Golden Army comes to life Â '70 times 70 warriors' (let's call it 4900 for the mathematically-challenged) Â all eye-bending CGI machinery, and Hellboy and Krauss go into battlebot mode while Liz and Sapien stand around and hope we don't notice them behind the special effects.As in the original HELLBOY, these dead-end moments are many, where del Toro drops story threads and hopes he will get by on spectacle alone. But if Abe Sapien can learn to cry (even though he has no tear ducts), I'm sure del Toro will one day learn to balance spectacles and testicles.",7,3,7,4 August 2008
Cloverfield," Blair Witch meets Godzilla meets YouTube
","Big secret: what is Cloverfield? They kept the secret pretty well when this movie was in theaters.Not much of a secret. It's a monster. Okay? A big monster that does the Godzilla through Manhattan. The good thing about this banal ripoff is that it is never explained. If you're waiting for the obligatory 'radiation' or 'extra-terrestrial' origin, it won't come.The monster goes 'RAAAARRRGH!', buildings get broke, people get dead. The End.'Cloverfield' is the code name given to the patch of East Coast that has to be nuked to eradicate the monster threat. And on the DVD, we see that the film-makers affectionately referred to the funny-looking, twenty-storey monster as 'Clover.' How cute.Movie opens with a bunch of New York college kids in a hi-rise apartment, throwing a surprise party for one of their own who has scored a VP job overseas, leaving shortly. Was it too clever-clever foreshadowy that he was going to JAPAN? ... You know, city of GODZILLA?The opening party scene is on a hand-held digital camera, operated by one of the douchebags at the party. So it's choppy, shaky, amateurish and - here's the teeth-grinding part - supposedly unscripted. Scenes of people interacting, giving 'impromptu' testimonials, camera walking in on scenes in progress; reminds us of the grand opening wedding sequence in THE GODFATHER - only crap.I kept thinking, 'If this hand-held gimmick goes on for very much longer, I'm gonna start peeling my skin off.' It's not that the kids are BAD actors - they're just bad 'natural' actors. The irony in this age of YouTube and teens-filming-teen-bashings is that these kids can't act like they're NOT on camera! Just as Brando raged onto the scene with The Method, overshadowing the 'theatrical' actors of his day, now we have a new wave of 'reality acting' insinuating itself into our culture, not necessarily 'overshadowing' The Method, but carving a place for itself in certain types of media.On film, unless you do it really well (Gary Oldman's NIL BY MOUTH, Paul Greengrass's UNITED 93), stick to The Method. These kids look like they're ACTING.And it screams inauthentic.Michael Stahl-David is the young VP, who, amongst the decimation, goes in search of his hot girlfriend despite her skyscraper leaning against another one; Jessica Lucas and Lizzy Caplan tag along; T.J. Miller is the douchebag who won't stop filming even when his life depends on it - literally - and Odette Yustman is the hot gf.Written by Dave Goddard, the hand-held format is ingenious in one way, as it provides exposition creatively, and only focuses on the action from he P.O.V. of these few kids, but all the little things start to bother: battery life - the batteries never run out; audio - everyone who we NEED to hear, we hear; the date stamp on screen - it appears whenever necessary, being absent when it threatens to annoy with its intrusion on the action......and it is not implausible that he should continue to film through all the adversity - we're in the generation that does that, unmindful of consequences - but it's implausible WHAT he films. For instance, when a screaming 20-storey monster is rampaging one block away, in clear view, with soldiers firing on it, what sort of a retard would focus on his friends across the street, hiding? See, for the movie's purposes, the camera has to take in as much of the story as possible, whereas if a partying douchebag WAS doing the filming, there is little doubt he'd be transfixed for all of this cam's unlimited battery life by the skyscraper-sized terror right in front of him.There is the iconic image of the decapitated Statue of Liberty - used in all the trailers. Question is: unless this thing came out of the water near Ellis Island, why would it make the tourist trip TO Ellis just to knock the head off that lady in the harbor? Now the giant monster effects are beyond realistic, and its original design was reasonably cool - but then it started dropping off insectoid creatures for the sake of the special effects techs who find it so easy to generate these things now (STARSHIP TROOPERS, KING KONG 2005, LOST IN SPACE). These little crab-like things were a continual annoyance. The movie was on its downslide at this point.Then it REALLY lost me - when it did that thing that all these teen movies do eventually - make unintelligence a favorable trait. The camera guy says, 'Maybe the monster came from a crevasse,' and one of the girls gives him a look like he's talking PLUTONIAN, whereupon this gutless dweeb immediately changes his wording: 'I mean - a crevice.' Nice going, tool! Systematically driving down not only the intelligence level of the country, but the DESIRE to possess intelligence. How come no one ever retorts with, 'I'm not using any words that aren't in the English dictionary. What's your problem, dweeb?!' Immediately on the heels of this stupidity, the chick who gave him the look criticizes him for being stupid! This whole plot device of a guy going after his girl is wearing thin with me. After all the mundanity of a monster knocking over buildings, they dial it down to the level of boring chick-rescue movie, then dial it down further with the deplorable acting when we find the gf with a REBAR beam through her shoulder and in the next scenes, she is raising her arms as if there isn't a gaping wound through her torso. Oh, and that shoddy hand-held camera-work? - the whole nauseous movie! (I need a skin graft...) Then the film-makers pretend like they're blasting out on the edge of originality when they have all our stars die at the end. By that point, I was kinda glad.Oh, did I ruin it for you?",4,0,1,16 September 2008
We Were Soldiers," We Were Soldiers In A Plot-less Movie
","Like the Viet Nam war, We Were Soldiers has no plot. And also like the Viet Nam war, the movie drones on incessantly with half of America saluting it and the other half protesting that it should be ended.The number of isolated incidents Hollywood can potentially mine for movies about WWII or Viet Nam or the Gulf or, more recently, the war sloganed as 'Dumb President Dumb War', is limitless - but seriously, bozos, what's the point? After the hundredth explosion and twentieth empty promise of, 'We will leave no one behind!' and fiftieth guy who dies saving his friend's life, can I now claim my membership in the 'Inured To War Movies' Club and get on with my wretched life? In other words - I GET IT! Put the fake blood down and step away from the Huey. So it's a 'true' story - WHO CARES? There's some running and shouting and explosions - and then there's some running and shouting and explosions. But it's a True Story! - SO WHAT?! Rhubarb rhubarb harumph harumph. (I didn't get a harumph outa that guy!) Tagging any story as 'true' doesn't guarantee that it's worth telling. I bought fourteen rolls of toilet paper today and spoke to a CD replication plant in Santa Ana. True story. Where's my funding?Braveheart's descendant, writer/director Randall Wallace injects human involvement to the point where we shudder to imagine the loss of even one human life Â on ANY side. But this has become a tenet of modern movie-making Â the war film ironically decrying violence. 'Twould be a Profound Testament, were it not for 'All Quiet On The Western Front', or 'Paths Of Glory' or 'The Deer Hunter' or 'Saving Private Ryan' or a hundred other previous films with deeper and larger hearts.And yet, unbelievably, some slick-tongued agent was able to finagle some studio executive into conning some corporate funder into coughing up money to beat out the same old story with different names. I'm not even saying that this was a 'bad' movie (in that Roger Corman/Ed Wood sense of the word), just that it was... 'unnecessary' (in that John Woo/Michael Bay sense of the word).Despite its overall pointlessness, there are many surprisingly good points to this movie. The film-makers actually bothered to TRANSLATE the Vietnamese, which humanized them considerably; most movies of this ilk callously regard 'the enemy' as faceless, unintelligent guerillas who just deserve to die Â but the choice to portray the Viet Cong making military decisions, giving pep talks to their boys in... uh, green? tope? (what WAS the color of their uniform?), allowing the Vietnamese protagonists to express feelings of horror, indecisiveness, heroism, *humanity*, almost evened out the insensitivity shown to that race in every previous war picture to dateÂ Too late the apology Â if this movie were made in an age where war pictures were taken seriously, rather than mushed out in production-line fashion after September 11, 2001, maybe it would have made amends. Instead, it becomes indistinguishable amongst the bilious fad fodder like Black Hawk Down and Behind Enemy Lines. Another plus was the portrayal of the euphemistic 'friendly fire'; I'm sure that in the course of every major battle where no one knew which way was down, up or pan-dimensional, innumerable scores of troops must have been cut down by their own men, although, we realize that in showing this ONE scene, the movie-makers absolve themselves of the implication that this type of incident was commonplace. It is handled, as we would expect Hollywood to handle it, like a mistake that happens as rarely as Dennis Miller resorts to fart jokes for cheap laughs.Of course, all the maudlin attempts at heartstring-tugging were shoveled effusively down our throats, such as the birth of Chris Klein's baby and his subsequent hollow prayer, 'I don't know what god's plan is for me - I hope it's to protect orphans and not make any' - now let's qualify that statement with the word 'AMERICAN orphans', cos you sure as hell made a lot of Vietnamese orphans out on that field today, you mannequin-faced hypocrite.We're aware of his massive range of acting chops, but for this movie, Mel Gibson just cupped one hand and skimmed the surface froth of that deep, deep mug. And speaking of mugs, this movie may have salvaged a few reasonable moments were it not for Mel's egregious mugging at every foreseeable opportunity. His unabashed mugging was to this movie as Chuck Heston's was to Soylent Green. He delivered many monologues, all drenched in red-whaht-en-blue; he made a lot of empty promises (most of them concerned with 'leaving no one behind' blah blah) he oozed a lot of compassion and ultimately, should have quit the movie business after making Braveheart. (Can I get a witness?!? Examine his silly repertoire after that award-winning epic: Pocahontas, Ransom, Conspiracy Theory, The Patriot, What Women Want, Lethal Weapon 4 - to name a few.).So when's the next propaganda due?",3,0,4,2 September 2003
Ocean's Twelve," '1 Louder' than Ocean's Eleven
","Sesame Street is having an aneurysm over this movie's slogan: 'Twelve is the new Eleven.'Having nailed the formula down pat with 'Ocean's Eleven' Â ridiculously implausible action and pulp coincidences, snide and smarmy rock soundtrack (evoking a Guy Ritchie-ish Ã©lan), smash-cuts and wobbling Steadicams, overlapping, smart-ass dialog, and A-List megastars glutting all 70 millimeters of the widescreen Â director Steven Soderbergh now hurls 'Ocean's Twelve' at us like an elitist Upper Class Molotov cocktail and hopes we don't run screaming into the sallow beigeness of our mundane, everyday lives.Filled as it is with man-toys (from Clooney's too-hip instigator, Danny Ocean, to Damon's stuttering novice, Linus, to Pitt's glib Tyler Durden franchise, here named Rusty Ryan) and toy women (the stunningly rapturous Catherine Zeta-Jones as Rusty's ex-sex, Detective Isabel, and the stunningly bland Julia Roberts playing Tess, Ocean's spouse), we find the camera righteously slewing all over creation trying to cram them all in, making for a movie so self-aware of its megastar cheese-wattage that it can't quite get over its own smugness.There is something intrinsically twisted in a society bulked with Middle and Lower Class peons, who would patronize a film centering on the illegal exploits of High Class thieves, tolerating the hijinks of these outlandishly enabled hedonists for the very fact that they are too rich to be stealing for necessity in the first place. It's good to be a man-toy.The megastars quickly exposit why they should all go to Europe for this film (besides to annoy those of us trying to EARN a living): the casino entrepreneur whom they heisted in 'Ocean's Eleven', Benedict (Andy Garcia, foreboding as always), has located them all and craves payback Â with big vig Â so off they traipse to heist Continental rich men for the funds. 'Robin and the Seven Hoods' this ain't Â the rich robbing the rich to pay the rich. See, Lower Class peons, how it all works out for everyone? Thus does malarkey ensue. When their first Euro heist requires a cable shot that cannot be made from one building to another due to the second building being too low, instead of chipping away at the ramparts of the first building, or taking a shot from a *lower* window, these monumentally-thick thieves opt to *raise* the second building 18 inches (via underwater pylon-jacks) to achieve their goal. If you sat in your seat without batting an eye during this incomprehensibly-gratuitous sequence (which would have realistically put Ocean's crew so far into the red financially that they'd be selling their suave man-behinds in Amsterdam just to pay for the plane tickets home), the rest of the plot would make complete sense.If, on the other hand, you are not in the 1-percent of super-thieves currently trawling the French Riviera billionaire circuit, or if you have not the faintest clue where to purchase building-raising pylons with digital leveling readouts, the plot will become one sad contrivance after the next, magically twisting in on itself whenever it wants to pull another double-con on its audience.In touch with reality about as solidly as Michael Jackson, the movie's prime directive is eventually established - a thievery competition between Ocean's Eleven and acclaimed Euro thief, the Night Fox (Vincent Cassell, suitably Continentally Charming-yet-Treacherous).The competition's Prize is housed in a museum room rife with laser fields Â which begs the question: when is a security company going to produce a laser field that actually encloses the object it is guarding? From 'Entrapment' (where Zeta-Jones herself breaches a laser field), to 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,' laser fields only exist in movies to illustrate how pragmatically they can be breached, and are as much a hindrance to super-thieves as geriatric rent-a-guards. With a climactic soundtrack lifted from Iron Butterfly's 'In A Gadda Da Vida,' the grand double-triple-con goes into effect Â with Julia Roberts suddenly playing Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis suddenly turning up for added camera-slewing, and everyone else getting arrested and clanked into a cell, isolated from any *real* perps lest their luscious posteriors suffer the brunt of caged man-lust.Ultimately, Ocean and the Night Fox face off to explain to the addled audience (replete with crash-cut visuals) the obvious discrepancies and plot holes that we wanted to slap the screenwriter over. After the Night Fox gets his Bond-Villain on, revealing his methods in heisting the Prize Â including a scene of break-dancing through that vaunted laser field - Ocean accounts what *really* transpired during the heist. It's suddenly 'Rashomon' with man-toys.As in this film's predecessor, seems like a heist can only be pulled off successfully in past tense. Clooney should wipe that smirk off his face before someone slaps it off.As for the two women in the mix (Isabel, out to bust Rusty's taut butt, and Tess, incessantly prodding Ocean to renounce thievery) - seems they were only hounding their men until a big enough heist brought in enough income to reconcile them with Crime being a viable vocation. The final scene sees all these megastars partying around a poker table Â which speaks volumes about the vapid principles that the women supposedly stood on.In moving out from under the daunting yet protective shadow of the Sinatra-based 'Eleven,' Soderbergh's 'Twelve' was less financially-successful than its predecessor. In deference to this genre's trend, all the bombast, neo-realism and implausibility must necessarily be ratcheted up on successive sequels, thereby we can rest assured that, although Sesame Street may cringe in anguish, 'Thirteen will be the new Zero.'(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",6,0,0,22 November 2005
Snatch," 'Snatch' will grab.
","Released on the heels of his stylishly dangerous 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' 'Snatch' simultaneously solidified the grit-edged, flamethrower directorial style of Guy Ritchie, even as it launched Jason Statham into his 'Transporter' leading man roles; heralded an altogether explosive performance from Alan Ford as Brick Top; proved yet again the go-to value of Rade Sherbedgia as generic Slovakian Hard Guy (even though no two publications can agree on the spelling of his name); saw Dennis Farina reprising his smarm-jockey from 'Get Shorty'; was a hilarious continuation of Vinnie Jones' unbalanced contract killer from 'Lock, Stock,' and marked Bradley Pitt's first foray into incoherent mumbling whilst covered in tattoos and poo.With a soundtrack as impertinent as its plot and as foreboding as the felons who populate it, edited with a verve which could snap your cervical vertebrae and shot with a style that will make your eyebrows bleed, 'Snatch' is a Molotov cocktail of a movie; a careening, chain-wielding maniac of a film.It's about incompetent thugs and incomprehensible gypsies. It's about Desert Eagle point five-oh's and fist-sized, dog-swallowed diamonds. It's about bare-knuckle street fighting, for gangsters who breed people-eating pigs. No good guys and no bad guys - only bad guys and badder guys.Indescribable at best, inexplicable at worst, who knows exactly what is going on in 'Snatch,' except maybe Guy Ritchie - and only when he's drunk.Compulsive gambler, Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) must deliver from London to New York an 86-carat diamond to Cousin Avi (Farina), but Boris the Blade (Sherbedgia) gets in the way, via his small-time help, Vincent and Sol, simultaneously igniting the wrath of sadistic underworld kingpin, Brick Top (who would just as readily suffocate you with a plastic bag or feed you to a pig as deign to scathe your manhood with his cockney insults). So Cousin Avi must jump-cut travel to England and employ Bullet Tooth Tony (Jones) to retrieve the gem.Disparate plots and subplots intertwine like choker vines - with dialog so lushly British you could smell the fish 'n' chips and comedy so sharp you could paper-cut your tongue on it.In a seemingly removed throughline, Turkish (Statham) and his marginally-tolerated sidekick, Tommy (Stephen Graham) get themselves deep into devil dealings over bare-knuckle boxing matches with Brick Top and must tactfully employ the very fighter who put their star fighter out of commission - the 'harder than a coffin nail' gypsy, Mickey (Pitt). Refusing to play the game of taking dives, Mickey gets Turkish and Tommy into even deeper devilry when his freight-train right hook fells Brick Top's bet-winning boxer.Freeze frames, crash-cuts, slomo, chronological reversal, whip zooms, contrast-treated frames, follow-frames, Batman angles - Ritchie relishes throwing the baby and the bathwater at the viewer, garnering his fair share of stylistic detractors. Ultimately, 'Snatch' is not designed for 'The Wedding Planner' set.In the final few minutes, the disparate threads coalesce and the diamonds and dogs and boxers and blaggings all somehow crazily make sense.But only when you're drunk.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",9,0,1,6 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Jedi Mind(less) Trick
","Another day. Another Death Star.The Galactic Empire has returned with another planet-sized space station to terrorize the galaxy - a fantastic visual of skeletal steel framework on the scale of a planet. And the Rebel Alliance has returned to break it. The Jedi Knights have returned as well, with Luke Skywalker continuing the legacy of the humorless old farts by dressing in black and channeling Burt Lancaster.George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan write, and Richard Marquand directs RETURN OF THE JEDI, opening once again with a text crawl that says nothing. In ominous chords, the Imperial Sith Lord Darth makes a visit to the Death Star to ensure progress continues, for the Emperor himself (Ian McDiarmid, wizened beyond the help of Olay) is scheduled for a visit.Meanwhile, Our Heroes (C-3PO, R2-D2, Han, Chewbacca, Leia and Luke) are in another fine mess, in the palace of evil Jabba the Hutt. (a combination of stale blubber and cancerous liposuction runoff). Han Solo (Harrison Ford), frozen in carbonite, is almost rescued by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who, in turn, is made the tastiest slave girl fourteen-year-old boys could possibly fantasize over.Into the belly of Jabba's lair strides Luke (Mark Hamill), like an out-of-work acolyte, to rescue Our Heroes with his 'hokey religion and ancient weapons.' Like a True Jedi. And gets captured. Like an out-of-work acolyte.After Luke battles the aptly-named rancor (a triumph of stop-motion spectacle) and wins, no one in Jabba's employ advises the cancerous blob that it would save on energy, resources, manpower, screen time and efx budget if someone would just blast all the Rebels and be done with it. Instead, they invent the Batman Procrastination-Death: Jabba tries to cast everyone into the Pit of Sarlacc, all pomp and circumstance and a thousand opportunities to escape. Which they do.A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a galactic empire fell, and we descendants of those worlds at war, only hear the WINNERS' points of view. That is, the Rebels Without A Cause. Like all history, it is skewed to make the winners look 'right.' But were they? The Empire kept order. They battle the Rebel Alliance seemingly just because the Rebel Alliance are battling them.Viewers never question what the rebels were actually fighting for. Well, 'peace,' for one thing. But the galaxy was AT peace until the Rebels started fighting FOR it. The Empire are so powerful 'star systems bowed down before them' but what exactly does this mean? Why must 'empires' be synonymous with evil, like corporations? There is really no difference between the Empire and the Alliance, except the costumes were shinier and the music was scarier.In EPISODE I, slavery is condoned - in a political system long before the Empire came to prominence. Did the Alliance fight to stop slavery? No. By EPISODE VI, there are still no salient issues they are fighting 'for.' I guess that's why they're called Rebels, for the mere act of 'rebelling.' We are told they are the good guys unquestioningly; blindly. And you know what happens then - religion is invented.Cue the Jedi.Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears to Luke and rationalizes his lie about Vader 'killing' Luke's father by saying, 'So what I told you was true... from a certain point of view.' With steam comin' outa his ears, Luke retorts, 'A 'certain point of view'?' The story of STAR WARS Compleat is 'a certain point of view.' And if the Empire runs business networks and trade routes galaxywide, in defeating them, the Alliance would only throw galactic business into disarray. But then, Luke and his pals are only dethroning figureheads. Like any corporate machine, it could run automatically until new figureheads are in place. Now I'm all for keeping order in the galaxy, through the use of reasonable taxes, the trade federation and the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet â it's the freakin' REBELS throwing things out of whack with their spies and ersatz princesses and wookiees wearing no pants.Climactic action is split into three parts - Han and Leia on the forest moon of Endor ally with Ewoks (were these things meant to be cute or annoying?) to nullify the Death Star's deflector shield; Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and a puppet lead a space battle against the Imperial star destroyers; and on the Death Star itself, Darth Vader (now a good guy who only wants the best for his son) must stop Luke doing Burt Lancaster impressions in front of the Emperor, who is having just too much fun being fey.In space, the dogfights continue like Spitfires against Messerschmitts.At the end of the day, the Empire only lasted about thirty years, from EPISODE I to EPISODE VI. The Jedi would constantly pule about some 'chosen one' bringing balance to the Force (meaning Darth Vader) while the Sith would sneer that the Dark Side was stronger (meaning Darth Vader). Both hokey religions were wrong. But no one seems to notice.The biggest mind trick the Jedi ever played on us was making us believe George Lucas knew what he was doing. No doubt RETURN OF THE JEDI is exceptional stuff, with John Williams's orchestral score once again simply magnificent, the best effects money could buy, the broad strokes of redemption, friendship and unity amidst the matte paintings and explosions; yet ROTJ is full of gaping holes, ignorant non-science and silly rationalizations, which no amount of 'authorized' websites can re-imagine into sensibility.I'd go through all the asinine plot holes and physics anomalies, but - as some gutless pilot once wailed, 'There's too many of them!' --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,0,1,16 August 2009
The Expendables," The Man Show.
","Ladies, don't go near this movie if you don't want to get pregnant.Sylvester Stallone and his man-team infiltrate a junta compound to rescue a chick. Explosions. Gunfire. Wrestling matches. Man-banter. Big explosions. Then some bigger explosions. Then an explosion so big it will rattle the testosterone right out of your ballsac and into the nearest female's womb. That's how manly THE EXPENDABLES is...As a boy's action-adventure movie, THE EXPENDABLES delivers, with hand-to-hand, gun-to-gun, wall-to-wall, ball-to-ball man-sweat; hot women (Giselle ItiÃ©, Charisma Carpenter) and a cool seaplane; hella fun, with hard action, hard livin' and forearms as hard as roped steel cables.Seems Stallone has given up trying to impress audiences with his considerable acting talent and opted, in his autumn, to revert back to the gunmetal thunder of his macho youth that involved beating up people and baritone mumbles. (Autumn? At 64, still built like a freight train. Now that's the power of will, the power of diet, the power of, uh, steroids.) Stallone heads a mercenary team informally known as The Expendables, which includes Jason Statham (most agile), Jet Li (most diminutive), Terry Crews (most trapezius), Randy Couture (most xtreme) and Dolph Lundgren (most junkie giant). Eric Roberts (most B-Movie) is the villain, with Steve Austin (most neck) as his muscle. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis cameo in a man-banter scene with Stallone that makes its own semen sandwich. Mickey Rourke (most tattooed) is an ex-member of the boy band, who surprisingly turns out to be the heart of the movie.It is Mickey's tragic baritone mumbling about how he could have saved one woman's life, after taking so many lives in a war zone, that spurs Stallone into going non-merc and rescuing one of the hot women for free (apparently to redeem his soul, but mostly cos she looked like a Euro runway model), and our hearts go out to him and his boys for having to kill all those faceless junta drogues who can't hit the side of a barn with their machine guns and army training.A wet-dream tough guy ensemble, Stallone directs and co-writes and beats up people and baritone mumbles.",5,0,3,20 August 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," A wondrously grim fairy tale.
","PAN'S LABYRINTH is a fairy tale, but it's not for kids. Ironically, the fairy tales that are for kids are as dark as this tale.Spanish with English subtitles.Set in the lush woodlands of 1944 Spain, during the waning of WWII, young bookworm Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) move into an army barracks with stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi LÃÂ³pez), a ruthless fascist, bent on weeding out the last resistance fighters hiding out in the woods. Maribel VerdÃÂº is their maid, secretly aiding the resistance.The marketing for PAN'S LABYRINTH is misleading, where they push the magical wonders. You won't find monsters appearing around every turn, rather, Guillermo del Toro writes and directs this very grim fairy tale as a drama, rooted in the real world of war - violent, painful and unforgiving. Ofelia escapes this world of constant suffering by becoming a part of the imaginative books she devours.Unlike Jim Henson's LABYRINTH (1986) where a girl is transported to a magical world wholly separate from ours, the 'magical' world in PAN'S LABYRINTH is so woven into the fabric of the real world that the transitions between the two are seamless and we don't get the sense of being transported to another dimension, so much as the magical world infiltrating into ours.One night, a fairy leads Ofelia into the labyrinth behind the barracks, where she meets El Fauno - Pan - who informs her she is a long-lost princess of a subterranean world and can only return to her true father, the underworld king, by completing three tasks. It's the old Three Tasks gag again, in a modern movie about ancient occultism.Doug Jones (HELLBOY's Abe Sapien) is Fauno, a faun unlike any you've ever seen; designed to look like he sprang from the living Earth, half-humanoid, half-goat, twigs and gnarled bark his skin. Although I think this is the first time I've heard a mythical beast speak Spanish. All those old Euro Sinbad tales and Italian Hercules movies always overdubbed English, so we take it for granted that - like STAR TREK - every un-human in every culture has to speak English for our convenience. It is almost jarring to hear Fauno use the language of the day-worker soliciting for odd jobs outside Home Depot. (Although he doesn't look as scary as some of them.) Doug Jones also plays The Pale Man, a gangrel creature who presides over an uneaten banquet, who has to insert eyes into his hands to see.The gore in PAN'S LABYRINTH is an organic part of its violent reality and comes at us gruesome and shocking; a doctor saws off a man's leg - without anesthetic!; there are point-blank executions; Maribel VerdÃÂº never gets to show off her magnificent figure under those frumpy maid skirts, but goes hog-wild with a kitchen knife; Captain Vidal tortures a prisoner with a hammer, before his own cheek is sliced open and he must stitch it together - in closeup! Like every fairy tale - were it to be examined deeply - there is a disturbing resolution, as Ofelia tries to save her newborn baby brother and discovers that Fauno seeks to sacrifice him to the Labyrinth - the portal to the lower world is opened by the 'blood of an innocent.' The only fairy tale I can think of more gruesome is the King James Bible.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,4,12,4 October 2009
Knocked Up," Stretchmark Benchmark.
","'Marriage is an institution. And you have to be crazy to be in an institution.' -- Gene Simmons.One could say KNOCKED UP is writer-director Judd Apatow's baby - and as malformed as the rest of his hobgoblin brood.Seth Rogen is Ben, a shiftless layabout (rooming with a menagerie of oafs: Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr) who somehow manages to knock up porn-sexy career woman, Alison (Katherine Heigl), on a girls' night out and must then deal with the consequences.And consequences there are. KNOCKED UP separates itself from the Chick Flick pack - like an embryo detaching itself from a uterine wall - by showing us what happens *after* the doughy guy gets the hot girl. Not just the CreditsÂ mundanity, discomfort, stagnationÂ Still, Seth Rogen makes the drudgery surprisingly bearable ('Do you want to do it doggie style?' 'You're not going to f*** me like a dog.' 'It's doggie *style.* It's just the style. We don't have to go outside or anything').KNOCKED UP is not your average 'romantic comedy' with the mandatory maudlin marriage message. It is laser focused on the comedy - let's face it, the 'romance' is pretty much over and done once she gets 'knocked up' - with unexpected laughs at every turn, great galloping guffaws from stupid situations (heralding Eric Bana as the resurrector of Jewish Pride in MUNICH; The Boys pretending to blow each other while Ben is on the phone to Alison; the worried summation of Ben's dancing skills, 'He's doing the dice thing too much!'); lovably disheveled characters, snappy dialog and earthly woes (middle age, kids, sex becoming stale...).And though the immaturity of Ben and his roomies is quite apparent (from their asinine, amorphous get-rich-quick scheme of launching a naked celebrity website - until they discover Mr. Skin), the movie itself becomes very responsible with its exploration of pregnancy from every angle: abortion, forced marriage, a relationship based on an accident, etc. It rationalizes too hard on why this situation cannot be resolved with a quick 'I won't say it but it rhymes with shmashmortion.' And that may be a stretch (er â pun intended?), but at least KNOCKED UP brushes aside that hideous chick flick fantasy that marriage is some sanctimonious institution that everyone should aim towards, where all happiness begins and all loneliness ends.Here, it's a pretty horrible state of duplicity, with uber-ad-libber Paul Rudd sneaking out on wife Leslie Mann so much, she thinks he is cheating on her, only to find he is sneaking out to play fantasy baseball. As Bill Maher says, 'The sexiest woman in the world â somebody's sick of f***ing her!' As for how a smokin' tamale like Alison could ever fall for a jobless, unambitious slob like Ben - no matter how much they hang together for support, or how deeply he cares for her or how hard he makes her laugh over the course of their pregnancy-courtship - well, that's the real fantasy...",7,0,2,11 August 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Slashing Singing Scissorhands
","Edward Scissorhands is all grown up! Never more apparent than when Johnny Depp (as the eponymous demon barber, Sweeney Todd) holds aloft a gleaming razor and boldly affirms in song: 'At last! My right arm is complete again!' Violent, gruesome, blackly hilarious, deliriously entertaining, director Tim Burton's vision of *Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street* is a wild cry of bloodlust put to song.The tale of *Sweeney Todd* is apocryphal at best, but it makes for a grand murderous musical: a naÃ¯ve London barber, Benjamin Barker (Depp, *sans* eye-liner) with a wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and young child, is deported by a lustful judge (Alan Rickman) on false charges, so that the judge could carnalize the barber's wife and raise the barber's child to young womanhood (Jayne Wisener), with intent to have carnal relations with *her* also. After years in exile, the barber returns, wearing more eye-liner than Twisted Sister, more Aquanet than C.C. DeVille, with a new alias, Sweeney Todd. Opening a homicidal barber's shop above a flagging meat pie shop, owned by Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter, looking more Edward Scissorhands than even Johnny Depp), Sweeney turns the corpses he makes into the pies she bakes; his single-minded goal - to get his deporting Judge in the barber's chair and give him the closest of shaves (wink bloody wink).As Sweeney sails into London harbor, he croaks his first pessimistic lines (*No Place Like London*): 'There's a hole in the world like a great black pit / And it's filled with people who are filled with sh_t! / And its morals aren't worth what a pig can spitÂ' Then he spends the movie proving it.The most urgent question asked of this production is: 'So can Johnny Depp sing?' Yes, of course he can. So too can everyone else in the cast. A production of this size would not allow less-than-exemplary performances to make the finished cut. What do people expect they're going to hear? Breaking voices and flat notes? Alan Rickman's Judge is probably the 'Oliver Reed' of the bunch, falling back on the untrained singer's 'talking/singing' technique.Screenplayed by John Logan, Steven Sondheim's numbers are edited for Hollywood-movie-length and, though none could be regarded as 'classics,' are generally snappy enough to move the story along briskly; the only reprise that garnered repose being *Johanna*, the daughter's theme Â every time someone started puling 'Johaaaaana!' my eyelids grew heavy.Sacha Baron Cohen Â back after *Borat* Â slam-dunks his hilarious cameo to the canvas as a rival barber, Signor Adolfo Pirelli, who unwittingly exposes Sweeney's barbering talents in public, whereupon the Judge's liege, Beadle Bamford (deliciously lecherous Timothy Spall), books a shave for the judge at Sweeney's new establishment. Narrowly missing his throat-cutting opportunity with the Judge, Sweeney falls into insanity, installing a tilt-a-chair that drops his arterially-spurting victims down a chute and onto their heads Â hard - in the concrete basement of Mrs. Lovett's Pie Shoppe.Mrs. Lovett only has raccoon eyes for Sweeney, who only has sunken eyes for his razors and there is a smart overlapping of vocals where they are both singing the same line, her to him, and him to his razors in *My Friends*: 'Come let me hold you / Now, with a sigh, you grow warm in my hand / My friend! / My clever friend...' Another smart double-vocal is when the Judge is in the chair and sharing thoughts with Sweeney over *Pretty Women*: though they sing the words in unison, Sweeney is remembering his lost wife, while the Judge is perversely thinking of his underage charge and Sweeney's daughter, Johanna. 'Sitting in the window or / Standing on the stair / Something in them cheers the air. / Pretty women.' In a surprising turn of fortune, the more Mrs. Lovett grinds and bakes Sweeney's unfortunate customers into her meat pies, the more successful the pie shop becomes. Still, her grinding machine could do a better job, as their young apprentice finds fingers and feet aplenty garnishing the upper crust of his pastry. Nonetheless, I must admit that seeing the grand meat pie again (a novelty food indigenous to British and Australian shores) made me hanker for one, no matter *what* flesh was ground into it!) It was pleasantly surprising to see that Burton never stayed his hand when it came to brutality. *Sweeney* earns its R rating decisively, with many a spurting carotid being accompanied by joyous song. That's what makes it so funny! The film is unnaturally leached of all color except blood-red, and the set design and cinematography are impeccably Burton.There is a subplot of a young sailor (Jamie Campbell Bower) rescuing Johanna from the clutches of the Judge, and there are tale twists where we hold our breath that Sweeney is going to do something regretful Â and parts where Sweeney DOES in fact do something regretful - all winding to an inevitable climax that merely proves the philosophy of both protagonists in the story, Judge and Sweeney alike: that all men have done something in their lives for which they deserve to die.'There's a hole in the world like a great black pit / And it's filled with people who are filled with sh_t!' Mmm! I feel like a feet pie!",8,1,3,7 January 2008
Blades of Glory," On thin ice.
","How much gayer can BLADES OF GLORY possibly be? Answer: None more gay.The words 'Will Ferrell' and 'professional sports' have no reason to be in the same sentence together. Somehow they keep happening.In BLADES OF GLORY, Ferrell is ice skating champion Chazz Michael Michaels, whose raunchy routines on the ice earned him the moniker 'skating's outlaw'; Jon Heder is ice skating wonderboy Jimmy MacElroy, whose strict stepfather (William Fichtner) raised him for one purpose - to be a gold medalist. When Jimmy ties Chazz for a gold medal, that isn't good enough for Jimmy's dad, who promptly abandons him.On the medal podium, Jimmy and Chazz publicly brawl and are banned from ice skating forever. But a loophole in the rules (pointed out by their fanatic stalker, Nick Swardson) allows them to compete as a sensual doubles team.Let the gaiety begin.Craig T. Nelson is the boys' coach, whose dream is to pull off a complicated routine that will either win them the gold - or get them decapitated. Real life married couple Will Arnett and Amy Poehler are the ambiguously incestuous brother and sister ice skating team who stoop to dastardly lengths to defeat Jimmy and Chazz.BLADES has many funny moments; Ferrell once again shows off his weirdly misshapen body for maximum laughs, he boasts of his 'ink' (tattoos reminding him of wild sexual conquests), and he is a practicing sex addict.Jon Heder (looking pretty as a girl, only with a bigger vagina - sorry, those are his lips) still has only one character in his acting arsenal - the Napoleon Dynamite - and he's gonna one-trick that pony till menopause.The final skatedown is a blade runner's cream dream, as Chazz and Jimmy become one on the rink in a series of maneuvers that would look risquÃ© even if a man and woman were doing them; with Jimmy and Chazz scissoring and sixty-nining, it is positively delightful. If you're homosexual.As one commentator says, when asked about the teaming of Chazz and Jimmy, 'As if skating wasn't gay enough already...'",Null,3,6,30 December 2010
Horrible Bosses," HitchcockÂ Hitch-Not
","Well, two out of three ain't bad. Two out of three HORRIBLE BOSSES, that is. There's Kevin Spacey as Boss #1, reprising his role from SWIMMING WITH SHARKS as pure A-Hole; there's Colin Farrell as Boss #2, creating an eccentric new role for himself as a balding, paunched lunatic. And there's Jennifer Aniston as Boss #3, supposedly a horrible boss because she's sexually aggressive towards her male employee - but really! What world are we living in, fellas, where Jennifer Aniston making overt advances on your member is a bad thing? In this attempt at black comedy, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day are three wimpy friends who have had enough of their horrible bosses and wish they had the balls to kill them. Flailing for solutions, they meet 'murder consultant' Motherf****r Jones (Jamie Foxx, doing his best Black Man, even though he's been white since 2005), who advises them of the STRANGERS ON A TRAIN method: each of them kill the others' boss, so there will seemingly be no motives. Hitchcock... Hitch-Not. For good measure, someone mentions THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN (the 1987 comedy reimagining of Hitchcock's 1951 STRANGERS). There's a strange self-referential thing going on here, as Charlie Day notes, 'Yeah, that movie with Danny DeVito!' and he's with DeVito every week in TV's IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA. (The fingernails-down-a-blackboard prize must surely go to this movie's casting agency; of the three unbearably annoying guys on SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA, for this movie, they cast the most annoying.) So Aniston's character is a hottie because if she was a fat ugly gunt, that would, ironically, be insulting to the fat ugly gunt ('oh, he's only turning her down because she's fat and he's shallow!'). The only way a man can win against this egregiously acceptable double standard is to be hot. Let's face it, ladies: if a beautiful man (say, Channing Tatum, Ryan Phillipe, Brad Pitt, Bradley Cooper) were harassing you for a date, dropping innuendo or complimenting you excessively in the quest for panty, you wouldn't have any complaints; it's only when the Danny DeVitos, Nick Noltes or Herman Cains drop hints that suddenly your panties are sacred and you're a 'victim' of sexual molestation. Main reason HORRIBLE BOSSES doesn't work: Hot Women Are Not Funny. And Hot Nympho Women are a notch above Hot Women. What man is going to burst out laughing when he's busy surreptitiously trying to unzip his pants in the darkness of a movie theater? Laughing would only get him busted. Bateman and Sudeikis have a few funny moments with their bosses, but Charlie Day's harassment by Aniston gluts the senses of every male who is fantasizing about what he'd do in Day's position: The things we could do with that flat stomach and black lingerie and banana-gulping mouth... Horrible, just horrible.Seth Gordon (FOUR CHRISTMASES) directs, from an overwritten script by three writers who should have had a horrible boss to keep them on track.-- Poffy The Cucumber",6,0,1,24 December 2012
Malcolm X," Malcolm in the Shizzle
","Before MLK, Before O, there was - X.MALCOLM X. A black man fighting for the black man in a white man's world.Denzel Washington is Malcolm Little (whom everyone calls 'Red' for his conked red hair), a petty thief, cocaine addict, prostitute peddler, and all-round small-time gangsta before the term was invented. During the War Years, Malcolm falls in with West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo), plying his trade in Boston and New York, eventually being busted with his long-time friend and accomplice, Shorty (Spike Lee) and sent to jail.In jail, about the time that Jackie Robinson made the major leagues in baseball, Malcolm Little becomes Malcolm X, to shuck off his 'slave name.' So begins the rise to power of one of America's great black leaders. But it is in jail that the movie MALCOLM X falters, as Malcolm's criminal outlook on life flip-flops to that of Islam, schooled by a pushy, annoying, racist fellow convict, Baines (Albert Hall). Malcolm leaves prison as one of Islam's greatest exponents, an articulate, intelligent, outspoken community leader, preaching fire and damnation against the White Man, causing so much civil discomfort (even whilst awakening the self-respect of the black community) that it leads to his assassination by the Nation of Islam.Proving my point about religious hypocrisy.As I write this in 2009, there are 'two' Americas - pre-Obama and post-Obama. Films like MALCOLM X created righteous outrage - but in a post-Obama world that outrage is obviously diluted. The Dream has been realized - where else is there to go for the Black Man? Yes, there will be racism - always. The human animal is built that way. But what more can be done or said than achieving the highest post in the world? The point of films like X was to create righteous outrage so people would aspire to the goal of equality. To that point, X served its purpose bodaciously - in a pre-Obama world. In a post-Obama world, well, the struggle may not be over completely, but the 'outrage' part surely must be. X opens with a burning American flag - power to the peeps an' all dat - but if you burn a flag NOW, isn't that just disrespect to the Black Man? Who happens to also be THE Man? Spike Lee directs MALCOLM X from The Autobiography of Malcolm X, as told to Alex Haley. Though it is not Lee's fault, Malcolm's messages were garbled in religious hypocrisy and overt racism, and the messenger himself precluded this movie becoming an epic due to his small-mindedness; due to not being King: He called the Kennedy assassination 'justice... the chickens coming home to roost,' saying it didn't make him sad, but glad. He called for 'complete separation between the black race and the white race' and subscribed to juvenile mythologies like the Tribe of Shabazz, an ancient race of black kings and queens from whom the Caucasian race descended. (Nowhere nearly as sensible as the Tribe of David where an olive-skinned virgin gave birth to Jesus the Magic Caucasian and started a white race of Christians even though he was a Jew...) Malcolm preaches, 'The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us the white man is the devil.' He doesn't say 'some white men' - he says ALL white men are devils. These are the lessons he learns from that idiot Baines in jail. (I call him an idiot because religious fanaticism is a form of idiocy.) You could play a drinking game to this movie, on every time Malcolm X says, 'The Honorable Elijah Muhammad' and by the end of the movie, you'll be drunk enough to convert to the Nation of Islam.The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, though treated like a deity, was a flesh-and-blood guy, supposedly the apex of spirituality, his exact words: 'I have built this nation under the divine guidance of Allah' - but the old Honorable Elijah Muhammad turns out not so honorable when news is leaked of two teenage girls who have sired children through his heavenly sperm. Malcolm meets with the girls, learns the pornographic truth, and is so disappointed in the Honorable Elijah Muhammad that he splits with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. (Jesus in Purgatory! Now he's got ME doing it!) Malcolm X was a fiery political leader - Denzel's sexuality and charisma are tuned to breaking point on the podium, a perfect role for a perfect black panther - but it's unfortunate he had to resort to the crutch of religion to unite people. After he splits with the Honorabl--yeh, that guy, he has to maintain that his words are now not the Honora-- geez, there's no escaping this guy-- and that his words are his own. Why couldn't he do that from the start? Was Malcolm that weak-minded he needed to lean on the platitudes of a philandering old goat to unite people under a false aegis? Spike Lee's movie-making is stupendous, Denzel's performance, electric. Malcolm X was charisma and brimstone and an inspiration for the black movement. But his message of Islam was plain stupid. I don't take away from the man - he is greater than I will ever be - but the delusion of religion obfuscated his underlying messages and this movie is shot through the prism of Malcolm's religious journey, which weakens the movie.Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom the same faction who called him a religious hypocrite for splitting from them, The Nation of Islam 'under the divine guidance of Allah.' Need I say more about religious hypocrisy, the godlike manner in which they silenced him, or the Honorable Elijah Muhammad? A messianic eulogy ends this powerful film. But it's too late. I'm already drunk.--Poffy The Cucumber",7,2,9,2 January 2013
Nacho Libre," Lotsa Lucha, Lessa Libre
","Apparently, wrestling IS real. A body-shaved Jack Black, squeezing his scrote into a sky-blue leotard and wrestling as a Mexican luchador by night whilst tending orphans during the day as a monk, must have sounded good on paperÂ Greenlighting the writers and director of quirky hit Napoleon Dynamite (Jared and Jerusha Hess) would have also been a no-brainer in this industry that sees your last success as its future income. Add to the mÃ©lange writer Mike White, who penned Black's last storm-bringer, 2003's School Of Rock, and the product of all these A-Listers is - A movie where the phrase 'comedic payoff' is as foreign as its cast.Resting on their Dynamite laurels, the writers seem so self-conscious that any portion of their innocuous dialog may find legs as schoolyard or water cooler catchphrases that no effort is expended in tightening up the lackadaisical pacing, timing, action or script itself. Like its hero, Nacho Libre lacks any kind of punch. (Although the name of Jack's and Mike's new production company hits a home run: Black and White Productions.) Set in a Mexico where everyone is greasier than is racistly possible, and where the first language is English, delivered with an English-as-a-second-language accent, Black is Ignacio, an unwilling monk who tends a poverty-stricken orphanage, with his monk superior doing a Mexican Ray Romano (i.e. being not funny). Into this orphanage comes Sister EncarnaciÃ³n (Ana de la Reguera, trying hard to be mistaken for Penelope Cruz), for no reason other than to give Ignacio blue balls.Obsessed with the Mexican free-style wrestling known as Lucha Libre, Ignacio enlists the aid of a street thief, Esqueleto (anorexic HÃ©ctor JimÃ©nez - or maybe he just looks anorexic next to Black), to partner with him in small-time, underground wrestling matches, body-slamming canvas as his alter-ego, the masked and leotarded Nacho; losing matches with wild abandon, they yet make enough cash to afford fresh food for the orphanage and a pimping' lifestyle for themselves.There is a silly life-lesson attached to this aspect of making money. EncarnaciÃ³n tells Ignacio that fighting is only acceptable in the church's eyes if it is done for someone who needs help. Does no one appreciate that Ignacio's winnings raised the cuisine of the orphanage from feces gruel to Bennigan's Chinese Chicken Salads? Yet the movie pursues this fallacious point as avidly as it resorts to fart jokes when nothing else seems to be working.After losing all his battles - because he was supposedly fighting only for the fame - Nacho wins his last fight, ostensibly because he has re-thunk his attitude to fight for the orphans who need his help - but his spurt of winning spunk only comes when he sees Sister EncarnaciÃ³n enter the arena and visions of nun-pie careen his endorphins. Which effectively means: not only was he not fighting for fame, he was not even fighting for anyone who needed his help - he fights for the reason every animal on earth fights: to impress chicks. (This is, ultimately, the most noble quest of all, from an Earth ecosystem point of view - procreation. Try telling that to people who pretend they are on a 'higher spiritual plane' than the rest of us heathen, by dressing in black smocks and white collars.) Black has still 'got it' and there are two major belly laughs, when he unleashes his 'JB' persona, belting out anthemic paeans in his inimitable Tenacious D idiom (complete with 'bedo-bedo-boopoduuu' horn lines). These moments were, alas, too few to make a difference, Black meeting with the same fate as Jim Carrey in 2005's Fun With Dick and Jane: a super comedian in a role that would have better suited a non-comedian like Rob Schneider or Jason Biggs. With an accent unintentionally vacillating between Tony Montana, Shatner and HervÃ© Villechaize, the Jack Black we automatically laugh at was subsumed by foreign ambiguity.Speaking of foreign ambiguity, Peter Stormare is completely misused as some kind of fey oracle, an opportunity to skewer Connery's Ramirez from Highlander going wanting. All the other wrestlers are one-dimensional, most of them wearing their masks full-time to avoid any kind of humanization, especially the film's cardboard villain, Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez).Nacho's mask is ripped off in the final battle with Ramses for the same reason that all masks and helmets are removed for no apparent reason (Spider-Man, Mission to Mars, Red Planet) - so that during high anxiety, we can see his facial expressions and relate to his emotional palette. Film-makers think we have not yet caught on to this lame gambit.At movie's end, when we realize that Nacho has still not consummated his relationship with Sister EncarnaciÃ³n - and probably never will - so as not to send a message of monk-nun infidelity (as if that would shock a PG-13 audience - maybe for the fact that it is purely a normal heterosexual relationship involving no young boys), we can only grimace, like him, through clenched teeth and blue balls.And, like the rest of the movie, without any punchline, it simply... inoffensively... peters out...",5,0,1,22 July 2006
Elf," Elven Hell.
","Will Ferrell is funny. This movie is not.In *Elf*, Ferrell is Buddy, a normal-sized human raised by Santa's elves (hence, thinks himself an elf), who is sent out into the world ostensibly to find his real daddy, but in reality to get his clumsy, over-sized derriere out of the tiny toy factory. In Christmastime New York, still wearing his elf getup, he discovers his father is Sonny Corleone, which must make him Andy Garcia.Rounding out the cast are bland Zooey Deschanel, inattentive Faizon Love, untalented Andy Richter, drunk Artie Lange, gruff Edward Asner, and cameos by Amy Sedaris, Kyle Gass and director Jon Favreau.Another of those Santa-Is-Real films, with the paradox of insufferably obtuse parents not believing in him even though toys must mysteriously appear under the tree every year.Gags that 'pop' in a 30-second trailer fall absolutely flat in the context of the film and of course, The Message of 'everyone needs to believe in a Fantasy to quell their inherent loathsome selfishness' is delivered with the subtlety of Rosie O'Donnell cannonballing nude into a public swimming pool.Sonny Corleone must whack Santa, and Buddy must whack Joey Zaza as revenge for wiping out the New York dons and everyone lives happily ever after.That's not how it ends.

Shutter Island," Just dropped in - to see what condition my condition was in...
","'The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.' --John Milton, Paradise Lost.What a beautiful, sophisticated, mind-leveling thriller! SHUTTER ISLAND is not 'scary,' but creepy, disturbing and filled with enough tension and intrigue to drown a plush toy.1954: Detective Teddy Daniels (Leo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) on a mission to Shutter Island, an institution for the criminally insane, to investigate the disappearance of a female murderer. The head warden Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) outlines the mystery 'as if she evaporated through the walls.' As Teddy carries out his investigation, things start to fall out of place more readily than they fall into it, and events start to lead Teddy to the conclusion that everyone is conspiring to let this dangerous criminal disappear without helping him locate her. Why then, was he brought here? And why can't he leave? At first, it's because a raging storm cuts off the ferry service. And then...well...SHUTTER ISLAND conjures those fears of walking into a psyche ward and not being able to walk out again, because people start treating YOU as insane. Didn't we learn anything from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST? Teddy arrived with his partner Chuck; halfway through his stay, Dr. Cawley begins asking him, 'What partner? You came here alone.' One of the characters nails the paradox: 'People tell the world you're crazy, and all your protests to the contrary just confirm what they're saying. Once you're declared insane, then anything you do is called part of that insanity; any reasonable protests are denial, any valid fears are paranoia...' Ruffalo is enjoyable as always, bringing a breezy humor to what could have turned into a darker role; Max von Sydow brings enough dark for everyone as a foreboding old doctor; even Elias Koteas, a prisoner whose face looks like it was put together by Victor Frankenstein, isn't as scary as von Sydow; Patricia Clarkson makes an intriguing appearance as a woman hiding out in a cave, who may just be who Teddy is looking for. Or she may just be a figment of his imagination. Or our imagination. Or maybe we're just watching INCEPTION and need to stop kidding ourselves that they'll let us out of here alive...From a novel by Dennis Lehane, Martin Scorcese directs - or should that be 'misdirects'? - brilliantly, never revealing enough information to give away the game, yet egging us on with just enough to tie us into a straightjacket. SHUTTER ISLAND is a Hitchcockian mind-bender that springs such a head trip in its last few minutes that you will watch it again immediately with completely new eyes. And you will see every clue hidden subtly in plain sight.Further, deponent sayeth not.",Null,0,1,23 July 2011
Capote," The movie about the book about the murders.
","CAPOTE, first of all, is not a biopic. It covers a short period in writer Truman Capote's life when he immersed himself in his classic True Crime novel 'In Cold Blood,' the first 'non-fiction novel' of its kind. Published in 1965, this revolutionary book would make Capote the most famous writer in America. And it would suck his soul bone dry, as he never completed another novel before his death in 1984.Directed by Bennett Miller, CAPOTE follows Truman Capote (a trimmer Philip Seymour Hoffman, putting on that outrageous accent and playing fruitier than even his drag queen in FLAWLESS) as he interviews the two killers of the Clutter family in Holcomb Texas in 1959, Richard Hickok (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). He lightbulbed on the idea of a book which would reveal their psyches, as well as the reactions of the townsfolk and the detectives who eventually caught the two killers, led by Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), but didn't bargain on the research being a heartsickening exercise that would take nearly six years of his life, test his skill as an author and his very humanity.This movie is not taken from Capote's book 'In Cold Blood,' but rather from a section of the book by Gerald Clarke, 'Capote: A Biography,' written for the screen by Dan Futterman.Viewing CAPOTE or reading 'In Cold Blood' reminds us of that scientific precept that states you cannot observe a system without becoming a PART OF that system and thereby affecting the outcome of your observations.Upon inserting himself into the story, by becoming so close to the killers that he actually hired powerful lawyers to appeal their cases to the Supreme Court, Capote affected the outcome of his novel; a tale that would keep stretching into the future with no end in sight, because he envisioned the hanging of the killers as closure.Capote (author of 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' 1958) was completely stymied on how to psychologically deal with this new form of fiction he was pioneering; he found himself split into two mental halves - one half empathizing somberly with the quadruple-murderers, while the mercenary side of him surreptitiously picked their brains for book material. Though he admitted a kinship with Perry Smith ('It was like we were raised in the same house, and one day he got up and walked out the back door, and I walked out the front') he would continually lie to him about the book's details.After four years of stays of execution, it was Capote who was having nervous breakdowns because the killers were not being executed. Ergo, his book was in limbo, remaining unfinished. When Smith pleads with him to acquire another lawyer, Capote writes back tersely that he cannot find one. It's a morbid conundrum, as Capote finally wants them dead and so must remove himself from the equation.Catherine Keener plays Capote's childhood friend and confidante, Nelle Harper Lee, whose own book, To Kill a Mockingbird, is published during this period. Only she can tell him truths about himself with impunity.One of the best features of this movie is that, while Capote was openly gay, he is never turned into a punchline - not by the high society depicted in the movie or by the makers of the movie. He lived with his gay lover (Bruce Greenwood) with no ostracism from the entertainment world. Though he was renowned as the life of any party, we only see snippets of his gregarious night life in CAPOTE.Movie is slow-moving but not boring, rather, introspective and disturbing. When Perry is eventually hanged, Capote's tears are not so much for the loss of the man whom he had grown close to, but for the fact that Capote himself could have stayed that man's execution indefinitely if he had chosen to invest in more lawyers; his tears are rage against his own selfish agenda in wanting to complete his book.Capote expressed no joy at the publication of 'In Cold Blood,' feeling like his soul was sold for its research.We feel just as soul-spent by the end of this dark, somber film.",7,2,3,14 July 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," Lucky Number Thirteen
","Like a rehabilitated version of its two retarded brothers, *Ocean's Thirteen* is still eye-candy (primary colors and insatiable set dressing screams at us within the opening five minutes), it is still big band bop underscoring a lavish, hedonist production, it is still man-toys squirming their taut butts through unutterably outlandish scenarios Â but this time 'round, the direction is wiser, the plot is tighter and some of the jokes are actually funny.My expectations going into *Thirteen* were not high Â the Sequel Syndrome, I believed, would eat this production alive as soon as it was greenlit. You know the syndrome Â you've seen it spiral out of control with every 'blockbuster' (how I hate that word) from *X-Men* to *Pirates*; brace yourself for a dumber summer.So when director Steven Soderbergh fills his first act with 'past tense' sequences, showing us the Setup of this heist, I thought we were in for it Â now, not only will the *heist* be in past tense (as in *Ocean's Eleven* and *Twelve* - where man-toys spend inordinate wrap time explaining every detail which we didn't really miss, but were never shown in the first place) Â we're also gonna get the Setup and the Formula and the Solution and everything goddam else in past tense as well! Bluster for luster.But then Â salvation!The story (by Brian Koppelman and David Levien) soon emerges after the first act's unnecessary smash-cutting. Slamming with the scamming without too much glamming. And hooks us - by crook! Reuben (Elliott Gould Â one of Danny Ocean's 'Eleven') has been taken for an investment ride by devious veteran hotelier, Willie Bank (Al Pacino, super-cool, super-cruel, taking over where Andy Garcia left off), leaving Reuben bedridden from a major heart attack. Both Reuben and Bank have 'shook Sinatra's hand' Â a milestone which should forge a tacit bond between them Â so Bank's betrayal is doubly grave, which prompts Ocean (once again, George Clooney) and his Eleven (nay, Remaining Ten, featuring The Damon, The Pitt, The Cheadle *et al*) to seek revenge. In the only way they know how Â through a major con.The boys reconvene in Las Vegas to destroy Bank insidiously, by fixing all the games on opening night in his new super-high-roller casino and busting him. To do this, they must of course pull the most convoluted machinations and confidence tricks this side of Houdini. Usually when heist movies show us 'how it's done' we marvel at how easy it is and why more people aren't heisting, but when the *Ocean's* films show us, it looks so hard and expensive that it's not worth the effort. There are a host of funny subplots: David Paymer as a V.U.P. (Very Unimportant Person) Â a hotel critic mistaken for a regular guest; Casey Affleck and James Caan cause comedic mayhem inciting wage riots at a Mexican dice plant, while Damon seduces Pacino's right-hand woman, Abigail (Ellen Barkin, whose breasts are really barkin'). After twenty minutes of seduction - where Abigail is uncontrollably crawling over Damon's big-nosed character due to a 'Gilroy' aphrodisiac Â she still hasn't shimmied out of her low-cut, sheer, skin-hugging red dress. Are they Iowa teenagers to keep necking that long without nakedness? (Barkin's lucky her breast-aug is so tantalizing, cos she's always had a face that looks like it took second place in a lemon-sucking competition.) Eddie Izzard Â Brit-suave and clinical-cool - is brought in as a kind of super-crim consultant, for the super-security-computers Bank's casino boasts.Vincent Cassell returns as the skulking Night Fox, his presence just screaming Euro Double Cross. Rest assured, the twists are not annoyingly smug Â they straighten themselves out after their initial jolt. One of the more ironic twists is the inclusion of Andy Garcia in the Eleven's roster, who, along with Izzard, gives us the titular '13.' Playing smarmy Benedict again (the hotelier the Eleven heisted in *Twelve*), slicker than an Exxon oil spill, Garcia on screen with Pacino is a heady nostalgia Â their last on screen pairing in the ill-remembered, yet gloriously-powerful *Godfather Part III.* Speaking of *The Godfather,* Reuben paraphrases from his sick bed, 'I hear cars driving up to the house, I hear Linus crying Â why don't you tell me what everyone seems to know.' The last scene reverberates with in-jokes: Clooney to Pitt, alludes to (dare I say it?) Brangelina: 'Settle down, have a coupla kids,' while Pitt in return alludes to *Syriana*: 'Keep the weight off between jobs.'It might seem redundant to note, but this time round, there is much more 'cheating' Â by the film-makers! After describing the maddeningly precise security systems, when Pitt pays off a concierge or when Caan replaces a dumpling with a spiked one, suddenly those security systems see nothing. The security is impossible to subvert when the Eleven decry it, but when they have to actually 'get away' with something, the security is as useless as it is in the real world. I was glad the chicks were M.I.A. Â Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones; there are one-line explanations for each, explaining their absence. (How must that make them feel? Not too indispensable, I bet.) Let's face it Â Vegas is a MAN'S town; we really don't want the spouses sniffing around. And a heist is a MAN'S game; the only roles women ever play in heists are *objects d'sex* (and the Eleven have Brad Pitt for that) and maybe squeezing into tiny airducts where men can't fit (and they have Shaobo Qin for that).This beyond-lavish production has renewed my faith in the ensemble power of man-toys Â and it only helps that the spirit of Sinatra somehow imbues this entry more so than even *Eleven* (2001). I wrote that *Thirteen* would be the new Zero. It's not Â so maybe *Fourteen* will be the new *Godfather Part II.*",7,0,1,23 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," CGI = Cast Grossly Inessential
","No veteran director ever took young George Lucas aside - no John Huston, or Milos Forman Â and advised the neophyte, 'Y'know, George: Less Is More.' Pile upon redundant pile of superfluous computer graphic imagery stuns you into almost not laughing at the ham-handed attempts at characterization and kindergarten dialog in this vacuous corporate merchandising advertisement thinly-disguised as a movie.Lucas can think up The Tale, but he should leave it up to his buddy Spielberg to *tell* it; envisioning grandiose scenes and world-consuming political intrigue is negated by his inability to simply 'direct' actors! Though he has the clout to secure the greatest thespians in the business, he abjectly ignores their interplay in the fictional worlds he forges. Thus this movie's major flaw is its technical *perfection*! - Whilst all Humanity suffered around that perfectionÂThough every press junket lauded his talent, Hayden Christensen brought a wooden-ness to his role (as the nascent Darth Vader) that Christopher Reeve could only dream of bringing to Superman. Analogous to that C-student Bush somehow attaining the office of president, Hayden vapidly doing his line-reads is an inspiration to all C-minus acting students with aspirations of landing an A-movie lead through sheer dumb luck. Setting up audiences for a tie-in deal with Universal Studios for a virtual ride, Hayden and Ewan's first interminable 'action' sequence (through flying traffic) is still not enough to wrest any emotion whatsoever from the bone-chillingly bland Christensen. When he attempted to cry later in the movie, I was crying myself - FROM LAUGHING SO HARD. He may be attired in Jedi robes, but Alec Guinness he ain't! His on screen lip-smudges with Portman exuded all the reticent passion of a Michael Jackson public-woman-kiss.And Portman's inherent sensual heat is utterly lost amidst the clutter of machinery and glutted blue-screen babble. Even her gratuitously-revealing dumb outfits did nothing to propel her plasticism into three-dimensionality.Christopher Lee suddenly appears in the movie, as the raging Count Doofus, having lost his way from The Lord Of The Rings sound-stage and figuring that no one would notice he was playing the same role. I think it bemusing that of all the titles he could have been bequeathed by Lucas, he ended up yet again as a 'Count'. Temuera Morrison, largely unknown in these United States (except for his cataclysmic role in the cult classic Once Were Warriors), was another surprise, as the clone-model bounty hunter Jango Fett, whose freight-train stature lent just that subtle hint of sarcasm to his best line, 'I'm just a simple man, trying to make his way in the universe.'Anthony Daniels returns, clad once again as golden droid C-3PO. Unfortunately, in this movie, he only took over where Jar-Jar Boolum-Head left off in the last one. Lucas seems intent on inserting a staple lowbrow element in this series to keep the Three Stooges fans wetting 'em in the aisles. Whereas Daniels' fey English Butler/Dr. Smith routine only got better in the first three REAL Star Wars movies (ooh, I'm gonna field some geek-flak for THAT one!), as he became more accustomed to the character, we are now subjected to a fusillade of desperately non-funny schtick from Daniels, his vapid repartee obviously culled from out-takes of Mary-Kate & Ashley and The Hogan Family. Describing his role as 'dull and clichÃ©d' does it justice! All that was gold definitely did not glitter this time 'round.Other Real-Life Actors Displaced In This Fantasy Realm: Samuel L. Jackson, as Yoda's sidekick/bitch, Shaft Windu, lightsabre in one hand and Big Kahuna Burger in the other; Jimmy Smits, as the Persian Rug salesman, his wares draped across him like serapes; Jack Thompson, half-heartedly reading his sides about his 'wife being kidnapped or somethingÂ'; Natalie Portman, who was out-acted by her dresses; Ian McDiarmid, as Emperor Palpatine, wearing too much makeup even for the drag-queen role he was playing; one of the Tusken Raiders who was leaning up against a tent as if he was 'acting like a Tusken Raider leaning up against a tent'; and finally, Liam Neeson, as Quim Gone Sour, whose presence in this episode was as powerful as his presence in the last oneÂThree unstoppable real-life actors rose above the morass of CGI fartwork: Christopher Lee (playing a role he has commandeered since time immemorial); Ewan MacGregor (holding his own in the dwarfing shadow of Sir Alec Guinness, whose young counterpart he plays), and Yoda (who was directed by Clint Eastwood). In no uncertain terms, this Jedi UberMeister illustrated why there is such a mythos surrounding his stunted green self, simultaneously proving *he ain't no Muppet*. Throwing down against the mighty Count Doobie, lightsabres clash and burn between Count Vlad and the High Plains Jedi and it is obvious that the only way out for Christopher Lee is to cheat and then run like a girly... More sequels on the way...Or should I say 'PREquels'? The trend of the sequel has arguably been overrun by the last few years' infuriating trend of 'prequels'. To wit: Smallville, the prequel to the Superman saga; the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Young Sherlock Holmes Mysteries, Muppet Babies, Baby Looney Tunes, Before They Were Rock Stars; we have even been subjected to The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years (did anyone even care?); the prequel-to-the-sequel of Silence Of The Lambs - Red Dragon, which is itself a REMAKE (?!?!) of Manhunter. And with bated breath, we await: Batman BeginsÂ.Like Eddie van Halen before him (who did not invent finger-tap, but brought it to the masses), Lucas did not invent the 'prequel', but he will be the person at whose feet will ultimately be laid the blame for the rash of impostors and wannabes to the concept.As Yoda's last words in this film portend, 'The attack of the clones... has begun!...'(Read the unabridged version at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/StarWarsAttackOfTheClones.html)",5,0,1,8 August 2004
Romeo + Juliet," More Comedy Than Tragedie.
","All I'm saying is: Leonardo DiCaprio should stop being prettier than his female co-stars. In *Romeo and Juliet*, snub-nosed Claire Danes bravely steps up to out-femme Leo's manly prettiness. And fails. Leonardo is Romeo (kinda archly poetic, no?) and Claire is his Juliet. Shakespeare's retelling of Ovid's *Pyramus and Thisbe* is retold with creative conceptualizing and high-voltage visuals by Australian thunderboy, director Baz Luhrmann, as an urban gang battle with a decidedly MTV-ian thrust. Alas, Luhrmann's noble idealism in re-inventing the Bard's most famous play for a generation weaned on music videos and boy bands unfortunately falls on ears deaf to irony, sarcasm, double entendre, punning, words larger than six letters and intelligence. Which pretty much rules out Shakespeare's *oeuvre*. Throwing out major portions of text ('Text? What's that?' mumbles Generation X), yet elocuting the remainder verbatim, performances are unevenly astounding, for when the actors can stop shouting at each other in the manner of Entertainment Tonight hosts declaring showbiz headlines, their occasional fluidity creates pockets of crystal clarity that move with the rhythms Shakespeare intended. Alas, it is unsustainable for most of them. Thrown into this mix of varying talents, Dash Mihok, Jamie Kennedy (it was all I could do to stop imagining them prefacing everything with 'Yo yo yoÂ') and DiCaprio stand out like ailing speechaphobics against the menacing fluidity of John Leguizamo, the simple sincerity of Claire Danes and the authoritative Shakespearean veteran, Pete Postlethwaite (still pushing 55, as he was 20 years ago).As Mercutio, cross-dressing Harold Perrineau steals the show in his mini-skirt, bra and command of Shakespearean rhythm. And look at those legs!The precursor to all Chick Flicks, you know the old story: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl drinks poison, boy kills himself, girl wakes up, girl kills herself.

Gone Baby Gone," View to a Hammock
","Casey Affleck (Ben's bro) stars in this controlled, sober, Ben-directed thriller. From a novel by Dennis Lehane, Ben Affleck makes gravy in his directorial debut, about a redneck daughter's kidnapping on the mean streets of Boston. And how his sleepwalking brother saves the day.Surrounded by intrigue and Ed Harris as a detective and Morgan Freeman as the head cop (all doing that ker-ray-zee Boston accent), Casey slouches his way through the role of Patrick Kenzie, a small-time private dick, called in by the aunt of the kidnapped girl, who believes that neophytes Patrick, and his private dick-lover, Angie (Michelle Monaghan) would bring a more personalized approach to the investigation than the callous police.They do - and get in way over their heads, their own personal life impacted by the moral decisions they must make.Genetics is amazing: we can really see Ben in Casey; his career was kickstarted by the OCEAN'S ELEVEN franchise, where we were introduced to his Hammock-on-a-Sunday-afternoon style. As soon as he shouts, we're listening to Ben... He is his own man when in that hammock. Not to say he can't pull out a deft Action passage, as when he is surrounded by rednecks in a bar and mans up in front of his woman to get them out of there with all limbs intact.After a gruesome scene involving another kidnapped child, the discovery of the redneck daughter is anti-climactic, for the kidnappers were not placing her in danger, but rather trying to save her from a life of trailer-trashiness, as exhibited by her mother (played with lowlife brio by Amy Madigan), her every move screaming Easy-After-Two-Vodkas.When moral ambiguity comes, pray it doesn't come as Morgan Freeman. When Morgan Freeman tells you to do the wrong thing - and he tells you it's the right thing - you believe him. It's Morgan Freeman.It took someone as half-asleep as Casey Affleck to resist the pull...",6,2,2,7 October 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," Red, White and Boob.
","In World War II, a patriotic American weakling, Steve Rogers, is injected with a top secret military serum to become a super soldier. Yes, it's Captain America! The red, white and blue avenger, in the best comicbook movie of the decade - and by that I mean, it's lightweight and predictable and aimed at twelve-year-olds.CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER captures all the spirit and action and derring-do of the Marvel Comics character created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby in 1941; just as that blond, blue-eyed super-patriot leaped off the pages in his battle against Hitler, so too does this latest filmic All-American Whitebread prettyboy... Trouble is, besides his interesting origin tale, and despite his iconic flag-wrapped butt, there was never much depth to this particular Marvel Comics superhero in the first place.So I mean it when I say the movie is well made, beautifully shot in ochre hues, with the actors putting alarming conviction into their relatively shallow roles, but Captain America himself (played with body-shaved sincerity by Chris Evans) is just not that interesting a character. All he does is throw his shield and punch people. And leap like Air Jordan, sometimes while throwing his shield and punching people. Thus, after an interesting buildup to the injection of skinny Steve Rogers with super soldier serum, the movie gets down to shield-throwing, punching people and Air Jordaning. Albeit, very nicely.Stanley Tucci is the good doctor Erskine who experiments on Rogers and is killed off much too soon by a German spy. I love The Tucci - what a great actor and underrated director; even in this death scene, his final wordless gesture is magnificently performed - but I think he picked up his 'Cherman' accent by watching HOGAN'S HEROES.Hugo Weaving's Nazi accent is not much better, as I'm sure he's mixing in a little Elvish. He's Jonathan Schmidt aka The Red Skull, also imbued with super serum, but because he's Cherman, he ended up 'bad.' Luckily, he didn't need any makeup to play Cap's craggy-faced nemesis - those cheekbones, like a Swiss model! Toby Jones is the Red Skull's sycophant, and his German accent is so bad, I'm positive he didn't even watch the HOGAN'S HEROES episodes provided by the filmmakers as homework.Tommy Lee Jones is Colonel Chester Philips, who is here to make snide remarks in his characteristic drill-instructor staccato. Hayley Atwell is Cap's G-Rated love interest, and if it weren't for her magnus 36DD-cups straining against her army uniform, we'd notice she looks like Bill Hader. Dominic Cooper is physicist Howard Stark (yes, IRON MAN Tony's father), who creates Cap's shield, and makes Cap jealous by sharing fondue with the Bill Hader chick.And Sebastian Stan is Cap's pal, 'Bucky' Barnes - in the comics, the ambiguously gay Robin to Cap's Batman, in this movie, a rugged heartthrob himself when the mighty man-beauty of Evans is not standing next to him. In tights.When Steve Rogers is a 90-pound weakling, it is Chris Evans's face computer-inserted over a skinny guy; an astonishing special effects feat that makes us realize that the era of the Method Actor gaining or losing weight may be past; just keep those computers rendering and those IT guys fed. Gotta admit that Chris Evans looks exactly what you'd expect an All-American boy to look like, and he's playing THE All-American Boy; that guy must get laid like he's the last man on Earth.Director Joe Johnston (THE WOLFMAN 2010, JURASSIC PARK III) is so erratic that the film 'works' in so many tiny ways (the colorful caricature of Captain America selling war bonds, the gruffness of Tommy Lee Jones disguising his understanding heart, the flip manner in which Captain America refers to himself - and how damn cool is it when he throws that shield?) and simultaneously doesn't work in bigger ways. For example: To intercept a moving train, Cap's squad must slide down a cable - which has no purpose being on that mountain other than to provide their Tinkerbell moment; once onboard the train, they battle bad guys in freight cars with road cases stacked on shelves - with none of the cases strapped down; when the bad guys shoot at Cap and miss (obviously because they've graduated with honors from the Stormtrooper Training Program on Bespin), Toby Jones has to yell at them through their headsets, more than once, 'Kill him! Fire again!' Really? I thought he was free to go after I missed him the first time... Then the Bill Hader chick turns up with her squad of reinforcements. Take note that all the soldiers are in full battle gear including helmets and body armor - all except for Hader. No helmet or body armor. Why? So we can see her pretty hair flounce and watch her breasts straining against the thin fabric of her uniform, her chest heaving like she's on the brink of orgasm. Such a realistic depiction of the horrors of war.I was almost applauding this movie for its attempt at credible science when skinny Steve was placed in the Manulator and doused with Vita-Rays (which, from the results, seem to automatically body-shave you), but then all the machines malfunctioned with Movie Sparks flying out de side. Sparks?! Really? Add that to the catwalk scene where someone must jump across as it collapses, and the climax scene where two men fight onboard a plane that is going down because no one is at the controls and we're just asking for Brendan Fraser.Movie ends with a promise that 'Captain America will return in The Avengers.' Knowing that that movie is being directed by Joss Whedon (the mind behind FIREFLY) makes me almost wanna salute a flag. Or at least punch someone and throw my shield...",6,2,5,24 November 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Badass Bourne becomes Mild Matty.
","There's that SOUTH PARK episode (Red Man's Greed) with the Native Americans named Runs With Premise and Premise Wearing Thin. If THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004) was Runs With Premise, then THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is Premise Wearing Thin.Another karate chop to the Spock Nerve, another car chase through crowded streets with no liability insurance, another amoral superspy whining over his lost humanity, all shot through director Paul Greengrass's furtive Steadicams waggling all over the place like George Clooney's head.Seen it once, seen it at least three times.And you must ask yourself, Are you a Bourne Completist or just a sucker for punishment? Reviewer David Poland favorably compares the BOURNE series to the BOND series. I'm no massive Bond-aphile, but I can judiciously state that with the Bond series, each new movie gave us a new adventure, new nemeses, new escape predicaments, new luscious ladies, even new Bonds in some cases. In the three BOURNE movies to date, there is nothing new - rehashing the same plot and sold to us as some Great Trilogy (like STAR WARS or THE GODFATHER).Directed once again by Paul Greengrass like an epileptic with Attention Deficit Disorder, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM starts from somewhere in the middle of the last movie, and the ending of the last movie becomes the middle of this movie - does that make sense? Doesn't matter.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still running, still trying to find his true identity (that is, the person he was before he was indoctrinated as a superspy), and the CIA (whose modus operandi seems to be to eradicate their own operatives so that illegal sanctions can't be traced back to them) is still chasing him.Joan Allen is still barking orders at the CIA bullpen (don't these people ever sleep? They are literally in their offices around the clock), but now she is joined by the great David Strathairn (wasting his time and talents); button-nosed Julia Stiles makes another contrived appearance. Brian Cox killed himself at the end of the last movie because, we suspect, he just couldn't take any more of the same plot line, but this movie provides a doppelganger to take his place as the crooked CIA boss - Albert Finney. Scott Glenn even tries to scare us with his vampire countenance.Of all the assassins that have been sent for Bourne, the best fight must be that with the cold-blooded Desh (Joey Ansah, who reminds us of the dangerous Tarzan character from THE HARD WORD. When are Bad Guy Organizations going to hire Bad Guys who don't look so obviously like Bad Guys?). Greengrass finds the perfect balance for this fight, reminding us of the best moments from THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002, directed by Doug Liman). Unfortunately, his usual process of herky-jerky cameraworky will hurt your eyes long before the Bad Guys lose interest in Bourne's butt.At least all three of these films' alphabetical order matched their chronological order.Bourne does find answers in this third entry to the BOURNE franchise. Not only does he discover his real name, he discovers what a large asshole he was: in accepting his role as 'Jason Bourne: Assassin' he himself gave up his normal life, which says something about his inherent misanthropy and sociopathic nature. Now he wants to recant his spy life Â but though his spy life is murder and amorality deluxe, what kind of person must he have been prior to becoming 'Jason Bourne' to want to become Jason Bourne in the first place? A discontent, dangerous, amoral, damaged personality that would do anything to escape reality.Matt Damon IS Ann Coulter.",6,0,1,27 March 2009
The Aviator," That Magnificent Man and his Flying Machines
","A powerful biopic of sex, insanity and aeroplanes. In any order.Martin Scorcese directs *The Aviator* based loosely on the life of Howard Hughes, with Leonardo DiCaprio adequately filling the shoes and flying the skies of the eccentric billionaire. (Leo's star status slightly distracts, as does his phony accent. Jim Carrey Â originally slated for the role Â would have pulled off a better visual hook; young Hughes resembled Tyrone Power more than Leo and the older mustachioed Hughes looked more like Bernie from *Weekend at Bernie's*.) Set in an era when Scarface was Paul Muni, not Al Pacino; when Hell's Angels were the U.S. Air Force 303rd Bombardment Group, not the guys who killed Meredith Hunter at Altamont; when Jane Russell, not Pam Anderson, was the dirtiest thing on two boobsÂ*The Aviator* (written by John Logan) follows Hughes from his halcyon days of filming his revolutionary WWII flying aces film, *Hell's Angels* (which would cross over from the silent era to sound, featuring flying sequences to curl toes and splice spleens, and making its star, Jean Harlow, a household name), to his political swashbuckling with airliners and aeroplane building, to his starlet-hopping, to locking himself in his germ-free room drinking his own urine. There is probably not enough time in any feature film to encapsulate the storied misadventures of Hughes, so the breakneck plot touches on everything it can in the time allotted.The film's narrative flits from one vignette to another, almost as if mirroring Hughes' creatively spasming mind: scandal over starlet's flesh (with Iam Holm giving a grand, impromptu lecture on how much boob exposure is too much); many OCD episodes, from being unable to eat meat once an uninvited guest touches his plate, to suddenly obsessing over washing his hands and then not wanting to touch the bathroom door to exit; electronically bugging his lover's house through jealousy; his aeroplane crash which took off tops of houses in Beverly Hills and left him crippled; his political battles over the largest plane ever built, the H4 Hercules, which flew only once in 1947, with him at the controlsÂ With the ultimate phallic symbol at his fingertips, is it any wonder Hughes made mile-high headlines with Ava Gardener (Kate Beckinsale Â mm! lovely!), Katherine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Jean Harlow, (insert any starlet). We can surmise that they didn't fall at Hughes' feet for his looks alone, but because he could fly them to Paris for lunch. The movie portrays Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) as a main squeeze, when in reality she was just another fling. Her character is intimidating enough to throw Hughes momentarily, 'Men can't be friends with women Â they must possess them, or leave them be.' Though she burbles truth, she can't live by her words, as her whole ideology breaks down once she settles in as Howard's toy.Unable to sit still and contemplate anything wisely, Hughes' many mental problems contributed to his diving into unfinished projects, obsessing over small details when the madness took him. He was also a racist - but pretty Leo can't be a racist, so we never see this side of him.At a party, two suspicious looking characters shadow Hughes, who asks his aide, 'Who are those guys? Do they work for me?' 'Everybody works for you, Howard.' Power like that is almost as beautiful as Leo himself.",7,0,2,30 July 2007
Burn After Reading," Guy Ritchie without the Two Smoking Barrels.
","At times funny, at times frenetic, at times foolish, BURN AFTER READING is mostly a lost opportunity with a great ensemble cast.Brad Pitt is a goofball Valley Boy (ten years too old for the role), saying 'shit' to his heart's content, as John Malkovich is a recently-fired CIA agent (perfect for the role), saying 'fuck' to his. George Clooney is in magnum head-waggling mode as another Coen idiot construct, an ex-secret service agent with a proclivity for surfing the web for one-night stands; Frances McDormand is a gym employee (who works with Pitt) who is looking for love in all the wrong chat rooms and hooks up with Clooney.Each character is an extreme stereotype and the plot is woven into their lives through Pitt finding a CD left behind at the gym, which he thinks is classified CIA material. When he and McDormand trace its ownership to Malkovich and try to sell it back to him, complications arise and they end up trying to sell it to the Damn Russkies.Turns out it's only Malko's memoirs, so it's a McGuffin.Written and directed by the erratic, esoteric Coen Brothers, BURN AFTER READING loses itself somewhere amongst the many plot threads and the second act. The comedy is so black it tips into espionage, and the espionage is so moronic, we're sure it's trying to be a black comedy.But then it gets too black with one sudden, accidental kill, which freezes the smile on our faces, wondering whether this kill was meant to be funny - because the character who gets it right between the eyes is completely innocent and was in the middle of a throughline.I like shocking as much as the next nihilist, but the Coens sabotaged their own movie by wiping out this much-loved character in the second act.I wouldn't go so far as some reviewers to state 'Burn After Viewing' - just burn the third act and excise those unfunny CIA segments with J.K. Simmons. Then we've got ourselves a watchable spy comedy that outsmarts GET SMART and is way funnier than QUANTUM OF SOLACE.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,0,2,4 March 2009
Watchmen," Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!
","And the fanboys whine like bitches. The 'unfilmable' graphic novel, WATCHMEN - has been filmed! Cry the beloved comicbook and let slip the dogs of nihilism.WATCHMEN is epic and sexy and bloody; sensual and visceral and brutal; more than a comicbook, more than a messianic cry of madness; flamboyant costumed heroes, a plot that shakes the world and Dr. Manhattan in full frontal ectoplasm.WATCHMEN is a triumph! ...Unless you're a fanboy.The Rorschach Test: One Fan's Classic is Another Fan's Bubastis.And the writer of the graphic novel, Alan Moore (V FOR VENDETTA, 2005) has once again spat the dummy and insisted his name be removed from the WATCHMEN movie, leaving only mediocre artist, Dave Gibbons, credited as 'co-creator.' There's perfectionist - and there's bitchboy. Alan Moore is the latter.Directed by Zack Snyder like the graphic novel panels are emblazoned on the insides of his eyelids, WATCHMEN the movie - like VENDETTA - is ardently true to the spirit of the source material and reverently recreates the world of an alternate 1985, where Nixon has been in office continually since the Viet Nam victory (!), where costumed heroes are part of the crimefighting landscape, where colors scream and morals bend and we hit the ground running in thigh-high boots that are not removed for mile-high sex.The opening montage, showing how the world assimilated these heroes into its culture, is crafted with such care and creativity (with source music from Dylan to Hendrix), I shed a tear at watching the pages of Watchmen come alive. And this was only the opening! Under the Hood: Battle not with Monsters, Lest ye become a Monster...WATCHMEN (written by mad prophet bitchboy Alan Moore, drawn by Dave Gibbons, published in 1986 by DC Comics as a limited 12-issue series) is a 'celebrated graphic novel' because the fantasy world it presents train-wrecks into our reality so closely it hurts our Gotham nerve.BATMAN BEGINS (2005) portended this trend of superhero films being no longer the provenance of teens vicariously living out fantasies with towels tied around necks; THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) continued this journey; now WATCHMEN takes it beyond the Bubastis, raising the bar into dark adulthood, where every sin is a necessity, every moral an ambiguity.None of the heroes have supernatural powers; except for the atomic anomaly, Dr. Manhattan (victim of an 'intrinsic field chamber' accident and able to manipulate molecules at will, and perceive future time streams), they are all versions of Batman and Captain America, well-trained and well-educated athletes with a penchant for vigilantism.And vigilantism - as in this real world - is only tolerated so long. Nixon outlaws 'masks' (as costumed heroes come to be called) - after they help him win Viet Nam, mind you! - and we are thrust into this roaring, breathing work of art during the second generation of masks after they are disbanded.When one of the Watchmen, the abrasive, cynical Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, love-child of Robert Downey Jnr. and Mickey Rourke) is killed mysteriously, the last Watchman on active duty, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), goes on a solitary manhunt to find the killer.He warns fellow ex-Watchman, Dan aka Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), 'An attack on one is an attack on all of us!' Rorschach is the nihilistic conscience of WATCHMEN, a sociopath with principles, wearing a mask that shifts its Rorschach ink-blot patterns continually. He considers this shifting palette his 'true face' - mirroring the ineffable, morally relativistic face of the New York he holds no love for... 'The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout 'Save us!'... and I'll whisper 'No.'' As each Watchman entered the equation, I recognized them immediately - the last such perfect casting being X-MEN (2000). There was, of course, Rorschach's wondrous ever-changing mask; the worrisome dweeb with the weak Chevy Chase lips had to be Dan Dreiber aka Nite Owl II (the faux-Batman guy); the bumblebee hooker with the Pert hair and bad bangs must be Laurie aka Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman); the Bowie-thin Brit is Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) and lemme take a guess that the shimmering blue, hung, naked buff is Jon Osterman aka Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup).And my own chiseled six-pack hardened with delight when I saw Ozymandias's exotic, mutated lynx, Bubastis! WATCHMEN is a wet dream waterfall.The key to WATCHMEN, the grand concept that elevates it above the jungle of super-beings who bust bank-robbers and petty thieves (which are merely the outlying strands of a much larger sociological problem) is Ozymandias saying, 'I fought only the symptoms, leaving the disease unchecked.' Now, as Nixon and the Soviets edge toward nuclear war, Ozymandias, 'the world's smartest man' with unlimited resources, takes it upon himself to attack the disease. To save humankind from itself.Hero? Villain? Spandex-wearing looney? When Spock said 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,' he was regarded as noble because he was sacrificing himself. Ozymandias plots to destroy life as part of a bigger plot to save life. The Comedian's death was a small cog in this world-shaking coup. And the moral dilemma falls to the other Watchmen to either stop him, or stop the truth being told.Though Dr. Manhattan is acclaimed as, 'God exists - and he's American,' Ozymandias's plan to kill millions to save billions is nothing short of godlike. ('...lest ye become a monster.') Superman saving kittens just wouldn't get it.Thus the graphic novel's slogan: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes (Who is going to guard the guards themselves?), or simply, Who watches the Watchmen?--Review by Poffy The Cucumber.",9,4,9,8 April 2009
The Bourne Identity," Bourne To Do It.
","Batman and Steven Segal had a baby, and his name is Jason Bourne.At least, he thinks that's his name.After being pulled unconscious from a European ocean, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, with that overly concerned look on his face that signifies he's Acting) awakens with a head-throbbing case of Selective Amnesia.What else can we call it? He can remember several languages fluently, all the martial arts of Steven Segal, all the espionage tricks of James Bond, all the deductive skills of Batman, all the driving skills of Mario Andretti - but not his name. He doesn't know how he possesses these incredible combat skills and all this pent-up knowledge, but he uses it to his advantage in tracking down his true identity.He's meant to be smart as hell, yet with all the fake passports, the inbuilt survival skills, the numerous bank accounts, explosives and computer knowledge, we figure out much sooner than he does that he's a CIA operative.Apparently, he botched his last kill assignment with a Ugandan named Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who seems like he's doing a bad Eddie Murphy impression, until we realize that it's Eddie Murphy who does such a good Ugandan impression) and he's been on the run ever since.Now the CIA, under slimy Chris Cooper, wants to kill him - because that's just how the CIA shows its love to former agents. And Bourne must use his mad skills to show his love back.Brian Cox is the CIA boss and Clive Owen - long overcoat and all - is a hit-man out to get Bourne. Button-nosed Julia Stiles is a CIA gopher.Bourne's love interest, scored in the silliest Hollywood Meet Cute manner, is Euro chick, Franka Potente (RUN LOLA RUN - ironic, no?).We realize too late that THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a showcase for director Doug Liman to squeeze as many stunts and chases out of a Robert Ludlum novel as possible - apparently, the movie deviates grossly from the book - but it's done artfully and it all takes place in Europe, so it's exotic and sexy.The obligatory car chase thankfully contains a minimum of arbitrary smashes, and when vehicles do crash, they just slam into each other and dent, glass shattering; obviously these cars are not as volatile as American cars that explode on the slightest impact or do flips off the backs of other cars when someone looks at them sideways.In ROUNDERS, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, MR. RIPLEY, Damon was good, but always overshadowed or made to share the spotlight. Here in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, he has found his muscle stride, ripped himself up for the role, an assassin's assassin. With this movie, Damon becomes his own man, no more Mrs. Affleck.THE BOURNE IDENTITY DVD features a tacked-on alternate beginning and ending to 'make it more current' in a post-9/11 world - yet these tags in no way help the film, serving only to add a very lame very beige explanation monologue by Brian Cox and a cringeworthy Hollywood Romantic Ending where lovers run into each others' arms as the outro song starts - Moby's breezy, boppy, catchy little swirl.The biggest stupidity with this alternate material: The filmmakers succinctly state 'We felt there shouldn't be any extra explosions than necessary - that no one will ever watch another movie with another explosion after 9/11,' so they excised many big orange explosions. So how do the idiot marketers describe the Alternate Version on the DVD packaging? - 'THE EXPLOSIVE ALTERNATE VERSION.' The original ending featured a cool ironic resolution: After months apart, Bourne tracked his girl to a scooter hire store where she worked, walked in and asked, 'Can I hire a scooter?' She tries to tamp down her huge joy at seeing him and asks nonchalantly, 'Have you got any I.D.' He answers with a wry smile, 'Not really.' No non-explosions necessary.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,0,1,2 March 2009
Hot Rod," Snot Rod
","Here's one you can watch with a straight face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell wouldn't be in it.There are two laughs in HOT ROD.1. The Punch-Dance. Rod 'needs to go to his quiet place' and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is footloosing a passionate, overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of Europe.2. John Farnham's You're The Voice. In one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist? A major Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early '70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it leveled mountains in Switzerland.Besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit.Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yeh, someone actually thought that was funny.Without one jump under his starry belt, he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever... who watches these movies for plot anyway? Along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), he scores a salubrious chick (Isla Fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser.Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must've lost a bet to be here.",2,4,12,22 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Movie as fully realized as The Book
","Dare I opine that the effects in this movie are unequalled in modern film-making? To wit: the magnificent, subterranean Goblin Hall (a CGI architecture masterpiece, 200-foot pillars stretching into shrouded distance); the hybrid orc at the tomb of Balin (a giant lumpy thing with the speed of a train and the relentlessness of Herpes Simplex B); the crumbling stone stairs, (a gratuitous flexing of effects muscle, which leaves one to assume that it was created merely to annoy George Lucas); Bilbo's initial meeting with Gandalf (a masterful handling of double-camera technique so subtle that it took a few moments to even realize your eyesight was being exploited); and so it went, each effect only enhancing the credibility of this incredible tale, paradoxically making this Fantasy World seem more 'real', rather than a CGI glut-fest: camera panning through vast caverns aflame with activity, as if they really existed; giant sculptures from antiquity adorning the countryside; wizardry, beasts, Vallejo-esque structures.The movie being named The Lord Of The Rings, it was imperative to keep reminding the suburbanite viewer what all the running and screaming and poking was over. Consequently, there were 3 million close-ups of a filth-encrusted hand opening around a gold ring. Like Rocky Horror fans emulating their film heroes, people arrive at screenings having not washed their hands or hair for weeks. If you can make a person puke by letting them smell your hand, you get in for free.ELIJAH WOOD, not having reached puberty yet at 22, played wide-eyed, bushy-footed hobbit hero, Frodo, cerulean-blue peepers and cheeks as-yet-unscarred by the Gillette Corporation. Urged by Gandalf to journey afar to destroy the Ring Of Power, Frodo embarks with three idiot friends. At an inn of disrepute, Frodo inadvertently rings his finger with this talisman and is assaulted by high-decibel shockwave static, out-of-focus fuzzheadedness and time-dilatory slow motion, a sum effect not unlike having way too much tequila with the boys the night before and going home with a fat stripper named Belulah and waking up with your face buried firmly between elephantine cheeks. (How I miss those days.)  Here, the Hobbits ally with -VIGGO MORTENSEN, as Strider/ Aragorn/ Euro Guy Compleat, the unshaven rockstar Hero. Always looking like he's just stepped out of a shower that didn't clean him, wet-haired Viggo lends his mighty sword to the quest in the hope that Wizard Gandalf might one day conjure up some soap. As the Hero Who Gets The Girl, on his first day of shooting, Viggo started making out with -ORLANDO BLOOM, until someone told him that wasn't the girl. Bloom, whose name is perfectly congruent with the prim, blond elfin archer he played, Legolas, was responsible for holding up shooting for days on end when camera lenses would crack under the spell of his haunting boy-face. Constantly knocking on his trailer door, begging for beauty tips, was -LIV TYLER. A goddess. The sensual electricity is headily apparent between her and Viggo, even though he hasn't washed since 1437 and his musky shirt is now stuck to his back with sweat. Some chicks just dig the rugged outdoorsy type, I guess.  Anyone got her number? Certainly not -SEAN ASTIN, who, having reached puberty and finding that he didn't like it, reverted back to dull, ambiguous child actor. Playing Frodo's sidekick, Sam-I-Am, most notably from Dr. Seuss's classic tale of Wizardry and Demonology, Green Eggs And Ham, Sam-I-Am is entrusted by Gandalf to ward Frodo. His one attempt at poignancy (`If I take one more step, it's the farthest I've ever been from home') is slamdunked by two hobbits from the East End, who join the quest to travel to the farthest reaches of the land, which was about ten miles down the road. Led by -IAN MCKELLEN, renowned rille-faced veteran of stage, film and backdoor-mannery, as the stringy-haired, hessian-robed wizard Gandalf The Grey, hard-pressed curbing his desire to touch Elijah Wood's Golden Ring, dusky whispers taunting him whenever the candy-skinned man-boy would saunter near. One face-crease away from being Patrick Stewart's doppelganger, McKellen leads a ragtag expedition (did I just say 'ragtag'?) into special effects flummery, from the Elfin City, run by -HUGO WEAVING, whose thespian prowess successfully melded two of his most famous roles: that of Agent Smith in The Matrix and the drag queen in Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert. Told by Peter Jackson, to `wear something from Priscilla', he did, perfectly befitting his role as the Elfin Queen. But can there be anyone more fey than the ORIGINAL Lord Of The Wings -CHRISTOPHER LEE, aka Dracula (pronounced 'Drah-kyule', which lends it more legitimacy for some reason), playing the treacherous Saruman, Gandalf's Human Resources Manager. Enrobed in startling white, snowy mane cascading to his lower back, beard grown down to big-ass medallion (that was how he turned up on set every day - before makeup), Wahmpyre Christopher is testament to the rejuvenative diet of worms and virgin blood. Considering his mortal body died 35 years ago, Lee continues to make onscreen cameos with as much verve as undead people half his age, like -THE BALROG, undoubtedly the COOLEST daemon to stalk cloven-hoofed and flame-chiaroscuroed across a screen, stage or pentacle EVER! This torn-winged, hell-blackened, ram-horned apotheosis of Evil Incarnate (how I love him so!), faces off with The Great Gandalf in a cinematic sequence so astounding, breath-stopping and power-hammering that George Lucas is *still* trying to re-write Star Wars Episode Three.There are two more Rings movies on the way, each, so we hear, as monumentally staggering as this one - Good Luck, George!",10,1,2,10 October 2003
Cast Away," A Breath of Fresh Air
","Chuck Noland (plump Tom Hanks), inextricably married to his time-sensitive, nerve-fraying job as FedEx consultant, instead of to quietly-suffering fiancÃ© Kelly (Helen Hunt), finds himself suddenly and unceremoniously negated from Civilization's jetstream when a plane crash leaves him Stranded On A Desert Island.A 'Crusoe 2000' tale, by way of Thoreau's *Walden*, director Zemeckis audaciously grants his audience their intelligence, in making Chuck's island interlude all the more powerful and poignant by what he leaves *out*. There is minimal dialogue and no soundtrack, no undercurrent of computers and electrical paraphernalia pulsating subliminally - the bedrock of ambient sound upon which our society runs; no lawnmower growling on faraway lawn, no cell phones, iPods, piped jazz, TV commercials bombarding lies of 'whitening whites' Â in essence, a slice of Heaven! Nonetheless, for thematic closure, Chuck must necessarily escape back to First World indolence, where he finds he cannot reconcile his new Life-awareness with that of society's stultifying rigors, nor can he rekindle the 'love' which kept hope alive whilst marooned, enabling him to then embrace a free-wheeling optimism, only evidenced in the film's final shot.For those who value their quietude and the welcome respite from rat-racing it brings.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",8,0,1,28 October 2005
Armageddon," Arma Hatin' It.
","Imagine the worst pain and suffering ever. That's how it's gonna feel at the end of the world. Coincidentally, you can feel that exact same pain and suffering by watching Michael Bay's Armageddon. Armageddon is a painful exercise in squeezing every clichÃÂ© possible into 150 minutes of swooping camera moves, slomo shots of blond American farm kids, nauseous flag-waving and the movie's heroes walking abreast towards the camera, with smoke billowing in the background in slow motion. At least twenty times.Armageddon is also about an asteroid ('the size of Texas') on a collision course with Earth, which only Bruce Willis' team of oil-drillers can destroy, able to perform the requisite deep-core planting of a nuclear device on the asteroid to blow it up. You can't train actual astronauts to do technical stuff like that, no way.While a slightly perverted subplot revolves around Ben Affleck pursuing Willis' daughter, Liv Tyler, a cavalcade of B-stars makes A-holes of themselves in the middle background: Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner, Will Patton, Owen Wilson, and trusty Chris Ellis (Deke Slayton in APOLLO 13, and forever cast as Some Guy In Mission Control in all these space films).A movie with less science than STAR WARS (if that's even possible), less physics than MOONRAKER (which had none), less credible operating procedures than CAPRICORN ONE (which faked them), and less street cred than DEEP IMPACT (which preceded this film by two months). And - of course - ripping off Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov so bluntly and banally, the filmmakers should be roasted over an open spit when they make that big science fiction convention in the sky which Clarke and Asimov preside over.Only one example of the thousands upon thousands of uneducated scenes should convince a viewer what an eye-candy fool's joke Armageddon is: two space shuttles are launched simultaneously - okay, fine - but fifty feet apart? Just seeing them attain low Earth orbit together and jettisoning their Solid Rocket Boosters should give even the most 'unscientific' bananahead (i.e. the filmmakers) an idea of why this was such a monkeybrain scene - the SRB's are ejected via explosives which propel them away from each vehicle - into the flight path of any other vehicles in their vicinity. Of course, in the film, tragedy is averted by making the CGI SRB's jettison AWAY from the path of the following shuttle. But anyone with common sense will look at this scene and realize what a brainless berk Michael Bay and his writers are for allowing it on screen.CAPRICORN ONE was an uneducated mess, but space movies made before the 90's at least had True Ignorance on their side. The general public only knew so much about orbital mechanics and physics laws. Now there is NO EXCUSE for movies to treat outer space like a thrill ride at Six Flags. We've all seen footage of actual space shuttles in space - so how can Michael Bay's shuttles fly around as if they're in an atmosphere, following NO orbital mechanics, trajectories, or laws of physics. Why is there sound in space? Shouldn't these people have their glare-shields down on EVA in sunlight? We know all this via the very technology these movies flaunt, yet pretend to ignore, in order to serve the asinine plot.Everyone in space shouting at each other like they're actors doing something really hard and important - even though they've all got headset radios; everyone extolling information which should have been imparted in training ('you're about to hit minimal gravity, so you might get nauseous' - thanks for telling me TWO SECONDS before I hit minimal gravity!); non-sequitur action, like Buscemi picking up a machine gun and firing arbitrarily, simply to cause concern for the characters (which I lost as soon as they started signing Leaving on a Jet Plane like the Oil Riggers Men's Choir), rationalized as 'space sickness.' THIS MOVIE is space sickness.Every scene an epic moment waiting to happen, like Liv Tyler with her hand on a monitor after tearful goodbye to her father in space; camera pulls back and every single monitor in NASA is showing that same transmission - not like they have anything IMPORTANT to monitor, like the incoming space shuttle with a thousand malfunctions represented by all the movie sparks comin' off the consoles. And if the epic shot doesn't happen, Michael Bay jumps on his Chapman crane and MAKES it happen, annoying inspirational music padding the whole exercise.Best line is when William Fichtner describes the other crashed shuttle as being 'off the grid' and Buscemi retorts, 'Off the grid?! What're you, a freakin' cyborg?!' One redeeming factor of Armageddon is that it actually delineates what a 'hero' is - for this society which tags foopball hooligans and people jumping out of buildings and army grunts doing their jobs as 'heroes.' Bruce Willis stays behind to detonate the nuclear bomb. He is a hero because HE HAD THE OPTION NOT TO.The two halves of the asteroid 'miss the Earth by 400 miles' and around the globe everyone cheers, Chapman crane swooshing in ecstasy, blond American farm kids hugging their parents in slomo - with everyone once again ignoring the physics law that puts those pieces (each half the size of Texas, mind you) in orbit around Earth (unless they're pulled out of orbit by another celestial body), which means, in Earth's future, another flyby, another potential collision...Let's hope next time that ignorant human species is wiped out.",2,4,7,11 December 2008
21," Counting to Dumb.
","In this vacuous drama supposedly based on a true story, Old Hand (Kevin Spacey) teaches Teen Models (Kate Bosworth, Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts) to count cards and take on Vegas. Happens that Old Hand is college professor Micky Rosa, and his Teen Models are his students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. I don't doubt this may be a true story. That the characters displayed such stupidity, I do doubt.From a book by Ben Mezrich, Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions, 21 follows talented young M.I.T. student, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), struggling to pay fees for classes he can't afford. He is invited to join the covert team of Teen Model Card Sharks (who make us cringe with their Too-Kewl-For-Skool 'tudes) aiming to break Vegas.When the Teen Team recruit Ben, they speak like they're old hands at the Vegas scam, wowing him on how his lifestyle will change, yet when they gather in Vegas, Professor Micky lays down instructions like they've never been there before. I call this the Movie-Astronaut Rule: Always save the most crucial information on space travel for the actual journey, when the cameras are rolling. For the Ignint Audience.Two glaring loopholes in logic ruined this film: first, they have no fence. These are just college kids. When they come into large cash, how do they propose to launder it? Ben hides it in his dorm roof, but when he starts paying for that college he couldn't afford, the IRS is gonna rain down on him like a Vegas jackpot.Also, their attempts at discretion are ludicrous: they all arrive in Vegas at the same time, sometimes in asinine disguises, check into the same hotel together, go drinking together at strip clubs, constantly acknowledge each other and spend big in loud montages. Smart - but no Common Sense. Their fantastic 'secret signal' (on whether a table is hot to hustle) is to fold their arms behind the chair. Nice for some podunk operation in Ohio - but this is Vegas! Sure enough, a sinister casino cop, Williams (a beefed-up Laurence Fishburne) notices the scam signals on these new inventions called Security Cameras, and uses the Bush Administration Interrogation Policy of 'America Doesn't Torture' to torture some answers outa the dweebs. Williams, on Professor Micky's tail for years, now sees his opportunity to get Micky through his Teen Model stooges.In most scam movies, we marvel at the ingenuity of the criminals. In 21, we cringe every time these jokers are on screen. Spacey and Fishburne carry the movie on their shoulders alone, as every time we turn to the Teen Models, Sturgess is too busy looking like Tobey Macguire and Kate Bosworth is too busy pretending she's hot, and the movie falls flat.The attitude casinos have towards 'counting cards' bugs the babyjesus out of me! In Blackjack or 21, everyone maintains counting cards is not illegal. So why do casinos allow any jackass to play the game except those who are exceptional at it, who can count the cards? Casinos will fleece anyone, but anyone who fleeces them - legally - is taken to a room with no windows to get the intelligence beaten out of them...Ben loses his mind over plain Bosworth and starts losing and drinking, and then defects from the Teen Team to scam solo. To stop Ben's stupidity leading up the chain to Micky himself, Micky grasses up Ben to the authorities - sadist Fishburne. He had every right to do this, as Ben was 'gambling not counting' with Micky's outlay-money, so Micky cut him loose. It's a dog eat Teen Model world out there.However, Ben has one last con up his sleeve. He gives Speech Number 32 in the Generic Screenwriter Inspirational Speech Catalog (the 'Let's Do This One Last Time... For the Honor, For the Game... For The Boys' speech) - and grasses up Micky to the Ethical Non-Torturing Fishburne, who proceeds to torture Micky.The twisted message 21 sends is that even though the Teens betrayed their mentor and he tried to protect himself, the Teens won by being even more unethical, amoral and underhanded. And they're justified because... well, because they're Teen Models fer cryin out loud.",5,0,2,9 January 2009
American Psycho," Exotic Psychotic
","About a yuppie serial killer who finds he is slowly going insane, not from killing people, but from the BOREDOM of doing so. This comedy is not just black - it's black with sprinkles on top and a human head on a spike.From the hilariously disturbing Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name (screenstoried by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, directed by Harron), *American Psycho* defines a new angle on the internal world of serial killers. Our Hero is Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, ripped like a suspension bridge cable), a VP of his company, a 1980's uber-executive, whom we never see do any actual office work, narrating his obsessive-compulsive behaviors; petulant, trivial, rich, ensconced in yuppie consumerism; in a loveless, close-to-tears-of-exasperation relationship with his empty-skulled girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon), who is oblivious to his ambivalence and neuroses. He's also a serial killer. Bateman's life is an endless succession of vapidity Â exec friends who speak and never listen, women who speak only as prelude to bonking, fake parties, fake emotions, plastic girlfriends, all status and wardrobe and petty gossip. Every time he needs to exit an unsavory social situation, his excuse 'I have to return some videotapes' is taken without question because no one is listening; when he is loading a body bag into the back of a taxi, a fellow exec catches him, only to marvel at the excellent 'overnight bag'Â It is no surprise that Bateman's only grasp on 'reality' is the solid hack of his axe on someone's skull. When Bateman narrates an album review or describes pedantic rituals, his voice takes on the clinical detachment of an outside observer. And in that persona, his murders take place Â observing himself as he is committing them. We feel the incongruous juxtaposition of personalities as he puts on a Whitney Houston CD and starts proselytizing on the philosophies of *The Greatest Love of All* as a prelude to killing two girls. And the black humor shines when he tells his secretary (ChloÃ« Sevigny) during a date, 'You'd better go or I might hurt you,' she thinking that he refers to the discomfort of office relationships, while he means it LITERALLY. Surprisingly, the two FEMALE film-makers retain verbatim Ellis' misogynistic Truth about women with 'good personalities,' voiced at a Boys Sitdown by Josh Lucas: 'There are no girls with great personalities. A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard-body, who'll satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her goddam mouth shut....'With all the *CSI*s and *Law and Order*s abounding on our inculcating airwaves, one gets the impression that most murders are eventually solved. But *American Psycho* leaves us with the reality that there must be thousands of unsolved murders perpetrated by people like Bateman Â murders that we will never hear of because they are so graphic; that would never air on *Cops* for fear of making the steroid bull-stars of that show look as impotent as we know they are. Though a detective (Willem Dafoe) passively questions Bateman on suspected missing persons (that he has eighty-sixed), the reality is that if someone in Bateman's VP position WERE a serial killer, the kid gloves would stay on; were he indicted, the charges would be harder to stick; were he convicted, his sentence would be commuted. This is how a money-based society treats its moneyed criminals. It takes more brains, organization and creativity to be a serial killer than a cop. We are made privy to prosaic details when Bateman kills Paul Allen (Jared Leto); putting newspapers down to sop up the carnage when he chops him up, meticulously cleaning his fingerprints, packing a suitcase for the victim to make it look like he has gone on a trip, changing the message on the victim's answering machine, body bags, skulking skills, alibis, lying to the police so convincinglyÂ it's quite a task, and we almost admire Bateman for these forward-thinking skills, but then, maybe it's that same skill set that *all* vice presidents possess. We've always known you need to be pretty morally bankrupt yet a decisive mover-shaker, to attain executive corner offices. With its plastic, pastel-tie soundtrack (featuring Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, Robert Palmer, et al), *American Psycho* captures the era when cellphones were the size of cereal boxes, also conveying the ultra-upper-class hedonism and juvenility of these spoiled-riche business-boys (Bateman is vexed when a colleague's eggshell-colored business card is better than his; simply devastated when another colleague's card has a watermark); and reminds us of the blasÃ© sexism once accepted in the office ('Don't wear that outfit again - and wear high heels') Â but the movie never quite captures the disturbing horror or unbridled carnage of the Ellis novel.Two reasons: Firstly, the book is the most violent story you will ever puke your guts out over - I especially remember the scene where Bateman grinds a circle saw into a woman's face and marvels at her teeth splattering outwards Â and there's only so much disturbing gore the gutless, hypocritical MPAA will allow onto the screen at one sitting; secondly, the movie has been screenstoried and directed by women. Yes, it's a sexist comment Â directly criticizing the fact that the female sex is trying to convey the male sex's point of view. And that can't be done Â not by the most intelligent woman, not by transgenders, not even by Richard Simmons. Women cannot possibly fathom the sexual intent of *normal* red-blooded men, let alone the perverse sexual depravedness of a serial killer. How graphic, how 'sexually realistic,' how authentic can the movie possibly be with these two hampering aspects? The most extreme this movie gets is showing a naked Bateman, covered in blood, chasing a hooker through his apartment complex with a roaring chainsawÂand we've all done *that* before",7,1,3,25 April 2008
"I, Robot"," I, Gamebot
","I, Human, even whilst viewing the first trailers of 'I, Robot', knew that They, 20th Century Fox, were destined to make Film, Botch-up.Sure enough, this movie bytes! Pounding home the sordid fact that Big Studios Â as cookie-cutter idioms unto themselves Â must morph any greed-driven, blockbuster-bent story from cerebral concept to popcorn-glutton whiz-bangery, 'I, Robot' is a tragic depravity of speculative fiction writer Isaac Asimov's complex vision; an unrecognized mutation of the compendium of intriguing Robot Stories revered by readers through the decades.Thank you, Hollywood. Thank you so bloody much.Before Asimov's death in 1992, speculative fiction deity Harlan Ellison collaborated with him on an early screenplay of 'I, Robot', but the usual industry discombobulation and improprieties left the Last Writers Standing as Jeff Vintar (writer of 'Final Fantasy' - the first fully computer-animated movie) and Akiva Goldsman (whose breadth covers the jejune 'Batman And Robin' to the earnest 'A Beautiful Mind'; for this job, calling upon his 'Batman' skill set Â Holy Insensibility!).Premised in a society conversant with the 'immutable' Three Laws of Robotics (which safeguard humans against robot mischief whilst granting human mastery over robot will), the movie's opening sequences echo hollowly Asimov's grand expositions, as Detective Spooner (Will Smith) investigates a scientist's 'suicide' which seems to point to a probable Murder By Robot. Smith's smugness wears thin almost immediately.His standing as a major player in the motion picture industry seems to finally be overwhelming the last vestiges of his 'Six Degrees' ingenuousness, as being the whitest wigga in the movie doesn't seem to faze him in the least; wool cap pulled snidely over only one ear (in an attempt, I suppose, to convey some sense of futuristic fad), taut t-shirted torso (naked in his first scenes Â a shout out to da ladies!), sneakers from the Year 2000 (oh! Â you go, retro-girl!) and long, black, Beyond-Badness leather coat. Sure, it's Los Angeles 2035, but unless the earth's precessional axial tilt has stepped up speed and driven the city into higher and colder climes than its 23-degree-north latitude, no one in LA *really* dresses like that Â not even in *this* movie (except for Spooner) - unless they're attending a film premiere, making a music video, or a nouveau-trash summer blockbuster.Spooner, irritated almost all the time, smart-mouths his way through his scenes as if AKSING for a slap upside his bitch head, only much later in the film expositing a rationale for his surliness Â years ago, relying on mathematical probability, a robot chose to save him over a drowning child (ripping out his arm in the process, necessitating a bionic replacement), he maintaining that a 'thinking, feeling being' would have tried to save the child no matter what the probability; thus, his hatred for robots and distrust of people who create them. Nonetheless, it is still an unnecessarily sour performance that offers little wit to alleviate the constant puss on his face. 'Attempted wit' doesn't count.One of Asimov's foibles (if I can call it that without being stoned for sacrilege) was that he avoided expounding on sex to a fault, thereby making his recurring female character from the Robot Stories, robopsychologist Susan Calvin, as coolly sexless as the automatons she is ironically empowered to 'make more human.' As Calvin, Bridget Moynahan pulls off this idiosyncrasy so effectively that we cannot imagine her having been touched by any mammal, let alone a man. When she does touch Spooner, it is purely a technical examination of his bionic arm and Â double irony Â it comes off as sensual for its very perversity! Director Alex Proyas, who wove the noir visions, 'The Crow' and 'Dark City', seems like the perfect choice for a dark Asimov tale, but has noticeably caved to Big Studio demands with this production, structuring it as simply as a knucklehead video game; no small coincidence that the movie's draw-cards - the robots - look like any given 'gamer' characters; we catch ourselves thinking how incongruous they often look in this film's 3-D world.The Robot glitch which our human protagonists must monkey-wrench back to normalcy is the over-played 'Humanity is a Danger to Itself' card, telegraphed to absurd (though, plausibly realistic) proportions by the master computer, acronymed VIKI, who empowers the hordes of gamebots to enforce city curfews and house-imprisonment, so that Us Dumb Humans won't blow us-selves up. Needless to say, the sourpuss hip-hop refugee and frigid heroine (whose severe convent hairstyle gets progressively more sensual during the third act as she exhibits more lubricity towards Spooner) win the day.The Human glitch in the making of this movie was in ignoring the inherent irony of Asimov's title, 'I, Robot'. The 'I' signifies a Descartian self-awareness, a facility which robots Â by definition Â should not possess, thereby making the title an oxymoron. Asimov, understanding this, structured each Robot tale as an examination of the complexities, paradoxes and conundrums of bequeathing machines artificial intelligence. In the film, this aspect is given a cursory nod in the form of Robot 'Sonny', whose sentience is poignant and almost slips the movie past Asimov aficionados, until those idiotic scenes of robot hordes chasing down or blatantly attacking Spooner, intoning, 'You are having a car accident!,' remind us what a big bowl of wrong this movie is. To further gouge Asimov's concepts, Sonny is able to override the Three Laws because Â well, because *Vintar and Goldsman* say so Â to help the Noble Humans defeat the Bad MachinesÂAsimov drew the sentience theme to its logical conclusion in his disturbing short story 'Bicentennial Man' (brought to the screen in 1999 by director Chris Columbus and Robin Williams - with as much homogeneity and popcorn pap as *this* stinker).Where are Lije Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw when we need them? We miss you, I, saac.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",4,1,2,11 December 2005
Over the Hedge," Die Hard with a Woodland Critter Vengeance.
","It is a pity that the quality of the storyline of these modern 3D animation features does not always match the level of talent that goes into their animation.*Over The Hedge* uses the most modern computer technology to animate the most ancient of story lines: lone racketeer cons group of patsies into doing his dirty work, then repents when he finds, over the course of his con, that the patsies provided him with the 'family' flavor that was missing from his life. Not to say that it isn't enjoyable. But does our enjoyment stem from the tale and its telling, or from the megastar backbone that props up all these modern 3D animation films? I cannot recall a 3D animation film or cartoon from recent history (all the way back to Toy Story in 1995), that does not utilize A-List actors.Of course - as they say in *The Godfather* - it's just business. An unknown voice talent - no matter how much more 'talented' than these recognizable marquee toppers - will simply not sell as many tickets as a star who needs no special talent but to simply lay down his voice to evoke all the characterization his past roles have wrought. These 3D's have now reached such an impasse with 'perception' of largeness that they cannot back down to under-the-counter names. Projections for advertising, computer-rendering time, star salaries and box office unequivocally force the hands of movie-makers into a vicious capitalistic circle that feeds off itself.As with any commercial venture that sweeps across demographics and cultures, pap will replace zap in an attempt to flense all prospective offensiveness from the product; all originality must necessarily be replaced with something familiar, something tried-and-true Â something bankable.Hence, DreamWorks Animation gives us *Over The Hedge.* Familiarity? Here is a set of cartoon characters so typecast by the real-life actors who voice them that characterization can be completely dispensed with. There is RJ, the racketeer raccoon, voiced by Bruce Willis. Like all Willis's action heroes, he is tough, resourceful and smart-mouthed. So too, Garry Shandling's tortoise, Verne, is exactly as neurotic as Garry Shandling. All one has to do is read the star names and their voiced animal is immediately slotted into a familiar 'type' in the moviegoer's character catalog. Example: William Shatner Â if you filed him under 'overactor,' you'd be right: he plays a possum with a penchant for melodramatic death scenes. Mention Nick Nolte and you envision a grizzled, bearish character Â again, you'd be right: Nolte voices Vincent, a bear whom RJ owes a season's supply of food. Wanda Sykes, spunky black woman, plays Stella, a black skunk with spunk. Even pop singer Avril Lavigne makes her feature film debut as a teenage possum, who seems to be wearing just that same amount of extra unnecessary mascara that gives Lavigne that barely-legal prostitute look which has enabled her to sell way too many albums.From T. Lewis's and Michael Fry's intelligent and extremely cute cartoon strip, *Over The Hedge* tells the story of a clutch of woodland animals who come upon the titular hedge (an artificial barrier erected to separate forest wildlife from a planned suburban community) and who are encouraged to explore its other side by John McClane Â I mean, RJ the Raccoon - to gather food for next winter in hedonistic amounts. What Korben Dallas Â I mean, RJ Â doesn't tell these trusting critters is that he intends to steal all their gatherings to pay back Nolte's bear.As anyone who has studied a screen writing course will tell you, RJ feels remorse over his duplicity at exactly the moment that his friends need him most Â when they are captured and slated to die at the hands of the Exterminator (I believe the ex-Terminator is the Governor of California now).When Vincent the Bear threatens RJ, he doesn't use euphemisms; instead of 'You'll wish you were never born,' or 'I will bring you down to Chinatown' - he very simply says, 'If my food is not replaced by next week, I'm going to find you and kill you!' Surprisingly direct for a PG-13 comedy - one of those lines you would expect to be leached.Screenstoried by Len Blum, Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton, and Karey Kirkpatrick, and directed by Kirkpatrick and Tim Johnson, the bulk of the movie is concerned with how these animals go about stealing their food from the humans who, as RJ puts it, 'live to eat,' rather than eat to live. This justification is inserted, of course, to palliate the crime of stealing, by implying the humans have such a surplus that it is okay to skim the overflow. Whereas the comic strip had the luxury over many years to explore the more amusing foibles of human nature, the film can only concentrate on this one theme, often resorting to nakedness jokes (concerning Verne's oft-removed shell) and fart jokes (pertaining to the skunk). Paying homage to Warner Brothers' PepÃ© Le Pew, one gag involves disguising the skunk to distract a cat.Talented musician Ben Folds is misused on the soundtrack, shoehorned into an insufferable Randy Newman clone with his original songs.There are many gems to be found in the animation Â more than one viewing is required to appreciate all the subsidiary action, facial expressions and lightning-quick one-liners sprinkled liberally (especially pertaining to Steve Carell's Attention Deficit squirrel); icing on a cake which the animators put much love into baking. Their work is not wasted; each secondary character, each texturized surface, each shadowed furball is much appreciated.Now if only the writers could have loosened their white-knuckled hold on story clichÃ©, they might have achieved what the Unbreakable RJ does for his innocent charges Â taken *Over the Hedge* over the edge.",6,2,4,6 June 2006
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Laugh Hard.
","Musicians: this one's for us.WALK HARD is not for Guitar Hero fakers or karaoke jackasses or talentless DJs with the audacity to call their fade-ups and fade-downs 'mixing.' Let me say it again: WALK HARD is for MUSICIANS; for we who have lived the road, beaten the boards, spanked the groupies, trashed the dressing room, fart-filled the studio, fed the beast our day-job dollar, and slapped the roadies and called them Susan.The public won't get WALK HARD as deeply as musicians will. And I don't care. Cherish it, Musicians. Hug it and pet it and call it George.After the two formulaic, Hollywood-drenched biopics, RAY and WALK THE LINE, set the standard and simultaneously lowered the bar for musician biographies, WALK HARD takes every single clichÃ© from those glossy turkeys and parties with a penis in your face.John C. Reilly is fictional songwriter-guitarist Dewey Cox, who rises to superstardom on the wings of clichÃ©. ClichÃ© so battering and obvious, we will never look at musician biopics with a straight face again, especially those featuring the seminal artists of the 50's who rose from 50's dance halls to superstardom - Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly. They ALL look like spoof biopics now! Dewey finds he is talented at a young age, soon after slicing his brother in half with a machete, Monty Python style, who telegraphs the tragedy: 'Everything's fine when you have such a long life in front of you!' John C. Reilly LIVES Dewey Cox, performing all his comedic songs himself, which are actually enjoyable and catchy country/rock and roll tunes. We follow him from his big break in a colored club 'where people come to dance erotically,' to touring with Elvis and Jerry Lee, to immediate radio airplay with his hit Walk Hard ('recorded just 35 minutes ago by Dewey Cox'). Dewey meets The Beatles (Jack Black as Paul, Justin Long as George, Paul Rudd as John), experiments with musical styles from Dylan to Bowie; on through the 70s he hosts a TV show and marries Cheryl Tiegs (playing herself, taking the name Cheryl Cox-Tiegs - yeah, say it out loud). In the 80s, Dewey succumbs to mind-altering drugs while trying to compose a magnum opus with ethnic orchestras, trampolines, farm animals and fruit. He even takes a leaf from his friend Will Ferrell's book and runs naked through the streets during a freakout.WALK HARD will be compared to the progenitor of this rocku-mockumentary genre, SPINAL TAP, as WALK-HARD's makers also display actual hands-on, penis-on knowledge of their target.Writer-director Jake Kasdan and co-writer Judd Apatow ladle out every single vignette that musician biopic screenwriters have grown lazy on - from teens at the dance warming to Dewey's high school band and jiggling in ways that make a priest yell, 'devil's music,' to the record producer admonishing Dewey then suddenly loving his song (a riotous John Michael Higgins cameo, '...and if somehow you are able to sing a song now with these boys whom you haven't even metÂ but I'm telling you right now, I don't think it's going to happen... I'll give you 15 seconds'), to the whining wife in curlers (Kristen Wiig) cradling three babies, constantly telling Dewey he'll 'never make it' - even whilst he is on the road supporting a number one album. With a penis in his face.Musicians know these scenes from their own lives, and how Hollywood has compressed them to nut-squeezing idiocy. Kasdan and Apatow display a virtuoso's knowledge of their subject, down to making the instrument-playing look authentic (a pet peeve of all musicians watching musician movies). The script is as taut as a guitar string and sings like a Les Paul plugged through a Marshall stack on 11.Johnny Cash and Ray Charles would be spinning in their graves - if they were not laughing so hard.Slap a roadie for me.",8,4,6,9 January 2009
Disturbia," Rear End Window
","Alfred Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW for Teen Models.Shia LeBeouf spends the fist half of DISTURBIA stuttering his way into the panties of the girl next door; the second half, stuttering his way out of the clutches of a serial killer.Doing time on house arrest, Kale (LeBeouf) eventually turns his bored, binocular perving on the suburban neighborhood on the new hot neighbor (Sarah Roemer), then noticing his other neighbor (David Morse) is behaving suspiciously like a character in a suspense thriller.Playing spaz buddies for all they're worth, Kale and Ronnie (Aaron Yoo, who looks like he's on break from a Tommy Hilfiger shoot) stake out the creepy dude (while perving on the hot chick during breaks).One Meet Cute later, Hot Chick teams with Dweeb and Spaz to unravel the dark secrets of the Creepy Guy Next Door.Carrie-Anne Moss does a turn as Shia's MILF, while David Morse is, as always, brilliant.

Monsters vs. Aliens," Monstrous Alienation.
","MONSTER VS ALIENS is a suitably giggly concept, well executed in 3D animation, well written, with funny characters and a straightforward storyline that kiddies will understand. Yet it fails for a fundamental reason - it advocates GuantÃ¡namo Bay! Whoa! Poffy's gone insane! Comparing a kid's cartoon to President Bush-Cheney's war crimes. But think carefully now: As a human being with compassion towards other human beings (yes, I'm talking to you directly), what would be the first thing you would do if a woman suddenly grew to fifty feet tall? You would try to get her help, right? Not so if you are a misanthropic swine like Bush-Cheney - at the first sign of 'difference' you would declare her an 'enemy combatant,' persuade everyone she is a 'threat,' then lock her away with no habeas corpus, no rights, no legal prerogatives, no resolution, in a cell with no windows.This is what happens in MONSTERS VS ALIENS. Young bride-to-be Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is hit by a meteorite, which makes her grow to fifty feet tall on her wedding day - at which point the military shows up and takes her captive without one word of permission, compassion, approval or apology. She is told her subterranean prison is so secret, it is 'an x-file, wrapped in a cover-up and deep-fried in a paranoid conspiracy.' In other words, it's a rendition. (Coincidentally, Witherspoon played the wife of an Egyptian-American kidnapped and tortured by Americans in RENDITION.) What does this teach the ignorant populace, let alone impressionable kids? I'm sure that wayward vagina, Liz Cheney (daughter of even bigger vagina, Dick) is forcing her kids to watch the opening scenes of MONSTERS VS ALIENS as if it's a documentary.So even though I want to laugh at the many funny moments in this movie, it is informed by plot lines like this. And I can't see anything funny in General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland, sounding as unbalanced as R. Lee Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET) telling Susan as he locks her away, that 'the government has changed your name to Ginormica.' 'Oh,' say Liz Cheney's kids, 'the government can DO that?' 'Yes, children,' informs their spineless hawk swine of a mother (daughter of draft-dodger and spineless hawk swine of a mother, Dick), 'the government can do anything it wants. Now go wash up for dinner and wipe your asses on our American constitution towels.' I'm sure that Stephen Colbert (of THE COLBERT REPORT), who voices The President of the United States, would have noticed this misanthropy, but he's being employed merely as an actor here, so had to let it slide without biting commentary.In prison, Susan meets other detainees, kept just as unwillingly, but more humorously, since the less a lifeform resembles us, the more vicious we can be towards that lifeform without guilt: Dr. Cockroach Ph.D (Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link (Will Arnett), and B.O.B. (Seth Rogen, who brings his crazy little laugh and scattered personality to this blue blob, unlike his innocuous participation in other animated features, like HORTON HEARS A WHO or KUNG FU PANDA).Together, they defeat the forces of Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson), an alien who wants the essence from the meteorite that landed on Susan.Some of the funniest scenes take place on Gallaxhar's ship, which is an architectural wonder. In 2009, we take a lot of visuals for granted because of computer technology, so we have to step outside ourselves to admit that the destruction scenes of the interior of Gallaxhar's ship actually look more 'realistic' than the interior destruction of the Death Star in RETURN OF THE JEDI! Let's face it - referring specifically to only those scenes (where a giant generator-type thing starts falling and splintering), both are 'non-real' scenes, either matte paintings and/or computer animation, so we are comparing apples to apples, not live-action to a cartoon.Everyone ends up Disney happy, obviously because it's only a kid's fantasy disconnected from reality.Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon (who also participated in the writing) predictably fill their movie with messages of self-realization and philanthropic acceptance. Ironic then that they depict their own government so callously as being the opposite - but again, this is because America as a nation has become so inured to the criminality of the Bush-Cheney War Crime ethos (being perpetuated and promoted even after their doomsday reign by the Cheney cabal) that it is now considered comedy. Not even black comedy, but mainstream, nay, KIDDIE comedy! But GuantÃ¡namo (and other 'black sites' like it) are no laughing matter; creations of a pathologically insane sadist who lived in a fantasy disconnected from reality: Dick.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",5,1,3,1 November 2009
Being John Malkovich," The Importance Of Being Malkovich
","It's about a puppeteer who finds a portal into the head of a real-life actorÂ No, it's about an over-sexed, 105-year-old pirate who runs a company on the 7 Â½ floor of a building who has found a way to live foreverÂ No, it's about a woman who realizes she is transsexual after having sex with her lesbian lover whilst inhabiting the body of John MalkovichÂ Okay, I give up.I plead the Charlie Kaufman defense.Like *2001: A Space Odyssey*, like *Brazil*, like *A Clockwork Orange*, *Being John Malkovich* is like nothing else in filmdom. For originality alone, it deserves the highest accolades. Like its eponymous subject matter, it is inexplicable and indefinable.Transcending its own marginally sane storyline (penned by that maniac, Charlie Kaufman), this movie stuns us with its audacity: has there ever been a puppeteer as movie hero?; when was the last time action took place on the 7 Â½ floor of an office building?; have characters ever spoken plain English to a secretary, only to have her accuse them Â in English Â of speaking gibberish?; have we ever met such a lovable Grandpa character with such a liltingly filthy mouth ('My spunk is, to you, manna from heaven')? And the grandest audacity of all is the plot line of the puppeteer finding a tiny hidden door in his office which turns out to be a portal into the head of John Malkovich. (Don't ask. I can't explain.) Enter the portal and for fifteen minutes you see what Malkovich sees, hear what Malkovich hears, experience what Malkovich experiences; basically a passive passenger onboard the Malkovich train Â until the puppeteer finds a way to manipulate Malkovich like a human puppetÂ Brought to the weird screen by director Spike Jonze, *Malkovich* stars John Cusack as the puppeteer, Craig Schwartz; Cameron Diaz in an actual thinking, speaking, acting role as his wife, Lotte; Catherine Keener as the glibly aloof Maxine, overplaying her arrogance as usual (I would sincerely hate to be the guy Keener comes home to every night); Orson Bean as the lovable old lech, Lester; Mary Kay Place as his befuddled secretary whose naked thighs he wants to feel next to his; and, of course, John Malkovich Â or is it? Comporting himself in that slightly askew manner that can only lead us to believe he is a closet knife-killer, John Malkovich proves to be quite the sport when it comes to self-deprecation. Skewering himself as thoroughly as the movie skewers him, he does such an exemplary job of acting as if other people were inhabiting him, that we truly forget it is he himself who is calling himself an 'over-rated hack,' or lamenting that he should have found a younger body to inhabit, for fear of breaking a hipÂ Jonze and Kaufman bend storytelling convention so far backwards so successfully that Â like *2001*, like *Brazil*, like *Orange* - we could never guess at what might be coming next in this *sui generis* tale Â which is as satisfying in its own way as any left-turn plot twist.The bizarre intertwining between Maxine and Lotte and Craig-as-Malkovich will not support a simple 'Hollywood' solution and commendably, there is no sappy ending with a heterosexual couple finally together after enduring adversity. Another portal has opened, another soul is diluted, and Carter Burwell's sad, evocative score shadows a tragic, disturbing conclusion.*Malkovich* is a balancing act between comedy and pathos: the ongoing reference to 'that jewel thief movie,' which Malkovich is constantly accused of acting in, against his denials; the sudden cameo of a well-known Hollywood roisterer as Malkovich's confidante; a funny little backstory involving Lotte's chimp, Elijah; Cusack, as the tragic, unappreciated puppeteer, walking a line which could have easily led an audience to regard him without pity Â as a ball-less, amoral cur, who had to inhabit someone else to realize his own potential Â yet he somehow evokes our sympathies through his pathetic attempts at progress; there is also the unexplored allusion to sublimated personalities and possession.And what happens when Malkovich enters the portal himself? That, faithful reader, is too Malkovich for mere words to Malkovich.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",9,1,2,17 June 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Most fun you can have not having sex.
","Judd Apatow's THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN has a premise which is utterly ridiculous, a story utterly preposterous and a cast utterly hilarious.Steve Carell is Andy, the eponymous FYOV, enjoying his bachelorhood working at an electronics store by day, painting action figures and playing video games by night. After Andy's friends discover he is a virgin, in a priceless scene played to the hilt by Carell (where he describes breasts as sandbags and offers fake sexploits on the strength of overhearing other people's war stories) they do the only thing good friends should do for a virgin buddy - take him out to a nightclub to try and get him laid.When Andy meets Trish from the store across the street, (Catherine Keener in MILF mode) he starts dating her on the proviso that they don't have sex until their 20th date, under the pretense that waiting makes it special and worthwhile, but in reality because he is too scared to have sex on accounta being a Forty Year Old Virgin.Yes, we've all been there at one time - virginity, that is, not 40 - and it was never this funny; wondering just how to cross that bridge and lay that pipe. (Even I, the King-Of-Porn Cucumber, was once close-mouthed about my sex life because I didn't want to get embarrassed; now I'm close-mouthed about my sex life because I don't want to get arrested...) The movie rides on the back of its supporting cast: Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Jane Lynch - and Gerry Bednob as Mooj, the resident East Indian with the priceless accent and inappropriate crassness. These workmates and buddies are all so eccentric and so game (coupled with Apatow's laid-back, improv directorial style) that we never quite anticipate what quotable gem they're gonna spew next. ('You're putting the pussy on a pedestal, the Pusilaya,' 'You framed an Asia poster? How hard did the people at the frame store laugh when you brought this in?' 'I will pray for your cock.' 'Today's forecast? Dark and cloudy, and chance of drive-by.')Ultimately, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN fails because it ends up doing what every 'romantic comedy' does: lean towards the propaganda that Marriage & Kids is what we're all aiming towards. Tragedy that Andy gets married to the first chick he plonks. For all the sex he's gonna get now, he might as well be a 40 year old virgin again.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,0,1,27 March 2009
Spider-Man," Hanging With The Big Boys
","From the web-woven opening credits to the last strains of the cartoon theme as the copyrights roll, Spiderman joins the pantheon of underpanted heroes whom the movie forum has portrayed as mightily as their bulging quadriceps (at this movie's release date, that being only Superman and Batman - the OG's).Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, James Franco and Kirsten Dunst's Breasts.Spiderman's new movie franchise ambassador had to win over audiences in his first 5 minutes screen time, or go the way of Leno-chinned Nicholas Hammond, the vacuous, Gilligan-hairdo nerd of the late-70s TV series, The Amazing Spiderman, which was as exciting as swallowing chalk. Tobey Maguire, running after his bus, browbeaten by schoolmates, lamenting in voice-over his teen-age problems, was a winner right outa the gate! An exhilarating feature of this film was the web-swinging (non-existent in the soporific Amazing Spiderman TV series, due to its technical difficulty). Movie technology has lent literal wings to stunts and visuals which were impossible in the days of Adam West running around with a Wile E. Coyote bomb over his head, or Reb Brown decimating the legend of Captain America throughout that whole ineffectual DOINK of a movie. Truly this is the correct era to begin making films of 'super' heroes, for only now can movie-makers convey a 'superiority' that George Reeves could never achieve by lying on a table and being chroma-keyed onto a swishing sky-scape.Aficionados may lament that there *is* a CGI jerkiness to the man-spider's swinging - but this nonhuman factor somehow only enhances the arachnoid element in this 'spider'-man. It's a letdown, yes, knowing that Tobey is not even on screen when Spiderman is barreling along, but it's better than watching 'crooks' with pencil-mustaches shooting at George Reeves with their hats on, while he poses arms-akimbo-legs-apart, then crushes their guns like the movie-clay models they are ('one-trick-pony' in the dictionary, there's a picture of George Reeves as Superman).In the 60's comics, Parker was bitten by a 'radioactive' spider Â this was updated to 'genetically-mutated' spider, reflecting each era's fears and misunderstandings. The decision to have Spiderman internally generate his webbing seems more rational now, than his creation of web-cartridges in the 60's. It always intrigued me why Stan Lee (Spiderman's creator) balked at the webbing aspect, giving his young hero super-strength, an inexplicable 'spider-sense' and even the power to walk up walls (which should not be possible; stickiness of appendages is irrelevant, but rather volume-to-surface-area ratio allows insects this ability), yet no endemic webbing Â a spider's trademark. (Spiders 'spin' their web via spinnerets located anally, so did Lee consider this and veto it? Â and I suppose any superhero generating web from a butt-spinneret would lose most of the popcorn vote.) Who better to play Spiderman's greatest arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin, than Willem Dafoe? Face carved from crazy and body ripped like Jesus in crucifixion pose, Willem OWNED this role. The kiddies might have relished Norman the Goblin in his techno armor suit (a deviation from the comics, though definitely an improvement on the purple and green sexually-indecisive Halloween attire), but my favorite scenes were Willem battling the Goblin Within; when he was simply - like John Malkovich Â Being Willem Dafoe.James Franco, as Dafoe's barely-tangible son and Peter Parker's almost-incorporeal pal, Harry Osborn, phoned in his role on a cellphone that kept cutting out. In the comic world, Harry wildly grabs the party reins when his father dies at Spiderman's hands, and becomes the second Green Goblin. By movie's end, Franco - in a valiant attempt to become three-dimensional - vows to make Spiderman pay for killing his dad, but I don't think any of us can visualize the fey Franco carrying the torch of Divine Wicked that came so rapturously naturally to Willem. Probably the biggest crime this wisp of smoke could perpetrate would be to join a boy-band and pretend to be The Hard One.Can anyone deny the integral role played by Kirsten Dunst's Breasts?; ubiquitous, delinquitous, nasty-perky, herky-jerky, firm yet forgiving, relentlessly real, cruel but fair. Remember, dears: when walking home from work, *always take the darkest alleyways and wear no bra*. Flame-red locks, sotto voce delivery, camera unable to focus on anything BUT those mounds of necessity, those pillows of slavery. Spiderperve has the advantage that most of us who wear dark glasses indoors gainfully employ: behind that mask, we KNOW what he's looking' at! After impressing her by kicking white-rapper butt, he hangs upside-down passively, allowing her to ease his mask off his mouth, in the same manner she would ease dark-nylon stocking from betwixt milky thigh, rain streaming down his roundish head, delineating her pinkish curves, as they lock lips in a tongue-roving, erotogenic, nerve-jangling, storm-driven kiss, rivaling easily the heat of Scarlett & Rhett in Gone With The Wind, or Rourke & Basinger in Nine Â½ Weeks, and even Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine in Deathtrap. The subliminal metaphor was not lost on this disciple of heady foreplay: Fear, Sweat, Violence, Surrender. And all of it Â WET. The Human Procreation Arc.Like the movie's slipshod ending, I have to wrap this essay suddenly (I've reached my word-limit, as Raimi probably reached his budget-limit). Kirsten Dunst's Breasts suddenly profess an irrationally-deduced 'love' for Parker, which is an essay unto itself, outlining the needless 'hope' this would instill in geeks who bag their comics who are NOT secretly superheroes: perpetuating the fantasy that a Pasty-Boy can Make Good if his Love is Real Â well, boys, you'd better pray that somewhere out there, there's a radioactive ferret with your butt-cheeks' name on his teeth.(Read this review unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Spiderman.html)",7,1,2,19 August 2004
Aliens," The Warrior/Goddess Dichotomy and the Eternal Feminine
","ALIENS! Leaping, screeching, hissing, grabbing - hellish armies of H.R. Giger's inscrutable extra-terrestrial life forms, swarming killing machines going elongated-head to jar-head withÂ the United States Marines (Roger Ramjet Space Division, Glib Company).Writer-Director James Cameron helms this sequel to one of the landmark space/horror films of our time, ALIEN (1979). And it shows. Not one for subtlety, Cameron creates a script (with David Giler and Walter Hill) that bluntly screams 'More is Better' Â more aliens, more victims, more explosions and incredible amounts of more mucus. Surprisingly - he gets away with it.A colony of humans on a remote planet has lost contact with Earth. The military sends a reconnoiter mission, along with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, recently rescued from suspended animation in a drifting escape pod some eighty years after blowing up the Nostromo in ALIEN). She is more than miffed that the planet she is forced to return to is the one she just escaped from (in ALIEN - Director's Cut scenes actually show the crashed 'horseshoe' spaceship from ALIEN and Newt's father getting face-hugged at its base).Sho' nuff, send the Marines in anywhere and everything gets pear-shaped. After aliens *en masse* peel from the mucused walls of the space colony corridors and decimate the grunts, the remaining Marines (under Ripley's ad hoc supervision) must find a way to leave the planet and nuke it.There are so many factors that make the ALIEN series so much more than just Running-and-Screaming debacles. A major factor was Swiss surrealist, H.R. Giger's alien design, overseen in this movie by legendary creature-creator Stan Winston. The life-cycle of the aliens was also well thought out, which gave them an organic depth that simple zombies or big-eyed beige beings lacked. Like some interesting insect species here on Earth, the alien warriors do not simply eat or kill all their captives, but cocoon them to serve as host bodies for their hatchling stage (the face-huggers), which impregnate the captive with the seed that grows into the chest-burster (which John Hurt will never forget).Cameron, who is renowned for his Wham-Bam, actually cleverly inserts major Thank-You-Ma'am into this movie. At first blush, ALIENS looks like any summer Boy's Movie, but look closer and you'll notice that it is actually a *homage* to the Eternal Feminine! All the males are either emasculated or ineffectual: Apone the Marine captain (Al Mathews) is dispatched in the first battle, Gorman the coordinator (William Hope) is bitchslapped by Ripley when he crumbles during a skirmish, Hudson the grunt (Bill Paxton, in an immortal sissy role which will haunt him for life) takes girlie whining to a truly vaginal level ('Game over, man! Game over!') and Paul Reiser is perfectly cast as a corporate weasel. The most masculine Marine is Vasquez, a dirt-talking' Mexican dyke who has bigger guns (on her arms and around her neck) than any actual male Marine.The only male worth his cahonnes is Hicks (Michael Biehn) Â and even he ended up taking orders from Ripley. The other male of any note: Bishop the cyborg (Lance Henriksen, in an emphatic 'synthetic person' performance) Â and he got torn in half. All the other male Marines were like those nameless Star Trek crewmen who beamed down to a planet with the principle actorsÂCameron boldly brings us Sexy Dangerous with Ripley: whereas in ALIEN she was an innocent youth who grew into her formidable anti-alien role (with a wink-wink end-scene that stripped her down to panties to remind us of her femininity), here she is the vetted warrior, tougher than Marines, yet maternal enough to dote on a surrogate child; she may slam the corporate weasel against the wall, but when Hicks gives her a location bracelet ('Doesn't mean we're engaged or nothing') her alluring smile is radiant. Cameron has brilliantly created what every man craves - a woman powerful enough to stand on her own feet, yet beautiful enough to attract you into sweeping her off them. The Warrior/Goddess dichotomy. (If it weren't for that soccer mom 'do, she'd be perfect!) And he does it in such an artful way that we don't feel threatened or repulsed by it.Even the final battle is between Ripley and the alien queen, as the queen chases Newt (young Carrie Henn, who never made another movie), Ripley interjecting with the now-famous, 'Get away from her, you BITCH!' Â a female going after a female, being stopped by a female.This is a thunderous movie, fulfilling our every craving to see bigger, badder, madder aliens and see them in full action, in full view. Boldly directed and shot, with incredible detail paid to the species that spawned so many inferior copycats. The egg-laying scene, in the cavern with the queen alien, is a mind-stopper.And in the film's final minutes Â even WITH all the female empowerment flying at our testicles Â Our Man James Cameron somehow manages to get Ripley down to her panties again!....",8,1,2,29 April 2008
Saw III," Now it's just painful.
","A horror movie with brains... splashing all over your feet as they fall out of someone's skull.Okay, now it's officially gratuitous. SAW III begins the ruination of the SAW franchise. Not only is it needlessly gory, original SAW writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan try to connect the existing SAW movies in a Grande Trilogy that almost works, but only succeeds in pulling back the curtain on the skull-splitting intrigue that drove the original SAW.Shawnee Smith (who keeps getting hotter with each SAW) reprises her role as Amanda, and it is revealed that her role in all three SAWs was more integral than any of us had imagined. Backstory flies all over the place like intestines at a werewolf party; seems that after Amanda escaped the infamous head-bear-trap in SAW, she was so thankful to Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) for alerting her to the error of her junkie ways, she became his bottom bitch and has been aiding him with gags ever since - including the very first one with Leigh Whannell and Cary Elwes in SAW.TMI, dudes. Dial the backstory down to OCEAN'S TWELVE.SAW III picks up exactly where SAW II left off - Donnie Wahlberg as Detective Matthews chained to a pipe, in the movie's most powerful scene, which hearkens back to the hook that separated SAW from its knife-kill ilk - self-mutilation for the sake of escape.Unfortunately, as with II, after the stomach-churning opening, it's downhill on a tricycle with no brakes, Jiggie Doll eck-eck-ecking his little spiral-red cheeks.The connecting tissue in SAW III involves two stories: nurse Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) must keep Jigsaw alive through a graphic head operation, with the threat of a bullet necklace going off in her face if she lets him die; and Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) wanders through a house of traps where people involved in his son's accidental death are in mid-torture, his decision to either forgive them or let them die - but forgiveness will bring him one step closer to the ultimate killer of his son...That microcassette gag has become tiresome beyond redemption. At every trap, Jeff finds that infamous cassette that explains his conundrum, but the traps and situations are now so complex, it wears on our senses. The question becomes not how to escape the trap, but how ingeniously the trap was set up: people have to be stalked, studied, captured, inserted into their marvelously deadly traps, which have to be constructed from scratch, from no existing designs, meticulously working on timers, with all their escape points nullified so that there IS no escape, psychologically or physically... the logistics are mind-boggling.And that's when the nonsense of it all bleeds through. Even if Amanda was the most ambitious serial killer in the world, she still wouldn't have time to set all this up, avoid the authorities, pay the electric bill and still have time to apply makeup and lip gloss and keep her hairstyle so street-cred skanky.And when we see Jigsaw convulsing and vomiting in pain on his makeshift hospital bed, we recall our own human frailties. Think about those stomach aches that throw your whole day into disarray: a virus? gas? kidney stone? botulism? renal failure? A thousand sicknesses could double you over and make you a wailing child again, and you can't focus on anything except stopping the mind-curdling pain; you can't even plan ahead to LUNCH - yet Jigsaw, whose pain levels are immeasurable (as he reminds us constantly), can still summon the will to concoct ridiculously innovative methods of killing other people 'to teach them a lesson.' Insanity or genius? It just doesn't gel with what we know of human pain; in the midst of pain, it is impossible to think of inflicting it on others - we want to selfishly stop our own pain first.Admittedly, Jigsaw is a psychopath. But most psychopaths we encounter in knife-kill flicks are in prime health. Jigsaw, in the throes of convulsions, would still feel physical trauma as a human. Would that he used his ingenuity to outfit his dank little dungeon with methods to curb his pain, rather than spread pain outwards through Amanda.His first gags in SAW were in the early stages of his disease, so his psychosis could be accepted as that of a dying man erroneously mistaking killing others as grasping for a last spark of vitality. But here, every semblance of reason and motivation has been lost due to his near death condition.A powerful, surprising ending does nothing to curb our pain, and we know that even though SAW III ties it up with grand deaths all over the place, the franchise will limp on, fueled by contrivance.In the words of Monty Python, 'Oh, you're no fun anymore!'",5,1,2,20 November 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Whatchoo talking bout, Cheadle?
","As the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (and every other provincial, back-slapping institution for the purveyance of 'arts') quite often does, another faux-prestigious award needs to be invented for the sole purpose of giving it to just one guy: The Most Embarrassing Fake British Accent Of All Time Â awarded to Don Cheadle in 'Ocean's Eleven'. Surpassing even Keanu's Idiot-British in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' or 'Much Ado About Nothing', 'inauthentic' would be a compliment to Cheadle's uneducated abomination of the mother tongue. Cheadle played Sammy Davis Jnr. in the TV movie 'The Rat Pack' Â a role which called for the most talented actor of The Pack, as he had to mime not only singing, but tap-dancing, trumpet-playing and six-gunning, so it is with great concern that we view this exemplary actor's abject ignorance and lack of perception of one particular inflective tongue, based on his own spoken language! (Well, actually, *preceding* his spoken language, but this ain't the forum for resolving etymological beefs.)Still, casting Cheadle as a warbling limey was only nominally more sensible than casting the shovel-mouthed Julia Roberts as a 'beautiful woman'. And as casting choices go, this movie was at a disadvantage from the outset with the impossible task of filling the shoes of one Francis Albert Sinatra. In a role which Frank insouciantly tossed off as a lark (which cast all the more sheen on it for its rebellious bent), head-waggling George Clooney steps up as Danny Ocean. And fails.With 'Ocean's Eleven', as with 'Robin and the Seven Hoods', or 'Jailhouse Rock', or 'Every Which Way But Loose', we're not so much dealing with 'movies' as we are with 'movie STARS'. (In sooth, this 2001 'Ocean's Eleven' observes that tradition with the wealth of wasted talent deployed in it.) Re-making films such as these will not capture the consecrated quality afforded the originals by the passage of time and the involvement of their particular god-status icons. It is merely a fiscal exercise, involving brand-name recognition (buy the original rights and wretchedly sully the nostalgia), curiosity quotient (we'll get the Frank & Dino fans into the theater at least *once*), next-generation retro hipness ('I'm so kewl cos I like the 'classics'), crossover marketing (with this ensemble, we're *bound* to get *someone* through the turnstiles) and providing A-List actors with work to keep them off reality shows. The premise to heist major casinos in Las Vegas is the only tie with the original 'Eleven', as this remake's storyline had to be noticeably updated to cater to the state of advances in hi-tech security, the writers sensibly eschewing re-creating The Rat Pack's lo-tech heist note for note.Of the heist gang, Brad Pitt is Clooney's 'Dino'; Matt Damon meanders one- dimensionally, Bernie Mac does his 'black thing'; Cheadle does his 'cockney(?) thing'; excepting Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner, the remainder of the Eleven are populated by 'passengers', including Ben Affleck's brother and James Caan's son gaily taking on half-dimensional roles.Maybe it's just admiring that previous generation's devil-may-care tilt at Life (or at least, the *media's* reporting of it) that gives the 1960 'Eleven' more of a rose-colored flare than all the gadgetry and gags this remake offers as collateral. Though there are attempts at capturing the magic and camaraderie of the original (Clooney's best line to Pitt, 'Ted Nugent called Â he wants his shirt back'), this movie's redemption is in its slick production value Â it may ring hollow as a buddy-piece, but it is truly a guilty ocular pleasure, highly watchable for its appealing camera-work, lighting and set design. Inadvertently turning this piece into a *nolo contendre* flame-fest, I might as well fire home the last barb in stating that the original 'Eleven' packs a hilarious, if not frustrating, twist ending - unequivocally a more substantial wallop than the anchor that this remake is built on: the interpersonal fizzle of George & Julia's latent love. Let's face it, an action-comedy movie with an ending where Nothing Happens leaves us holding the proverbial injured aquatic bird (i.e. lame duck). With this ensemble, one would expect roiling acting chops flung at the viewer like raw meat to lions, but the only players who consistently chew their roles delectably are Andy Garcia (as the casino owner heistee), Gould and Reiner. Everyone else is flailing for substance, including Pitt and Clooney who only have a few good moments together; the rest of the time, they're just being Brad Pitt and George Clooney, vying for enough screen time to try to top each other for one of those provincial, back-slapping, faux-prestigious awards that already exists: People Magazine's World's Sexiest Man.My vote is for Frank Sinatra.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",5,0,1,30 December 2003
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Before Swine.
","In garish detail and stunning investigative probing, PEARL HARBOR digs deep below the surface of the gasoline embargoes and jingoistic fomenting and reveals exactly what this WWII conflict was all about - the love triangle between three young American Models.You see, Ben loves Kate. And Kate loves Ben. But Ben's best friend, Josh, also likes Kate. And there's a war with Germany or something happening. Ben is a hot pilot, and reports to somewhere overseas that is Not America for hot dogfights that make his biceps thrum with the need to hold Kate.Ben is shot down and reported Missing In Action back in the United States, a land where every waking hour is spent looking to get laid (if you were a nurse like Kate) or looking to get laid (if you were a flyboy like Josh). So when Ben is reported missing, Kate cannot face the next five long days wondering if she will ever get laid again, so she falls in love with Josh.Now Josh loves Kate. And Kate loves Josh. But Ben comes back. And he hits Josh for falling in love with Kate. Then they have a beer. And then the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. The end.Don't even want to go into the real politics behind that Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, when the Japanese launched a surprise attack that wasn't really a surprise on the American Pacific Fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. God knows, director Michael Bay doesn't.Remember, if it weren't for those young models in love, none of this woulda happened. Written with emotive overkill by Randall Wallace (BRAVEHEART, 1996, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, 1998), HARBOR reminds us of TITANIC (1997), where the insufferable love story sucked all the oxygen out of the movie until James Cameron redeemed himself with that magnificent CGI boat-tipping.Discounting the three-way pap between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, PEARL HARBOR's redeeming war scenes are cinematography gone insane. Spielberg never took to the air in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - he still holds the crown for best ground skirmishes - it takes Michael Bay's sweeping cranes to now claim the crown for best air battles: Affleck gets to fly a Spitfire, the coolest fighter plane ever, in rampaging dogfights that put us so square in his hot pilot's combat seat that we can feel the sweat puddling on the backs of our patriotic thighs.The scenes of the stealth Japanese planes flying low over American farmers and people out enjoying the world, thinking the war was in some other country, look surreal enough now - imagine how it must have looked in 1941. The thunderous grumble of amassed Zero engines splitting the rural morning, each plane loaded with one bomb each, tilting low over fields and schools, under American radar, Bay's characteristic American Blond Kids in slow motion below them.The Pearl Harbor attack is launched with a tracking shot of a bomb loosed from a Japanese plane down to the USS Arizona, silently falling, then exploding and actually undulating the ship like a steel snake spasming. From there, the incredible realism of old school battle is more exhilarating than walking in on Kate Beckinsale sandwiched between Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett.Bay and cinematographer John Schwartzman have such a knack for creating iconic images that even whilst we cringe at the melodramatic slomo and hero framing of certain scenes, they wring a tear as well with their beautifully evocative composition. The art overshadows the story.Cuba Gooding Jr. fires a big deck gun. Tom Sizemore runs around his airfield and swears. Jon Voight shucks off his Republican idiocy to play Democratic president, FDR with great empathy. Obvious that Bay believes HARBOR to be his MIDWAY (that 1976 war epic with A-Listers piled on A-Listers: Heston, Fonda, Coburn, Mitchum, Mifune, Wagner...), as he populates his film with numerous 'names' in smaller roles: Alec Baldwin, Jennifer Garner, Mako, Colm Feore, Dan Aykroyd, Ewen Bremner...Beckinsale - ever the female double standard bearer - asks boxer, Cuba Gooding Jr., 'So why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?' completely forgetting that her own boyfriend is gunning down strangers in planes to keep her respect, with his big Spitfire-shaped penis.Kate tells Josh as he's going off to war, 'I love you and I'll be here waiting for you when you come back.' Of course, that's provided you don't go MIA and my thigh twitch compels me to turn to the Next Best Thing...Cuba looked pretty hot on that big gun...",6,3,6,16 August 2009
Tropic Thunder," Bringing the Thunder.
","As gut-wrenching as APOCALYPSE, as heartfelt as RYAN, and as filthy as hell, TROPIC THUNDER is another in the small oeuvre of Ben Stiller writer-director-actor comedies where Stiller goes 'full retard' for maximum satirical jungle juice.Action movie juggernaut, Tugg Speedman (Stiller) and a platoon of spoiled-rotten actors, all from major-grossing films in various genres (Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Brandon T. Jackson, Jay Baruchel) are having spoiled-rotten-actor issues while filming a cheddar-cheesy Viet Nam war movie with their frazzled director (Steve Coogan) - until their military consultant (grizzled Nick Nolte - that's kinda tautologous nowadays) suggests they be air-lifted into real jungle in Southeast Asia to man them up, whereupon Tugg is captured by real guerillas (whom he thinks are actors), with his platoon forced to use their cheese chops and fake props to save him.We sometimes mistake Stiller for a mediocre talent when we see him as Actor Only in drab dishrags like MEET THE FOCKERS and ALONG CAME POLLY, or mediocre milestones like MYSTERY MEN and DODGEBALL - but we need to separate those acting-only jobs from his personalized writer-director-actor projects.This is the same man who brought us the brilliant - yet too-quickly-canceled - THE BEN STILLER SHOW (1992) and after getting his directorial feet wet with the GenX throwaway REALITY BITES, his subsequent writer-director-actor output is from stellar left field: THE CABLE GUY (1996), ZOOLANDER (2001), and now TROPIC THUNDER.THUNDER is a tribute to the poo-kicking industry of movie-making; self-effacement, narcissism and irony girds the script and fuels the characters: Stiller's Speedman is everything that Arnold and Stallone were, with ten times the hyperbole; Jack Black is heroin junkie Portnoy, with the fart-driven comedy franchise THE FATTIES; Brandon T. Jackson is hip-hop superstar Alpa Chino, with a soft drink line called Booty Juice; Jay Baruchel is the naive youngster starstruck just to be around legends; and under-used Steve Coogan is the flustered director who cannot control his movie stars.Plucking references from APOCALYPSE NOW, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, PLATOON, the RAMBO series, THE DEER HUNTER, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, the cinematography sometimes brushes up so close to those classics it is eerie.Tom Cruise is the callous movie producer, who sees more profit in Tugg being M.I.A. than rescued. And he's very funny, in a very scary way. But it will take awhile to see through the heavy bald makeup and fat forearm prosthetics to recognize him. Matthew McConaughey, on the other hand, is the same surfer dude and Tugg's agent.But the movie belongs to Robert Downey Jr. For once that comedic force of nature known as Jack Black does not steal the show. That award must go to Downey for, ironically, playing a black. He is simply astonishing as an Australian, Kirk Lazarus, an actor so immersed in Method that he undergoes 'skin pigmentation' to play the role of an African-American, in a nod to that Hollywood idiocy of placing white movie stars in non-white roles.At first it's seems like a joke - but Downey goes deep. And never lapses. He IS The Black Man. He inhabits the skin of Lazarus so fully that most of his lines are ad-libbed - and sound authentically black! He lives the black vernacular, the black swagger, the black inflection... I'm sure African-Americans would pick his slipups (as I pick his fake Australiana when he lapses into that character) - and the actual black guy on set, Alpa Chino, continually lambastes him for racism - but the completeness of Lazarus's transformation is magnificent and gutshock hilarious.When Tugg accuses Lazarus, 'You people are always complaining...' he counters with 'What do you mean 'you people'?' To which Alpa retorts, 'What do *you* mean 'you people'?' Tugg's previous, Oscar-tilting role was in SIMPLE JACK, a starring role where he played a retarded man, yet lost the Oscar. Lazarus advises Tugg he shouldn't have gone 'full retard': 'Check it out: Dustin Hoffman - RAIN MAN, look retarded, act retarded, not retarded. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic? Sho'. Not retarded. Tom Hanks - FORREST GUMP. Slow? Yes. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded...' In an inspired piece of screen writing, the SIMPLE JACK subplot, the classic war films and this film's opening scene itself all come together to create a satirical yet somehow tear-jerking climactic scene.If Hollywood could make more movies like this one, maybe movies lambasting Hollywood like this one wouldn't have to be made.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,1,2,4 March 2009
Quantum of Solace," Quorum of Stinkus
","Stunt, stunt, stunt, crash. Stunt, stunt, stunt, crash. Explosion.QUANTUM OF SOLACE, directed by Marc Foster like a speed freak on crank and edited by Matt Chesse and Richard Pearson like a chicken fight in a monkey house, makes THE BOURNE IDENTITY look like MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.As I watched the opening car chase grind metal, and the subsequent foot chase beat streets through an Italian town during a horse race, one question kept surfacing: Did I accidentally walk into TRANSPORTER 3?QUANTUM OF SOLACE exists only for its next popcorn chase sequence only to show off its next stunt, with editing that will maim your optic nerves. Your eyes will start hurting long before you realize there's nothing on screen worth watching.Daniel Craig, still chiseled like a Grecian statue, still super-cool and super-cruel, is listed as playing Ian Fleming's super-spy character, James Bond.But is it still Bond? Having recently watched two of Pierce Brosnan's outings (GOLDENEYE and DIE ANOTHER DAY), I see that Brosnan (a perfect Bond, I might add) never colored so far outside the lines of the character that he became not just unrecognizable, but indistinguishable from the morass of other taut-buttocked man-toys glutting the action hero landscape. That's the tragedy here - Craig could be Jason Statham or Clive Owen or Jet Li; the Bond franchise might have been resurrected/reimagined in CASINO ROYALE, but there is not enough 'essence of Bond' left by venturing so far outside the box in QUANTUM.There is still the suaveness, sure, but the infamous Bond gadgets? Not a trace, except maybe the soaring height of computer technology displayed by the whole MI6 organization. Aston Martin? Only a banged up version in the opening car chase. Flamboyant villain? Well, he's indeterminately Euro with designs on absolute power. Ironic banter? Nope. Quips? Nope. Sex with leading lady? Nope - instead, a glorified extra. Even the catchphrase, 'Bond. James Bond' is absent. And the laughable Bond death-traps where - like the 1960s Batman - he is left to die in some contraption with a countdown that allows him just enough time to find an improbable escape with no one watching? Bond actually turns the table on this one, leaving the villain in the desert with only a can of motor oil to sustain him.Written by the talented Paul Haggis, the Evil Plot in this Bond film is congruent with today's morally muddy politics, where a shady 'green' entrepreneur, Gordon Greene (Mathieu Amalric), deals hand-in-glove with the CIA and the British government, who both admit, 'if we didn't do business with villains we wouldn't be doing business at all.' Of course, Greene's ultimate aim is power over others - in this case, monopolizing the water supply in Bolivia, using 'environmentalism' as a cover.For those not paying attention, there are the eye-straining fight scenes and chase scenes to keep you amused: car chase, boat chase, plane chase, moped chase, foot chase across rooftops (where've I seen that before? Oh yeah - the last Bond film!), wholesale destruction following in the wake of Bond and his pursuers.Meanwhile, that wrinkled old man in charge of MI6, Judi Dench, goes swishing about doubting Bond's trust because he is mooning over a chick who got murdered in the last film. So Bond goes rogue long enough to plonk a newbie bimbo by the name of Fields, then finds her dead like the chick in GOLDFINGER, covered in oil instead of gold. (Black gold?, heh heh--Waitaminute! Even if you were dipped in crude oil like a shrimp cocktail, wouldn't it just slide off? How does it cake her body like black syrup?) And the leading lady - in these films, termed Bond Girl - Olga Kurylenko, doesn't even schtupp Bond! Isn't that the POINT of being a Bond Girl?! Detached to the point of boring, Kurylenko's ice queen character is ironic, playing some kind of double-agent with a burn scar on her back that I couldn't stop looking at, tooling about a searing desertscape, trapped in a hotel fire - yet generating not one iota of heat. Let's face it: Bond's universe is no place for a woman too independent. Our primal instincts felt the old magic when dippy Fields bantered with Bond, but that misogynistic fun was not to last. Excuse the pun, but - 18 million cracks, my arse! Why does everyone moan about the title? Does anyone know what Quantum means outside of physicists and Scott Bakula fans? (From IMDb:) According to Henry Chancellor in his book James Bond - The Man and His World, 'Quantum of Solace' relates to the necessary iota of emotion that is needed between lovers.Now tenuously link this with Bond seeking revenge for his last bÃ©bÃ© and the villainous organization named Quantum. Thank the junkets we don't have to view the film for this info, which takes us from Haiti, to Italy, Bolivia, Austria, London, Russia, and leaves us north of Eye-Strain.QUANTUM opens with the good ole sexploitation gimmick of sand dunes as naked women, Alicia Keys and John White singing, Another Way to Die; closes with the gun barrel motif and classic Bond theme music.Just like the last film, Bond's healing abilities are like Wolverine: every little face cut - healed by the next scene. In CASINO ROYALE, he plonked Vesper Lynn mere days after his mandacious torture - can the franchise heal itself as quickly as Wolverine Bond's ballsac?",6,20,26,6 December 2008
Independence Day," The Arrogance of Independence.
","'The most likely circumstance is that extraterrestrial beings will look nothing like any organisms or machines familiar to us.' --Carl Sagan, The Cosmic Connection.And what is the moral of INDEPENDENCE DAY, my child? That humans will always win. Always always always. Aliens got no game like humans; even with faster-than-light travel and impenetrable shields and death rays and superior technology and ruthless efficiency far greater than humans... humans will always win.How could they not? Humans made the movie. Arrogant sluts. All alien invasion films are nothing more than human arrogance, from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL to CONEHEADS.This movie just has better special effects.Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich have some gall listing themselves as the sole writers of this confused sci-fi debacle, when the alien arrival scenes in INDEPENDENCE DAY are plagiarized from Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End. City-sized spaceships eerily filter into Earth's skies, causing panic, yet simply hovering over major cities. These are the primo scenes in the movie, as massive shadows crawl over familiar landscapes, including the cowering White House.The inevitable human story lines are introduced - to make us care: Marine pilot, Captain Hiller (Will Smith), and his stripper fiancÃÂ© (Vivica A. Fox); the President (Bill Pullman) and his stranded wife (Mary McDonnell); the tech geek (Jeff Goldblum), his Jewish dad (Judd Hirsch) and his estranged wife (Margaret Colin) who works for the Pres; the crop-dusting pilot (Randy Quaid) and his half-breed brood.And then - beautiful destruction; wholesale death ray decimation of cities, unquestioning, unmerciful, unhuman. And a cheer goes up as the White House is obliterated in a savage blast of energy; no two useless, duplicitous, bureaucratic bricks left standing together.End Act I.Let the stupidity begin.'The singular failure of UFO believers is their lack of imagination.' --James O'Ehley, The Sci-Fi Movie Page.The Aliens have razed whole cities in seconds. How do the Marines retaliate against power so formidable? Send in Captain Hiller and his fighter plane squadron, which will do as much damage as bacteria on an elephant's backside.The gargantuan Alien ships have impenetrable shields, which not even nukes can penetrate. Though nothing can harm them, why do they feel the need to counterattack Will Smith's bad boys with fighters of their own? Because the humans who wrote the movie have no imagination, forcing the aliens into stunted human methods of warfare.The ensemble cast all put in their 2c worth to defeat the aliens: Will Smith getting his black on, Goldblum getting his Goldblum on, Judd Hirsch getting his Jew on, Pullman getting his Clinton on; with Robert Loggia, Harvey Fierstein and Pullman trying to out-rasp each other for maximum cred.But can anyone's cred be saved if we examine their hypocritical agenda? Pres Pullman communicates with an alien through some kind of Spock mind-meld, and 'sees' the aliens' Grand Plan and rasps, 'My God!' with a Bon Jovi accent, 'They're like locusts, moving from planet to planet. After they've consumed every natural resource, they move on - and we're next!' Oh, the Aquanetted outrage! Er... excuse me - isn't that exactly what MAN does? Carl Sagan filibusters in all his books for space exploration and terraforming. After Earth's resources dry up, MAN himself must find a way to move on and rape some other planet.When faced with extinction from extra-terrestrials, of course we would fight back, but not because we are sanctimoniously 'right' - but because we are as SELFISH as the next race of intelligent beings. INDEPENDENCE DAY could have been saved with the inclusion of this one little concept.End Act II.Let the terror forming begin.'To rejoice in conquest is to rejoice in murder.' --Lao-Tsze, Chinese philosopher.Before the humans launch a definitive attack on the alien ships, President Pullman makes us feel dirty with his raspy pep speech: 'We will not go gently into the night; we will not vanish without a fight...' Somewhere an orchestra is playing; somewhere a cheese factory is dying.If Devlin and Emmerich stole the first act from Clarke, they stole the last act from H.G. Wells - in War Of The Worlds, Wells's Martian invaders die of Earth viruses. Conveniently forgetting that plagiarism is unethical, Devlin and Emmerich update Wells's organic virus to a computer virus, which Goldblum and Smith must plant personally in the mothership, which would scramble the force-shields of all the alien ships hovering over cities and leave them open to attack. Cue illogical plot, soporific aliens, enough special effects to feed all the children in Africa, and Einsteinian physics thrown out with the bathwater...How does Goldblum plant the computer virus in the alien computers - when we can't even get Macs to talk to PCs? Inspirational music, cheering across the globe, pretty orange explosions, sacrifice, tears, everyone on Earth happy (like an Obama election), movie stars uniting on the blasted white glaring salt flats... Is there anything more desirable to a woman than that last long shot of Goldblum and Smith striding towards the camera, their burning craft in the background, across the white blaze of the salt lake? (Probably the only recorded instance of a white man ever looking cooler than a black man.) Then the forgotten physics laws kick back in, as that same atmosphere that should have burned Smith and Goldblum to a cinder upon their re-entry now fries the remnants of the alien mothership as metal chunks of it streak across the stratosphere to put an epic cap on the overwrought finale...Carl Sagan wrote, 'The virtue of thinking about life elsewhere is that it forces us to stretch our imaginations.' Probably the only time Carl Sagan has ever been wrong...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,2,5,28 April 2009
The Butterfly Effect," The Teen Model Effect
","Ashton Kutcher courts credibility by sporting a beard that looks like the direct result of losing his shaver and sleeping in his clothes for two days. It worked for George Michael.As far as I can gather from *The Butterfly Effect*'s totally illogical storyline, a teen model time travels backwards to rectify sins of the past so that in the 'present,' he can hook up with another teen model.Noble? No. Hot? Definitely. We must remember whom this wiffle of a movie was created for Â girls. But despite its attempt to sabotage itself by casting Kutcher in the lead role, this thriller succeeds as a very effective and entertaining film. Directors/writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber move the action at the pace of a car salesman's pitch, and twice as slick, designed to specifically deceive your brain through the muddled logic and irreconcilable paradoxes for exactly the length of the movie. After that, you're on your ownÂThe actual 'butterfly effect' is a chaos theory syllogism (attributed to an early pioneer of chaos theory, Edward Lorenz), which posits that 'the flapping of a butterfly's wing will create a disturbance that in the chaotic motion of the atmosphere will become amplified eventually to change the large scale atmospheric motion, so that the long term behavior becomes impossible to forecast.' (Michael Cross, Professor of Theoretical Physics, CalTech). Put more simply, 'the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil may set off a tornado in Texas.' (ibid.) Consequently, *The Butterfly Effect* movie is based on chaos theory in the same way that *Achy Breaky Heart* is based on *Bohemian Rhapsody.*But the notion that the filmmakers attempt to impart is simple enough. Whenever Evan Treborn (Kutcher) jolts himself backwards in time to try to change one thing for the better (to ultimately end up with his dream girl, Kayleigh, played with varying degrees of conviction by Amy Smart), his action sets in motion a wave of unpredictability for the 'present' that he returns to.Or at least, unpredictability for the principals only. Evan, his mother and his teen friends change dramatically whilst every other person in their orbits is more or less unaffected. They don't seem to have made any new acquaintances, business partners or lovers along the way who influenced their lives Â these few teens only seem to have affected each other and the outside world just came along for the ride. So the world DOES revolve around teen models!The method by which Evan achieves his temporal travels is by reading his childhood diaries; read a certain page with the concentration of a teen model and he is jolted back to that point in time, as per Einstein's Theorem of Teen Model Time Travel. Upon finding a mess in the 'present' after each backwards jaunt, Evan steps up his jaunts to the point where we are watching him with the expectancy of another episode of Gilligan's Island; that is, the serious nature of his unique power dissipates and we wonder how that crazy Gilligan is going to mess up THIS week. Ultimately, the plot goes past chaos theory and straight to chaos.Weighted issues like pedophilia (shabby Eric Stoltz making a cameo as a child molester), letter bombs (remember the good old days when not even a bomb placed in your letterbox would make you puss out and cry 'terrorist!'?), animal abuse and baby-killing keep the movie above the fluff level. Some would say *below* the decency level. The kids playing younger versions of the teen models are such fine actors that, in a fit of disassociation, we incorrectly attribute their talent to the overall character of Evan, Kutcher being only the eldest incarnation, but nonetheless garnering our misplaced respect. Mediocre actor as read, there's no doubt that Kutcher is on a different plane of maturity when it comes to his professional life: an ex-Bioengineering student from Iowa, the 6'2' ex-model is a producer, executive producer, writer, restaurant owner Â and married to the hands-down-hottest Brat Packer (Demi Moore) who was married to the hands-down-hottest action hero in Hollywood, Bruce Willis. Dude, where's my bitchslap?The fact that Evan does end up performing a noble deed which leaves him Without The Girl is a brave choice for a Chick Flick of Kutcherian proportions, raising the sobriety level of the film even higher. (The director's cut inserts a very disturbing ending indeed: Evan goes back to the womb for his noble deed - how he got there, his fetus not having made any diary entries, is a question for the chaos theory mathematicians to answer. Anyone got Edward Lorenz's number?)If taken at face value, *Butterfly Effect* is a crafty, hip, infuriatingly enjoyable jaunt. If taken with a shred of logic, it retains about as much credibility as - well, Ashton Kutcher.",7,6,10,29 April 2008
Alien vs. Predator," AVP: Audience Versus Padding
","The question is not whether an 'Alien' can overcome a 'Predator' (ignorant semantics, as the two non-human species in this film are both 'aliens' AND 'predators'); the real battle is pitting the movie's Audience against its interminable Padding scenes. Can Â we Â survive? With my leg bloodied from the onslaught and a gaping wound in my side, I struggled out the theater exit, leaving two friends gurgling in the seventh row Â hey, I'm no jar-head Â I make no empty promises to 'leave no one behind'Â If the subterranean walking scenes didn't finish them off, the inane talking scenes did.Padding: 2. Audience: 1.This Alien/Predator movie is akin to the nippled Batsuit Â a franchise gone too far. It fulfills its purpose of keeping 14-year-olds off the street and thereby less likely to shoot up a school or get your daughter pregnant, which is small respite; all we can hope for Â until the next over-breasted Lara Croft video game release or somnolent Harry Potter movie. But as adult entertainment Â and let's face it: present-day adults, not kids, are the demographic weaned on the Alien and Predator movies Â it is diversionary, but not involving; good but not great, glittering but no prize.Both 'Predator' and 'Alien' were *sui generis* movies, the former spawning an adequate-bordering-on-lame sequel (Danny Glover in lieu of Arnold?!), whilst the latter, through canny screen writing and an uncompromising lead heroine, spawned three above-average sequels. Now, like the 'Highlander' franchise, the mythos of *both* creations has been sullied to the level of soap opera and with the Marketeers wielding their pimp-witted power, no longer will any successive 'Alien' or 'Predator' movies exude the mystery or excitement of their progenitors, but rather, bombastic, overblown CGI and gratuitously-tweaked explosions for the action-figure teenboy market.As a stand-alone movie Â forget it! This movie's existence is predicated on our cognizance of the last 25 years of these iconic monsters. Without that foreknowledge the very existence of these creatures and their interaction will appear contrived. The plot seems cobbled together from drafts made by 14-year-olds playing with their action figures (much like George Lucas writes his plots): an ancient pyramid is the initiation ground for young Predators, who achieve 'Predator-hood' by killing Aliens, which are kept captive in the labyrinthine pyramid by the elder Predators for just this purpose. At first, this seems mildly plausible, but then you realize that this exordium is shoving square storyline into round plot holes and demystifying not one, but TWO rapacious extra-terrestrial cultures into common Philo Beddoe barroom brawlers. Casting one's senses back to those heady days of the original movies, we remember that our enjoyment was piqued precisely because their antagonists WERE inexplicable; they were *truly*Â 'alien'; i.e. too much exposition makes for mundanity.Except for Lance Henriksen (renowned B-movie 'That Guy'), all human characters were instantly forgettable, except for a guy whose cultured locution could easily get him mistaken for a black James Bond and the young female expedition leader, a la Black Ripley; in essence, humans are this movie's McGuffin, for any agent could have unearthed the battle-pyramid and a text crawl could have explained the back-story of the Alien-Predator symbiosis. Only reason we meet humans at all in this film is so that we may invest a modicum of attention in this tale which, literally, has nothing to do with our species.Henriksen's role is anomalous: his character is familiar with Aliens (from 'Alien3'), yet when confronted by one, instead of becoming Mr. Corporation (as would be his character's wont), he burbles incoherently with the rest of the B-Actors. Then when confronted by a Predator, instead of dollar signs cha-chinging in his eyes at the discovery of yet another alien species, he goes Rambo on it and gets, subsequently, dead. But let me leave this trite conundrum to the fan-boys to clarify.Terming one species Alien and one Predator is a point of irritating contention for me; these terms only exist in OUR viewer-reality, for in the movie, the creatures are only superficially identified as 'serpents' (Aliens) and 'hunters' (Predators). The substitute terms are a dead giveaway: hunters are 'noble'; serpents, wellÂ do we need to extemporize on a well-trodden metaphor? From the outset, we are led a merry road by the film-makers to perceive the Predators as 'the good guys'. No surprise, for in being prejudicially human, we are prone to siding with the more anthropoid of the two aliens, and ironically, the Predators assume the Arnold role in this movie - the musclebound 'heroes', as it were. The movie rationalizes, sensibly, that the Predators only try to kill our human B-actors to re-acquire what was theirs in the first place Â their weapons. Which puts paid to the movie's tag-line, 'Whoever wins Â we lose.' Well, not exactly, for the Predators are portrayed as 'good guy' sentinels keeping the roistering Aliens at bayÂ So only if the PREDATORS lose, we lose.Thusly, battle scenes ensue Â with the predictably close-cut action and blurred whiz-banging - but the fights are only adequately directed and rather short, and it is just too incongruous viewing these two iconic monsters on screen together. Something just don't click. Either this would be a good Alien movie (for the Aliens are animated excellently, combining live puppetry with CGI) or a good Predator movie (the rugged masculinity of those 7-foot behemoths was enough super-cruel to power a small township), but - as Offspring advised Â 'you gotta keep 'em separated.' And for the record, the 'AVP' acronym is so IGNINTLY 'skoolyard-bitchin' that it REEKS of Marketeers grappling with the long-dead spirits of their nerd youth in pathetically trying to ramp up the street-cool of this geek-square movie.Give up your day jobs, fellas.Now gimme that spear Â after witnessing those man-tastic pecs on the Predators, I'm going in - I've got two friends to save in the seventh row",4,6,11,2 September 2005
No Country for Old Men," New Killer. Old Hairstyle.
","Quietude. West Texas veldt. 1980. A lone gunman (Josh Brolin) hunting game comes upon a slaughter scene: a handful of Mexicans dead in their clustered cars on the barren plain. The gunman follows a blood trail to another dead man clutching a leather briefcase stuffed to the seams with cash.Does he walk away? Does he call the police? Are you kidding? In THIS economy?! The gunman does the sane thing and takes the bag.Simultaneously, on a lonely desert road, the most sinister villain since Hannibal Lecter (Spanish star and newcomer to American cinema, Javier Bardem) uses a tank of compressed air and a cattle gun to dispatch a lone traffic cop. Wordlessly. Emotionlessly. His bad Brady hairstyle making his murder seem all the more incongruous (the cattle gun a judicious weapon of choice if you regard people as no more than cattle).It becomes obvious that the bag of money is his. His hunt for the gunman has begun.Tommy Lee Jones, as a small-town sheriff, narrates in these first few minutes (in that Texas Hick that fits him like a pair of horse-breaking denim jeans) describing a teen he put away years ago, who killed his girlfriend (Jones pronounces it 'kilt'), who bragged he would kill again if they didn't give him the chair; a remorseless sociopath whose mind Jones could not begin to comprehend, regarding the teen like a herald for a new breed of evil.That's got nothing to do with the rest of the film, but everything to do with what the film is ABOUT.From the novel by Cormac McCarthy, screenplayed and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, in its first ten minutes we see why *No Country For Old Men* is so lauded Â not through any explosions or car chases or ridiculous special effects Â but simply through its controlled camera and tension-filled storytelling. Films like this are often called 'minimalist,' but that's only because we have become so jaded and ocular-insulted with the *Spiderman*s and *Transformer*s - this is classic film-making in that bold Eastwood-ian vein.The plot is almost secondary to the exceptional manner in which the story is told through movie MAKING; through the 'art' of making the movie, framing every detail with utmost thought to light and shade, literally and metaphorically; each tension-soaked moment ratcheted to perfection; each scene a nuanced smorgasbord of directorial and acting skill.A large part of the film involves Bardem hunting Brolin (who refuses to let go of the bag of cash), the stark realism of the hunt creating more compelling moments than all the plot twists and CGI that other movies use as distraction. Such interesting scenes, dripping with almost-nauseous intensity: the old man at the store who nearly 'buys the store,' the dog chasing Brolin through a stream, the bruise that Brolin sustains from a door-lock exploding into his torso, the gruesome reality of a bullet wound and Bardem self-medicating and operating on himself; the awe-ful reality of a bone sticking through an arm after a car accidentÂ all these things never needed to be gussied up to hold our interest; there was no tweaking for 'Hollywood' impact Â and that is the screaming beauty of this movie. For an example of a movie that needlessly gussies and ruins its impact Â *Jurassic Park*: the epic beauty of the dinosaurs would have been enough to give the movie legs, instead, Spielberg and Crichton demoted the things of beauty into things of convention, making them chase people, thereby becoming plot contrivances that were no better than monsters or zombies.*No Country* defies every movie convention (which is why it leaves fully half its viewers boggled and/or disappointed): Woody Harrelson makes a cameo as a 'cleaner' Â and is suddenly 'cleaned' himself; Brolin's character vows he will turn the tables on the Brady-haired killer pursuing him - instead of that pat Rambo ending, Brolin's fate is a jarring departure from anything we are used to; the killer disappears without repercussion, without redemption Â and without his money; even Tommy Lee Jones' ineffectual sheriff, who never quite picks up the scent of Bardem-hunting-Brolin, doesn't come close to any closure or capture.Though Carter Burwell's score intermittently peeked through the large silences, the movie ends as it began. In quiet. Jones laments his directionless life to an old friend, ominously decrying how evil has outpaced good; how men like him are ten steps behind the new breed of killer.And this new breed of movie Â with its sharp turns and defiant originality - leaves us all feeling like there's a little bit of Danny Glover in all of us: We're getting too old for this",8,1,5,28 April 2008
The Love Guru," Half-Spreading the Love.
","THE LOVE GURU: another excuse for Mike Myers to act unutterably stupid - and get paid for it.As the Guru Pitka, the usually brilliant Myers is in mediocre form, playing an Indian guru who is hired by Jane (talentless Jessica Alba) to help a recently-separated hockey player, Darren (Romany Malco, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN), find 'balance' (i.e. get his game back on) after his wife leaves him for star player, Jacques 'Le Coq' Grande (Justin Timberlake).Though Myers flounders with that wavering Indian accent and jokes that require him to laugh at them himself, and though Alba is still getting by on the smoothness of her ta-tas rather than acting ability, everyone else is in fine form, especially - surprisingly - Justin Timberlake.He's fey, French, and fantastique in this broad comedic role that suits his style more than the unmanageable drama of BLACK SNAKE MOAN. His six-pack tatt speaks for him: The Man, The Legend; one arrow points up, one points down.Nice to see Verne Troyer (you know, Mini-Me) in an actual speaking role - an asshole, no less - as the domineering, loudmouth hockey coach.Ben Kingsley reprises his Gandhi, albeit Gandhi for Imbeciles and, of course, nails that Indian accent.Balance is almost restored - until everyone discovers Guru Pitka took a shortcut in 'curing' Darren. And we kinda laugh at him laughing at his own jokes all the way to the Bollywood ending.The one real laugh is when Pitka is surfing radio stations and - in a nod to WAYNE'S WORLD - flips past Bohemian Rhapsody and does a camera-take.In the words of Freddie: 'Ooooh bay-beh / Can't do this to me, bay-beh / Just gotta get out / Just gotta get right out of here.'--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,2,5,2 March 2009
District 9," A Closer Encounter.
","It lacks the epic majesty of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the wonderment of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, the cloying fear of ALIEN, the scientific ineptitude of STAR WARS, it even lacks the funny masks of STAR TREK. But - like 2001, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, ALIEN, STAR WARS and STAR TREK - DISTRICT 9 is revolutionary! All extraterrestrial alien movies must now bow down before DISTRICT 9.Like the deformed child of a documentary and a reality show; a psychodrama with a tongue-in-cheek sense of black humor. No world domination or alien armies, no mighty deathships or hyperspace star streams, no cantina scenes or darth Cheneys - just a real world grit and bureaucratic spit, coupled with racial allegory that holds up a ruthless mirror to mankind's black soul. Much like BRÃNO, only totally Not Gay.They arrived 20 years ago in their broken spaceship. And just hung in the sky, unthreatening, unknown, un-Spielberg. Luckily, they didn't break down over the country with the biggest percentage of closed minds per boob job - America. But even over Johannesburg, South Africa, livid with the unlearned lessons of apartheid, they became pariahs. The government rescued these one million malnourished, harmless, 'worker class' aliens from their own ship and overcrowded them into a Johannesburg shanty town called District 9.Squalor, crime, interspecies prostitution and black market arms deals between the aliens and Nigerian gangs prompt Johannesburgers to demand 'apart-hood' from the aliens.Multi-National United (MNU), a military/government body, appoints nerdy cubicle boy, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley, in his first major role), to oversee the massive relocation of the aliens 200 miles from Johannesburg.Wikus storms District 9 with bogus 'eviction forms,' like Orwell's Thoughtpolice by way of Ricky Gervais, as we try to figure whether this is high comedy or uncomfortable racism. It is both.Bigots call the aliens 'prawns' for their crustacean-like faces, and the unflappably jaunty Wikus seems to be the biggest bigot of all, as he orders the burning of a shack brimming with alien eggs, telling jokes about the baby prawns inside bursting like popcorn as they're trying to escape.Director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp has assembled a cast of brilliant unknowns, and forged a movie of veteran quality, creatively lensing the story's development through security cam and surveillance formats and news footage; aided by producer and fantasy god-king, Peter Jackson (LORD OF THE RINGS, KING KONG 2005).It can now be said that Jackson's special effects company, Weta Digital, blows every other effects house back to the age of Pong - this goes for prominent A-Listers like ILM (STAR WARS), Sony Imageworks (SPIDER-MAN), Giant (INCREDIBLE HULK). In DISTRICT 9, we never doubt the veracity of the city-sized spaceship hanging in the sky, the thousands of aliens in full daylight, the 3D holograms, the weaponry...Alien weapons (which the aliens trade for catfood and hookers) is attuned to alien DNA, so humans cannot use them, which of course, the humans try to do, by mutilating aliens in MNU underground labs in attempts to combine their DNA with humans. (The analogies with Nazis' human experiments are not lost.) While in DISTRICT 9, the Nigerian gang leader (on advice of his witch doctor) eats fresh aliens for the same purpose.Wikus unwillingly becomes the most wanted man amongst the aliens, the Nigerian gangs and the MNU, when a vial of alien fluid accidentally spurts in his face... Flashbacks to THE FLY, as his fingernails and teeth gradually fall out, nubs of exoskeleton poking through his flesh... alien DNA combining with his...And an alien that Wikus was terrorizing, named 'Christopher Johnson' (wearing a red vest, so I shall call him Red Vest, rather than use his slave name), and his smart little alien son, become unbidden allies to Wikus.In any alien film, language is the credibility downfall. Here, both parties have learned the basics of each other's speech, but since their throats are constructed differently, do not try to imitate each other, speaking fluently and authentically, picking up snatches of concepts.Even when DISTRICT 9 tips into 'blockbuster' and suffers a TRANSFORMERS moment (when Wikus is inside a giant CGI exoskeleton), the reason for him being inside the robot suit is to save Red Vest to reunite him with his son. Amidst the hail of gunfire from muttonhead military drogues led by a vindictive officer (David James), poignancy blossoms as Wikus almost tenderly (yet with firepower to stop tanks) tells Red Vest, 'Let's get you to your son.' And by the way, don't humans know by now that regular bullets can't harm alien robot suits? DISTRICT 9 is ultimately a Grande Tragedie, as Wikus transforms into that which he despised, taking 'seeing things through another's skin' to a whole 'nother level.Laden with these metaphors and allegories, DISTRICT 9's stylish brutality may in fact distract from its message: it doesn't take extraterrestrial aliens to bring out the barbarism and racism in humans. Any nominally alien race will do.Humans were no less brutal in 1948 when apartheid laws were institutionalized; were no less inhumane when burning Jews in 1944 (and probably laughing as internal organs burst with popcorn sounds); are no less single-minded in their brainwashed murder when eradicating Iraqis in George W. Bush's 'holy crusades' undertaken by Xe (nee Blackwater) in 2006...When worlds collide in DISTRICT 9, the beings displaying the most inhumanity - are the humans.",9,4,5,26 July 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Shooting of an Olde Worlde Epic by a New World Filmmaker.
","This classical western draws us into 1800s Americana so richly that we feel our teeth rotting from lack of dentistry not invented yet.Written and directed by Andrew Dominik (from a book by Ron Hansen), THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a study in authenticity; the set dressing, weaponry, music, the arcane vernacular of the characters, even the wordy title itself transports us back to grainy film and honky-tonk pianos, thrusting us bodily into the grimy, wild, paranoid frontier that was romanticized beyond its harsh reality.Dominik's photoplay is a deconstruction and a rambling paean to a bygone era. And way too long for the iPod generation...Jesse James (foreboding Brad Pitt) is already a legend when we meet him. Nineteen year old, Robert Ford (whining Casey Affleck) is obsessed with everything Jesse, collecting and poring over every dimestore paperback featuring the outlaw, now starstruck that he rides with the man himself. Vouched for by his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell), Robert comes onboard a ragtag new James Gang assembled for one last job by Jesse and brother Frank (mighty Sam Shepard).Even Jesse senses there is something peculiar about Robert's hero worship: 'I can't figure it out: Do you wanna be like me - or do you wanna be me?' A tragic, insecure, yet dangerously ambitious runt, Robert Ford wants the fame that riding alongside the infamous Jesse James will bring. When the gang fragments and Robert finds himself still a nobody, he sees one last stab at fame in being Jesse James's assassin.A narrator lifts passages directly from the Ron Hansen book that inspired the film. Not only is there an ancient poetry in the words: '...and the omens promised bad luck which moated and dungeoned him,' the accompanying scenes look like 1800s photographs, with anamorphic lenses blurring the edges of the screen. There is so much detailed thought that has gone into making this movie experience an ancient wonder that-- --it is almost a pain to watch! You heard me, Movie Aficionado. ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES seems to come at us through a time warp from the 1800s, as every aspect that elevates it also detracts from its 'modern' enjoyment. It might be called 'controlled direction' but we can also say that events unfold in this movie with the rapidity of swimming through tar; we can call it challenging to listen to the olde worlde vernacular, but most of the time, it is ear-strain, and I had to turn on the English subtitles ('for the hearing impaired' Â that always gets me!) if I was ever to decipher their jargon: 'I'll say, How come an off-scouring of creation like you is still sucking air when so many of mine are in coffins? I'll say, How did you get to reach your 20th birthday without leaking out all over your clothes? And if I don't like his attitude, I will slit that phildoodle so deep he will flop on the floor like a fish!' Without subtitles, you ask yourself, 'Did he just say what I thought he said?'ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES is very successful at creating the paranoia of Jesse and all those around him, Jesse unceremoniously killing ex-gang members if he caught a whiff of betrayal in the air. He may have been the prettiest of the gang, but he was also the most unbalanced, prone to mood swings that would make a high maintenance girlfriend look almost sane.Though the film's title suggests Jesse James was an honorable man betrayed, we realize its irony in the film's depiction of Jesse as a wary coward himself, so paranoid that he would stoop to any lengths to stay one step ahead of the law or the people who might betray him, not averse to torturing young boys for information or shooting friends in the back.This is not a shoot-em-up western, yet all the violence is sudden and unflinching, therefore more dreadful than the glamorized violence we've grown inured to. The realism of the guns sounding like cap pistols and head-smacks sounding like bone on meat makes us realize how much fantasy we've been listening to all these years, from the cannon reports of FISTFUL OF DOLLARS to the wet-towel punches of any John Wayne west-fest.On April 3, 1882, Robert Ford shot Jesse James in the back of the head. Jesse was not wearing his guns.For a while, Robert Ford seemed to get what he wanted, as he became more recognizable than the president, touring with a stage play recreating Jesse's final moments, with his brother Charley playing Jesse and Robert reprising his own ignominious role.Only after Jesse's death do we realize this tale is Ford's point of view, as the movie continues for another half hour in a world where Jesses James is dead. Robert's star would rise in the aftermath of the killing, only to plummet as the Legend of Jesse James grew into romanticized pulp.By the time Robert Ford was shot down himself for being the 'coward who shot Jesse James' - by a nobody named Edward O'Kelly - his spirit was at such a low ebb that he welcomed it.An ambitious movie, with power names on the production credits: David Valdes (UNFORGIVEN), Brad Grey (THE DEPARTED), Ridley Scott (AMERICAN GANGSTER), and Brad Pitt himself; DP Roger Deakins (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN); music by Nick Cave - even a cameo by Clinton dogsbody, James Carville, playing an iron-fisted governor, of all things. Andrew Dominik brings back epic, emotional film-making to this world stunted with Transformers and Iron Men.",8,1,2,9 January 2009
Batman Begins," Dark Knight Reconstructionist Theory
","Droves of bats against an ocher sunset, teasing out the infamous Bat Logo on the sky with their swarming bodies; the first five seconds of Batman Begins are scintillating.Then it just keeps getting better.If there is bedrock truth in the axiom, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', then surely the inverse is also true: 'If it IS broke Â FIX it.' And if there was one modern legend that needed fixin', it was the laughable vamp and clamorous camp of Gotham's fruity caped crusader, the Bat Man. As Michael Caine might opine, 'About bloody time'.Director Christopher Nolan is in no hurry to throw us blockbuster money shots, as this leisurely-paced (yet crammed with content) origin tale takes us on a blighted journey, physically and mentally, exploring the whys and wherefores of the psychosis/rationale behind one man's obsession for curbing injustice. Along the way, we are made privy to a multitude of answers to questions we've sometimes never even thought to ask, such as: how did Alfred get in on the gag?; origin of the Batcave?; cowl contractors?; why reptilian spikes on forearms?; why even WEAR a cape, a non-utilitarian artifice at best? - and, most importantly, 'why a bat?' In the Keaton-Batman movie (till now, the best of the modern Batman series), we met our protagonist already entrenched in his dualism; how he got there was the subject of minimal flashbacks and *a priori* knowledge on the viewer's part. This movie, though subtitled 'Batman 5', SHOULD realistically be the first in the series.Which raises a pertinent issue: where do they go from here? Through years of braindead example, we are well aware of how gutless, greedy, shameless and rootless studio heads are, and how they would readily sacrifice quality for the sake of potentially increasing sales of their stocks. The fact that creating a quality product might even elevate their stock values never occurs to them. As such, 'Begins' is unfortunately not the beginning of a trend, but a *departure* from Method, as painfully illustrated by the shallow mentality (and hence, wide demographic appeal) of The Fantastic Four, this season's Other Superhero Movie.Batman Begins is so rooted in a modern-day reality, and filmed so grittily and starkly, that when the Batman eventually does appear, he is almost incongruous; an anachronism in this modern crime drama. In keeping with Bruce Wayne's vision: invoking fear with a figure so haunting and misplaced from reality that it resembles nightmare.Not for the Attention-Deficit-Disorderlies, our Chiropteran Hero appears well after the movie's first hour and then, only in small bouts of screen time - true to Wayne's vision, 'the bat man' is portrayed as an enigma. See too much of the Enigma, it loses its mystery and terror.Amazing how the film-makers took so many liberties with this revered character and yet re-rendered him as even MORE appealing. The costume is the blackest, sleekest and most functional of all Batman's incarnations. (Unfortunately, after initial glimpses, we never see it wholly clearly again.) The logo has been honed to a more serrated appearance - subsequently, all the bat-gadgets must necessarily resonate this upgrade. The Batcave is an actual CAVE, depicted before computerization, dramatic lighting and rising turntable dais for BatmobileÂ Nolan even went so far as to renounce the canon, 'Never mess with a man's vehicles', obliterating the popular conceptual design of Batman's automobile Â gone are the associative batwings and sleek undulating curves Â the 'tumbler', as it is called here, is the jagged offspring of a Hummer and an F-14 Tomcat.And the best upgrade of all: Batman is no pussy-rescuer.Allow me to elaborate: Superheroes are often shown saving kittens in trees and preventing minor purse-snatchings, to give us a sense that they really do CARE on a level which should probably be 'beneath' them. Well, it IS beneath them. In a reality where super-beings commission themselves to combat injustice, they would be veritable gods (albeit vigilante gods), and you don't bother gods with trivialities like the coffee machine being broken Â they are there to solve the BIG PROBLEMS that are above the Common Folks' capabilities.Ironically, a 'super' being concerning himself with every grocery-store heist and fanny-pack snatch WOULD be considered a menace through his vigilantism - by every cop flunkie who would rather be scoring the collar for themselves.Conversely, super-beings who involve themselves at higher levels of crime will ALSO risk run-ins with the authorities Â but at higher levels of bureaucracy. For the authorities in every major city don't REALLY want to stamp out crime, or drugs, or terrorism Â without the power they wield as supposed protectors from these 'evils' (not to mention the direct and indirect kickbacks and perks), they become impotent.An excellent writing choice in allowing this 'super' being to resolve a fiendishly 'super' plot - one which could not simply be curtailed with some well-placed Pow's and Blammo's.Although, to be honest, in making Batman more than a pussy-rescuer, it would then be unnecessary for this high-crime bane to stand atop a rooftop gazing out over the city. All he is achieving is airing out his cape, as he is WAY TOO BUSY to go galavanting after every stereo-stealer and horse-dealer he must be witnessing from that vantage.The cast itself packs a Blammo, and have the time of their lives playing dress-up: Bale in his Batsuit; Caine, a spunkier Alfred; Oldman playing Good Guy; Liam, exotic Hard Guy; Murphy in his funky burlap hood; Wilkinson doing Pacino; Freeman playing Â er, Freeman.Give Keaton his due, but forgo the rest of the series, ESPECIALLY Clooney's nipples and Robin's single facial expression - it is HEREÂ that Batman beginsÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",9,0,0,2 August 2005
Liar Liar," Fabrication Retardation.
","Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a lawyer aka, ergo, ipso facto, a liar. His little son Max (Justin Cooper) makes no distinction, as Fletcher is a callous dad who is always breaking promises to Max, putting his job first.Max makes a birthday wish that his dad won't be able to lie for one whole day. It comes true.In LIAR LIAR, Carrey is once again directed by Tom Shadyac (who rocketed both their careers with ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE) and the result is once again as magical as the inexplicable force that compels Fletcher to tell the truth no matter the consequences.The hook in LIAR LIAR is that Carrey plays a normal guy, not a 'character' - and the honesty 'curse' turns him into a 'character.' Because he is just a regular man in the real world, his descent into truth and his resistance to it is all the more explosive. And his normalcy sometimes catches us off guard, highlighting what a brilliant dramatic actor Carrey can be when he isn't careening off the walls, as when he blurts to his wife 'I'm a bad father!' Maura Tierney is Fletcher's long-suffering wife, who has put up with his dishonesty long enough and plans to move to another town with her new boyfriend (Cary Elwes), taking little Max with her. Though his actions prove him discourteous, disrespectful and untrustworthy, Fletcher's abiding love for Max causes him to identify and make the changes he needs to keep Max nearby. It takes a day of telling the truth for him to realize what a big liar he's been all his life.Jennifer Tilly is the unethical defendant Fletcher must represent without the ability to lie. Amanda Donohoe as the office slut who exploits Fletcher's honesty by asking him what he thinks of the office staff and the boss - in front of them.Each scene is a Carrey masterpiece of ingenuity, of twisted faces and frenetic limbs, of speaking in tongues and grappling with oneself; as with his best work, it is indescribable and inimitable.One of Fletcher's clients calls him after being arrested again, needing advice, to which Fletcher screams into the phone, 'Stop breaking the law, asshole!' Every time I call my own lawyer, I'm grimacing and waiting for him to say the same thing...During Fletcher's Truth Phase, Max asks him if it's true that if you make weird faces they'll get stuck that way, to which Fletcher assures him, 'No, in fact some people make a good living that way.' Awesome Carrey. That's no lie.",7,3,4,1 January 2011
Bridesmaids," Marriage of heaven and hell.
","One blond (Kristen Wiig), one brunette (Maya Rudolph) and one fatty (Melissa McCarthy). Covering all the demos, are we? BRIDESMAIDS was advertised as being a Chick Flick version of SUPERBAD. Nope. It's just super bad. About a lonely bridesmaid (Wiig) who battles another snobbish bridesmaid (Rose Byrne) for the affections of the ugly bride (Rudolph).BRIDESMAIDS also aspires to being THE HANGOVER. Nope. The closest it gets to that raunchy film is when Wiig gets drunk on the way to Vegas and gets kicked off the plane. Then she wakes up with a hangover.Judd Apatow produces. Yet even with his usually perceptive comedy radar, this movie fails. At least, for me. Because I have man parts. It's not as hubristic as SEX AND THE CITY, but it's almost as annoying.Film loses me in its first frames, as Annie (Wiig) has raunchy, multi-positional sex - with her bra on. Who's buying this crap? Unless it's a quickie in someone else's bathroom, or across the hood of a car, or on a crowded dance floor, what Man would tolerate the prudishness of a woman who bolts on her bra through hours of sex?! Annie's schlep-buddy is Jon Hamm, delighting in squeezing her boobs - through her padded bra. What kind of madness--? (During this scene, Annie actually cracks a BRADY BUNCH joke about 'George Glass,' which only aged viewers of the 70's series will appreciate, if at all.) From there, it's an estrogen thrill ride, as we are dragged like whipped boyfriends through Woman Adventure, i.e. choosing dresses, tennis doubles, lunch, brunch, chocolate fountains, weepy movies and whining about not being married.The unbrained message is, as always, if you're Annie's age and don't have a husband, then something is wrong with you. After the constant dissatisfaction of being single, one would think that after a woman gets married, she would stop trying to trade up to an Antonio Banderas lookalike while partying in Vegas. Movie desperately tries to appeal to all genders and demos by injecting swearing, sex and scat into the Woman Adventure, but it's just polishing turds.Directed by Paul Feig, it's mostly hell, but there are two good aspects about BRIDESMAIDS. One is Kristen Wiig. Co-writer and lead, she sells this bilious piece of crap; a luminous darling of the screen, a female comedian who is consistently funny in all her work, and cutie-pie sexy to boot.And the other amazing thing about this unfunny comedy is that everyone pulls off such a fine acting performance, all underplaying so well, it's like they think they're in a good movie (except for the fat chick, who plays it broad; yes, pun intended). Cameo from Matt Lucas (LITTLE Britain), one of two fat, pasty Brits who love showing off their porcelain girth. Jill Clayburgh, the hottest chick ever (SILVER STREAK), is Annie's mum. Chris O'Dowd is Annie's tentative cop love interest; sensitive performance, we feel his love and pain.As well as Wiig, Byrne and McCarthy, the bridesmaid clique includes RENO 911's Wendi McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper. And then there's the bride, Maya Rudolph. Note how the ugliest of the women is the bride. Because she's the ugliest. If she were one of the bridesmaids, she would have played Aggressive Ugly Chick, the role that the Fat Chickfulfils. It stuns me how anyone could consider Rudolph 'beautiful' - or, heaven forfend, keep impregnating her! - when she is so obviously empirically mad ugly. Is it just a stock fallback position that one has to adopt around women in prominent positions, like Barbra Streisand and Jennifer Garner? I'm sure Rudolph herself - being a good actress and comedienne and more financially successful than I will ever be - would be the first to admit she's a special class of beast. It doesn't help when she takes a botulism dump in her wedding dress in the middle of the street. I was already on the verge of vomiting having to endure that face - and now I have to think of her greasy pork-hole expulsing feculence? Jesus on a donkey! I'm telling you, Movie Maniac, the distraction of Maya Rudolph's mugly noggin robs fully half my attention away from the movie and Kristen Wiig's padded bra. If you think it's just me, take a good look at the BRIDESMAIDS poster: Rudolph is the only women altered so that she looks like someone else! We all know that movie stars' pictures are always 'treated' to make them look ten years younger than their human age, sans pores. But on the BRIDESMAIDS poster, the Photoshop artist made some solid overtime on Rudolph: rounder eyes, less hooky nose, less grotesque lips, slimmer cheeks - it's a work of art! Everyone else is doctored with mere contrast and color balancing - they didn't even doctor the fat chick! So it's not just me who thinks Rudolph deserves some kind of Porridge Award for that puss - it's the marketers as well! And the marketers have done some extraordinary work, BRIDESMAIDS proving that the sniveling awards season is all about politics and not quality, as the movie is nominated for numerous Golden Globes, Oscars, AFI Top Ten, SAG Awards, etc. Even the Fat Chick has been nominated for Best Supporting just for acting like a walking erection.And as if the movie isn't painful enough, Wilson Phillips do the last song. You read that right: Wilson Phillips, that unlistenable 80's girl trio of vocalists made up of one blond, one brunette and one fatty.--Poffy's Movie Mania",3,1,5,25 December 2012
Meet the Fockers," Fockerize This!
","There are two big laughs in *Meet The Fockers* - but I can't remember where they are.Sequel to the minimally-superior *Meet The Parents*, this movie once again makes a fool of Robert De Niro, continues to make a neb of Ben Stiller, while orbiting megastars Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman add little or nothing with their 'oversexed teenagers' routine. Gwyneth Paltrow's mother and the blond fiancÃ© are plot conveniences.Silly lines ('I am going to be Pamela Martha Focker. I know how that sounds but I don't care!'), amateur looping ('Step on the gas, Gaylord!' Â a looped line just as we see a cop), contrived plot (an unnecessary baby nephew hovers, pets featured for specific gags, then disappear completely, people going through motions only to end up at next plot point), and shallow characters, it is the star power Â and star power alone Â that keeps this poster-movie for mediocrity afloat.The Byrnes family (headed by De Niro) meets the Focker parents (Streisand and Hoffman) and - so the junkets inform us Â 'all hell breaks loose.' Yes, this is hell.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",5,0,0,9 April 2006
Saving Private Ryan," A Spielberg fantasy done horribly right.
","What if the United States Military actually possessed a shred of decency and humanity? Shyeh! What if.In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the people who type the 'Sorry Your Son's Dead' letters for the Warmongers Who Send Sons Off To Die notice that three letters are addressed to the Ryan family of Anytown USA. Seems three brothers have been killed in the name of assuaging the small-penis insecurities of the American government. There is one more Ryan boy presumably still alive, and the Warmongers Who Send Sons Off To Die now send America's Favorite Son, Tom Hanks, to snatch the last Ryan from the belly of the beast, intending to send him home honorably. Shyeh! What if.Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the war movie by which all other war movies will be measured - not for its implausible premise (written by Robert Rodat) and typical propagandistic slant, but for its revolutionary depiction of battle scenes, more brutal than any ever committed to film. Visceral. Nightmarish. Incendiary. Words cannot do justice to the ferocious spectacle and gutshock aftertaste of the opening Normandy invasion.We meet the Yanks stepping onto the beach at Omaha, the sea more blood than brine, in a frontal assault on the Normandy coast that is going horribly wrong, as the German fortifications on the shoreline mow them down ruthlessly. Steel crossbeam obstacles called 'hedgehogs' stick nefariously up from the sand in the low tide; planted to mutilate the undersides of boats as they attain the shore - if the tide had kept the hedgehogs hidden underwater - now they ironically provide the only cover for the American troops in a searing firestorm.During this blood and bone tempest we meet Captain John Hiller (Tom Hanks) trying to stay alive yet move his troops closer to the German machine gun nests and take them out. We are in the crucified heart of the battle, blood on the camera lens, rain dirt muddying the view, machine gun rounds slamming and pinging past like fireballs, gray-green desaturated filmstock and a kind of lens flare sheen around the film edges; internal body parts, severed limbs, ear-numbing explosions; a grimy, hellish, embracing maelstrom of frenzied death.Spielberg and longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski capture what has never been captured in depictions of battle - desperation, futility, the overwhelming randomness of slugs whizzing by and claiming lives, medics wasting morphine stabs on dying soldiers; confusion and screaming, bodily fluids and exit wounds, intestines mixing with mud - simply the most authentic Cinematic War we have ever seen.Hiller's mission to Save Private Ryan is painted as a spark of humanity illuminating the gross inhumanity of war. YET. The high command's decision to send a son home to his grieving mother can only be for one reason - not moral, ethical or humane - to make a future politician look golden.Hiller's ragtag squad consists of Tom Sizemore (scrappy adjutant) Edward Burns (cynic looker), Giovanni Ribisi (the doc), Barry Pepper (holy sharpshooter), Adam Goldberg (resident Jew), Vin Diesel (goombah muscle), and Jeremy Davies (scaredy cat Upham). And each man is created whole, as we discover whenever 'characterization' sets in during quiet time.Captain Hiller feels every bladed inch of the Shakespeare axiom, 'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown' (Henry IV). He is the victim of one bad decision after anther, not all his fault, but for his shoulders alone to bear. Each man who dies under his command takes him 'one step farther from home.' When Hiller's troop finds private James Ryan - he is Matt Damon, acting the hell out of the Concerned Face chapter of the Acting for Male Models handbook.To climax the movie - another skin-searing battle sequence. Spielberg is now just having the time of his life: his crew have the formula down and we are once again struck speechless by the construction of the on screen blitzkrieg that makes all other skirmishes on film look like Monty Python's Batley Townswomens' Guild Battle of Pearl Harbor.Chilling - as Goldberg's Jew struggles with a German and is stabbed slowly, deliberately; regretful - as Davies's scaredy-cat Upham could've stopped the stabbing if he had just had the guts to run up a stairway instead of tearfully ascending in fear; twisted - as Pepper's holy sharpshooter prays while he snipes that his lord keep his hand steady and his eye keen, 'You are my tower, you are my shield' (which should be a morbid contradiction for Christians, that they will instead find reassuring - that 'god' is supposedly on their side); disturbing - when Ribisi's doc is mortally wounded and he stutters instructions on how to 'operate' on him, even as his liver is mutilated and the last of the morphine is stabbed into his leg as he expires; amusing - as Sizemore is shot and is madder at his gun jamming than at being shot; ultimately tragic - as Hiller's dying words to Ryan convey his confidence in the unproven worth of humankind, and a simultaneous indictment that Ryan could never hope to live up to: 'Earn this!... Earn it.' For closure, a general narrates a letter written by the People Who Send Sons Off To Die, to Ryan's mother on how the army is soooo generous for sending James Ryan home, misusing Lincoln's words about her other sons being sacrificed on the 'altar of freedom' and making our flesh crawl with platitudes, euphemisms and shallow commiserations.Just think, if Franklin Delano Roosevelt had kept his promise of keeping America out of foreign wars, instead of antagonizing Japan and then entering WWII, he could have saved not only private Ryan, but also the whole godforsaken American army, navy and air force.But that would entail America actually possessing a shred of decency and humanity.Shyeh! What if.",10,1,2,1 January 2011
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Boring Roaring.
","Unnecessary.That's the word that comes to mind during Steven Spielberg's THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK, the insipid followup to his mighty JURASSIC PARK (1993).In a fit of George Lucas storytelling (i.e. Making It Up As He Goes Along), we are reintroduced to Hammond (Richard Attenborough), the industrialist behind Jurassic Park (whose character actually dies in the Michael Crichton book, Jurassic Park, therefore is not featured in Crichton's literary sequel, The Lost World). And Hammond lets fly with exposition piled on rationalization piled on piles of dino dropping...Been a few years since the incidents at Jurassic Park and Hammond is now a sniveling naturalist trying to preserve his OTHER island of dinosaurs from industrialists who want to cash in on it (like, uh, himself from the previous movie). Cos this other island called Site B is where the dinosaurs were really bred, see, before being transported to Jurassic Park, see; and for the sake of getting people on the island for some Running and Screaming, Hammond has sent a research team comprised of mismatched actors (Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn and Richard Schiff). Jeff Goldblum as chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, raises the pertinent question to Hammond, as to how there are still dinosaurs running around if he bred them 'lysine deficient,' to which Hammond looks up his Hollywood One-Liner Plot Fix Manual and replies, 'Yes, but they're flourishing - that's one of a thousand questions I want answered by the team.' Let it be known: JURASSIC PARK II was not made for its story (which departs from the book in the worst ways), nor for art, nor for fans, nor for enjoyment, purely for dirty profit. At the risk of sounding like Eric Cartman, dare we rename Spielberg's sequel JEW-RASSIC PARK? So what are you waiting for, Steven - let's see some dinosaurs!Still committed to some bare vestige of storytelling (maybe because David Koepp wrote the screenplay - sorry, 'butchered' is more appropriate), Spielberg gives us even more crammed exposition. There's Schiff's 'high hide' (a useless piece of elevated cage that serves ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE); there's Vaughn's back-story about being in Greenpeace for the chicks; there's Malcolm's black daughter, Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), in whom we presume Malcolm's white genes decided to skip a generation (even in trying to do the right thing - by showing us an interracial child - the filmmakers cast a kid as dark as the offspring of a Namibian princess and Barack Obama Sr.).Even throwing down his best Jeff Goldblum impressions, Jeff Goldblum still can't stop this dino mound getting higher by the minute. By the time we actually reach the island, we're trying to tunnel our way out.This time, the wonder of the dinosaurs lasts even less time than in JURASSIC PARK, before they are objectified and then turned into villains. During the first fantastic stegosaur encounter (with a very fake baby stego), through everyone's gasps Malcolm actually remarks, 'Oh yeah. Oooh, ah, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming.' He actually uses my clinical definition of this fall-back position for when ideas run dry: Running and Screaming. I oughta trademark that. A million trashy 'horror' movies will owe me a big dime.The Corporate bad guys arrive on the heels of Malcolm's research team, led by Great White Hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite - eternally 50) and slimy lawyer Arliss Howard. Lots of running dinosaurs. Capturing, mistreating, head-butting, ropes and jeeps and struggling corythosaurs. Oh my.Pete Postlethwaite's energetic missing scene is indicative of this film's problem: the theatrical release does not show Roland coming to the aid of a waitress at a tourist bar, knocking out a guy half his age with one hand tied behind his back. He does this not for honor, but because he's bored. It is a great insight into his character. And the scene is cut. In favor of Running and Screaming. Doesn't that tell anyone with a whit of knowledge on story construction where this film derailed? After he bags the tyrannosaur, Roland disappears from the script.Storyline so contrived, most of it is from JURASSIC PARK. Especially that 'trailer-dangling-over-the-precipice' gag. Yawn. This overwrought sequence gives us yet another reason to dislike Mr. Spielberg, as innocuous Mr. Schiff tries valiantly to pull the dangling trailers up onto solid ground and is rewarded for his troubles by being eaten. Pulled apart by two tyrannosaurs! After all its cringe-worthy humor and ratcheting tension, the movie pays off this supposedly thrilling sequence by killing the only likable minor character. Now that was unnecessary.(The opening scene in this movie is actually the opening scene of the book, Jurassic Park, where a rich family dines on a deserted beach and the little girl stumbles on a compsognathus herd.) There is much science in Crichton's didactic book; in the movie, the most science that occurs is watching Julianne Moore try to act.THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK is centered around plopping a tyrannosaur in the middle of San Diego. Spielberg's own confession. Which explains the half-baked, hurried and insubstantial dinosaur scenes on the island. More plagiarism, as the tyrannosaur arrives in Los Angeles like Dracula - aboard a ship with all the crew dead. The beast is still locked in the hold, which begs begs begs the question on how it ate everyone and managed to lock itself back in the hold.After Spielberg sates his jones on stupid t-rex gags around Diego, it is captured by Goldblum and Moore and put back on the ship. Final scene is a stinker of the highest proportions, as a conga line of herbivores walks beside a conga line of carnivores as if neither can see the other. It is unbelievably incognizant.The only reason this movie scores at all is the 'realism' of its dinosaurs. They're the best CGI animal whores that money can buy.",5,4,10,28 July 2010
Insidious," Not Normally this Para.
","Uh-oh. I need to turn on the lights...INSIDIOUS is one of the few modern horror films that is truly scary. Not many movies can hold your nerves hostage like THE EXORCIST or THE OMEN, but INSIDIOUS comes close, with atmospheric direction, blood-chilling sequences and lots of screeching violins.A family with three kids moves into a rambling house in Middle America - the type with hardwood floors, high ceilings and a dark attic that practically screams, 'Hey, look at me! I'm haunted!' Patrick Wilson (WATCHMEN) is father Josh, Rose Byrne is mother Renai (sans her baby fat as Brad's plaything in TROY, 2004). Their little boy Dalton (Ty Simpkins) has an accident in the attic and goes into a coma that doctors can't explain. Months pass. When Renai tucks in Dalton's little brother, he whimpers to her one night about comatose Dalton in the next room, 'I don't like it when he walks around at night.' Blood chills. Hairs rise. Cities fall.Written by Leigh Whannell and directed by James Wan (the twisted Australian duo who brought us SAW), INSIDIOUS kicks us in the ribs with classic horror iconography: loud noises, doors opening by themselves, apparitions, whispers on a baby monitor... some beautiful scares - like the unclear vision of the Dickensian boy through the window dancing to 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips.' Only thing scarier is Tiny Tim.INSIDIOUS channels POLTERGEIST fiercely - and though we might call that movie a classic today, even POLTERGIEST did get a little kooky in its third act. Remember all the Hollywood commotion in the final scenes, skeletons popping up in the pool, the house disappearing in some kind of vortex, and the elf woman with the voice that sounded like she was suckling helium?... So too INSIDUOUS cannot live up to its razor-burning first half, although it does retain enough ectoplasm for a wild ride to a satisfying surprise conclusion.Like most horror films, INSIDIOUS does not survive its 'explanation' phase. As per Horror Protocol, a suitably wizened old woman psychic (or medium, or charlatan, or whatever they're called) provides the prosaic explanation behind Dalton's coma: as the POLTERGEIST Helium Elf called the other dimension 'The Light,' the INSIDIOUS psychic (Lin Shaye) calls it 'The Further' and explains that Dalton is actually astral traveling there, while demons are trying to use his inert body as a vessel to squeeze their bad selves into our dimension...Royt...Which brings up all those usual questions I have for psychics, mediums, charlatans, whatever: Why don't the demons just come through and be done with it, instead of poking around half-heartedly by leaving bloodied handprints on sheets and speaking through baby monitors? Are they trying to possess Dalton? Is he going to turn into a maniac axe-murderer inbred hillbilly? Why murder people if they only wind up in heaven? Isn't that undermining your whole demonic task of bringing them to hell? Why bother 'scaring' them at all? Wouldn't demons from another dimensional plane consider simple Earthbound scares below their dignity? And in the noisy climactic scenes, ghosts try to cross into this world by busting out of a closet - and a man obstructs their paranormal entrance into our dimension by holding the closet door closed! Really? That's all it takes? I thought ghosts could go THROUGH things... Can we get a Demonic Infiltration Rulebook up in this haunted hizzouse?And then - the perennial SÃ©ance. Why in the dark? Does the absence of light really affect inter-dimensional contact? Human eyes can only pick up a miniscule section of the electromagnetic spectrum - between 4000 to 7000 angstroms - that we call 'visible light,' so how could it possibly affect entities that can obviously communicate along a much wider bandwidth (and who are from a dimension where everything is supposedly so frickin' bright)? I'll tell you 'why in the dark?' Because all those unsophisticates who handed down ghost stories from yore figured it would be scarier. How I love scientific explanations...Writer Leigh Whannell plays one of two paranormal investigator dorks, whose funny appearance in the film is at a point where some levity is welcomed after heart-skipping scares - but his presence also presages the wizened woman and the unneeded 'explanations.' From the outset, the main drawback of INSIDIOUS is its PG-13 rating (we know they're allowed to say 'fuck' but once and are only allowed concepts that won't overwhelm your average Lindsay Lohan fan), so with that hobbling, we realize what a good job the filmmakers did to make those hairs rise on your mammalian body. Point the finger at Joseph Bishara's eerie, evocative music.Funniest (or most ignorant) by-product of movies like INSIDIOUS is that the slapstick mongoloids who call themselves 'ghost hunters' notice all the made-up 'paranormal' detection devices on screen and believe that they can actually construct this bogus equipment - at the very least, name some glorified toaster the same name as that apparatus in the movie and presto! Instant Ghost Detection Device! Which says more about the pants-wetter who is using it than the device itself.The first half of the movie gives you The Fear - that notion of the inexplicable; half-seen visions with no point other than an abiding alienness; the second half is for ghost hunters with weak bladders (that would be all of them, no?).If I, a nullifidian cucumber far above the superstitious beliefs of afterlife, angels and demons, needed to sleep with the lights on after this effective movie, I shudder to think how hellish this movie must be on those pants-wetters. Look behind you, ghost hunter. It's waiting for you in the dark.",8,4,6,24 November 2011
Bolt," O.D. on QT.
","If cuteness ever becomes a sin, this movie is going straight to hell.BOLT (voiced by John Travolta) is a little white puppy that was raised from birth as a superdog. Well, he's not really a superdog - but HE doesn't know that. For the sake of realistic reactions from Bolt, the producers of his weekly television show (where he plays a superdog) don't let him know it is all make-believe.One day, Bolt's 'person,' Penny (Miley Cyrus), is kidnapped by the villain of the show (Malcolm McDowell) in a cliffhanger episode, and Bolt believes he must save her. So he breaks out of his trailer - and is immediately accidentally mailed to New York, having to trek back across country to find Penny.Along the way, he meets a cat (Susie Essman) whom he takes hostage, and a crazed hamster who idolizes Bolt's superness, Rhino (Mark Walton), who craves the action-adventure so badly, his middle name should be 'Danger.' Bolt must also come to grips with the fact he is not super, and that he is replaceable on the show, and there's the tear-jerking clichÃ© just waiting to happen.For laughs, BOLT achieves its purpose - but I'm just laughing at the cuteness of everything. Except for the pigeons (yuk! those realistic feathers!).Excellent animation, lots of Hollywood insider gags (James Lipton as The Director, Greg Germann as The Agent, the pigeons pitching episode ideas) and much too much too much cuteness.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,1,6,16 August 2009
2012," And he'll have fun fun fun 'til his daddy takes the CG away...
","As disaster movies go, 2012 is definitely the big one. I mean, how do you outrun the world? An inordinately large neutrino burst from the sun causes the Earth to break, and creates much employment for special effects companies. Also, the planets in our solar system have aligned (which doesn't really mean anything, considering the gravitational force they would exert is microscopic) and narcissistic humans who still can't shake the fact that the universe does not revolve around them, seem to think it affects tectonic activity on little old Earth. Also - Mayan Prophecy. Now there's something REALLY scientific that proves all this is true! The Mayans predicted that in 2012, Digital Domain would have the computer graphic technology to wipe out the Himalayas and New York with tsunamis. This they do, as well as other cool stuff like raining down the John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier on top of the White House and the noble president, who is tending injured people on the White House lawn by asking them if they'd vote for a public option.In 2012, writer-director Roland Emmerich has balanced his admittedly masterful use of CGI with his usually prosaic handling of human stereotypes. All the stereotypes are still here - the Everyman (John Cusack), the young scientist with all the answers and the body to go with them (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the noble President (Danny Glover - being black is now less of a fantasy than the nobility he displays in staying behind, which is absolute fantasy), the wacky prophet (Woody Harrelson), the ambitious politician (Oliver Platt), the brainless automaton military - but they either feel more organic to the plot, or the trillion dollar promotional campaign which could have gone towards bailing out another crybaby corporation on Wall Street affected my Discernment Gland.John Cusack uses his knowledge that he is the Leading Man to narrowly escape Earth-splitting cracks and falling objects, while wife Amanda Peet does her job of looking hot and screaming a lot; while her New Boyfriend (Thomas McCarthy, who can't stop looking like Patrick Wilson from WATCHMEN) pilots all of them unselfishly away from danger, when he should be familiar with enough disaster movies to realize he has to fall down a crevasse or something soon because his salary is nowhere near the Leading Man's.Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Emmerich, Chiwetel Ejiofor actually does some exceptional acting up against Oliver Platt, causing them to almost disappear into another movie with more credibility and less screaming.Amidst Roland's advertisement for a suite of outboard tools, there are some genuine touching moments: Chiwetel's father onboard a cruise ship that ultimately goes Poseidon; Russian pilot Sasha's (Johann Urb) camaraderie with fellow pilot McCarthy - that's not to say there's anything original about these moments. Apart from the Leading Man's relationships, the strongest emotional bonds are the ones set up to specifically destroy and target our Weeping Gland.Final scenes show desperate humanity trying to board gargantuan 'arks' that billionaires have paid to have a berth on. Chiwetel curbs the inherent selfishness of the species by giving Oscar Speech Number 23-a, 'What is it that makes us human?' rolling smoothly into importuning, 'What will we tell our children?' and ending with the glorious 'We can't build a civilization if our first act is one of cruelty!' which amazes us at how much it makes our flesh crawl.Okay, so let's deconstruct.1) 'What is it that makes us human?' Apparently, money. The people clamoring to get onboard the arks, who are in danger of being left behind on the docks - ARE OTHER BILLIONAIRES who already paid for a berth, whom the arks were leaving behind because tsunamis were almost upon them. Opening the giant doors to let them in was not an act of kindness towards homeless bums and underprivileged day workers - it was a contractual obligation to other billionaires! 2) 'What will we tell our children?' How about, 'I paid a billion Euros to save your necks and you should be building a shrine to thank me!'? Now go clean out the poo in the gorilla cage.3 ) 'We can't build a civilization if our first act is one of cruelty!' Sounds kinda morally correct - but is demonstrably wrong. Firstly, you already HAVE a civilization built on cruelty. The passengers onboard the arks were chosen because their pockets were one billion Euros deep. What exactly happened to all the middle class personnel who built the ships and maintained the infrastructure while you collected your billion-Euro payments? Oh, that's right, after they complete their menial jobs, they're dead to you. At least, they will be when that tsunami hits 'em in their poverty-stricken asses. Secondly, Mr. Black White House Official, have you forgotten that America's 'civilization' was built on the skulls of Native Americans and African slaves? It's a good thing no one is paying attention to anything except the special effects. Or we'd all be dead.",7,2,4,29 August 2010
The Number 23," The Number of the Least.
","It just don't add up! Numerology - utter fantasy coupled with utter coincidence. Try telling that to the EVP Nosferatu fake-moon-landing 9/11-conspiracy empath-candle what's-your-sign bible-thumpers.When dogcatcher Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) reads a mysterious book called The Number 23, he begins to realize how much the number 23 figures in his life, from his birth date, first date, marriage date, etc. popping up everywhere he looks. Of course, when you arrive at 23 through a complex set of equations pulled from your nether regions, it's easy to make it add up to something portentous.For example, the devil's number is 23. (Rationale: 666 is 3 sixes. 3x6=18. 18+5=23. 5 is 2+3 after all, 23, right?; that's why we add it to 18...) Yet this psychological thriller is an entertaining diversion, moving at a pace that prevents us from seeing the stupidity in 2+3=23 (yes, this is the 'intelligence' level of numerologists).Another extraordinary performance from Carrey, playing more than one character again (his real-life persona who is slowly unraveling, and his delirium fantasy called Fingerling, in total control of his Clive Owen longcoat). Virginia Madsen plays Carrey's wife and scary Danny Huston plays a psychologist friend. Both of them turn up as analogues in Walter Sparrow's deliriums.Joel Schumncher directs (also directed Carrey in BATMAN FOREVER) and Fernley Phillips screenplays with the Rod Serling handbook planted firmly in lap.This movie made me realize all the uncanny coincidences in MY life and the 23-conspiracy that surrounds us: did you know that every month has at least 23 days in it?; or that the English alphabet has more than 23 letters?; and I'm OVER 23.... oh my goat-faced deity! That proves it! Most of the musicians I know are over 23 as well! So is Jim Carrey! So is Virginia Madsen! It all adds up!",6,0,2,11 December 2008
Velvet Goldmine," Moonage Daydreams of Stardust
","'...As the slap on my ass by a lipstick-kissed elbow gloveÂ' - Shudder To Think, *The Ballad of Maxwell Demon* A true songwriter would give his left testicle to smack down lyrics as creamy. And *Velvet Goldmine* - a diabolical, Bowie-esquire, Wilde-ian fantasm Â veritably pulsates with this species of lascivious mind-painting.Not for the musically squeamish, the more familiar you are with David Bowie and the glam slam he was largely a part of and responsible for, the more tongue you will afford *Velvet Goldmine*. Being alive and licking during the 1970s is the best symptom for maximum sensory affinity; failing that, if your bag is Iggy Pop, T-Rex, Brian Eno, Lou Reed (matter of fact, any glam-stroked band, from The Sweet, to Slade, Kiss, or Alice Cooper) *Goldmine* will slide into your Velvet just fine.Written by James Lyons and Todd Haynes and directed like a wet dream gone horribly right by Haynes, starring the cyanide-intense Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (as Bowie analog, Brian Slade) and dangerously sensual Ewan McGregor (as Iggy analog, Curt Wild), *Goldmine* is a celebration of a period that was surface Pop over layered Tart, expressed through raucous colors and pungent pan-sexuality in the form of the musical idiom we now call glam rock; a story of teen alienation and decibel-ed angst, of clutching belief in a lifestyle that seemed like a destination but ended up merely part of a longer journey. The underlying message in *Goldmine* was espoused by Bowie himself in *Changes*: 'Ooh, look out, you rock n' rollers! Pretty soon now you're gonna get older!' *Goldmine*'s success is in its evocation of the period - glam-struck London of the early 1970s Â and its poignancy depicting the alienation of an insecure rock fan as he tries to be as Out There as the In Crowd. Around these backdrops, the larger story of the superstar elevated to messiah is woven.Spearheading the androgynous attack on social morÃ©s is enigmatic Brian Slade aka Maxwell Demon, who fakes an on-stage assassination at the height of his popularity. We follow reporter, Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), in a *Citizen Kane*-like hunt for Slade's whereabouts a decade after his decline.The young Arthur (also played by Bale) is the outcast teen who cannot assimilate into the glamster crowd he so desperately feels kinship with; finding no respite at his parents' home either, he turns to the glitter of glam for comfort. At one point, young Arthur, while quietly watching a Slade TV interview with his parents, fantasizes that he jumps up, points to Slade and shouts at his parents, 'That's me, that! That's me!' The reality is: no matter how loud he were to shout, his parents will never hear him. From his room postered with rock idols from ceiling to floor; to the way he turntables *The Ballad of Maxwell Demon* album and excitedly commences reading the record jacket, down to his parents being utterly unable to communicate with him, *I* felt like jumping up and yelling at the *Goldmine* screen, 'That's me, that!' Eddie Izzard, as audacious manager, Jerry Devine, makes Brian Slade a household name and allies him with American superstar, Curt Wild, who becomes Slade's lover, to the chagrin of Slade's wife, Mandy (Toni Collette).In more subtle and striking ways than can be recounted here, *Goldmine* is a homage to *Citizen Kane*, Oscar Wilde and David Bowie (especially Bowie, whose influence extends into the very fibers of the glam mythos itself, the character of Brian Slade alluding to Bowie by his very existence, encapsulating *Ziggy Stardust*, *The Man Who Sold the World*, *Diamond Dogs*, *Jean Genie*, and even a sly dig at Bowie's *Let's Dance* era Â with the name of the film itself being the title of a Bowie B-side). The film exists in an insular universe, so none of those influences is mentioned explicitly Â which makes the innuendos more interesting to identify and will make the discoveries of their references all the more fascinating to young retro-glamsters.Even Slade's Maxwell Demon persona is a reference to physicist James Clerk Maxwell's thought-experiment creature (called Maxwell's Demon) which examined scenarios regarding the Second Law of Thermodynamics.*Goldmine* sears with the genius of its allusions, its opening sequences a joyous primal scream to thwart the demons of conventionality. But Â like the inevitable Second Law Â its energy is unsustainable. Worse Â it makes a bad excuse for its entropy, using formulaic dramatic arcs of washed-up, burnt-out fates, which seems disrespectful to the real-life icons of these filmic counterparts, who enjoy a longevity and success in excess to this day.Brian Slade is undone by his excesses, and made to endure a Jilted Wife scene straight out of The Actor's Studio. She shrikes at him, 'You know what your problem is? You get what you want and do what you will.' Not really a problem, *per se*. Which proves conclusively that whenever someone deigns to tell you your problems, the most sensible option is to ignore them.These pitfalls of rock super-stardom were to pander to 'normal' people who believe erroneously that success is a bitch. A prime example of excess engendering success and longevity and industry clout is the man without whom this movie could never have been made Â David Bowie.In order to insert these negative messages, the film becomes overlong. (Damn you, MPAA!) Yet *Velvet Goldmine* somehow redeems its negativity by having Arthur discover Slade's secret - that he did not relinquish his success at all, just his space-messiah persona, swapping his serpentine sensuality for a more sterile, adult-oriented Business Model. In its final scenes, we find the film *has* been paying attention to its real life analogs and tips its hat one last time to David Bowie, the Grand Master of Reinvention.",8,1,2,23 September 2006
Ghost Rider," Queasy Rider
","If there's another word for idiocy, I think that word is GHOST RIDER.Sloppy editing, directionless direction and idiotic writing make this the number one feel-retarded movie of the year. And Nicolas Cage in eternal mourning-faced mode as the Ghost Rider doesn't help any. He is stunt biker, Johnny Blaze, employed by the devil (Peter Fonda, embarrassing himself) to stop the devil's son dominating the world. Oh yeh, and when he turns into Ghost Rider, his head turns into a flaming skull. For no reason other than it looks kinda cool.Sam Elliott lends his balls-grit voice to the narration and appears as a supernatural gravedigger, but even that compounds the stupidity. His first lines narrate how every generation spawns a Ghost Rider, whose job is to collect souls sold to Satan. Okay, nice premise Â now start confusing meÂ Seems the Wild West Ghost Rider (from the 1800s, I'm guessing) 'outran the devil himself' because he didn't want to collect 1000 souls on one particularly meaty contract.Where to start with the stupid questions, knowing there'll be stupid answers at the end of all of them? Is it within the Ghost Rider's capacity to discern how many souls the devil should be bagging? He's just an apprehender, a bounty hunter; it's like bequeathing that redneck moron Dog the Bounty Hunter or one of those Nazi cops from COPS jurisprudence and the ability to execute sentences on nothing but their own cognizance, when we all know they are merely apprehenders with zero powers or intelligence beyond clicking on cuffs.So what about the Rules for Supernatural Beings? How fast can the devil run? And since the Ghost Rider is a supernatural being himself, how fast was HE actually running to outrun the devil? And was he galloping across desert plains, or in some other dimension? If in some other dimension, were they 'running' physically - with feet touching the ground for traction, or in some invisible medium? Any answers from geekboys forthcoming? Every single minute of GHOST RIDER raises more idiotic questions about supernatural rules. For example, the GHOST RIDER is a supernatural being, so when evil supernatural beings fight him (beings fashioned from earth, air, fire and water), why do they bother punching each other? They're not operating on the same rules we are in the physical plane Â for cryin' out loud, when a truck runs into the Ghost Rider he is unharmed, so why does the being made of water even *think* that he could debilitate him by PUNCHING? Or hanging him by the neck with a chain? Later, a supernatural being made of wind laughs when Ghost Rider tries to punch him, then he eats crow when the Rider whirls his whip around and somehow creates a vortex of fire that sucks the wind being into nothingness. RiiiiightÂ..At one point, like some kind of superhero, Ghost Rider saves a girl from a pursesnatcher and then condemns the pursesnatcher to hell as if he had lied Amerika into a false Iraq war, causing the deaths of 100,000 people and consigning Amerika to a trillion-dollar debt which four generations would have to shoulder. It's the SUPERMAN conundrum: while he saves a cat in a tree, a million African children die for want of diverting a river to save their village. Get your priorities right, Bonehead! Marvel really screwed the pooch with this D-Lister; Stan Lee didn't even bother making a cameo. The origin tale works gangbusters as a comicbook, but in this age of semi-realism in Marvel films (SPIDERMAN, X-MEN, PUNISHER), GHOST RIDER gasps for credibility with its insanely convoluted mythical storyline and rule-less landscape.Frumpy Eva Mendez is Johnny Blaze's long-suffering romantic interest, Wes Bentley gives a pointless performance as the devil's son, and Donal Logue tries overacting to save the movie. Didn't work, but at least he's got some cheese for his demo reel.",1,8,14,1 August 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-eunt in X-asperation.
","Action without heart. Spectacle without logic. Brawn without brains.Director Brett Ratner balances on Bryan Singer's shoulders, attempting to hold up the mutant world Singer so reverently rendered in *X-Men* (2000) and *X-Men United* (2003). But he falls off - and helms *X-Men: The Last Stand*, the third in the x-franchise, with as much reverence and talent as Bryan Singer's shoe.Ratner and screenwriters Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn feign respect, drawing in the fan-boys (with teaser ads featuring edgy photography and magnificent visuals, like Angel's breathtaking wingspan; dangling the reunion carrot of the five original Uncanny X-Men members - for the non-mutant readers, these are Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman, Angel and Beast; giving us tastes of legendary idioms, when Bobby Drake eventually goes fully Iceman for a few seconds, or Beast exclaims, 'Oh my stars and garters!') Â but then tumble off the grid completely, as they kill off half the main characters, never show the original five on screen together, twist legacy into dramatic clichÃ© and fulfill the worst fears of intelligent moviegoers. *Last Stand* is not a case of 'more of the same,' but TOO MUCH of the same; a runaway George Lucas effect.Forgetting that 'He who sips from many cups, drinks of none,' Ratner loads this 104-minute movie with so much content that it implodes under its own weight.The government has isolated an antigen from scary Cameron Bright (playing Leech, a mutant who negates the powers of other mutants) and markets it as a 'mutant cure,' drawing mixed reactions from mutants. Magneto (Ian McKellen) sees it as usurpation of mutants' very souls, whilst some, like Rogue (Anna Paquin), who cannot touch anyone without draining their life-force (and whose pink bits have been quivering for man flesh since she met Wolverine back in *X-Men*) see it as an opportunity for some Jagger-like satisfaction.While Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) insults everyone back at the mutant mansion of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Cyclops (James Marsden) wastes his 3 minutes screen time weeping like a bitch over dead Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). The blue-furred, Presidential Mutant Diplomat, Beast (Kelsey Grammar, perfectly cast), attempts to find the right spin for the antigen campaign, whilst boy-band member, Warren Worthington III (aka Angel, played by Michael Murphy, doing Jay Mohr), uses up his four seconds of wingspan screen time to make good on the startling trailer and fly out on the cure.Before anyone can say 'mutant overload,' Jean (with her long, luscious, burgundy wig slightly crooked), has returned from the dead as Dark Phoenix, had Cyclops for lunch and is hot for some Wolverine whippin'.Magneto scorns Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) after she sacrifices her mutancy for him, and proves to be quite the playa; no sooner dumping the blue babe than hooking up with a Dark Phoenix.If all this seems confusing, rest assured, it is. *Last Stand* makes little attempt at explaining relationships, superpowers or logic (except for a flashback which finds the two Shakespearean veterans, McKellen and Stewart, amusingly wrinkle-free, meeting Jean as a child, exploring the complexities of their love-hate association) and is unapologetically for fan-boys who have continually sacrificed the love of a good woman for plastic-bagging their comic books in chronological order; ironic, considering the film-makers themselves don't display much love or knowledge of these characters.And Cyclops! Oh, Cyclops! I have never condoned the dismissive treatment of the Uncanny X-Men's prime member. In the comics universe, everyone respected his authoritah - but the first two Singer movies demoted this master tactician, group leader and masculine love-interest for Jean Grey into a metrosexual strip-o-gram. We tolerated his film deficiencies because the films themselves lauded the X-Men legacy. With *Last Stand,* Cyclops' pussified ousting is unconscionable.Screen becomes clogged with super-beings who only figure how to utilize their powers as the plot denotes, otherwise stand around doing nothing.Only Magneto and Wolverine ever use their powers intelligently, Wolverine usually with his shirt off; alas, his action scenes are all too brief (and how does his singlet heal its holes anyway?). Magneto's power is truly awe-inspiring and the vaunted Golden Gate Bridge sequence is remarkable.The themes of this movie Â offering homogeneity to those who feel alienated and forcing homogeneity on those who wish individuality Â are lost amongst the movie's many plot-holes and poorly-directed action. For example, why was the government transporting Juggernaut, Multiple Man and Mystique without first shooting them with the antigen? Well, so that Magneto could rescue them, of course.And why does Wolverine try to stop Phoenix being shot with antigen? This would have eradicated her nihilistic death-persona and left behind a supermodel. Instead, whilst the world is being sucked into her destructive vortex, he opts to kill the Dark Phoenix (with his shirt off). Seems he'd rather have a dead Phoenix than a live Jean Grey.Economically, the *X-Men* franchise has fallen victim to its own plot line: in order to recoup its astronomical budgets, it needs to homogenize its product; in doing so, it kills off impact and integrity, thereby risking *lesser* income through inferior product. This will be the last collective X-Men production; the future of the X-Men lies in their spin-offs. Already, *Wolverine* has stalked into pre-production.Yet the marketers force-feed us a cliffhanger, just in case: while Storm assumes matronly duties at the mutant school, while Beast presses White House flesh; while Wolverine insults someone and Angel flies high on CGI; while Rogue (cured of her deadly touch) and Iceman make the beast with two backs in the nearest broom closet, two sidelined Shakespearean veterans slyly find their mettle once moreÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",6,1,2,26 June 2006
Hellboy," Hell-Freed, but Earth-Bound
","Hellacious Spoilers.They say he's from Hell Â now is that the Christian version or the ancient Jewish version? Or the Greek version, or Nordic, or Moslem? Why, there are as many versions of Hell as demons FROM there. But enough about George Bush Junior.This movie is a classic example of hype over-riding content. I am as big a fan of comics/graphic novels as the next geek-cheese, but I am a bigger fan of well-made movies, and 'Hellboy', for all its glitz and glam-blammo, is not a well-made movie. 'Beige' is a suitable adjective, for though it LOOKS fine (the costuming, set dressing, cinematography are without fault), the stunted attempts at humor, romance and plot construction leave the viewer slightly crestfallen.For example, it was not made clear at all that THE Rasputin was the monk attempting to open the gates of hell with special effects. This doesn't make for an effective foreshadowing device if this same character turns up later and we are unclear as to who he is.Then there are the large gaps in continuity, as when Hellboy and his goth chick are cornered by Too-Much-CGI and she uses her power of fire-starting to defeat the CGI Â suddenly we are in another sewer-like lab with Hellboy strapped down and the fate of the universe in the balance Â wha-? Apparently, Hellboy's brick fist plays an important role in unlocking some gateway to Huge Savings or something and Rasputin wants to be the first in that door.You lost me.There were many scenes which brick-walled in this manner and I was sure that somewhere along the way, all would be explained to my Pre-MTV consciousness. But my hopes that that would happen were dashed when about five minutes before film's-end, a gargantuan entity which had nothing to do with previous creatures, villains, plot or character development Â but everything to do with throwing superfluous special effects at the viewer in a last-ditch attempt to have them exit the film with a hellishly-unnecessary image burned into their neo-cortexes Â grabs Hellboy and quickly gets killed by his big gun. That event proved that this movie was made for a demographic still conversant with transforming robots into trucks. And I knew I would get no explanationsÂ The characters evoked no sympathy from me. As far as I'm concerned, Anthony Daniels should sue the fish-guy character. And I find it hard to believe that Selma Blair was the best they could come up with for the clinically-depressed goth chick Â why, the casting call should have turned up thousands of this species in Orange County alone. The young detective was a formless puddle. John Hurt tried, I'll give him that. And Rasputin chewed some scenery.Granted, Ron Perlman was the only person on earth who could have pulled off the lone, laconic, lantern-jawed Hellboy, and his tale IS one of Grande Concept. It was just not executed terribly well.There are intimations of deeper messages, such as teen alienation and social outcasting, but they are not dwelled upon, and one of these 'teen-love' scenes between Hellboy and his goth chick is one of those non sequitur brick walls.There were many reasons the movie lacked a sense of grand scale, one of them being Hellboy's major battles against creatures which were simply unimportant cogs in some other being's master plan. There were many replications of one single creature, which resembled a triceratops with a medusa's head, Hellboy having to chase down and fight a LOT of them. Consequently, he seemed to be making no headway whatsoever and it didn't give the audience a sense that he was moving up a progressive ladder of evil, soon to face the Inglorious Mastermind behind the Grand Plot. It gave us a sense that we should have seen the matinÃ©e for three bucks less.Also, I think the Long Leather Coat thing has run its course as Hard Guy Haute Couture, fellasÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",5,9,13,8 August 2005
Good Will Hunting," Beautiful mind versus beautiful beard.
","All hail the *intelligent* screenplay! GOOD WILL HUNTING pairs 'Bahston' boys Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in their first, and arguably most powerful, bromance to date (excepting maybe their turns as marauding angels in Kevin Smith's DOGMA); written by Damon and Affleck, who deserve every inch of their little gold man (Best Screenplay 1998), a driving story of a disturbed young mathematical genius trying to find his niche in a world that unwittingly ostracizes him for his beautiful mind.Matt Damon is Will Hunting, a brawling teen by day (with his informal gang Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser) and a janitor at a college by night; he is also an autodidactic savant with photographic retention skills and math aptitude to embarrass a rocket scientist. He is 'discovered' by physicist Professor Lambeau (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) who tries to nudge him on a respectable path by bailing him out of jail on the provision that Hunting will help the Professor solve perplexing mathematics problems and also see a therapist.The math problems are a breeze for Hunting. The therapists are a stickier matter, as they all run screaming from his presence as he pinpoints their insecurities before they can pinpoint his--until he meets Sean Maguire (Robin Williams, unshaven like a bearcub), who brings all his DEAD POET'S philosophic skills to bear on the fast-talking, uncooperative scrapper.Minnie Driver is Skylar, the Harvard student who falls for Hunting, but whom he ends up pushing away neurotically, in an argument-out-of-nowhere scene that is written so well, it doesn't seem like it was written at all, but escalating right before our eyes.When Hunting's neurosis is unlocked by Maguire at the end, the revelation is so simple that we marvel at how easy it is to actually connect with someone, and yet how hard it is to find that connection.The script benefits from being written by two 'unknowns' who load it with verve and vitality, realism and dynamism, while still displaying a sound mechanical knowledge of 'Hollywood' screenplay construction. Director and pal Kevin Smith aided Affleck and Damon in securing a deal where they had a large amount of control over their story, and director Gus Van Sant would let it play out unobtrusively and intelligently.The Professor and Maguire are at odds on how to handle Hunting--push him into society or let him find it at his own pace; what could have become a clichÃ©d pissing contest in a passÃ© Hollywood writer's hands remains a revelatory argument of ethics between two men who are battling their own regrets and just want the best for their surrogate son. If we thought we'd seen the best of Robin Williams in DEAD POET'S SOCIETY or AWAKENINGS (as opposed to his worst in NINE MONTHS or FATHER'S DAY), he embraces this sober psychiatrist's role like the bearcub embracing his face; and it took a couple of novices to put words in his mouth that would melt like butter and ring like the bells of Notre Dame. (He would deservedly walk away with a little gold man of his own for Best Supporting Actor.) The best aspect of the script is that it truly captures the contempt and separation that a virtuoso feels for people who cannot grasp the art or discipline that he finds so awkwardly simple. Hunting describes his aptitude for equations with an insightful analogy: 'Beethoven looked at a piano and it just made sense to him; he could just play. I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys, three pedals and a box of wood--but Beethoven, Mozart, they saw it, they could 'just play.' I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably couldn't hit the ball out of Fenway, and I can't play the piano. But when it came to stuff like that, I could always 'just play'.' Hunting is offered jobs dealing with superstring theory, advanced algorithms, heavy duty CIA stuff, which he isn't interested in, at one point raging into a tirade that connects all the political corruption in the world to the personal level, '...America only over there to install a government who would sell them oil at a good price...' Of course, the 'troubled character' has to find his redemption and it is done subtly, with every payoff hitting elegantly: Hunting's best friend Chuckie (Affleck) laments Hunting is still hauling bricks with him, and hopes for the day he can arrive to pick up Hunting for work and Hunting is not there, '...and you're just gone, no goodbyes, no nothing'; Maguire tells Hunting of how he met his wife by giving up a classic baseball game, 'I told my friends, 'I'm going to see about a girl'.' When these moments hit, the performances sell them; they are not forced, and create magnificent screen moments for Williams, Affleck and Damon.We wish Affleck and Damon could once again write something half as good as this masterpiece of cerebral mayhem. Though they've parlayed their grand win into continued success through the years, nothing they've done individually or together yet matches the raw (dare we call it 'indie') flavor-blast of GOOD WILL HUNTING. Like Costner, Welles and Lucas, they seem to have peaked at the head of their careers. It's ironic that these two young guys (Affleck and Damon), now renowned for their sex symbol status, shot themselves into the A-List by writing and starring in a dialog-driven mindfest! --Poffy The Cucumber",9,1,3,10 January 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," When Wizards Collide.
","Gandalf is SUCH a badass! Wizard against Balrog in a film opening so power-hammering it is astonishing that writer-director Peter Jackson didn't score a cross-promotion roller-coaster ride at Universal Studios called The Falling Balrog.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS opens at the middle of the last film, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001), as our friends (hobbits, men, elf, dwarf and lots of poo) flee through subterranean caverns, pursued by a towering flaming demon that only Gandalf (Ian McKellen) has the 'nads to face down. When he thunders at the advancing Balrog, 'YOU - SHALL â NOT â PASS!' and thwacks his staff upon the stone floor (in a sound which any comics fan should know is written as 'KRA-KHOOM!') it is every superhero personified and every man-fantasy of impressing chicks combined.Then they both fall.There is that 'falling' metaphor passim in Tolkien's writing. (Only to rise again - the Superman trope, which is Nietzsche's Ubermensch, formerly Christ's resurrection, which in turn was plagiarized from every life-death-rebirth deity that came before, from Asia to Akkadia.) Later, Aragorn is swept off a cliff by a wolf, and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reports to Eowyn, in a poignant moment that is moving as much for Rhys-Davies's throat-catching performance as for his words, 'He fell.' When Gandalf is resurrected as Gandalf The White and thwarts the surprise attack of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (what a badass!), Aragorn, dismayed, says to him, 'But you fell...' Even the ultimate fall of Gollum into the lava in THE RETURN OF THE KING, though it means the death of that poor conflicted special effect and the destruction of the One Ring, signifies a 'rebirth' of Middle-earth.TWO TOWERS is where 'that gangrel creature' Gollum (motion-captured performance by Andy Serkis) comes into his own, in a mind-blowing, pioneering special effects coup for WETA Digital, Peter Jackson's efx company. Like an evil Gandhi on crack, Gollum allies with the two star hobbits, Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) on their quest to Mordor; they go to destroy The One Ring, Gollum goes for any opportunity to reclaim the Ring, his 'precious.' Thus opening a new era in effects creatures interacting with humans on screen. The sight lines between Gollum and the hobbits never falter, and when they engage in physical contact, their interaction is so 'real' we never doubt it, watching the movie completely entranced by its story rather than marveling at Gollum's 'reality' or how his scanty panty never falls off.In THE TWO TOWERS, all our friends from the previous film wend their separate adventures in a dynamic, kinetic story full of middles. Being that TOWERS is - ahem - Middle-earth's middle film (the red-headed child of Peter Jackson's nonpareil RINGS trilogy), it very sensibly has a middle, more middle, lots of other middle, a legendary medieval battle that will stamp itself into filmic history, and more middle.Frodo and Sam find Mordor with Gollum's help, decide to backtrack and find it again from the other side; the fruity B-hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) stop being carried around by orcs and get carried around by a tree; the Nazgul have graduated to riding excellent bat-winged dragons with VOOMP-VOOMP! wing-beats; sexy Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), his blonde elfin babe, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and their husky child Gimli, run around the countryside, presumably in search of a good hot shower; while the mighty Gandalf slays a Balrog, drives the spirit of Saruman (Christopher Lee as Edgar Winter) out of Theoden King, and leads a cavalry charge on the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep - what a badass! So many characters, so many strands of plot, yet Jackson holds it all together with an iron grip that never flags - from its broad battle strokes to its poignant personal relationships. Jackson focuses maybe a little too much on Aragorn pining over his elf-boo Arwen (Liv Tyler, with pointy ears that just scream 'Do me Elf-Style!'); add Arwen pining over Aragorn in slomo and whole chariots of tiresome love butter clog this film's arteries. (And it's hard to sympathize with Aragorn missing his pointy-eared woman, when Eowyn (svelte Miranda Otto, a shield maiden of Rohan) is bursting all over him like a romantic raincloud.) Left for dead, when Aragorn arrives solo at Helm's Deep, a grand, sweeping 360-degree pan frames him, in a scene befitting a resurrection, and necessitating the invention of big screen plasma TVs.There is only one way to describe The Battle of Helm's Deep, which somehow does not lose us in its madness, conveying clearly the pitch and yaw of victories and defeats, focusing on every character involved yet encompassing the grand scope of the madding war tableau... actually, there is NO way to describe it. Just watch it. I don't know how he did it, but Jackson keeps us hanging in suspense and excitement during every minute of what most other filmmakers usually turn into generic rumbling. A truly incredible feat of direction, editing, choreography and creativity.I wonder what a Tolkien scholar would think of THE LORD OF THE RINGS?Jackson rewrites certain plot points for drama, but cannot escape broad strokes: so 10,000 orcs are sent to decimate 300 people? If Saruman just ignored this veritable 'village' he could still rule Middle-earth pretty much without any resistance.At the end, while a montage of battles cascades before our wondrous orbs, Samwise Gamgee gives one of those speeches that makes your flesh crawl, whereupon the hobbits share a moment so romantic we feel we shouldn't be watching them.And just like the movie, I'm going to end in the middle--",8,0,2,21 July 2010
The Incredibles," Puts the 'in' credible.
","In every review of *The Incredibles*, it has become a refrain: 'This movie could have worked as well in real life.' Big Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is a cone-shaped mountain of a guy, an ex-superhero doing time as a layperson in a world gone small Â from his office cubicle to his aspirations. Married to superheroine, Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter), like every husband, he sneaks out at night occasionally to hang with the boys Â in Bob's case, to fight crime as Mr. Incredible with his former teammate, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).Bob's two kids have inherited superpowers as well: son, Dash, super speed and daughter, Violet, telepathy and invisibility (think Phoenix from the X-Men). (A discussion on how the genetic combination of super-strength and elasticity in the parents would yield super-speed and invisibility in the offspring would get us nowhere.) This 3D-animation marvel is separated from its peers by its thematic thunder - sure, it gives us the usual 'familial values,' but digs deeper by making the characters smart enough to ponder their roles as super beings in a mediocre world. The parents know that provincialism denotes they must keep their powers/identities hidden and their children sheltered, but the kids don't understand why, raising Socratic questions about herd mentality and the conundrum of being 'created equal' yet more gifted. Mom tells Dash, 'Everyone's special' (which is its own special form of condescension) and Dash, instead of taking it like a Disney knockout punch Â as most kids in these 'family' movies are inculcated to accept Â retorts (quite logically), 'Which is another way of saying that nobody is.' And when the action comes, it delivers in ways that even some live-action superhero movies do not. And by this I mean, the whole group uses their powers efficiently and intelligently, working together to combat their threats, rather than getting taken down by some inane plot point which they could have easily escaped simply by being themselves.And of course, there is the mandatory Group Hero Pose, perfected so gaily by N'Sync during their two-month heyday. (Apologies to my more sensitive readers for using the 'N-word.') Jason Lee voices the villain, Syndrome, whom the family team must combat to Save The Day.Written and directed by Brad Bird (who does triple duty as Edna Mode, a fashion designer for the hero-conscious), the humor is wit, rather than slapstick, the heroism is moral rather than muscle-bound and the whole outlook is adult rather than kiddie - *The Incredibles* is as real a movie as a cartoon gets.",8,5,7,24 June 2007
I Am Legend," Will Smith Saves The World - Again...
","Everyone on Earth is dead - but they left the CGI running.Will Smith is the 'last man on Earth,' Robert Neville, tooling through abandoned, overgrown New York City streets, hunting antelope in a red sports car.It is the near future and a plague/virus has taken down humanity - not again! - and Neville is the Last Military Virulogist on Earth trying to find a cure for the remaining mutated humans who inhabit the scarred underbelly of the city, called Dark-Seekers (or Hemocytes). New York was 'his sector' and his moral obligation to 'fix things' is obsessive. Wife and child lost to an accident during evac of the city, now he blindly goes about his daily toil of hunting food, experimenting on rats, broadcasting his location to a world who may not be listening, 'hiring' DVDs from the local store, and going slowly insane from the isolation.While his cute German Shepherd, Samantha, frolics in the blighted cityscape, he smacks golf balls off aircraft carriers in the bay. It would be a good life, were it not for being no life at all.Derelict future New York is all passively incredible CGI - a city dead of human intrusion, yet breathing with the life of nature; an exceptionally stunning cyclorama, not a simple rear-projection or matte, but a three-dimensional landscape, brimming with all the vibrancy that suffuses any real life tableau. It is some of the best CGI work you will ever witness; the effects companies who worked on this movie outdid themselves. (Among others, Sony Pictures Imageworks, CIS Hollywood, Lidar Services, New Deal Studios. The Visual Effects credits of this movie run longer than most movies' full credits.) Yes, the best CGI you will ever see... until the lion pounces. The passive tableaux look sensational, but animate objects are a little harder to create from dust or a twelfth rib or even computer pixels. After the film-makers raised dead New York from the primordial pixel stew, they got cocky and imagined that LIFE would look just as convincing.D'oh! Though surrounded by mostly green screen, Will Smith still pulls his A-game, and a scene where he sobs disconsolately to a storeroom mannequin almost brings tears to US, not just due to his human deprivation, but also due to his unmitigated talent. And it doesn't hurt the ladies' visual experience that his daily exercise routine shows him ripped like the whip that scourged Jesus.When Neville encounters the Dark-Seekers, we descend further into CGI audacity - these mutated humans (note: NOT zombies) are fully computer-generated, therefore kind goony cartoony. As antagonists for Neville, they would have been more compelling had they been actual humans enhanced by CGI. Dash Mihok is the Alpha Male Dark-Seeker - or at least, playing the computer blip that does the most roaring at Will Smith.I AM LEGEND is the third incarnation of Richard Matheson's 1954 sf novel of the same name. First iteration was THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (1964), starring cheesemeister Vincent Price; next iteration, THE OMEGA MAN (1971), starring Grand Poobah Cheesemeister, Charlton Heston. This 2007 version is directed by Francis Lawrence (CONSTANTINE, 2005) and re-scripted by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich.In the third act, atheist Neville meets Jesus freak Anna (Alice Braga) and her son, refugees immune to the virus and on their way to an imagined sanctuary. Even though she saves his life after he tips into insane (due to the sad death of Samantha), he doesn't know what's worse - being victim to the Dark-Seekers or the Jesus freak.Cultural touchstones appear throughout the film - the SUPERMAN AND BATMAN movie on posters, dialogue from SHREK, Bob Marley's Legend album - with the final scenes setting up nicely how Robert Neville saves humankind, himself becoming a Legend for future generations to pray to meaninglessly as a savior...D'oh!",6,0,0,21 September 2008
School of Rock," Tenacious D's Boy-Thunder Rides Hellacious and Raises The Goblet Of Rock
","Rock Spoilers.A beautiful rarity when an actor is bequeathed a role that envelops him (in the words of Ace Ventura) 'like a glove'. This movie IS Jack Black. And Jack Black IS this movie. Had he not piloted this vehicle like a deranged Timothy Leary by way of Keith Moon, it would have coagulated into limp-wristed Disney clichÃ©s and bilious sermonizing.As it is, it still requires a concentrated dose of 'suspension of disbelief' sturdy enough to knock over an elephant, as this story's premise is quite foundation-less and upon successive viewings, reads as ever more idiotic - but the surfeit of unrealistic contrivance doesn't intrude as much as it should, for Black eats alive every frame he is in, erupting so much hilarious energy into even his simplest chatting scenes, that he somehow salves any gripes we may have with script inadequacies.There hasn't been anyone this shameless since Bill Clinton.We meet Black's rock-fanatic character, Dewey Finn, fired by his garage band, jobless, squatting in the loft of his best friend, Ned Schneebly (played by Mike White, the film's writer), who is Every Man's Worst Vagina-Whipped Casualty. Dewey accepts a substitute-teacher post under Schneebly's identity, rationalizing the duplicity as beneficial since he owes Ned much back rent. And thus does the whole movie play, with Dewey committing sin after rationalizing sin, yet providing such consummate entertainment that we rarely contemplate his immoralities.In his guise of substitute teacher, Dewey stumbles across a substitute BAND Â the young kids of his class Â to fulfill his lowbrow scheme as contender in a Battle Of The Bands (Intentionally, we hear The Who's 'Substitute - your lies for factÂ') Enlisting their musical aid as if it were a school project, Dewey's initially duplicitous scheme transcends its meanness when, in his quest to achieve small-time stardom, Dewey ends up imparting profound advice to all and sundry, as well as educating his class (and the viewer) with the many facets required to make a rock show roll.As ascetic Principal Mullins, Joan Cusack (veteran hausfrau and leading-lady sidekick) Â uncharacteristically OOZES Woman-Heat in her severe schoolmarm attire.The children were thankfully not the usual clutch of precocious smart-alecks Â after countless spoiled, irritating, screeching pig-brats on screen, we finally get kids who act like KIDS. The boys were actually likable and the girls were actually cute! And this is one of those rare films that pays attention to its music synch (except for a short, dodgy classical passage).One aspect which annoyed me *personally* was the widespread notion that WE KEYBOARDISTS are non-stop NERDS: Dewey bequeaths Lawrence the keyboardist Yes's 'Fragile' album - why not 'Machine Head' or 'Demons & Wizards' for the Lord or Hensley stamps of majesty and showmanship? Why not a Hammond XB juggernaut to smack down the thunder, instead of the furiously metrosexual Yamaha synth? As a musician of 30 years who has shredded and smashed the hells bells out of my share of keyboards, let me assure you that Lawrence's end jamm solo was TOTALLY shirt-lifting Â put some STANK on it, fey keyboardist DORK-STALKER! To get those audience panties wet, play in the same mode as GUITARISTS (the pentatonic mode) - throw that classical noodling OUT! The first lesson of the School Of Rock: it's not how good you ARE Â it's how good you LOOK. So start by standing with those legs APART, for the love of - - but the damage is done yet againÂ The story is 'formulaic' to an extent, yet holds most clichÃ©s at bay. ClichÃ© would have Dewey's kids WINNING the Band Competition Â they didn't; clichÃ© would have Dewey plant one on Cusack at film's end Â he didn't; clichÃ© would force Dewey into recanting his wicked ways Â he didn't, which was the bravest clichÃ© omission, separating this film from gutless Disney fare.Dewey was incorrigible! He did NOT arc from selfish cad Bad Boy to mushy princess Home Girl Â his third-act epiphany allowed him to ADMIT his selfishness and mendacity, even whilst retaining those base natures! For the wheels of his con were so firmly in motion that everyone simply HAD to ride it out.All his displays of concern and inspiring pep-talks Â over the keyboardist's lack of cool; the drummer led astray by Poseurs; the fat girl's insecurities; the guitarist's bullying father; even his tentatively romantic overtures towards Cusack's ice-queen Principal Â were merely to cultivate HIS agenda. (That his actions WERE meaningful to the parties persuaded was merely a BY-PRODUCT of his false pretenses.) Yet, by film's end, Dewey had gone from self-appointed El Capitano Band Leader, to praising 'OUR' band. It was this small shift in stance that allowed his 'end' to justify his 'means', otherwise, even in the movie universe, he would have met with Zeppelin's Gallows Pole.Black trod that knife-edge between sociopath and savior, milking the storyline like a blue-ribbon set of udders, for the pleasure of rock burnouts of the Alice Cooper generation (Pre-Comeback). High time! Â enough with the 70s-disco movies, or the street-cred 'alternative' soundtracks Â here is a soundtrack with The Immigrant Song, Smoke On The Water and It's A Long Way To The Top searing our aural cavities - unabashedly, unapologetically - not as satire or denigration, but as the embodiment of the lead character's motivation. These same tracks having driven at least three generations to long hair, cheap pot and bad fashion, why has it taken so long for film-makers to 'get' it, groove it, milk it, market it? Much like Black illustrating the street-greeting to Lawrence, this movie is one big Secret Handshake to crazed musicians of all disposition, crammed as it is with rock-scene esoterica. A flashback sans LSD.Thank Jesus H. Pants that we're back in Black.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",8,0,0,12 August 2005
Gran Torino," The Enforcer in the 'burbs.
","It's not a Dirty Harry film... really, it isn't. But someone forgot to tell Clint Eastwood.Clint Eastwood carries around so much Legend with him that no matter how he approaches a character, we view him through the prism of his inimitable Avenger archetypes. He was Dirty Harry in only five of his nearly 60 starring films, yet when Clint goes Avenger, he'll always be Harry Callahan to us.Foul-mouthed Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an outspoken racist who demeans religion, estranges himself from his children and grandchildren, mocks foreign families, and pulls a shotgun on a boy who tries to steal his car. Only Clint could play this 78 year old, unrepentant Korean War vet and still be loved for it. No one else could have pulled it off - after all, a man's got to know his limitations.Recently widowed Kowalski is the last white man standing in a Detroit neighborhood overrun by Hmong immigrant families from Southeast Asia and Vietnam. He is none too happy with his social situation - in fact, he acts the hell out of the Actor's Workshop definitions of Cantankerous and Surly - and keeps busy by obsessively mowing his lawn and fawning over his prized 1972 Gran Torino.A local gang forces Kowalski's young neighbor, Thao (Bee Vang), to 'mess with another man's vehicles' and steal the Gran Torino as initiation, but Thao comes up against Kowalski's aforementioned shotgun and flees. The next night when the gang returns for the unwilling Thao, a scuffle breaks out and ends up on Kowalski's well-tended lawn.There can be nothing more foreboding, and yet so hysterically funny, than Clint Eastwood aiming a shotgun at a gangbanger's head and bringing his velvet rasp to bear on that age-old phrase of grumpy old men: 'Get off my lawn!' That is the moment Walt/Clint/Philo becomes Dirty Harry. And for once, we cheer the grumpy old man.That's why no one else could have played this role. When someone offends a character played by Clint, we EXPECT Clint to pull a gun. Anything less would detract from his Avenger awesomeness. Now if Woody Allen played Kowalski, we'd have a more believable 'Everyman pushed to the edge.' Clint is hardly Everyman. And you don't have to push him to the edge to get a gun in your face - the middle will do. That's what keeps Clint Harry.While the Hmong neighborhood showers Kowalski with gifts for his 'heroism,' the gang harbors a vendetta against Thao's family, which only escalates. Meanwhile, Thao offers his services to Kowalski to atone for his attempted theft; thus even as events concatenate to bring out the Callahan in Kowalski, his paternal side is awakened as he mentors Thao.Clint's performance, though not Oscar-worthy, is vintage Clint, all sneering one-liners and avenger glares, recognizing his own star quality and humor and playing to those strengths. The cast of unknowns supporting him is another matter. Most of the Asians cannot act and seem like props for the story to progress. In his first film role, Bee Vang does such a useless job as Thao that we're constantly wondering whether he's acting socially inept or whether his acting is inept. When you 'fall out' of the film to wonder - Game Over.A young Catholic priest (Christopher Carley) serves as an annoying 'conscience' for Kowalski; he consoled Kowalski's wife in her last days and pesters Kowalski to take confession. Kowalski tells him straight: 'I think you're an overeducated 27 year old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.' We love you too, Harry.As violence in the neighborhood escalates, the specter of Harry rises to meet it: 'Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me.' This man has tongue-kissed Death, garnering war medals he has no use - and even less respect - for; we feel his visceral absence of fear against tiresome street punks who think they are tough because their pants are low. Eastwood shows us it has nothing to do with height of pants, as his are up somewhere near his armpits.The pants are a dead giveaway - we realize with a sudden impact this man is a 'grandpa.' It takes a bit of getting used to hearing his actual grandkids say it, rather than a bad guy mocking him before getting the subsequent knuckle sandwich or magnum opus.So we feel the inevitable coming: Screenwriter Protocol decrees the Curmudgeon must soften and the Patsy must harden (i.e. racist Kowalski learns tolerance and wimpy Thao learns manliness - they 'complete' each other) - but it doesn't come! Taking their cue from that rubber bracelet, 'What Would Harry Do?' director Eastwood and writers Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson allow Kowalski to become a hero without becoming insufferably pc.Yet another Eastwood film that defines 'heroism' clearly: A hero is someone who has the option NOT to be.Killing boy-soldiers in Korea still haunts Kowalski, so to save Thao's and Sue's lives and to redeem his own, Kowalski's fearless, fading warrior goes out with a bang - literally. We can see the showdown looming, but because it's Clint, we don't quite accept what is happening until it happens. What Would Harry Do? At his age... in the 'burbs... Harry just might...In LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, I called Bruce Willis the screen's Last Action Hero. I was wrong. There's always gonna be some Dirty left in our Harry.",8,1,4,9 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Heroic Movie about a Non-Heroic War.
","Baghdad, 2004. THE HURT LOCKER opens with a quote from journalist, Chris Hedges: '...war is a drug.' Kathryn Bigelow directs this one-note movie, a big closeup on a bomb squad in Iraq. Supposed to be horrifying and life-threatening. Comes off sexy. It would take a director with much bigger balls than Bigelow to make their product look unsavory - it would take a Kubrick or an Eastwood. Bigelow's product just looks way too heroic. And that is why it fails.Been a long time since I've seen a pro-war film pretending to be anti-war. THE HURT LOCKER would like to believe it shows us the gritty realism of sudden death and wasted life. It does - all with hero angles.Do we need any more proof than the slogan? 'You don't have to be a hero to do this. But it helps.' I oughta stop writing right now. HURT LOCKER is typical Amerikan Redneck Meat, intolerance, jingoism, faux-patriotism.'War is a drug.' Movie centers on one soldier who can't get enough of that drug - Staff Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner), who breezes into the Bravo Company bomb squad (which seems to be just three men, James, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) as they're counting down 28 days to rotation. He replaces their last Staff Sergeant (Guy Pearce) who died in a bomb blast (big surprise!).And I cannot relate to this jerkoff at all. Or what drives him to relish the sordid, edge-of-death life he embraces like heroin. But he is the film's hero. Not 'anti-hero,' not villain, not protagonist - 'Hero.' He is not portrayed as unbalanced or obsessed - even though he keeps a 'hurt locker,' a box full of components from the bombs he has defused; and though an injured Eldridge lambastes him for being an adrenalin junkie, it slides off him like bullets slide off Rambo.You gotta be a special kind of crazy to be a soldier in the first place. So though there are numerous tension-filled vignettes, there's no substance to the tension when we back away to look at the large picture. Why are you in Iraq in the first place? This question is completely ignored in HURT LOCKER. It is not political in the least - and that is another of its failings. There should be a reason for why these men are here. As we know, George Idiot Bush HAD no legitimate reason to place American sons and daughters at Death's door.Eldridge very correctly laments, 'If you're here in Iraq, you're dead.'Any time the movie's tension flags, I keep going back to the same refrain: Why are you in Iraq? At many points, it looks like the muscled Amerikans are actually protecting Iraqi civilians from IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) or bombs planted amongst civilian villages - but we are never shown extra-legal Amerikan mercenary companies like Blackwater (renamed Xe), whose CEO, Eric Prince, blatantly admitted to holy crusades and private vendettas to kill Iraqis at the behest of his neo-con, Christian leader, George W. Bush.And we know for a fact that real soldiers watching this movie would not be lamenting the tragedy and brutality of the Iraqi boy being mutilated or the villager strapped with a bomb pleading with the Americans to save him - we know that many soldiers will be thrilling to these deaths, brought about by their very intrusion into that country. It's Viet Nam all over again. The bigotry displayed by the soldiers in the film is simply mirroring the bigotry of the soldiers on the ground - so why is Bigelow trying to fool us into thinking these soldiers care for the downtrodden people of that country? While the hypocritical American government bullshits its citizens that its military presence is needed in Iraq to quell the terrorism against the Iraqi people, they neglect to inform those citizens (whose American taxes are paying to protect Iraqis, by the way) that the American military presence in Iraq is CAUSING said terrorism...The cameos are distracting. They are too short and only serve to take us out of the film's 'realism.' Guy Pearce is the rugged Staff Sergeant at the movie's opening who buys the farm. Then David Morse puts in a hilarious cameo as an officer wildly impressed with James's stupidity/ bravado in deactivating a carload of bombs without wearing his puffy bomb-suit, 'You're a wild man! A wild man!' And Ralph Fiennes suddenly appears as a Brit agent in the desert. As soon as I feel it would be cool to be firing big guns alongside the buffed Mr. Fiennes, the film loses its focus; that should be the LAST thing on our minds. And his sniper scenes are just way too kewl. Get me the hell outa here before I just have to touch his biceps! Guys who play soldiers in war movies must be akin to white guys playing Apaches in those 1950s racist American westerns. How can a person who chose an artistic profession like acting ever convey the parochial mind-set of a person who chose a profession as a sucker - I mean, soldier? In the end, we're looking at an artist's rendering of being a close-minded, death-wishing, authoritarian, weak-minded adrenaline junkie.James goes back home - cannot handle it - introspects to his infant son, 'You love everything right now... As you get older, you find less and less things to love. Until, when you're my age, maybe there's only two things left to love. Or one.' Final scene sees James striding into another bomb situation with his puffy suit on, the text blaring its message of doomed heroism: 'Days left in Delta Force rotation: 365.'And that is why this movie... uh, bombs?...",6,0,2,14 August 2011
The Illusionist," The Distractionist.
","In a movie about misdirection, the opulent production design, set decoration and sumptuous cinematography of *The Illusionist* serves to misdirect the audience into believing that there is something more profound at stake than the Getting of Panty.I can pinpoint exactly where *The Illusionist* loses its footing: during afterglow, Eisenheim the Illusionist tells Duchess Sophie, 'The only mystery I couldn't solve was why my heart couldn't let go of you.' Quantum groan.Up to that point the movie intimated it was about Eisenheim delving into occult knowledge, seeking forbidden illusions and tempting unholy fates, but with that George-Lucasoid line, it showed its hand Â its objective was simply to reunite star-crossed lovers. Again: groan; simultaneously, pay less attention so manhood remains intact.Originally a short story by Steven Millhauser (*Eisenheim the Illusionist*), written for the screen and directed by Neil Burger (only his second filmic offering), *The Illusionist* probably gave its hand away even earlier during gratuitous backstory, where our fledgling magician Hero Â a lowly peasant boy at the time - was smitten by a young upper class girl whom he is forcefully separated from due to bigotry of the caste system - and dramatic foreshadowing.Despite its overarching inanity, Burger scored big with two of the greatest actors in cinema today: Edward Norton (as Eisenheim) and Paul Giamatti (as Chief Inspector Uhl). Even so, Norton does not quite fill the aura of the master magician; his eye is not striking enough and his brow is not brooding enough; Rufus Sewell (who plays Crown Prince Leopold) has more of a commanding magician's look about him. Giamatti, on the other hand, burns down the screen with yet another chameleonic performance, astounding in its seamlessness and emphatic in its conflict Â that of a man torn between supporting Eisenheim's cause and advancing his own career by unlawfully harassing Eisenheim at the petulant Crown Prince's behest.Burger uses the passÃ© technique of starting the story in the middle, telling it in flashback Â which is the film's first half - and letting it 'catch up with itself' in the middle, thereby distracting us more than misdirecting us, for there was no compelling reason to do so, other than to call attention to how smart he fancied himself for doing so.Set in 1900 Vienna (with Philip Glass' soundtrack unmistakably evoking the period) we discover that the Crown Prince's betrothed, Duchess Sophie, (played with sensual style and bangin' buttocks by Jennifer Biel) is Eisenheim's love of his youth; accidentally re-discovering each other during one of Eisenheim's toast-of-the-town performances, she decides to flee the Prince and do the anonymous country girl shuffle with Eisenheim.This sets in motion a chain of events that are not what they seem. At one point, the story seemed to thankfully violate Hollywood Romantic Protocol with the death of the Duchess Â without the female love interest, the film would be forced to do something interesting through its third act Â but, as we discover, this plot point is merely sleight of hand, all explained in a last-minute montage of crash-cuts straight out of *Ocean's Twelve.* Plot twists serve a movie best when they reveal something startling, but this movie's pretentiousness in speculating on Eisenheim's communing with the dead or overthrowing an empire belies its prosaic outcome Â monogamy.Eisenheim's stage tricks were all sleight-of-CGI, which was yet another distraction, as the illusions were too extreme. Since this tale is told through the eyes of Detective Uhl, Eisenheim could have just as easily presented 'real' illusions, challenging enough to be considered supernatural by the virgin crowds of the day (as Arthur C. Clarke notes, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic') but in making them truly inexplicable (growing an orange tree in seconds, conjuring ghosts - attired in the couture of the period - walking through the audience), the movie leans on us to regard them as supernatural (as his audiences do). If so, then we must question the obvious: 'Do clothes have souls too?' (Otherwise, why aren't the ghosts naked? Does the supernatural world respect the propriety of Victorian-morals Europe and employ ectoplasmic clothing mimicry?) The fact that this point is never raised with Eisenheim's 1900's audience may be construed as proof of their credulity or unsophistication Â but think of all the years you in 2006 have been exposed to ghost stories and horror movies; ghosts are always wandering some Elizabethan hallway or haunting some teen model completely clothed Â *you've* never considered this anomalous either! It is this unquestioning acceptance that religions rely on to keep humanity marginally retarded with fairy tales masquerading as history (but that's another essay)Â Of course, the grandest illusion is that which our species perpetrates on itself - using 'love' and 'romance' to faÃ§ade more earthy human proclivities. In a biological system geared towards the continuance of Life, procreation is nothing short of Life's Prime Directive. Mating is good. The Villains are the hypocrisy of 'love' and 'romance.' *The Illusionist* glorifies these Villains morbidly.Sophie and Eisenheim delude themselves that their 'love' for each other justifies their atrocious framing of the Prince. Society seemingly advocates their premeditated crime, for when Inspector Uhl figures out the plot, rather than arrest Eisenheim for deviously driving a man to suicide, he simply laughs at Eisenheim's ingenuity (which involved slipping someone a mickey, faking a death, public slander, planting evidence Â all crimes, even in 1900 Vienna) because Eisenheim 'did it for love' of course.*The Illusionist* worked its most egregious misdirection by invoking 'love' (which in reality is nothing more than two evolved apes panting over each other's genitals) and making felonies look like family entertainment.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",6,2,5,8 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," More *Four* Bore
","There's something about the Fantastic Four that's not all that fantastic: it's called acting.Listened to Joe Satriani's Surfing with the Alien before spanking this review Â 'twas the only way I was gonna charge the cells after watching the soporific, yet tenuously linked Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. As some of you 80s steel-belted wardogs know, Surfing was Satriani's 1987 horse-powered second album and kick in the nuts to the gods of guitar, featuring none other than Marvel Comic's Silver Surfer on its cover.In Rise, the principle cast returns from Fantastic Four (2005), and promptly continues doing what they did in the previous film: not act - Ioan Gruffud (stretching a premise as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards), Jessica Alba (out-acted by her bra again as Invisible Girl/Sue Storm), Chris Evans (flamed by his CGI alter-ego, Human Torch/Johnny Storm) and Michael Chiklis (supposedly a rock, but indiscernible from wood, as Thing/Ben Grimm).Like the title track on Satriani's album, director Tim Story's Rise is a blistering juggernaut, a sliding, gliding tour de force of kineticism, with the Silver Surfer himself the coolest saboteur provocateur this side of Darth Vader (Doug Jones embodying Surfer's glittering form and Larry Fishburne dropping his Morpheus on Silvie's vocals); an interplanetary herald of destruction sent by Galactus, the consumer of worldsÂThe set pieces (the Thames emptying near the London Eye, the Surfer's chase sequences, cosmic clouds clawing their way around Earth) are massive spectacles which keep the 12-year-old contingent happy, but writers Don Payne, Mark Frost and John Turman, though trying hard to put emotional 'nads on the script, are subsumed by the summer stupidity of the director.The ice-veined Surfer's dark origins and darker purpose are given short shrift (he's from a planet which will be consumed by an entity insane with lustful power, were it not for his promise to seek out other planets for that entity, Galactus, to eat); what could have been epic and disturbing is handled with gloved thumbs by director Story and egregious so-called performances by egregious so-called actors.The Surfer himself, though, stands above and beyond any puerile human morality or notion of thespianism Â in every sense, he's UNREAL! With all that queuing for the first iPhones, seems Reed Richards had one before anyone, as it constantly rings at his paparazzi-laden nuptials, alerts him to radiation levels, breaks up his wedding, connects to the internet AND does half his acting for him; while his bride-to-be, Sue Storm, assumes her dream-killing role and starts bitching about 'leading a normal life' and eschewing their tight-suited superhero roles before Reed has even had time to wipe the bachelor party stripper lipstick off his tool. And Reed's just the type of puss to give in to her, but this subplot is quickly forgotten when the Silver Surfer rides by with no clothes on and everything starts getting pear shaped.The army deploy the Four to capture the Surfer and Reed gets his intelligentsia on when he retorts to General Hager (Andre Braugher) that even though he was raised as a geek and not a quarterback, he's still rich, famous and marrying 'the hottest woman on Earth,' whereupon Jessica Alba's dumb head grows larger than the Thing's thing. Chalk up one for the nerd patrol, but did he have to be such a nerd about it? The Four are forced to ally with Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon), their nemesis from the first movie, who has come back to life because in movies you can do that. Doom's ulterior agenda is to channel the Surfer's power, which he progresses in full view of everyone without them being the wiser - because in movies you can do that.Earth is next on the menu for Galactus, who has employed the Surfer to drill holes in the Earth almost as big as Jessica Alba's head, to presumably poke his cosmic fingers into them like a bowling ball and pop us into his mouth like finger food. The Four knock the Surfer off his board (which supplied his limitless power) by using Reed's waffle maker, whereupon the Army immediately tie Silvie to a table and torture him for no reason - you know, standard American Military Procedure.And while Doom makes off with the Surfer's board, fanboys hold candlelight vigils for the death of authenticity Â in Surfer canon, the board had nothing to do with his power. Another track on Surfing With The Alien was Always With Me, Always With You, where Satriani (one of the most lethal gunslingers of the modern age - after Hendrix, and Eddie and - no time to dispute the merits of axe-worship) displays the flip side to bombast and bluster Â subtlety and taste, something which Rise lacks as much as acting.While Doom surfs around on his commandeered board, firing 'bzzz' things from his hands (because we've got this special effects budget Â we might as well use it) and the Four chase him in a flying bathtub, Galactus envelops Earth (represented by a cosmic cloud Â see Movie Convention Number Twelve-a). And the Silver Surfer is the only naked shiny thing who can save the day.The Four's teamwork reclaims the board, whereupon Sue Storm dies and the Surfer Tampers In God's Domain to bring her back to life Â because in movies youÂ but you get the picture by now, right?...Surfer dude goes totally tubular surfing directly into Galactus' cloudy interior and Â I dunno, farting or something, which makes Galactus explode in a shockwave that should have thrown Earth out of orbit, but instead just damaged Japan a little, which was fortunately covered by its Godzilla insurance. Guess you hold the power of a god when you're Surfing With The Alien. Just ask Joe Satriani",5,1,3,30 April 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Youth is wasted on the Pitt.
","For the longest time, I held off on watching this movie because I thought it would be as depressing as rain on a Monday morning. I was wrong. It's worse; like pouring molten lava over your genitals, like seeing police lights in your rearview mirror, like finding your lover in bed with someone else, like watching an American IDOL winner attempt a career in musicÂ THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is horrifyingly painful.David Fincher (SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB) directs - no wonder it's so disturbing - from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald.1918: At the end of WWI, a boy is born to Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng), the mother dying in labor. The baby Benjamin Button is somehow age-wrinkled and scares the pants off Thomas, who leaves Benjamin on the doorstep of a senior's retirement home, where Queenie the caregiver (Taraji P. Henson) adopts him.As the boy gets older, he gets 'younger,' that is, even though he looks like a wizened old prune at age seven, his mind is that of a seven-year-old. During this period, Benjamin befriends a young girl named Daisy, even though, from an outsider view, it looks like a dirty old man cultivating an agenda with a seven-year-old girl.Disturbing.Benjamin grows (i.e. gets younger) until he is Brad Pitt, and Daisy becomes Cate Blanchett. Somewhere in the middle of her aging and his youthing, they move into an apartment together and do the nasty continually.They even birth a child, normal in every way, until Benjamin (considering his bizarre fate) leaves Daisy without a word one morning.Depressing.Benjamin spends much of his screen time traveling the world and having non-sequitur adventures that have no bearing on the main theme of his horrifying brain malfunction. It's like FORREST GUMP for opposite-aging freaks.The filmmakers aim for relevancy by inserting 'life messages' into Benjamin's travels, but these messages of 'power over one's destiny' are unoriginal tropes.The aging makeup is seamless and we never question the actors are doctored. The movie-making process is actually more transparent: For the sake of the narrative to flow, characters talk to themselves, or do voice-over, with Daisy's daughter (Julia Ormond) reading Benjamin's diary for most of the movie, doing that annoying movie device of turning to pictures in the diary that reveal exact moments she is describing.And that's not even as contrived as the overwrought coincidence sequence in which Daisy breaks her leg and derails her dancing career - a woman missing a taxi, a man not setting his alarm, someone leaving one minute later than usual, blah blah - when she could've just as easily been hit by a truck, rather than Rod Serling's TWILIGHT ZONE of coincidences.In hospital, Benjamin visits Daisy, who hasn't seen him in years. She exclaims, 'My God, look at you! You're perfect!' Well, he is Brad Pitt.Jason Flemyng and Brad Pitt sit down to a beer, as same-aged father and son, reminiscing about SNATCH, that other movie they did together where no one could figure what was happening either.Benjamin's autumn years get distressing again, as elderly Daisy cares for him when he physically reverts to a tiny, pink, smooth baby - with his mind at the stage of old-age dementia. It is disturbing to watch these scenes of Daisy cradling a baby trying to mouth something (as babies do) but imagining it is Benjamin Button, losing the power of speech, even as he loses his powers of cognition.BENJAMIN BUTTON is geared for tragedy overload, but can we really feel pity for Benjamin Button? For a whole bump-ugly segment of his life, he got to be Brad Pitt. How many people can be that lucky? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,5,9,23 August 2009
Transformers," More Than Meets The Eye-Strain
","The CGI prowess in the movie TRANSFORMERS almost makes us forget that this film is for people who still play with action figures.Directed by Michael Bay and his motion-sickness cameras, this overwrought production revolves around the All Spark, a mechanical-mystical cube that has knotted the steel knickers of two races of giant robots engaged in civil war over it Â the heroic Autobots and the lunatic Decepticons, who want to take over human technology with the cube for their own evil ends. From a planet called Cybertron, they've tracked this cube to Earth. Good for them. Bad for us.Caught in the midst of the fracas is young Sam (Shia LeBeouf) and Mikaela (Megan Fox). LeBeouf is eccentrically fibrillated in a slapstick-frenetic performance, stuttering his way through the movie like an American Hugh Grant, or a funny Ben Stiller, providing some pretty good distraction from the simple story. While Megan Fox struts about with her T&A all aquiver, just aching for it Â which, when you look at her, seems like it was all she was ever put on this Earth to do. Case closed, Yeronner.While Mikaela makes us want to touch her in all the right places, other subplots provide even more distraction. Josh Duhamel (you know, that guy who looks like a straight Ryan Seacrest) runs around as a military guy, Kevin Dunn and Julie White provide great comic relief as Sam's kvetching parents, Tasmanian Rachael Taylor makes our pants tight with her broad Aussie accent, Anthony Anderson aims at some kind of Overacting Hall of Fame award, and Jon Voight waxes stentorian as the Secretary of Defense Â in the movie, he is the mouthpiece for presidential orders because as we all know, the REAL president Bush (depicted in the movie as a moron) is a moron, and could never actually make defense decisions that don't involve lying through his skunken shithole.(When a Secret government agent appears, saying he is on direct orders from the president, we snigger so violently at the thought of George W. Bush issuing orders to perform a task which might actually be beneficial to mankind, that milk and peanuts come out our nose; when Voight later affirms the president has ordered the destruction of the defeated robots, again we climb our highest imagination pinnacles to envision that mongrel son of a whore having access to information which we know he doesn't read and which he couldn't comprehend *were* he to read it, we being well aware that he self-admittedly *never reads any of his intelligence reports, scanning them briefly if at all*.) But nothing is as distracting Â or as epic Â as the 'reality' of those giant robots coming to life before our very eyes, transforming from cars and helicopters and tanks. Whereas Michael Bay is probably the best person who could bring such giant imaginary things to life in a grandiose way, he misses the opportunity to make them as awe-inspiring as they should be, turning the Autobots into the Three Stooges, pratfalling all over Sam's front yard in an attempt to hide from Sam's parents.Admittedly, it's a reasonably amusing scene, but it followed a scene where the mighty Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader, related the tale of why these 'autonomous robotic organisms' found their way to Earth. (I hate tales that start, 'Ours was a peaceful societyÂ and then war came.' As if 'war' is some outside element intruding into a bubble of harmony. If a society descended into war, then by definition it *wasn't* peaceful!) As the Autobots stood tall before Sam and Mikaela, there was almost an inspirational moment, as I imagined how the creator of these toys for Hasbro might have felt, seeing his tiny action figures rendered as gods on screen.John Turturro suddenly appears as a secret government agent and actually makes it even funnier.For every excellent freeway chase scene or epic interaction scene, there are the unnecessary scorpion robot scenes or that tiny annoying Decepticon causing havok. The music is quite moving - even when the obligatory Running and Screaming starts and all storyline is squeezed into the simplest of singularities: Protect The Cube. As big things that are not really there battle with other big things that are not really there, interacting with cityscape as if they ARE really there.Though the detail is astounding on these robots, it's ocular candy to the myocardial infarction degree. Yeh, my eyes hurt. 'More Than Meets The Eye' - you can say that again, Dr. Amblyopia. And it doesn't help if you slow down the frames on DVD. Because the transformations from beast-to-machine are not logical: the parts don't match or slot into actual physical spaces, the robots and vehicles simply *morph* back and forth. I still remember, over 20 years ago, my baby cousin playing with 'Oktimus Prime' and how ingeniously the robot slotted into his truck alter-ego Â not so in the movie Â it's clank and springs and panels and matter being created from nothing.And when the robots battle each other, I found myself YEARNING for the discomfort of 3D glasses.The Transformers are apparently the only movie where the action figures came first. I'm sure my cousin, now near 30, saw this movie in Australia. Yes, the movie IS for the action-figure setÂ that would be ALL of us over the last three decades",6,3,6,4 August 2008
Pi," Uneasy as Pi
","There is something genius lurking its way to the surface in Darren Aronofsky's PI - but it gets sidetracked with hallucinatory drugs.An indie film through and through, filmed in startling, scratchy black and white, with reasonably poor performances from everyone except the two leads - Sean Gullette and Mark Margolis (forever Alberto the assassin from SCARFACE, 1983) - with an ambitious idea that is not fully realized due to excursions down chemical alleyways and probably lack of budget.Sean Gullette is Max Cohen (geez, I wonder if he's Jewish?), a brilliant mathematician (are there any other kinds in movies? I mean, just once, I'd like to see an AVERAGE mathematician) who spends his days brow-furrowing over insurmountable math theory problems involving pi (defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter), while playing go with the assassin from SCARFACE.Anthropophobic, manic, paranoid, continually injecting himself and popping pills (with the odd hallucination of a drill to the temple) Max works at some problem that will bust open the stock market, if he can stay sane enough to outlast his computer crashes. Early sequences are interesting, where he describes Fibonacci spirals and how he plans to wield these numbers to strike gold.Max ventures out of his computer-cluttered apartment only for sustenance. When he meets a pushy Hasidic Jew who looks like Jason Biggs in a fake beard (Ben Shenkman), he trips into a tangent of intrigue that makes his cerebral problems with pi seem irrelevant. And the soundtrack, coupled with his psycho-babble, makes for a jarring sidetrack into fantasia.On the verge of discovering something monumental, the Hasidic community comes after Max to discern the meaning of a 216-digit number that would reveal the true name of god.Oh - and all this time we thought it was something IMPORTANT you wanted...Espionage Jew Style.",6,0,1,28 October 2008
Kelly's Heroes," From Zeroes to Heroes
","It is World War II. A small troop of American soldiers surrounds the German-occupied French village of Claremont, closing in slowly over the rooftops and through the ruins. Thirty miles behind enemy lines, isolated from their own army, one Sherman tank their only armored support against three superior German Tiger tanks, they're not here to fight a battle.They're here to rob a bank.With characters like Pvt. 'Barbara,' Pvt. 'Cowboy,' 'Little Joe' (jumpy Stuart Margolin), 'Crapgame' (whining Don Rickles), 'Big Joe' (rough-hewn Telly Savalas), 'Pvt. Willard' (Harry Dean Stanton, actually looking young - well, young-ISH), 'Oddball' (a mind-expanded Donald Sutherland) and the unruffled, smooth operator, Kelly (Clint Eastwood, gliding through this movie like a Private With No Name), *Kelly's Heroes* invented the word 'ragtag.' Up against these guys, American troops in previous films portrayed as impertinent insubordinates looked like altar boys.These misfits learn of a cache of 14,000 German gold bars behind enemy lines and Â led by Pvt. Kelly - take a detour from their futile war effort to heist it. Kinda like *The Dirty Dozen* without the meticulous planning. One: down to the road block we've just begun. Two: the guards are through. Three: we're ALL on a spree!...Released smack in the midst of the Viet Nam war (1970), the film's coterie of quirky characters more readily reflects that era's disheveled anti-establishmentarians, rather than the somewhat grittier G.I.'s of the actual Second World War. Which accounts for Oddball's hippie commune of actual 'flower children' Â a species that did not yet exist at the time of this movie's supposed period.Chief crewman of Oddball's cadre of three Sherman tanks is Moriarty (engine-oiled Gavin MacLeod, long before he captained The Love Boat, here piloting The Love *Tank*), incessantly being accused and mispronounced by Oddball, 'Always with the negative waves, Moriaritty! Always with the negative waves!' In their quest to pull off the perfect crime, with an actual pot of gold (worth 16 million dollars) at journey's end, Kelly's 'heroes' inadvertently win battle after battle, carving a swathe of allied territory straight through the heart of German occupation Â to the chagrin and delight of General Colt (frenetic Carroll O'Connor), who believes these troops are ploughing patriotically through enemy lines despite the hesitance of their commanders.Languidly directed by Brian G. Hutton (who also directed the other Eastwood war movie of this era, *Where Eagles Dare*), this movie would have fared better Â as a more entertaining diversion and as a better story - if it had concentrated on the aspects which *separated* it from other war movies of its day - the 'heist' angle and the 'comedy' - rather than adhering to war movie convention so perfunctorily: machine guns blaze away at every opportunity, mowing down Germans who couldn't hit the side of a barn, with carpet-bombing padding out large segments of screen time. Being a 'war movie,' Hutton obviously received a fat explosives budget - and by Jerry Bruckheimer he was going to use it! By the time they reach Claremont, Kelly's armada of companies has been whittled down to only his troop and Oddball's one remaining Sherman. Meanwhile, General Colt drives headlong to Claremont to meet up with Kelly's troop, not realizing that if he did, instead of handing out the medals he brings, he'd have to court-martial the lot of them.After his troop disables two Tigers, Kelly must find a more subtle way to subvert the last remaining Tiger, dug in directly in front of the gold-laden bank.And Sergio Leone comes to the rescue! In a scene directly spoofing one of Clint's own *Dollar* standoffs, he faces down - across an expanse of dusty street - a Tiger tank. Joined by Sutherland and Savalas, and accompanied by Lalo Schifrin's score emulating one of Ennio Morricone's evocative passages (i.e. close your eyes and you're back in *For A Few Dollars More*), they grimly (yet almost smirking for the audacity of the in-joke) stalk towards the tank, whose occupants silently regard this display of bravado - or temporary insanity. All that's missing are the spurs and ponchos.From out of the tank steps the commander (Karl-Otto Alberty, oozing such searing Nazi authenticity it's a wonder he wasn't indicted for war-crimes after the film). Kelly's plan: like any good American entrepreneur Â to Make A Deal. 'All you have to do to have an equal share in this money is crank that turret around Â and blow a hole in that door.' Once again, though other movies may have united Germans and Americans in touching tableaux serving to illustrate the meaninglessness of war, this movie unites them in a decidedly Marxist twist - the proletariat partners in crime united against the capitalistic *bourgeoisie*.Amidst the French celebrating in the street (thinking they have been liberated), with General Colt mistaken for de Gaulle by the revelers and mobbed before he can discover the decimated bank and American soldiers making off with its loot, Lalo Schifrin's and Mike Curb's strangely nostalgic and immortally memorable theme, *Burning Bridges*, plays out the credits, as Kelly's unlikely heroes load the last of the gold onto their truck and drive off Â literally Â into the sunset.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,7,8,2 March 2006
Saw II," Seen It Once, SAW It Again...
","The opening scene of SAW II is as compelling and horrifying as anything you will ever see as a human being with pain receptors: A man wakes in a dungeon with an open bear trap locked around his neck, lined with nails. It is on a timer to snap shut on his head, but he is told where the key is to unlock it - surgically implanted behind his eye! A scalpel and a mirror are laid out before him... The question is not what HE would do - but what YOU would.That's the draw of SAW.After this grand opening, though, SAW II (co-written by SAW's writer, Leigh Whannell and the director, Darren Lynn Bousman) is on a tricycle downhill. Not all the way, but definitely not keeping pace with its powerful predecessor.Donnie Wahlberg is emphatic as Matthews, the slightly unethical cop at the center of SAW II, whose son's (Erik Knudsen) life is at stake. His partner though, Dina Meyer, recently graduated top of her overacting classes and brought her Method Of Smug to this production that just made me want to slap her after brutal spinner sex with her.We feel Matthews's pain and desperation as a father, as he watches his son on a monitor trying to escape a house of traps with six other strangers (Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Beverly Mitchell, Tim Burd, Shawnee Smith); they got every 'type' in there - it's TWELVE ANGRY MEN meets the passengers on the bus in SPEED.Except for Shawnee Smith (reprising her role from SAW), the trapped characters are staples from the ClichÃ©d Character Handbook - the beefy guy, the slut, the businessman, the bum, the token black guy; each supplied with Nifty Exposition Dialog, with all gaps in backstory filled in by Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), his Exposition Monologue Handbook open on his wheelchaired lap.'I want to play a game...' But the game is not as compelling as that which Jigsaw played in SAW. The people traps are not as insidious or as smart as those in the last movie. Therefore, the gore seems more gratuitous, rather than organic. And someone should probably do a psych evaluation on Australian writer, Leigh Whannell - to say this guy's imagination is morbid is a nice way of saying he's a latent maniacal serial killer...The story itself is loaded with twists and reveals and surprises that keep ramping up the stakes, twisting the barbed wire tighter around your chest, all filmed in that sickly green hue that makes you think you just vomited.The original SAW had a reveal at the end that rivaled Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE for ground-shaking impact: We never saw Jigsaw coming. In SAW II, there can be no such surprise quotient any more - even though Jigsaw is menacing and ominous and intellectually superior - so they try hard for a shocking reveal, but it is forced.Of course, with the SAW series, the title would mean nought if we didn't get some juicy self-mutilation for the sake of escape, rather than the sake of being a supermodel.Towards the end, there is a nice little wink to fans of the original SAW. Through an eye with a key surgically implanted behind it...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,1,1,1 November 2009
Clash of the Titans," Hash of the Titans.
","Liam Neeson and Sam Worthington try to out-act special effects. Fail. 16-year-old boys rejoice. Mankind tries to live without deities. Fail. Churches rejoice.CLASH OF THE TITANS is written for 16-year-old boys, to be enjoyed exclusively by 16-year-old boys. Hell, I loved the 1981 original film. When I was 16. The 2010 remake obviously has better special effects and much better-realized and refined supernatural creatures, but the acting and the story have not graduated past the level of acceptance required by 16-year-old boys.Perseus (Aussie Sam Worthington, who just can't seem to shake that accent as his ancestors Mel Gibson and Guy Pearce did), a demi-god in ancient Greece, must battle against the gods themselves when the city of Argos is forced to sacrifice its princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) to the Kraken.Like any story that involves religion, everything happens for irrational reasons and without motivation and without any point. Perseus's very birth is laden with irrational backstory, as mortal King Acrisius (Jason Flemyng) feuds with Olympian god Zeus (Liam Neeson), causing Zeus to rape Acrisius's wife.Let's backtrack for a moment: How exactly do you feud with a god? How does one 'raid Olympus'? Isn't it on another dimensional plane? And even if Olympus IS just a physical abode resting on the lowest clouds, how do the ancient Greek soldiery (possessing no flying machines) actually ATTACK Olympus?...Onward...Acrisius's wife births Perseus, who is half-god, half-Australian. Acrisius, in a fit of rage, uh, waits nine months until baby Perseus is born, to entomb both baby and mother in a coffin and hurl it into the sea 'to destroy Zeus's seed.' Guess his 'fit of rage' didn't take into account it might have been easier to just stab the mother while she was pregnant...Long story short: Perseus lives, becomes a fisherman, in a world which has started to defy the gods who created them. Soldiers destroy a giant Zeus statue and broham Hades, ruler of the underworld, immediately appears as a giant black winged entity (with smaller bat-winged demons reminiscent of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS) and wipes the floor with the soldiers. So what kind of cretin would continue insulting gods? Yet they do. Queen Cassiopeia of Argos boasts that her daughter Andromeda is more beautiful than the goddess Aphrodite, at which point Hades (Ralph Fiennes, doing his best Gary Oldman), appears again and calls for Andromeda's sacrifice - or he will release the Kraken (which we presume is a Very Bad Thing because he pronounces the name so terribly feyly).After Hades lays down his curse, Perseus unwittingly gets roped into the quest to stop the Kraken, which involves visiting Stygian witches, taming a Pegasus flying horse, lopping off the head of the gorgon Medusa and using it to turn the Kraken to stone. While Hans Zimmer's music makes it epic on toast. All in a day's work for a demi-god. But Perseus spends half his skirt-wearing, sword-wielding time bitching about wanting to be a man not a god.Perseus maintains to Zeus, 'We live, we fight and we die for each other - not for you,' which again, is spoken like a man living in a world WITHOUT gods, or in a world with imaginary gods, i.e. ours. If the gods showed themselves and performed magical, physics-bending havoc when you defied them, I'm betting you would learn quicksmart how to live, fight and die for them.Blaming director Louis Leterrier and writers Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi for these discrepancies would be like blaming Peter Jackson for the illogical happenings in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. The Greek mythology is already written - if the movie writers stuck to every detail and inserted every ulterior motivation of the complex characters, we would need a trilogy of movies. As a movie version of CLASH OF THE TITANS had already been written in 1981 by Beverly Cross, these remake writers simply took that script - and dumbed it down even further.As illustrated by the box office, no one cares. In modern parlance, 'going Greek' doesn't involve mythological classicism.The visualization of the creatures - from Flemyng's Calibos makeup to the ferryman Charon, to Medusa, the Pegasus and the Kraken - is monstrously good, although I will say that Medusa should have been topless. She's a snake-like monster who lives amongst ruins and turns people to stone with her stare; can you really see her adjusting her ornate bra for maximum push-up effect? I'm just sayin.' Movie makes an infantile decision to paint Hades as a 'villain,' as if synonymous with the Christian devil, but Hades was not a simple polar opposite to Zeus; Zeus ruled Olympus, Poseidon ruled the oceans and Hades ruled the underworld, which was called either Tartarus, Elysium or Erebus, and was a region ALL human souls passed through, not just 'bad' ones. And Olympus was NOT the equivalent of Christian heaven, it was the exclusive abode of the gods - NO human was allowed there.Would that any human cast his unworthy gaze on Liam Neeson's fake pirate's beard and absolutely fabulous outfit; gadding about in a shimmering silvery ballroom gown made of chromium wings that is even gayer than his costume as Qui-Gon Jin.The grandest misnomer of all: the twelve Titans of Ancient Greece were Cronus, Oceanus, Tethys, Mnemosyne, Hyperion, Themis, Thea, Iapetus, Phoebe, Rhea, Coeus and Crius. None of whom appear in the movie. (Though Zeus and Hades are erroneously regarded as Titans by some texts, they are merely offspring of Titans, Cronus and Rhea.) So... a movie called CLASH OF THE TITANS which features not one actual Titan.The movie makers are just bending us over and going Greek on us.",6,1,2,20 August 2011
Paranormal Activity," Pants Not Normal Activity.
","Gonna get this PARANORMAL ACTIVITY party started by insulting 'you people.' You People know who you are: believe in demons, astrology, gods, ghosts, angels, woobies...I make this distinction because this film's impact on a non-superstitious cucumber is very different to its effect on You People, who take it for granted the events in this indie docu-style movie COULD HAPPEN, and then can't close your eyes at night for fear it COULD HAPPEN to you.And writer-director Oren Peli knows just how to scare You People.We think we know horror because our senses have been deadened by what the Hollywood system calls horror. Just like we think we know hamburgers because we eat at McDonalds (whether we like it or not and whether we admit it or not) - but visit a Ma and Pa griddle and suddenly the stinging of the onions leaps out at you, as does the red freshness of the ground meat patty on the crisply toasted buns; the cheese is aromatic, the tomatoes bleed with seedy juice, the lettuce is garden crisp, and a hint of ketchup cheekily enhances this audacious co-mingling of the five food groups.PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a hamburger from Ma and Pa's griddle.Movie works on the premise elucidated by Stephen King: don't show the monsters. Young couple Micah (if you squint real hard, a young Eric Bana) and Katie (don't need to squint to see her two mungus assets) move in together and experience the titular paranormal activity, which consists of doors moving, loud noises and sounds of people running around. But we see NOTHING.Film is shot entirely on a hand-held Vidcam that Micah buys to record the phenomena. The obvious parallel is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in almost every stylistic aspect. (Like BLAIR WITCH, the footage was supposedly 'recovered' - and edited into this movie by some nice editors who had nothing better to do than spend three months in an editing bay, then hire a marketing firm to create internet buzz, then attend film festivals since 2007 trying to score major distributors...)We get the backstory when a gutless psychic (Mark Friedrichs) visits and asks Katie questions. Seems she's been plagued by demonic visitations since she was 8, so the psychic goes into Wet Pants Mode, 'My expertise is dealing with ghosts, not demons.' (Oh, so you have no expertise.) 'Dealing with demons is different.' (That's right - to deal with them, you have to pretend even harder.) Micah taunts the demons with his vidcam and even sets up an EVP Microphone (oh, it's a comedy!), which makes Katie scared that he is 'angering' the entities. Sho' nuff, when the psychic returns, desperately called by Katie for some help, he assures her by saying he can't help in the least, and wets his pants into the night, exclaiming the demon is outraged he is there. Evidence for his gutless behavior? - his behavior itself. Simply because he says 'The demon is angered,' You People believe him.Micah claims he is doing 'research' into psychic phenomena - with a PICTURE BOOK of demons and witches... about as much research as he did on his girlfriend before moving in with her and only then discovering she's slightly cracked for hallucinating figures standing at the base of her bed. Katie keeps saying, 'Let's get out of the house!' - but it's not the house, honey - it's YOU! And as for why Micah doesn't simply leave her, guess there's no accounting for the effect mungus assets have on guys who kinda look like Eric Bana... (And he keeps putting up with her after she refuses to have sex on camera - there's a deal-breaker right there--)The scares are sudden and admittedly effective. Certain sounds at any hour of the day are scary - such as a gigantic THOOM! that rattles your ribcage - but hear them suddenly in the middle of the night and your hairs rise autonomously, whether you are a ghost whisperer, a practising catholic or a nullifidian cucumber.Micah's camera spends long stretches on a tripod filming them sleeping - though the daytime acting is exceptional in that naturalistic vein, these night moments are the most fun (and not because of the non-existent sex). The timer on the camera is integral to some of the scares, and it will keep you guessing as to how they pulled some of the supernatural gags - especially the 'dragged-out-of-bed' gag. (It's true: if your leg is sticking out of the blankets, the devil WILL grab it!)On a budget somewhere between nothing and shoestring ($11,000), Peli has carved his 15 minutes, but it's a quality fifteen, with solid old fashioned thrills. He only stoops to the level of convention once - where he ramps the speed of the film to emulate THE RING's style - trouble is, that relapse comes in the film's final frames and compromises an otherwise above-average pants-browner.The moral of the story is: Don't Taunt The Hamburger, You People!",7,0,1,6 August 2011
World Trade Center," A Date With Density
","Oliver Stone's *World Trade Center* is not about the World Trade Center. Nor does it pose questions on conspiracies, religionism, racism, political ideologies, oil collusion or White House incompetence. Which raises the obvious question: why then make a movie about the World Trade Center?To invoke a known audience. 'World Trade Center' has become synonymous with '9-11' (itself a contraction of a culture-shocking event) and both have become shorthand for proselytizing on courage and heroism and misplaced patriotism. Attaching that moniker to any media - however tangentially Â sells tickets. *WTC* is about two beat cops, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) who are trapped in the rubble of Tower 1's collapse before they even get the chance to rescue one civilian. (Guess we've added yet another criterion to the term 'heroism': anyone who INTENDS to rescue people but needs to be rescued himself after doing nothing.) The first act is restrained film-making at its best, as Stone shows us Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawning like any other mundane workday, New York populace going through the motions of city life. Comparisons with the unobtrusive camera of Paul Greengrass' superior *United 93* are unavoidable, and Â like that movie Â a vicarious thrill builds in our bones, for we know something that the New Yorkers don't: that today is going to be so far removed from mundane it will gouge out its own vernacular in history.The first intimation that there is something horribly awry with this particular September 11th is an ominous plane-shaped shadow whooshing over the cityscapeÂStone does not explicitly show airplanes impacting Towers (it would remove focus from his characters), but his scenes of destruction and mayhem are as good as cinema gets. And though there are still whiners puling 'too soon,' the audience yet extracts a rubbernecker's glee from watching this unimaginable tragedy unfold with astoundingly seamless special effects from a Ground Zero ringside seat.Stone has also captured excellent performances with the shock, surprise, horror and incredulity of the officers arriving at Ground Zero. Those of us who were not there could never hope to imagine what uncontainable emotions overwhelmed each rescuer's breast as he gazed up at a tableau which the wildest imagination could never conjure. And after injecting us into the heart of the action, with a breath-stopping sequence trapping our stars under mountains of rubble, the film Â like the World Trade Center - collapses. For there is nowhere to go and it becomes obvious that inexperienced screenwriter Andrea Berloff has formulaically set up a tearjerker just waiting to happen. There's a fine line between restrained and boring. And Stone's hand seems so stultified by the gutless executives who funded this project that he resignedly points his camera over the wrong side of that line. Though he tries to retain relevance to the 9-11 *GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung* (by inserting actual newsreel footage of super-Mayor Giuliani, faux-President Bush, reports on United Flight 93, the Pentagon crash, *et al*), even the earth-shuddering impact of the WTC Towers collapsing is soon forgotten when the story turns its focus on the wives of the trappees (Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello) and their maudlin, Academy-tilted performances. It turns into just 'two guys trapped in a mine shaft.'The movie also loses what little objectivity it strived for when Jimeno launches into an extended 'heroism' speech (which veritably bends over and spreads its cheeks for the hero mongers). Meanwhile, Cage's initial heartfelt performance of McLoughlin diminishes over time, as he uses up the film's one allocated swear word (as decreed by the MPAA for PG-13 films) early in his desperation and then becomes non-believable, as no one in this mind-breaking situation ever swears after that one transgression, making it all as painfully PG-13 as any Freddie Prinze Junior debacle.And while Jimeno has dumb Jesus dreams, McLoughlin inertly flashes back to his four kids with the hands-down hottest MILF in the neighborhood (Bello). (If any of our lives were HALF as idyllic as the 'real life' characters portrayed in any 9-11 movie, the Muslims who razed the Towers would have defected over to white-bread Christianity millennia ago. Or maybe that's why they razed them.)Nothing continues to happen, proving conclusively that not every true story is worth telling. The rescue of the two men contains its fair share of nail-biting and was apparently instigated by an ex-Marine, Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), who abandoned his job in Connecticut and traveled to Ground Zero because 'God called him.' (While talking to Karnes, God must have neglected to head on over to Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Florida and talk to Bush about the attacks. Without a direct word from God, how could *anyone* be expected to abandon the compelling *Pet Goat* to lead a country. Evidently, only *after* the attacks does God deign to start talking with The W.) As we grow to learn of Karnes' delusional nature (obsessing over Marine ethos to the point of asking to be addressed as 'Staff Sergeant'), we realize that this is the exact type of bulldog fundamentalist bred by the American Armed Forces, and that it wasn't God calling him after all Â it was his red neck. To its credit, the story does not make it seem like rescuing its two stars puts an end to the horror, and the unfinished nature of the rescues and aftermath are noted; Jimeno's family walk past a wall full of missing persons, Karnes emerges from the rescue rubble talking of retribution, Dorff's policeman laments the multitude not accounted for, and McLoughlin himself had to undergo 2 years of medically-induced comas and 27 surgeries Â well, that'll happen when a World Trade Center falls on you. Only 20 people were pulled out of the WTC rubble alive. Only eighteen more True Stories with movie deals to go",6,3,8,26 August 2006
The Dark Knight," Do not go gentle into that good knight...
","If Batman is the untamed world, The Joker is the unbalanced world. THE DARK KNIGHT tells us humanity lives somewhere in between. In Christopher Nolan's sequel to BATMAN BEGINS, we hit the ground running, cape flouncing dramatically, cowl turned sideways so we can only see through one eye-hole; claustrophobic scream rising as Gotham City is terrorized by The Joker, while the Batman, Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent join forces to stop him at the cost of lives, ethics, reputations... as simple as this outline reads, director-writer Nolan and co-writer, Jonathan Nolan, have elevated this comic book tale to tragedy on an operatic scale. Christian Bale is once again Batman/Bruce Wayne, all muscled arms and intense quietude; Michael Caine, his loyal butler, Alfred; Morgan Freeman is technocrat Lucius Fox, who delineates the ethics slur that Batman commits (a grave nod to the Amerikan FISA bill); mighty Gary Oldman is Commissioner Gordon; hourglass Maggie Gyllenhaal thankfully replaces dull Katie Holmes as Assistant D.A., Rachel Dawes; Aaron Eckhart makes a killer Harvey Dent, tragically transmogrified into Two-Face; and - let me do that Hannibal Lecter thing when he talks about Chianti - there is... The Joker....Why So Sneerious? The tragedy mounts its gargoyle perch, as Gotham realizes too late that only a city overseen by a caped vigilante would be prone to inspire villains as flamboyant as its protector. For the first time on film since his appearance in graphic novels in 1940, The Joker is the heart attack Cadillac hell-on-wheels insanitarium he was always envisioned to be. And Heath Ledger - in his swansong performance before his untimely death - does not go gentle into that good night. Was it ever imagined that someone on this earth could out-Jack Jack? And what mad fate that that one man would leave this earth after his most throat-slicing role... Heath Ledger's kamikaze performance as The Joker runs this movie on a scalpel-edge, a role so black and purple and psycho-delicious, it turns our hair green with pus. His origins are never explained, his motives are never explored - 'Some men just want to watch the world burn.' First scenes pay homage to the 'Sons of The Batman,' where do-gooder impostors don Batman's cowl and cape to bring vigilante justice to their corner of Gotham. After this pat action beginning, The Joker rears his painted head. And everything gets pear-shaped. We meet The Joker in a convoluted bank robbing scene, where double-crosses and triple-crosses against his own henchmen illustrate exactly how saw-toothed the cogs of The Joker's plans are. He plays by no rules, thriving on the chaos he creates from the tripwire of civilized society. With his psychological profile lifted from the graphic novel BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE - 'All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy' - The Joker launches a plot to undermine the underworld as well as the over world. His plots are plans within plans,moral ambiguities piled upon moral turpitude. Playing humanity's dark side against its gray side.Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne operates from a giant subterranean crawlspace, trying to keep Batman's name free of scandal and to simultaneously protect Gotham from The Joker's demolition smile. In this reality-based world, vigilantes are a mixed blessing, as Harvey Dent walks a tightrope of tolerance for Batman. Meanwhile, Bruce's love interest, Rachel Dawes, is Spanking Panties with Harvey right in front of Bruce, which drives him batty. At one point, Bruce almost gives up being Batman for the sake of Rachel's spank, because it truly looks like Harvey is making headway in cleaning up Gotham. In not being bought or negotiated with, Dent has become Gotham's 'White Knight.' Then The Joker happens...This is not a simple film by any means and the moral dilemmas each protagonist is made to face by The Joker are astoundingly well-crafted.Dent is injured during a rescue, half his face chemically burning off, but his resulting 'split-personality' as Two-Face is not the simplistic madness of Tommy Lee Jones, but the moral ambiguity of an avenger for justice who has seen both sides of the good/evil fence - and they're both the same but for *one bad day!* The Joker - in playing good against evil - unwittingly achieved a poetic symmetry in Dent.Batman resorts to spying on Gotham's citizens via their cellphones, to pick up possible transmissions from the Joker and locate him. Lucius resents this intrusion of privacy and quits. This is not 'just' a superhero movie - oh, it's got all the action you could want - that Bat-Hummer thrashes through traffic and then births a spiffy Bat-Bike; Batman swooshes through the night and delivers chest-kicks aplenty, and a hospital goes kablooey! - but THE DARK KNIGHT questions everything ABOUT heroes, and takes itself just as seriously as The Joker doesn't. In a sad irony, Ledger's Joker lifts another allusion from THE KILLING JOKE when he tells Batman they are 'destined to be doing this forever.' The Joker's fate in the movie is ambiguous, left hanging upside down from a skyscraper girder, cackling, as always, as if in on a joke that only HE gets. As Batman burdens himself with the sins of Gotham and White Knight Dent, so that society won't crumble when their belief in heroes is shaken, Gary Oldman's words ring the messianic outro, to the question his son asks, 'Why must he run?': '...Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a dark knight.'",10,4,10,13 September 2008
Into the Wild," Northern Over-Exposure.
","The question will always be: Once you get INTO THE WILD, what do you do there? Of all the people to ask this pertinent, profound question of Chris McCandless - it is Vince Vaughn.From a book by Jon Krakauer (who also wrote Into Thin Air), Sean Penn directs Emile Hirsch as Christopher Johnson McCandless (Feb 1968 - Aug 1992), who shucked off his earthly possessions, did a Henry David Thoreau and flitted into the wilds of Alaska to live off the land. Vaughn plays a farmer employer that Chris (Hirsch) meets along the way.After graduating as an 'A' student from Emory University, Chris stuns his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and surprises his sister by giving all his money to charity, burning his Social Security card - his strongest link to an identity in the 'civilized' world - and setting out on foot with nothing but a backpack and seeming enochlophobia (fear of crowds).He renames himself Alexander Supertramp and travels from Arizona, kayaking illegally down to Mexico, then trudging/hitching up to Alaska. Along the way, he meets a cast of characters who each tells Chris, or at least fears, that his quest to isolate himself will end in tragedy, and unwittingly offer him three staples of 'civilization': Vaughn offers money - the steady job; a hippie commune (with Brian H. Dierker and Catherine Keener) offers female companionship (in the form of waif Kristen Stewart, who knows how to woik cut-offs); and a doddering Hal Holbrook tearfully offers family, asking if Chris wouldn't mind being adopted as a son.In retrospect, we see that Penn compresses McCandless's journals to present us with only these clichÃ©s, but while viewing, the characters are oddly compelling. We are rooting for McCandless to make his journey, yet we also want him to experience the fullness of life as WE have become accustomed to it (i.e. take the new car your father offers to buy for you; plonk the sexy chick before you walk away; at least take your Blackberry, dude...).For anyone raised happily in First World society, it would take a lot to convince him or her of Chris's determination to get away from it. Emil Hirsch sells Chris's wanderlust state of mind and body completely.When Chris arrives in Alaska, the searing beauty and welcome quietude lasts only as long as it takes to realize that the land is unforgiving to idealistic puny humans who were not born and raised into it. Chris finds an abandoned 'Magic Bus' and sets up a cozy HQ from which to drink in grand vistas, hunt and store food, but soon comes to realize the folly of drawing all his wilderness knowledge from books.Chris narrates the realities of killing a big animal for food - a moose; in a disturbing scene, he is one man with a small knife, trying desperately to cut it into small pieces, but he cannot cure and cook the meat before the flies leave it crawling with maggots, making the death of this magnificent beast worthless. He writes, 'One of the greatest tragedies of my life - shooting the moose' and tearfully relinquishes it to the wild, watching the wolves and bald eagles pick at the flesh. '... clearly felt the presence of a forest not bound to be kind to man. It was a place of heathenism and superstitious rites, to be inhabited by men nearer akin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' Chris must have been one wicked misanthrope to abjure the embrace of humankind. Yet there is hypocrisy in people who wish to excise themselves from the world of man and yet leave behind a journal for the world of man to read. Writing is the provenance of creatures who perceive a future; anyone who engages in lyrical flourishes like the above passage is writing for other people to read them eventually.And we see that this is true, for Chris fully intended to return to the world, his Walden experiment having run its course through his veins. That's when Penn springs the dramatic hook on us: when Chris realizes life is only good when shared, it is too late. He writes (still fantasizing about that book deal, we presume), 'I have literally become trapped in the wild.' Penn is unflinching, showing us not only the grandeur of Chris's adventure, but also its fatal mistakes. Chris eats a poison plant by mistake, that suppresses appetite, thereby killing its victim slowly. For author Krakauer to reconstruct Chris's last days from journal entries and other evidence, Chris must have been a pathological writer to document the symptoms of his death even as it slowly overtook him, Emil Hirsch doing a Reverse RAGING BULL and turning skeletal before our eyes, his final moments spent in agony yet gazing up at the open sky.I always wonder, with these wilderness guys, how an ailment like kidney stones, or a thorn stabbed into the foot turning it gangrenous, or - like Hanks in CAST AWAY - a decayed tooth, would make them feel about hanging out so far from drugs and busty nurses.But in the film's final narrated words of elation, Penn allows Chris the benefit of the doubt that he enjoyed his life to its end. Free. 'What if I were smiling... and running into your arms... would you see then... what I see now?' Whatever he might have meant by that enigmatic passage - that every person's perception of happiness is wildly different - Chris achieved what I believe was his most joyous goal: immortality.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,4,7,6 March 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," Also sprach Kubrick und Clarke
","Long before Douglas Adams, in *2001: A Space Odyssey*, Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke tackle Life, the Universe and Everything.The result? Monolithic! A movie where everything exciting happens in the human mind. No aliens blasting at each other as if they were cowboys from 1870 Earth, or rocket sleds blaring loudly in space and explosions of spacecraft as if they were in an atmosphere; no plots to 'rule the galaxy' as if it was a serfdom easily circumnavigated in a day or two - in the grandest irony, *2001* uses none of the conventions it was responsible for spawning in its wildly-inferior successors to the space-movie throne Â the *Star Trek* and *Star Wars* franchises. And all other 'space' dross that would issue from the mind of man.With the simple placement of an inexplicable, anachronous object Â The Monolith - Clarke and Kubrick forge the best 'true science fiction' adventure of all time. For this is how a truly 'alien' intelligence might come amongst us Â not in papier-mÃ¢chÃ© flying saucers or as disguised humans Â but in the form of a seemingly benign message of superiority as non-intrusive as a hammer.The adventure begins with primeval ancestors of mankind Â ape-like beings struggling for existence in a prehistoric African veldt Â who come upon The Monolith, which acts as a stimulant for their latent intelligence. Soon these man-apes have conquered their surroundings through power, realized in the simple wielding of a femur bone.The action leaps ahead in what Clarke calls 'the longest flash-forward in the history of movies' Â three million years, to 2001, when a manned moon base uncovers a Monolith not unlike that which woke our ancestors from their bestial slumber in prehistoric Africa. It is, like its prehistoric brother, black, featureless, light-absorbent and an utter mystery. After emitting a startling radio signal aimed at Jupiter, it falls silent.Cut forward once again, to the spaceship *Discovery*, on a mission to Jupiter to find out exactly why the Monolith spoke its single syllable there.After first viewing *2001*, you will dismiss Kubrick as indulging his inner hippie-chick with random futuristic images burdened with faux-portent due to the elitist soundtrack. After the second viewing, you will be contemplating which room of your house to sacrifice to your Kubrick Shrine.With a soundtrack so lush and awe-inspiring it kept hippies and music enthusiasts alike rooted to their seats in expectation, *2001* forged a new vernacular for the 'sound of space.' By applying well-known source music to his film, Kubrick breathed new life into Johann Strauss' *The Blue Danube*, GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti's *Lux Aeterna* and *AtmosphÃ¨res*, and of course, Richard Strauss' *Also sprach Zarathustra* ('Thus Spoke Zarathustra'), the movie's euphoric main theme, with its elegant horns, glittering organ and pounding timpani standing on hind legs and beating its chest like an alpha silverback.As Arthur C. Clarke has grown nauseated in telling, *2001* was not only culled from his short story *The Sentinel*, but from six other tales as well: *Breaking Strain, Out of the Cradle, Endlessly OrbitingÂ, Who's There, Into The Comet* and *Before Eden.* With such a powerfully understated and enigmatic performance in both this movie and its inferior sequel, *2010: Odyssey Two* (1984), it is unlikely that Kier Dullea will ever be remembered for anything else - and unlikely that he will ever be forgotten. Dullea is Dave Bowman, who, along with fellow astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) faces the adversity not only of the Monolith's mysteries, but of their malfunctioning on-board computer, HAL 9000.Ultimately, it is for him that Destiny crouches and pounces on, as The Monolith works its wild wonders on his frail humanityÂ Speaking in tongues, Kubrick and Clarke swirl Bowman through anomalies in the space-time continuum and craft a resolution to Life itself. With Bowman's transmogrification to that of Star-Child, his essence sloughing off physical flesh, his rebirthed cosmic embryo looks back on a distant Earth.Released in 1968, utilizing the hardest real science of its time, Clarke and Kubrick not only achieved Kubrick's dream of making the proverbial 'really good science fiction film,' but gave their audience over to the most cerebral speculations known outside the marijuana-drenched hippie community. How to wrap our minds around nothing less than the power that engines the universe? Dave Bowman's transcendence is not a death Â it is a subsuming. (As Carl Sagan epically notes, 'We are all star stuff.') With no mysticism or religion intimated, it is a grand vision of all things being one. Of all man's adventures of discovery, when our minds are thus freed, it will be our grandest odyssey of all.Thus spoke Kubrick and Clarke.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",10,1,4,1 June 2006
Toy Story," Plastic Fantastic.
","Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking! In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and 'plastic corrosion awareness meetings,' until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops 'in the field' (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels Â in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature Â just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the 'real people') irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The 'Disney Movie' has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are 'messages,' but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, 'Clearly I will go sailing no more,' launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idÃ©e fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz Â who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of 'playing inert' when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as 'Mrs. Nesbitt'). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, 'This is not flying - this is falling with style,' simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing systemÂ.",9,52,59,26 May 2006
Blood Diamond," A Rough in the Diamond
","The greed of the human animal is such a compelling thing that even decrying that greed will only feed it. Such is the paradox facing Edward Zwick's powerful *Blood Diamond*, a movie set in the west African country of Sierra Leone in 1999, when Revolutionary United Front rebels took over the nation's capital, using diamonds mined by slave labor as their civil war sledgehammer, to finance their war against the government.Though it is against the horrors perpetrated by the rebels and their leveraging of 'blood diamonds,' the movie recreates their atrocities so well that it will rake in millions on the depiction of those atrocities.Audiences have recently given Mel Gibson grief over the gratuitous bloodletting in his movies, yet when *Blood Diamond* blasts into a shattering killing euphoria every twenty minutes almost on cue, do those same critics hold their tongues because *Diamond* supposedly portrays a real conflict? Written by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell, we are shown boys recruited by the RUF, armed with AK-47s, mindlessly blowing away citizens, we see arms being lopped off, sudden shootings in the head and wild slayings of innocents; knowledge of the Sierra Leone civil conflict might lend a context to the violence, but its acceptance as an ostensible necessary element in this movie says something about our violent species. Is Gibson's violence gratuitous because it depicts societies far removed from our modern world, and is *Diamond*'s violence 'noble' because it is just across the pond? Like Mel's *Apocalypto*, we are witness to a people destroying themselves from within. Over greed.Slinking beneath the radar of the turmoil is diamond smuggler, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio). For this role, Leo does what most women do who want to be taken seriously Â women like George Michael, Ashton Kutcher and Joey Fatone Â he grows a goatee. It doesn't help. He's still as pretty as sunset on the French Riviera. But he's hard - the hardest he's ever played: shooting down guerrillas in cold blood, breaking necks, facing down gun-toting madmen, all in a shirt so grimy with his back-sweat that it probably brought a lunatic's price on e-bay from some squealing tweener. In fact, he's so hard that if they were to remake *Titanic* today, he'd play the iceberg.Though his career performances have been consistently stellar, in burying himself in the role of this Rhodesian-born, white African, through a reasonably legit South African accent (and that badass goatee), for the first time, we lose the sense that we are watching a Movie Star; it could be just some guy pretty enough to be Leo DiCaprio.Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vandy, a fisherman whose teen son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers), is kidnapped and brainwashed by the rebels, *a la* Patty Hearst. While Dia is trained to smoke, drink and mow down villagers every bit as mindlessly as a good ole U.S. Marine, Solomon is enslaved by the rebels to dig for diamonds, one day unearthing a pink rock the size of Freedom Â which he hides.In true mercenary style, Archer hooks up with Solomon, promising to help retrieve Solomon's son in return for a part of the diamond. (In an unintentionally funny scene, skinny white-boy Leo asserts he will set the pace cross-country Â with a mandingo like Djimon at his side.) Archer brings along smart-mouth American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly Â blessed with the scriptwriter's snappy repartee that no female ever employs in real life), who is also a merc, offering to help them in return for Archer providing her vital black market info that will make her exposÃ© on blood diamonds pop. So she has no call to give Archer a contemptuous look when she discovers why he is helping Solomon Â but in true Female Double Standard idiom, we are meant to forgive Maddy *her* merc intentions for her doe eyes and half-exposed teats.Still, though both start out as mercs, Maddy and Archer's characters eventually bow down to the god of Hollywood Character Arcs, both finding their inner Oprahs before the credits roll.Keeping the lovebirds apart in the final few minutes, the film might have retained even more cred had it not made them so freakin' HONORABLE. We humans are a gruesome, violent species - watch the screaming satisfaction of Solomon smashing a shovel over his slaver's head. More than a few people enjoyed that scene with their hands down their pants, me included.During boardroom scenes (populated by suits pretending concern for the blood spilled over illicit diamonds) we learn of The Kimberley Process, a joint government and diamond industry initiative working to staunch the flow of 'conflict diamonds.' But who's buying this lip service? There is greed up and down the ladder, from the CEOs to the governments, to the rebels and precious stone customers.And though the movie is supposedly an indictment against this black market bingo, I doubt Leo's goatee, Jennifer's teats or Djimon's mandingo will influence real world buyers into only purchasing 'conflict-free' gems.Trying to blow the lid off the illicit diamond trade, Maddy asserts, 'People back home wouldn't buy a ring if they knew it was gonna cost a hand.' Wrong. The type of people who insist on diamonds as presents, who think nothing of terrorizing a man into surrendering three months' salary to placate them with trinkets, hail from a sickly society whose voracious greed ensures blindness regarding methods of procurement. Besides their industrial abrasive and conductivity properties, diamonds are non-utilitarian status symbols, in the general community only serving to make her bleary-eyed and open-thighed upon receipt.Guess that's all the utility we need.",7,0,1,24 January 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'Eternal' Shines then Dims.
","Darkness piled upon darkness, steeped in disturbing dissonance; a glutting, suffocating despair; a stultifying of the spirit and a crippling of the ego. No way out, no way outÂ no, not the movie Â my last relationship.*Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind* opens with a disoriented Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) wondering how he sustained a giant gash along the side of his car. From there, through flashbacks and flash-forwards, we gradually unveil the depressing reality that is his life Â and how his last relationship was a promise of respite from despair, but ended up merely presaging a different species of despair.After his relationship has acrimoniously soured with his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet, even more irritating than she was in *Titanic* - if that's possible), Joel discovers, through mutual friends, that she has had a scientific procedure performed that erases selective memories; while some may contend that Kate Winslet has always been walking around with a blank brain, in this case, she has just erased memories of her relationship with Joel. In a fit of righteous wrath, Joel enlists Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson - whose description of this implausible procedure sounds oddly feasible) to do the same for him: erase Clementine from his mind.With Mierzwiak's aides, Stan (Mark Ruffalo, sporting the Einstein 'bed-head' 'do) and the slimy Patrick (Elijah Wood, with a panty-stealing penchant and a lunatic giggle, seemingly intent on wiping the *audience's* memories of his cutesy hobbit mien), Joel undergoes the erasure procedure, but as his memories regress (with his body unconscious, but his dream self somehow watching and participating in this regression), his Clementine memories become less antagonistic, veering towards enjoyable and then, he realizes too late, downright 'precious.' His dream self fights against the erasure, trying to hold onto the pleasant memories, realizing that if every trace of Clementine were wiped, somehow a piece of himself would disappear also.Director Michael Gondry has captured on film one of the most ineffable human experiences Â the dream state: the feeling that everything you are experiencing is somehow sensible, yet not making sense; that you are running mightily yet making no headway; that underlying cohesion and overarching dread. Using nothing but hand-held cameras and stark lighting in some sequences (in others, utilizing disappearing sets and suddenly-changing landscapes), Gondry evokes that desperate, visceral fear that irrationally gluts our dreams. Add screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (*Being John Malkovich, Adaptation*) and the disturbing irrationality only escalates.The film's title is excerpted from a poem by Alexander Pope, 'Eloisa to Abelard,' the same poem that puppeteer John Cusack enacts in another of Charlie Kaufman's screenplays, the beatifically bizarre, *Being John Malkovich*.One cannot overstate Carrey's brilliance in this role. Watching his unshaven, haggard, insecure paragon of introversion, Joel, it is impossible to imagine an Ace Ventura careening across the screen monopolizing every oxygen atom within reach.Carrey's tastefully subdued performance is contrasted with that of Winslet's gregarious Clementine, a talkative, intrusive young woman who at first impression seems to have dropped too much acid in the nineties. When Clementine insidiously, yet forcefully seduces Joel on a train, we realize we have seen this character in cinema before: the pushy young wench who unlocks the heart of gold beneath the shy guy. But why do screenwriters believe that a talkative and obtrusive woman is somehow 'attractive' or 'spunky'? There's another term for insecure, attention-seeking, irritatingly extroverted women who suck all the energy out of a room with their rattling bicuspids Â high maintenance.Joel wants to retain the happy memories - but he's got it all backwards. It is these memories that wrench you with unquenchable longing, making you apt to do something stupid - like getting back with her. It is the bad memories Â those weak-chested churnings impotence and disrespect - that will keep you sensible enough to never call the crazy bitch again. But who wants to shoulder that unsavory burden? Just erase the lot, and you'll never have to forget regret.Before their brain-wipe, each person is required to make a cassette recording of all the aspects about their wipee they cannot stand. Due to a subplot involving Mierzwiak's infatuated, spurned secretary (Kirsten Dunst), both Joel and Clementine receive their partner's recordings to listen to, and we realize that the present-time storyline is Joel's and Clementine's *second* meeting, independent of - and unaware of - their previous relationship.And what we thought was a unique exploration of despair, coupled with repression and regression ramifications; a film which alluded to god-complexes (the doctor's command of Joel's brainwaves) and self-persecution paradoxes (Joel is a self-persecuting personality, which is why he gravitates towards women like Clementine) topples from its lofty aspirations to explore the girly-man question of whether you would re-commit to someone whom you have already discerned you cannot stand.For the sake of sating the expectations of young girls, Joel and Clementine poignantly avow their love for one another, despite the evidence of their damning testimonies on tape. Couples Being Paired is the grand device that engines 95-percent of cinema seen in America. From *Star Wars* to *Gentleman's Agreement*, from *Crocodile Dundee* to *Rock Star*, no matter the ostensible theme or subject matter of the movie, it will always boil down to the point of view of the paired couple, against all adversity. In this film, the adversity is *the couple itself*.Does this say something about the fact that true love will triumph even over mismatched personalities Â or that people will do anything to get into each other's pants? So after scaring us with faceless dream-people and nightmare corridors and potential brain damage and Â the most horrible ugliness of fall - girlfriends who won't stop talking, Eternal Sunshine ends up as just another quirky romance clothed in a Real Movie's drama suit.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,0,3,3 June 2006
Taken," TAKEN for a thrill-ride.
","Liam Neeson has always stood up for what's right (as Oskar Schindler, as Rob Roy, Michael Collins, hell, even as Qui-Gon Jinn) - but he's never been so BADASS about it.In the European production, TAKEN, Neeson is Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA operative - he calls himself a 'Preventer of Bad Things' with 'a very particular set of skills' - whose 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to France and is kidnapped by Euro slave traders for Mid-Eastern royalty and super-rich white men. And Mills comes to her rescue, kicking arse, taking names and leaving no prisoners.In short, utterly preposterous. And utterly enjoyable.And utterly Euro (written by the great Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel), meaning there seems to be little or no stinking MPAA presence; Neeson can get away with shooting bad guys in the back (without them drawing on him first), torturing bad guys (while describing how the 'U.S. outsourced these techniques'), killing ruthlessly and callously, in short, stooping to the bad guys' level to get the job done - rescue his daughter.Famke Janssen is the ex-wife, underused, Xander Berkeley is the ex-wife's rich new hubbie, also underused; ingenue Maggie Grace keeps reminding us of how much better Kristen Stewart would've fitted her role; and Leland Orser is one of Mills's CIA buddies - and he's NOT whining about anything.With TAKEN being such a hard, satisfying ride, I wouldn't be whining either.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,2,4,20 June 2009

'Burt' Munro (1899 Â 1978), whose life story was an 'inspirational movie' just waiting to happen.The tagline boasts, 'based on one hell of a true story,' justifiably it would seem, as Munro Â a fearless, free-spirited New Zealand rider who broke land speed records in his 60s - was one hell of a character.*The World's Fastest Indian* is the quixotic tale of Munro's first trek from his provincial home town of Invercargill, New Zealand, to Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats, to tilt at the land speed record in what he hopes will become The World's Fastest Indian Â his modified 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle. Reading like the archetypal Hollywood tearjerker, it is fortunate that archives of Munro interviews and riding footage still exists, to corroborate that his tale was indeed a real life template for underdog movies.As with any 'true' story, director-writer Roger Donaldson (whose resumÃ© is a laundry list of recognizable films: The Bounty, No Way Out, Cocktail, Species, Dante's Peak) composites events and characters to squeeze Munro's storied life into 127 minutes of fish out of water hell on wheels. Lifting many of the anecdotes and dialog from Munro himself (from a documentary Donaldson directed in 1973, which appears on the DVD: *Offerings to the God of Speed*), Donaldson admits to Munro's legend blurring over the years, 'There were many stories that I'd heard that just could not have been true and then there were stories that I knew to be true that were hard to believe.' Anthony Hopkins, as Munro, gives a startling performance (for his utter divergence from all things Hannibal or Uptight Butler), paying supreme tribute to Munro by burying himself in a role which is part absent-minded professor, part master mechanic, all nutjob Â the type of guy who, when told to mow his thigh-high lawn, torches it with gasoline, not through any malice, but with an ingenuousness that would somehow endear him to all he came in contact with.The able supporting cast reads like a B-Actor cameo call: Chris Williams, Bruce Greenwood, Paul Rodriguez, Christopher Lawford, and notable appearances by Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd, to further the fact that 'dirty old men need love too.' Accompanied by the Indian he worked on for decades like a lover, Munro's quest would see him paying his way across the Pacific as cook onboard a tramp steamer, using a log as a wheel when the desert highway claims his makeshift trailer, choking down a Native American's gift of powdered dog's balls for his prostate, stealing petrol from the official race supply, letting his tailpipe char his calf during a record attempt rather than stopping, battling his own ailing heart, butting heads with regulation-raunchy officials and Â the most horrible trial of all Â spending two nights in Hollywood.Was Munro such a yokel that, instead of finding a hotel in Long Beach (where he would pick up his bike from Customs the next day), he would rather trek all the way north into Hollywood for the night just to 'see film stars'? Apparently so. With scenes that read like a clunky *Crocodile Dundee*, Munro winds up at the Flamingo Sunset hotel, promptly getting ripped off by a fake flower-girl, propositioned by an old hooker and meeting a transvestite within the space of two minutes. (When I first moved to Hollywood, it took me three whole months to get taken by a small-time hustler, propositioned by a skanky hooker and befriend a she-male.) Cutting down on the weight of his bike - and against all regulations - Munro saw no need even for brakes ('I'm planning on going, not stopping') or a parachute ('I'm not planning on bailing out'). From the poverty-stricken, ascetic life he led, it was no wonder he was eternally ready to die with his boots on. If Munro had nothing else, he had balls. And plenty of 'em. Which accounts for his simple philosophy, 'You live more in five minutes on a bike like this going flat out than some people live in a lifetime.' And also accounts for the trail of bodacious, wrinkled squeeze he left in his wake (Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd).For those who believe in planetary alignments and other such nonsense, the whole solar system must have conspired to aid Burt Munro in those days leading to the 1962 Bonneville Speed Week, as fortuitous event after fortuitous event nudges him towards his goal, everyone's heart melting over Burt's cause (from competitors to race officials alike), creating a syrupy Disney contagion that seems non-believable at times, but which must have some basis in reality, as the shattered records are testament to this broke, obsessive, neighborhood nuisance becoming a living legend.Some of Munro's land speed records still stand to this day.It's a sobering thought that there must be thousands of fanatical old tinkerers out there who obsess over seemingly ridiculous, esoteric pastimes, any of which, with the right set of circumstances, could land them in history books.Burt Munro just happened to be the wrong man in the right place at the fastest time.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",7,1,3,28 July 2006
Avatar," Electra Glide in Jungle Cat Blue.
","'For the protection of the good, for destruction of evil, and for the establishment of righteousness, I come into being from age to age.' --Lord Krishna, avatar of Vishnu, The Bhagavad-Gita.Hubris. Conquest. Destruction. Hell. Humility. Harmony. Renewal. Paradise.Frank Zappa once said, 'Writing about music is like tap dancing about architecture.' And there's no way to describe James Cameron's AVATAR without a lot of tap dancing.If it weren't so serious, it would be satire. If it weren't so expensive it would be laughable. If it weren't so irresistibly watchable it would be golden trash.Ah, which hubris to talk about first? The hubris of writer-director Cameron for foisting a story as old as the hills (or at least as old as Kevin Costner) on a demographic whom he is sure has never seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, 1990 (but might be familiar with the 2009 SOUTH PARK episode, Dances With Smurfs)?; the hubris of the human race in 2154, strip-mining Pandora, a verdant moon four light years from Earth, for a mineral called 'unobtanium' (presumably named by a geologist who had no imagination on how to mine it, sell it or even think about its utility), and callously wiping out the indigenous Na'vi species to obtain it?; the hubris of Cameron utilizing his own all-new patented King-Of-The-World motion capture technology to turn real life actors (who perform the whole movie anyway in their sensored jumpsuits) into Na'vi cat-toons, Because He Can, at a cost which could wipe out hunger in at least two Third World countries?; or the hubris of we the audience by going along with Cameron's subtle demeaning of the Na'vi race by blindly taking it for granted they are so unsophisticated that they would accept an impostor into their midst whom they know is nothing more than a ventriloquial figure for a human? If the American Natives took blankets in exchange for land, I guess ALL indigenous peoples are that gullible...Speaking of ventriloquial figures, Sam Worthington (as paraplegic jar head Sully) captures that wooden acting idiom that up until now was purveyed unchallenged by Christopher Reeve as SUPERMAN. Worthington's got a great career ahead of him as a plank.Early minutes laden with exposition dialog are tiresome, as Cameron rationalizes the financially-unsound concept of military avatars - Na'vi creatures mixed with human DNA, mentally controlled by humans, mingling with the forest-dwelling Na'vi for the purposes of... something something metaphor something. Totally unnecessary, cos if the big bad military is going to forcefully strip-mine Pandora anyway, why bother snowjobbing the natives as avatars or negotiating a peaceful exodus? Sully neural-links with his ten-foot, blue-skinned cat-person through a MATRIX-like fusion of non-science, whereupon he experiences the euphoric use of his legs again. And a nice piece of tail. And if that isn't incentive enough to betray your own species, cue the sexy naked cat-chick, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) - a nice piece of tail - who, even though an alien, sports pert tennis ball ta-tas in a disturbingly anatomically-correct position on her chest, and who rides her bird-thing in a demonstrably human sexual position - and it's homo who? The tail only makes it hotter.Though Sully is with the science team, the mantastically pumped-up Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) sequesters him as a double agent, to report tactical weaknesses in the Na'vi stronghold.Sully has way too much fun being taught the Omaticaya tribe's ways by Neytiri, in a montage which screams upcoming unsafe sex scene.By the time Sully plonks Neytiri on a bed of luminous lichen, his alliance with the natives is sealed. He fights on the side of the Na'vi when Quaritch comes a-calling with his giant helicopters, and what must be spectacular coffee, for him to be sipping it constantly while in heated missile strikes.The military chop down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring, making the Na'vi wish they'd invented fire insurance.In the movie's greatest irony, Quaritch keeps calling Pandora 'hell' - when it is actually a paradise - as he BRINGS hell to Pandora with his gunships.Thereby forcing the Na'vi to stoop to human methods of warfare; in essence, 'fighting terror with terror' - because the filmmakers possess only limited 'human' imaginations, and cannot conceive of battling military might other than by making two wrongs make a right.So why bequeath this unoriginal, scientifically-contrived tale such high cucumber ratings? Because it is done with a surety of hand, a certainty of concept and a gleeful whoop of entertainment maximus. The script moves the story at such a clip we barely notice the dearth of plot and, to tell the truth, the science is adhered to more closely than most sci-fi actioners.With the undoubted impact AVATAR has on first viewing, people have dusted off one of his old sobriquets and are calling Cameron 'king of the world' once more. But which world? AVATAR's most impressive achievement is Pandora itself as an integral character; on its orbital position as a satellite of the large planet that dominates its sky; on its implied ecosystem that pulses from the screen in mind-numbing detail.The Na'vi have an intimate greeting, 'I see you,' meaning, of course, metaphorically. Not surprisingly, AVATAR opens and closes with shots of Sully's eyes opening - at the start, he wakes stupid, just a jar head on a cryogenic ride; in the final frames, he opens his eyes as a god; he is whole, wise in the ways of blue tooth, subsumed by the hive mind. He is Pandora's Jar.Making the most wondrous thing about Pandora the fact that it could actually educate a jar head.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",9,2,4,25 January 2010
Toy Story 2," Toying with our emotions.
","One of the best-reviewed sequels of all time, TOY STORY 2 continues the tale of the toys from Andy's room, adding a few characters, upping the chase ante and breaking our hearts with animated toys that are better actors than people.Cowboy Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) is stolen by Al the toy collector (Wayne Knight, still playing a blubbering fat guy - even as a cartoon!). Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) mounts a rescue mission with some of the other toys to get him back. But Woody may not want to return...Woody turns out to be a collector's item, completing Woody's Roundup Gang, comprising Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) and Woody's trusty steed, Bullseye; all awaiting shipment to a museum in Japan, making big bucks for Al.All the principals return to voice their now beloved toys: Don Rickles as cantankerous Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as pragmatic Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as twitchy Rex Dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as impatient Hamm the Piggy Bank. And the three little green aliens find a new god in Mr. Potato Head and make 'oooo' sounds at him.In their quest, the toys enter Al's toy store and separate, searching for Woody. They meet Tour Guide Barbie, who joins their quest, while Buzz's nemesis, the Evil Emperor Zurg, stalks them, and is involved in the funniest STAR WARS joke since George Lucas cast Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader.It's ironic that the TOY STORY movies are the best feature film work of Tim Allen's career, as he imbues Buzz with such vibrant personality and imbues his human roles with the personality of a puppet.Buzz runs across a whole aisle of Buzz Lightyear action figures and is entrapped by one inculcated with the Space Ranger/George W. Bush credo of Imprison First with no Habeas Corpus. The 'fake' Buzz then joins our toy friends without their knowledge, thereafter calling each toy by their obvious design: 'Lizard Man' for Rex and 'Vegetable Man' for Mr. Potato Head; Hamm asks, 'Where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz?' 'Well, Slotted Pig, they're standard issue.' Meanwhile, Al calls in a Cleaner on Woody. This sequence is remarkable, accompanied by mind-bending mood music, as the old cleaner polishes, stitches and refurbishes Woody, which is a good thing, but which ultimately removes his identity as Andy's plaything. The music is reminiscent of the best cute, magical, yet ominous themes from the Disney archives, before Disney Corp became too sanctimonious to bear.Like the original TOY STORY (1995), Pixar Studios and the genius writers-directors (John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, Lee Unkrich among others) somehow find a way to break off a piece of our hearts, as Jessie recounts the tale of her little girl owner growing up and abandoning her for interests in ponies and boys, all to the strains of Sarah McLoughlin's melancholy, nostalgic When She Loved Me. It takes us back to our own childhoods and forgotten toys and carefree feelings and young friends now grown old like ourselves. 'You never forget kids like Emily or Andy, but they forget you.' Every 40-year-old man becomes a blubbering baby. It's embarrassing.The big question on all our minds: does Woody break off his namesake in Jessie the Cowgirl, who's a loud, raucous, game lass when it comes to tickling him and enticing him to stay with the Roundup Gang (with Filthy Pete - I mean, Stinky Pete watching out of the corner of his box)? But no - Jessie actually makes puppet eyes at Buzz in the end, leaving Woody to oil his guns on Bo Peep's bloomers.When Woody faces the dilemma of choosing between being a star in Japan or returning to Andy who will one day forget him, Buzz turns the tables on him, and in a mirror image of TOY STORY, Buzz emphatically chides Woody, 'You - are - a toy!' Now tell that to us weeping 40-year-olds.",7,0,1,10 January 2011
Chariots of Fire," When the British were Kings.
","Ah yes, running in slow motion. We've all done it. To Vangelis's music from CHARIOTS OF FIRE.British film, written by Colin Welland, directed by Hugh Hudson, nominated for 7 Academy Awards, winning 4 (including Best Picture). CHARIOTS OF FIRE is based loosely on two real life British runners in the 1924 Paris Olympics, who run for very different reasons - one against anti-Semitism, one for Christianity.Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), runs to win, to prove himself above the anti-Semitism he's experienced all his life; while Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) runs to glorify his Christian god: 'To win is to honor Him' (which should make anyone trip over from laughing so hard. Even in slow motion).Movie opens at Caius College Cambridge in 1919, when fervor for The Great War (though what made it 'great' is beyond my ken) is still high in everyone's nostrils, and British supremacy was a reality in the world. Most of the British runners all meet here as students.Different people would perceive different parts of this movie as inspirational. For an athlete, the running in slow motion, the sacrifices and the winning - both Liddell and Abrahams would go on to win their respective races and bring glory to Britain; for a religious fanatic, the nutty equating of Christ with racing - Liddell gives a speech loaded with metaphor, 'committing yourself to the love of Christ - that is how you run a straight race' - demonstrably ridiculous, because Jewish Abrahams ran 'straight races' as well, metaphorically as well as literally - by committing to the love of Allah.And there are so much of Liddell's ravings and rantings and refusing to run on Sunday at the Olympics, that it turned me off the film. This real life athlete ruined a film honoring him because his character (Charleson) had to portray him as he really was - a lunatic.Liddell's life plan is to visit China as a missionary, but he puts those plans on hold to attend the Olympics, because, 'I believe that God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure.' Sure you do. Anything as an excuse to rationalize why you do something fun. After the Games, he does actually give up running to spread the disease of Christianity in China.Liddell meets with Olympic and state officials who urge him to compete in his Sunday race, 'In my day, it was king first, God after.' Liddell replies, 'God made countries, God makes kings, and the rules by which they govern.' God also makes wars. Reconcile that with your missionary work, Running Boy - oh, I forgot, missionary work IS insidious war, after all, on Other People's beliefs.This is one of those films where it is pointless speaking of the performances, which are so natural and top notch, it is no wonder CHARIOTS received so many awards: Ian Holm is Abrahams' trainer, Sir John Gielgud once again defines Spectacularly Imperious by appearing in the dictionary right next to the word, and here as a College Master. Sadly, two young American actors who were stars in their own right appear here in their last major feature film before virtually disappearing from cinema, Dennis Christopher (who made his mark as the determined young bicyclist in BREAKING AWAY, 1979) and Brad Davis (who shook our foundations in the disturbing MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, 1978).Watching both Abrahams and Liddell cheer each other on during their respective races for Britain - though both were mortal running enemies in Britain - was a joy that no religion could sully; the physicality of driving human bodies to such extremes of performance; the intricacy of cardiovascular function that fuels the human animal; the tendons, joints, muscles, bones impacting the Earth, surging forward in opposition to gravity; the wonder of the raging human adrenalin machine stretched past breaking point... If only Liddell could have understood there is a much more wondrous power than his mythical Christ - humanity.Run from the truth, Eric! Run in slow motion!--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,2,3,23 November 2009
Saw," To Die For.
","It's all about the story, innit.SAW dives into its second act in its first minute: Two men in a subterranean TRAINSPOTTING bathroom, chained by their ankles to steel pipes at opposite ends of the room. A dead man lies in a pool of blood on the floor; in his hands, a gun and microcassette player. The men find cassettes in their pockets instructing them on how to escape their plight. One of them has to kill the other...Old-school indie film-making at its best, from director-writer James Wan and co-writer, Leigh Whannell. Though ever-gorier sequels (SAW II, III, IV, V) have turned the SAW franchise into generic gore-fests, the original SAW displays a depth to its cutting edges that raises it miles above the average bear-trap nipple-twister.Through flashbacks, tape recordings, police investigations, we piece together the story that a psychopath named Jigsaw is forcing victims into impossible escape situations where, even if they survive, they will forever be scarred physically or psychologically. The last seconds of the movie reveal why Jigsaw's motivation is to give people a new appreciation of life.The two trapped men are Cary Elwes as Dr. Lawrence Gordon, and Leigh Whannell (the co-writer) as Adam. Lawrence figures out that the hacksaws supplied by Jigsaw were not to cut through their chains...Amazing first-time direction and writing from Wan and Whannell, twists aplenty, solid characters and primal screaming that rattles our ribcages. We are immersed in every frustrating, impotent moment with the trapped characters, both Elwes and Whannell pulling off some complicated emotions.Ken Leung does a great job with his detective role, but Danny Glover sleepwalks through his role as Leung's partner. As they trail the killer, they uncover other fiendishly ingenious death traps: a man who must step across broken glass to work out the combination of a safe that contains the antidote to a poison he has ingested; a man who must crawl through razor wire to escape a cage, before the timer on the door locks him in forever; and of course, Shawnee Smith in the infamous reverse-bear-trap jaw-breaker.The beauty in the simplicity of the story and the complexity of the tortures.Has anyone told Monica Potter yet that she can't act? She plays the doctor's wife - unconvincingly. Luckily, the Story comes to the rescue, making up for the less-than-exemplary performances from Potter and Glover.Pay very close attention for there are twists aplenty, the filmmakers intending a double-meaning with their title, as in: Doubt what you 'saw,' not just the bladed tool to make people toss their plastic popcorn. But that is the image that burns itself into your fear factors: in the shocking, brutal climax, Lawrence descends into madness and does the unthinkable - saws off his ankle to escape and save his wife who can't act.",8,0,1,26 December 2008
The Last Samurai," Samurai Hei
","I love sushi. I also love Toshiro Mifune. Guess that makes me a prime candidate for a samurai warrior - at least, that's all it seems to take for a Westerner in this movie to wear kamishimo and wield katana. Despite that annoyance, this film crafts a sincere portrayal of an outsider undergoing an assimilation into Samurai culture without Western disparagement or cheap stereotype satire. *The Last Samurai* is a grandiose film, sweeping, majestic, inspiring - even WITH Tom Cruise in it.The late 1800's saw Japanese businessmen convince Imperial Japan that the shogunate government advocating military rule through shogun and samurai (*bakufu*) - was fettering the country to the dark ages and hindering their financial and technological advancement. In transforming feudal Japan into a modern nation, they did, in fact, hire Westerners to train their outmoded armies in the Way of the Gun.As imbecilic as that may sound (bringing haughty Yankees into a milieu where blade technology had attained a zenith in construction and killing prowess in the hands of the samurai millennia before the Americas were a twinkle in Europe's eye), the gun did historically overrun the sword as the primary weapon of warfare in Imperial Japan.This flensing of *bakufu* came to a head during the reign of Emperor Meiji, by all accounts as naÃ¯ve, indecisive and ignorant of the best political path for his country as he is portrayed by young Shichinosuke Nakamura in this movie. From this 'historical context,' this film's plot centers around one last village of renegade samurai, led by Katsumoto (the leviathan Ken Watanabe, out-acting the movie's titular 'star' by acres), obstructing the Way of the New Government, embodied by Meiji.To combat Katsumoto's outlaws, Meiji's CEO analogues rescue a burned-out lush of a Civil War vet, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), from his Dudley Moore *Arthur* impersonations, to train their 'modern' soldiery, a conscription of weaselly, panty-wetting nerds, whose ineptitude in battle rivals that of *Star Wars* stormtroopers who trip over twigs and knock themselves unconscious when chased by Ewoks.Ergo, it is no surprise when Algren's Benny Hill-ian troops are decimated during their first battle, Algren being taken alive as Katsumoto's prisoner.Through the winter months, Algren is imprisoned by the natural isolation of the samurai village. Ostensibly to learn of his enemy's tactics, Katsumoto engages Algren in philosophical conversations, whereby Algren Â begrudgingly at first - comes to learn the Way of *Bushido*, the samurai honor code, embracing it with a passion when he finds it fills the vacuum in his guts that had turned him to the Way of Dudley Moore's Arthur. In being an American soldier, he found only shame where he thought there was honor (when ordered to kill women and children); now, in this most unlikely place Â the village of his enemy Â he is startled to find honor once more in *bushido*.It is during this powerfully moving second act that the movie simultaneously excels and fails: excels because of its quietude, its controlled passages defining Algren's recapturing of his humanity lost Â and fails because Algren becomes too adept too quickly as a samurai swordsman. There is foreshadowing that he is a marksman and like most Civil War officers, he is issued a saber, yet all it takes is one *Rocky* montage and he is besting his fencing tutor, Ujio (Hiroyuki Sanada, who bears a marked resemblance to Toshiro Mifune, so was aces in my book from the get-go Â giving Tom Cruise a beating with a *bokken* in the rain upon their first meeting only increased his net worth.)It would have been enough that Algren embrace the creed and find 'life in every breath,' but in following the Bushido For Dummies handbook and having Algren become a master swordsman in the space of one winter (and mastering the language to boot), the film ironically adopts the superior westerner stance that it fooled us into believing it was trying to avoid, thereby cheapening the lifelong devotion, dedication and discipline of true samurai.That ain't right.Vainglorious Yankee spirit triumphing once again Â from a country where any kind of dedication to a discipline is disparaged; where collective bone-laziness has created such 'time-saving' devices as the salad shooter, the leaf-blower, the workout video and exercise machines that end up as clothes racks Â THIS is the society whom we are meant to believe can send one of its flock into the heart of a millennia-aged culture and assimilate it in one winter? Turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese oh I don't THINK so.When Algren is delivered back into 'civilization,' he finds he cannot re-assimilate into the shameful *dishabille* of his own people, so allies with the samurai against his own army.Thankfully, no computer warriors were killed on the final battlefield, hence, these rambunctious scenes resembled Mel Gibson's last-of-the-HUMAN battle epics, *Braveheart*. Gloriously so.An unnecessary romance blossoms between Algren and the wife of the warrior he killed before being taken prisoner. Though it might be construed as Algren attaining such a level of respect that the warrior's widow is now considering him fresh meat (when once she considered him as smelly as a pig) the real reason is because this film sports a bankable Hollywood Man-Toy which necessitates a gratuitous romance for the chick demographic.Director Edward Zwick and writers, John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz and Zwick himself might have forged a ten-star movie had they not made Algren such a superlative warrior and then opted for Hollywood Happy Ending protocol; steering so close to immortality, then insulting us with a paint-by-numbers.Still, watching a samurai film without Toshiro Mifune is like eating sushi without fish.(Read this review unabridged at: http://www.poffysmoviemania.com/LastSamurai.html)",7,1,3,2 May 2006
Up," Two Thumbs UP.
","The madmen at Pixar once again prove themselves the best storytellers on the planet. Or off it.UP is a unique animated adventure that follows crusty retiree Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) on his adventures in trying to float his house with thousands of balloons to his dream locale.Another humbling display of Pixar's incredible grasp of story structure. How do Pixar do it? Look at their ratings record on IMDb - every major theatrical release (except CARS) scores 8/10 or above. From TOY STORY to THE INCREDIBLES to WALL-E, it is becoming boring referring to them 'batting another out of the park.' They know no other trajectory.The first section of the movie is a sad little vignette all on its own. We first meet Carl as a cute little boy, marveling at the exploits of adventurer Charles Muntz (voice of Christopher Plummer). Also a fan of Muntz, Carl's future wife, Ellie (Elie Docter), whom he Meets Cute in a dilapidated house, as she pretends to fly it to an enigmatic South American rainforest plateau called Paradise Falls. A whirlwind montage of Ellie's and Carl's lives as they marry, move into that house and try to keep ends met while still vowing to trek to Paradise Falls 'someday.' He's a balloon salesman at the zoo, while she works in the South American exhibit. Montage rushes through their married life, dark days of miscarriage, old age, and finally Ellie's death, throughout, a picture of their promised destination on the mantel seeming to recede further into childhood fantasy. It stirs simultaneous nostalgia, bereavement and regret.And it's just a cartoon! As city developers tear down everything around Carl's little house, he resolves to make his fantasy a reality. He attaches thousands of air balloons to his house, rends it from its moorings and takes to the skies, with ingenious steering and sailing mechanisms that were once merely play-acting ropes for young Ellie.Along for the ride is a plump little Asian-American boy scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who was on Carl's porch when he lifted off. It is refreshing that Pixar would create this mixed-ethnicity character, as it has always been the provenance of spoiled blond white kids (which Carl was in the opening scenes) to go on adventures such as these.En route to the Falls, Carl and Russell encounter a big exotic bird which Russell names Kevin (and continues to call it that even after it is discovered the bird is a mother), a dog named Dug with a special collar that enables him to speak (voice of co-writer-director Bob Peterson) and Muntz himself as a neurotic recluse with his pack of trained collar-speaking hounds.Using the word ingenious to describe Pixar is like using skank to describe Britney Spears - it's intrinsic; built into every detail of this production, from the logistics of Carl's balloon-powered house to Muntz's airship, to the house-airship chase through canyons, and the endearing little animation details.Characterizations are, once again, as good as you will find in any drama. Though the movie obviously has a strong kiddie demographic, Russell's pathological need to earn his badges to impress his absent father is far from the usual syrupy guff. And watch how artfully Dug's lovable character is carved out in a few seconds of screen time, through his actions, voice and content of his disjointed dialog--squirrel! This is why Pixar shames Disney when it comes to writing 'real' characters - Disney's are STILL written as naively as Amy Adams plays Giselle in ENCHANTED (2007).Pixar writing vets Pete Docter (TOY STORY, MONSTERS, INC) and Bob Peterson (FINDING NEMO) direct, with Thomas McCarthy sharing co-writing credits with them. Creating an action-adventure without overpowering the people at the heart of it.UP was recommended to me by a screenwriter as an example of the perfect execution of the screenplay form. It is. A whip-cracking put-us-in-our-place illustration of just how a story should be told, with humor, action, poignancy, and every little detail paid off--squirrel!",8,1,1,26 June 2010
Invincible," Vince-ible
","'Âreally wasn't all that good a movie Â but he looked hot in it.' - female viewer.Pretty much sums up the Mark Wahlberg vehicle, *Invincible*. Written like a Runaway ClichÃ© by Brad Gann and directed well by Ericson Core, *Invincible* is one of those 'Inspired by a True Story' films that is itself geared to inspire. Grimace. Though it is a heartfelt tribute to a Philadelphia Eagles footballer, its underdog-makes-good plot has been told once, twice, three times too often. Trouble is: if the plot IS the actual 'true story,' how do you tell it any other way? Quandary.In the mid-70s, while Sylvester Stallone shopped his invincible script set in Philadelphia, *Rocky*, a real life Philadelphia native was proving he truly was invincible. Vince Papale, a 30 year-old part-time bartender and street footballer, attended open tryouts for his lifelong football heroes, the Eagles, making it through the rigorous culling process and eventually joining the team. With Stallone's film released concurrently with Papale's unexpected rise to fame, Papale was often regarded as the real life Rocky.In *Invincible*, Mark Wahlberg is Papale, bringing the role his legitimate, street-credible, freight train demeanor. Head down, do the job. Papale's only respite from the gloom of the '75 recession is the local football game with his pub pals (a cast of familiar serial actors, from The Sopranos, NYPD Blue, Law & Order, Oz, to name a few). Times are hard. Papale's wife leaves him. His part-time teaching post is cut. His NFL favorites, the Eagles, are continually losing.Times are so hard that the Eagles bring in a new coach, Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear, in a sincere performance of an insincere hairdo), who 'shakes things up' by offering open tryouts to snare new blood for the despondent Eagles. At the urging of his pub buddies, Papale tries out Â and makes the cut. The reality must have been a thing to behold: the fact is, Papale WAS recruited by the Eagles in 1976 Â without one game of college ball under his belt - so he must have possessed some wild aptitude to shine above the engine-pit of Philly's dregs.Core shoots the movie through a beautiful, tan-hued 'tobacco' lens that lends it a vintage air Â fashions, television broadcasts, vehicles, all reeking nostalgic 70s. We can almost interchange Wahlberg here with himself in *Boogie Nights* (1997). Conceptually, Wahlberg can also do an interchange with his character in *Rock Star* (2001), another story of a commoner who rises above the pit; who follows an institution and then becomes a part of that institution. (Coincidentally, this movie, like *Rock Star*, also lavishes Ted Nugent's *Stranglehold* on the soundtrack.) Core captures Papale's isolation and subsequent adulation, all in Panoramic Formulaic. The clichÃ©s and foreshadowing are SO OBVIOUS that when we are slammed with them, we immediately feel dirty. Exhibit A: After Papale has played a few Eagles games, he visits the old neighborhood game, opting to watch from his car. One of his bitter buddies invites him to play, 'Don't know how long the Eagles might want to use you, but your friends could really use you,' and Papale declines because he 'has a game tomorrow.' His buddy rejoins the game as it starts to rain.Can you see it coming? Better, can you see it coming In The Rain? IN SLOMO? Sho'nuff, Papale steps out of his car into the rain, into the mud, into the slomo. Yes, Screenwriters and Plot Developers, this is why he's doing it - for the love. For the game. For the Boys.Exhibit B: During open tryouts, there is a closeup shot of Papale looking up at the empty bleachers, obviously contemplating what it would be like to see them packed with fans. Which means we will see this same shot in the third act - but with bleachers packed with fans. We do. In slomo, of course.Exhibit C: Throughout the movie, his friends fantasize a winning play ('Papale's at the 40, he's at the 30, the 20Â') so frequently that we can do nothing but be caveman-clubbed over the head when this Defining Moment *does* come - whether we like it or not, and whether we like it in slomo or not; majestic soundtrack icing the play and the commentator's exact calling of the play as fantasized. Thank you, Disney. No, thank YOU, Vince Papale.'He played like a guy who lived his dream Â however long it was gonna last.' I don't know about the validity of the word 'inspirational' any more. If you have the aptitude and the love for something, and if you're given the chance, and if you succeed, well, would you need to draw inspiration from movies such as *Invincible*? Your career fell into lockstep with your particular talents. Boo-hoo to anyone who says Life Is Hard.On the other hand, in not realizing your potential in any field where your talent outshines those around you, *would* you draw inspiration from this film? Or would it be a bitter, cynical viewing, whining to those around you about the fallacy of golden opportunities, while they're just trying to ogle Wahlberg's biceps? It seems the 'inspirational' element will only be gleaned by those who don't know any better. Following your dream might very well lead down a dead end, chillun, so keep it in perspective: the majestic music and the cheering crowd Â and the slomo Â would have us believe the Defining Moment was a transfiguration from bartender to god, but he just ran across a line drawn on fake grass. It's just a touchdown. He ain't curing cancer.THAT - would be Invincible.",6,0,2,6 April 2007
National Treasure," Precious Little
","An old-fashioned treasure hunt, amped with modern technological idiocy, salted with a snide dig at the political laziness of the American people coupled with a sly *j'accuse* at their insuperably asinine government.Treasure hunter Ben Gates (a characteristically mourning-faced Nicolas Cage) must steal the original Declaration of Independence before an unethical colleague (Sean Bean, whose Bad Guy coterie all wear black for convenience) steals it first. Both are after a hidden map on its back, leading to a treasure unimaginable, involving the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, and Harvey Keitel as some kind of 'cleaner' (oh, like *that's* believable!).Insipid Diane Kruger (with a very fake blond job) and ineffectual Justin Bartha are along for the joyless ride, with Jon Voight trying not so hard to convince us he didn't do this for the pay.Director Jon Turteltaub, old hand at vapid cinema (*Phenomenon* (1996), *While You Were Sleeping* (1995)), finds a moment of crystallization - when Gates quotes what he describes as the defining tenet of the Declaration: 'But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such government, and provide new guards for their future security.' Considering this movie was released in 2004, when W was busy rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, it seems obvious this message was addressed to the American populace, who somehow still couldn't throw off that despot's yoke.But Gates fails to take into account the twisted methodology written into the American Constitution that makes it almost impossible to actually perform what was so idealistically envisioned by this country's founders.Firstly, ideological tenets cannot stand against a tyrannical government that refuses to acknowledge them; that is, how do you overthrow a government intent on staying in power by any means possible, legal or otherwise? Paraphrasing Lord Acton, John Roche warns: 'It is not so much power that corrupts, as the prospect of losing power.' (*Our Undemocratic Constitution*, Sanford Levinson.)'Indeed more than one representative and senator has accompanied retirement from Congress with comments about their own frustration at the difficulty of actually getting anything done with regard to the issues that motivated them to run for public office in the first place.' (ibid.) It is simultaneously at this point in the film that it loses all integrity Â for after Gates recites this King's English (not one word lifted from anything other than the dictionary we all subscribe to, but admittedly phrased in a vernacular lost on this inbred iPod generation of gameslayers), Riley (Bartha) responds with 'I have no idea what you just said.' Gates even meditates after the recitation, 'People don't talk like that anymore.' Why? Because 'people' are Riley. They need the OBVIOUS spelled out, which Gates proceeds to do Â in lay-moron terms for the audience's benefit Â the audience being made up of more Rileys.Immediately, this supposed dunderhead Riley, goes into a detailed description of the security measures that surround the Declaration, complete with the smash-cutting visuals that this short attention span audience seems to need in order to comprehend words with over two syllables. Riley knows all the angles Â except the weakest link in the security chain Â the Preservation Room Â because we need The Hero, Gates, to do that transparent 'splaining for the benefit of the audience once again.The movie quickly degenerates to car chases, foot chases, unbelievably tenuous clues and arbitrary shooting. Factoring for inflation, all this trouble was probably for a treasure that was worth Â oh, about $2.67.During the heist, to rationalize his 'honest theft' of the document, Cage toasts, 'Here's to the men who did what was considered wrong in order to do what they knew was right.' It's scary what George W. Bush and Dick Cheney might make of that statement.",5,2,3,11 February 2007
Limitless," Full Frontal Lobity
","Bradley Cooper takes a pill that makes him even sexier. Now how is that even possible? LIMITLESS is a breezy fantasy about a shiftless writer, Eddie Morra (Cooper), who is given a mysterious pill that allows him to access 100% of his brain, instead of the usual 20%. A super-man tale (or, in the case of Cooper, a super man-tail) where the protagonist is suddenly faster, smarter, stronger; a regular Steve Austin (without the boing-oing-oing-oing sounds).The pill uninhibits his brain's retention and recall, allowing him to access any information he has ever come in contact with, even peripherally.He discovers its utility in the manliest of ways, as he talks his landlord's wife into bed after screeching at him for the rent: 'Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary; it was all bubbling up into my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information!... She didn't stand a chance.' He wasn't high, wasn't wired. Just clear. He knew what he needed to do and how to do it. On the pills, he thinks of himself as Enhanced Eddie.His social circle suddenly includes stockbrokers and Euro adventurers; his book gets written in four days; his rocket-synapsed mind allows him to explode his income tracking stock trends; income augmented by counting cards at the blackjack table. Women, cars, private jets... He wins back his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) and gets involved in a global corporate merger... And his eyes turn an even sexier shade of preternatural baby blue.But being dependent on the illegal pills (known as NZT - had to have a 'Z' for action-movie cred), supplied by his drug-dealing, murdered, ex-brother-in-law, means that when the pills run out...Movie smartly intertwines a clutch of mysterious characters that orbit Eddie, all somehow connected with the pills or their results. Robert De Niro as corporate raver Carl Van Loon; Andrew Howard as a fearsome Russian mobster; a constant tail shadowing him (Tomas Arana - not his own Enhanced man-butt); and a detective (Brian Anthony Wilson) that isn't fully convinced Eddie didn't murder his ex-brother-in-law.When Eddie's ex-wife (Anna Friel) contacts him, we learn of the full spectrum of the pill's affects, including the coming crash...When he is mugged, we see Eddie accessing his memories for old Bruce Lee films and even snippets of self-defense videos he saw in passing a store window, bringing it all to bear in a cool, studied trouncing of his assailants. That's why this film works - we want to be this guy. Even for a few moments. We'd all give up some degree of security, sanity and safety for one chance - (as Mel says in BRAVEHEART) Just One Chance - to live the life that our youth and dreams promised us. Let's face it: we'd give up almost anything to be 'the perfect version of ourselves.' Interesting to note that when Eddie wakes after his first pill wears off, he laments his unenhanced state, 'I was back.' Later, only when he gets a pill into him does he say, 'I was back,' meaning he now considers Enhanced Eddie his true self. Unwitting commentary on those who rely on Zoloft, Valium, Prozac, or any medications (from aspirin to heroin) to consider themselves able to function correctly, as their 'true selves.' LIMITLESS is a very plausible science fiction story (almost Harlan Ellison or Robert Heinlein), written by novelist Alan Glynn, directed by Neil Burger (THE ILLUSIONIST) with some nice disorienting camera tricks, good pacing and solid story twists. It never gets too dark, even when the Russians are trying to kill Eddie by 'cutting your skin at the waist and pulling it over your head. You don't die from the cuts, you die from suffocation.' But it does have a gut-punch vomit moment when a dead Russian's blood is seeping towards Eddie on the floor and he realizes that the last of the NZT is in that Russian's blood, so in a classic junkie move - he starts slurping the seepage!...Can I get a big helping of 'EUUURW!' with a side order of AIDS please?",7,0,0,13 August 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Pants Wide Open.
","Stanley Kubrick directs EYES WIDE SHUT with his pants wide open.Elegant somberness, lurid themes, disturbing visuals, foreboding music, screaming colors. And tits.Tits tits tits. Not banana teats, cow udders or raisins either, but perfectly-rounded, gently-sloped baseballs to cantaloupes. On women ivory-legged, flat-bellied, pear-buttocked, butter-smooth, hungry-lipped, not one a notch below 9. Call it art. Call it exploration of the dark side of the soul blah blah. Fact is, a magnificent portion of EYES WIDE SHUT is naked women. Simple. Kubrick 'clothes' this prurience in the mantle of filmmaking, but isn't that how all artists score bitches (from rock stars to architects)? By couching their base intentions in seeming nobility? Yet, ironically, there can be nothing nobler than desiring to procreate, yet that too is cloaked in the bait-and-switch of family-raising.But back to the naked women... Who are they and what do they want with my willy? They are the licentious consorts at the exclusive sex mansion that Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) infiltrates and then finds he can't escape.You see, Harford and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) started speculating one night about their sexual fantasies and Harford discovers, to his chagrin, that hers are more exciting, detailed and likely to happen than his, which sets him on a libidinous quest to live lewd. No matter that the couple is happily married, have a daughter and successful jobs, let the blue-balled odyssey begin...After unfulfilling encounters on the tame side of filth, a chance meeting with a friend gets Harford the secret password to the ultra-exclusive sex club for the super-desensitized. Luckily, everyone at the ritual has to dress in masks and cloaks like they're reenacting a Mozart opera, so no one knows Harford is crashing their orgy. Until the cult leader calls him out by name and asks him the password to - exit...Cruise and Kidman reunite as an on screen couple - again (DAYS OF THUNDER 1990, FAR AND AWAY 1992), this time reportedly straining their real-life marriage with the hurtful residue of their brilliant performances. Further than balls deep. Beard or not. Or maybe it was that scene with the hooligans who pass Cruise on the street and call him a faggot. (I bet those guys are STILL eating out on that.) One time too many to simply flash the frozen smile and laugh it off? The movie's opening scene is a harbinger of the territory it intends to tread: Harford, chatting to his wife Alice, walks into the bathroom where she sits on the toilet in a long, high-slit ball gown; she wipes herself with toilet paper and throws it away, chatting back nonchalantly. So innocuous, so sexy, so dirty (and all I could think of as she slinked through that party was the moist spot on her panties). Close eyes, ride it back down to calm...Movie is telling us it will unflinchingly take us through the most private moments of this couple, uncomfortably close.Written for the screen by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael, from Arthur Schnitzler's novel Traumnovelle, EYES WIDE SHUT seems to allude to that old gag, 'You think you know someone...' In other words, when entering into marriage, you should supposedly know everything about the other person; the plan is - with eyes wide open. But is that ever possible in a species that cannot read each others' thoughts? Kubrick's characteristic disturbing directorial style leaves us as disoriented as the lead character. As Harford's morals are warring within him, colors seem to fight with each other in his scenes - oranges and deep blues, ambers and ceruleans; as Harford stalks the New York sidewalk lathering himself into lust, the camera leads, then follows, moving eerily, as adrift as he is; as the couple speak in unloving tones in their marriage bedroom, the harsh lighting frays our corneas; when Harford tries to hire a cloak and mask costume, the lewd tableau he walks into (with Leelee Sobieski, Rade Sherbedgia and some Asian men) is disturbing for what it DOESN'T reveal.The password: Fidelio. The expressionless gold mask. The taxi ride to the orgy mansion: nowhere. The single repeated piano note: pling......... pling....... pling..... The ritual: the tribades, letting cloaks fall to reveal their naked perfection ('But I say unto you, That whosoever look on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.' --King James Bible. Sorry, Christians - you're all going to hell!). The warning: leave. The sex: watching, performing, feigning disinterest, but it's the focal point of existence. The cameo: Sydney Pollack? The murder: identifying the sappho who warned him. The bonus: Nicole Kidman wearing nothing but reading glasses.Okay... ride it down again.... calm... calm...In the United States, EYES WIDE SHUT is rated NC-17 (that's the poop-your-pants, highest, deadliest rating a movie can get, without being porn), not because of its disturbing themes but because it shows people engaging in the life-creating practice of sex. Censors would much rather you drank in the death-creating practice of murder. Heaven forbid we show our kids how to make love; let's show them how to kill, and then we'll blame Judas Priest for the school shootings. A movie filled brim to end with murder can only manage an R-rating in the United States. What does that say about the hypocritical, gutless, inconsistent, wrong-headed, wrong-prioritied American censors? That they're nothing but a bunch of TITS.",4,3,6,13 August 2011
Inside Man," The Heistman Cometh.
","Movie opens with Clive Owen, as Dalton Russell, in hard close-up, warning us to listen to every word he says, because he'll only say it once. (As George McFly might say, I don't think I can handle that kind of pressure.) Dalton goes on to boast of his Perfect Heist; we know he speaks truth because we are shown heist scenes inter-cut with flash-forwards of the cops getting nowhere interrogating hostages. *Inside Man*, a Spike Lee Joint, is structured so that we know the outcome during the first act Â at least, we think we do Â for there is a robbery within a robbery in this heist, and it is that secondary robbery which gets everyone's knickers knotted.With Clive Owen laying down his customary foreboding, soft-spoken Hard Guy; with Denzel Washington plying his smooth blackness, playing yet another Intelligent Cop (is that oxymoron?); with Christopher Plummer settling into one of his comfort-zone characters Â black-hearted CEO (is that tautology?); with Willem Dafoe playing it straighter than his Jesus as a SWAT captain, this movie seems all too familiar, yet director Lee and writer Russell Gewirtz exploit the symbiotic triangle of heister-hostage-heat in refreshing ways.The heisters do not seem too concerned with looting cash; the hostages are regularly interchanged with their captors (in being forced to dress like their captors, in blue jumpsuit, mask and shades, we are never sure who the true hostages or 'inside men' are); the heat Â Denzel, as Detective Frazier Â is not as ethical as most leading police characters are painted. This all culminates in a satisfying resolution which illustrates that not every heist movie has to land someone in jail to comply with MPAA hypocrisy.Amongst all the 'comfortable' leading roles, only Jodie Foster plays hard against type, doing some strange hybrid of *Ocean's Twelve* School of Smug by way of Vincent Wolf from *Pulp Fiction*, playing a kind of 'cleaner' for the super-rich, with inside connections so high and dirty that - like Austin Powers - 'Danger' is her middle name. I'm still trying to figure out how much scenery was chewed.After the heist is underway at a Manhattan bank Â with the usual scenes of cameras deactivated ingeniously, this-is-a-stick-up and we-mean-business - head CEO of the bank, Arthur Case (Plummer), enlists the aid of Madeline White (Foster) to safeguard a life-damaging secret he harbors in one of the bank's safety deposit boxes.No matter her over-the-cheese performance, it is refreshing to see a strong female character (Foster) who does NOT use sex as her social-climbing lever or power-mongering weapon, but sheer politics instead. Not that she is devoid of female wiles; there is a scene in long shot, tracking Foster walking alongside Plummer, explaining how she will aid him Â an exposition totally lost on me, as my discernment was temporarily impaired by the vision of secretariat skirt cleaving to muscled buttock and silk-tanned legs. Convent-severe and domina-disciplined, Foster comes off as dangerous all right Â but in the wrong way: not dangerous like she'll stymie your career or have you shot - dangerous like she's going to clamp your nipples too tight or grind a 5-inch spike heel into your scrotum. *Caveat homo.* Story structure then denotes that if a CEO is desperate to guard a secret, it will be that selfsame secret that the thieves are after.Amongst the thieves, stunning Kim Director, a cross between Liv Tyler and a Robinsons-May mannequin (her fifth outing with Lee, second with Washington). There is much ado made over her ample bosom. As above, I concede to paying absolutely no attention to anything else during those segments. So sue me for being a fully functioning male.Any film that alludes to three Pacino films has to be doing something right - even if what it's doing right is just mentioning those films; Frazier's sidekick, Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) cites the Michael Corleone method of disposition ('Do you renounce Satan? Â Bam!'); Dalton mockingly refers to Frazier as 'Serpico'; and Frazier throws in a reference to *Inside Man*'s granddaddy, *Dog Day Afternoon* - a self-deprecating jab, letting us know the filmmakers are well aware of how closely their pic follows Al's lead.All *Inside Man*'s characters are portrayed as intelligent (with no silly 'movie' slip-ups to drive the plot to a crime-doesn't-pay conclusion). Therefore, Dalton's mundane request for a bus and plane are taken with suspicion of stalling by Frazier, who realizes Dalton is too wily to be pulling your average Dog Day heist. (The only person who displays insurmountable stupidity is Arthur Case, whose incriminating secret could have been disposed of with a twenty-dollar paper shredder or the flush of a toilet.) The game of outguessing one another wears thin enough for the SWAT captain to take the drastic measure of storming the bank.Just the way Dalton planned itÂ Suffice to say, there are surprises in store. And note that the title is not pertaining to the hostage switcharounds, but a wry reference to Dalton's method of deluding the heat in the final scenes.Bad Guys win.And somewhere, an MPAA censor has been fired for letting this dissident message go unchecked in free Christian amerika.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,2,2,7 April 2006
Detroit Rock City," God of Blunder.
","'If you're down in the dumps - and you need sumpin that'll bring ya uuuuup... sumpin that'll bring ya uuuuup?... There's only one thing that's gonna do it for ya...' No, not this movie - go dig out your record player and spin Rock And Roll Over.Appealing to the lowest of brows, the greatest of unwashed, the saltiest of the Earth, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a quaint enough road trip Psycho Circus with a few good gags, poorly executed - yet the whole exercise is about two decades late.Named after a classic KISS song (the marauding opener from 1976's Destroyer), movie follows four shiftless teens in 1978 on their quest across the American heartland to beg, borrow or steal their way into a KISS concert in Detroit.Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews are KISS Army members (in a KISS tribute band called Mystery), who are unconvincing as KISS fans let alone as rockers, Huntington and Furlong the only ones casually nearing the condition of 'acting.' They have four tickets that Huntington's Jesus freak mother burns, leaving them desperate, yet intent on making the concert.If you had Great Expectations for the film (co-produced by Gene Simmons and 'authorized by KISS' - meaning authorized by Simmons and Stanley), then Love 'Em and Leave 'Em. Director Adam Rifkin seems able to construct good visual sequences, but doesn't go All The Way, opting for prosaic slapstick in place of comedy. Sounds like a case of... 'rock and roll pneumonia! We're gonna have to call out... the Doctor.' The opening sequence is promising, as Rifkin gives us a montage of '70's iconography that places KISS in perspective with the times. It's powerful, it's heady, it's nostalgic - and ultimately the best part of the movie, which then goes downhill like a Baby Driver.The first KISS song we hear is the first cut of 1977's Love Gun, the frenetic I Stole Your Love, a few moments later, the first song on Side Two, the title track, over the montage.How do I know all this? Full disclosure: didn't go near Google for this info; a deep, abiding knowledge of all things KISS since they decorated my bedroom walls and ceiling. But I never did scrounge up the incentive to send away for the membership paraphernalia because, as Gene's own philosophy about marriage sagely advises, if I really loved them, I didn't need a piece of paper or a jacket back-patch to Shout It Out Loud that I did.But enough about my laundry.Soundtrack is righteous '70's rock - UFO, Nugent, T-Rex, KISS, AC/DC, Bowie, Sweet, Ramones - which gives a false impression of the film's quality, because though you feel that surge of bounteous rock stardom when you hear Lizzy's Breakout or Cheap Trick's Surrender, you're still watching THIS film.Paul Stanley: 'To call it a KISS movie does it a disservice, because it does a disservice to the KISS fans, which is what it's really about.' KISS don't appear in the film until the final few minutes - and then in an annoying composite of the renowned KISS stage antics (blood, smoking guitars, fire-breathing) within one song performance, Detroit Rock City, apparently the one and only song they're going to perform tonight, as they do their closing shtick after this song - drums rise, smash guitars, etc.The most bemusing factor of this 1999 incarnation of the band is that (except for Frehley) they look exactly like their 1978 Hooligan selves. And they've dressed the stage show in '78 lighted-stairs period, which gives us that nostalgic twitch. That's The Kind Of Sugar Papa Likes (there's a deep cut for you, fans!). We just grimace at the way director Rifkin handles the concert.I can't quite figure who this movie is aimed at. Actual fans would be turned off by the wholly unconvincing performances and naÃ¯vetÃ© of the filmmakers (film hits Rock Bottom when one of the guys sneaks in backstage by carrying a kick drum with a KISS logo amongst a group of roadies - I can't even begin to deconstruct the stupidity of this scene). Fence-sitting fans are not shown enough KISS to be convinced, just pummeled with the fanaticism of the fans (who all seem to be rednecks). On YouTube, it seems this movie's fan base are those who profess to be 'not into KISS, but like the movie anyway.' There are chicks named Beth and Christine, which would mean something to even the most peripheral were-kisser. And Shannon Tweed (Playmate of the Year 1982, and Gene's squeeze) makes a cameo as a MILF hot for guys who've been pursued by Terminators and brought their pets back to life.'Well, aw yeah! We're gonna have to call out... the Firehouse!'",5,0,1,13 August 2011
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," 'Lock, Stock' comes at us with two smoking barrels
","'Right! Let's sort the buyers from the spiers, the needy from the greedy and those who love me from the ones who don'tÂ' Bacon (Jason Statham) and Eddie (Nick Moran) work a street crowd with their hot merchandise. Cops. They flee. When the film suddenly crashes into super-slomo, and a hard, street-savvy narration kicks in (Alan Ford's voice) telling us of Bacon's and Eddie's street chicanery on its last legs, we hark back to the opening of *Pulp Fiction* (where Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are dialoguing intriguingly and cooing like lovebirds over coffee in a diner one minute and in the next, suddenly viciously holding up the joint). Like *Pulp*, this Guy Ritchie-penned and Âdirected trash whore promises to be a dialog-luscious film with a rabid style all its own.It is.With a frenetic energy that few films today possess, *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels* is the work of a film-maker who remembers that movies are, first and foremost, Entertainment. Guy Ritchie is Danny Boyle (*Trainspotting, 28 Days Later*) on crank.Along with Statham and Moran, Dexter Fletcher (as Soap) and Jason Flemyng (as 'Tubby' Tommy) round out the quartet of twenty-something East End street friends who pool their cash to enter Eddie, a card-shark natural, into a life-or-death stakes card game with local gangster and porn king, 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty).Which Eddie, through Harry's cheating, promptly loses.So begins Eddie and the boys' crooked quest to deliver 'half a million knickers' to Harry before Harry's bulldog, Barry 'The Baptist' (Lenny McLean) starts claiming their digits as vig.That's the short version. In the final telling, Lock, Stock - filmed with a leached look that makes London look even stinkier and gloomier than it actually is - is a Mobius strip of black comedic robbery and nihilistic bloodletting, shot through a revolving-door of criss-crossing, cross-killing, kill-switching plots.Concurrent with our desperate hero foursome (calling them anti-heroes does not even suffice for their level of 'anti,' so let's drop the prefix and stop pretending we don't support bad guys), there are the dazed and confused marijuana farmers led by the willowy Winston (Steven Mackintosh), whom we first meet inanely arguing over locking the front gate; there are Eddie's neighbors, a gang of thieves as ruthless as they are inept, led by a chilling sadist, Dog (Frank Harper), whom we first meet as he swipes golf balls off the nose of a victim while machete-ing another hanging upside down; there is a black gang of giants led by a cockney midget with a fashion-challenged 'fro, Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), whose introduction to the story sees him setting a man on fire for insisting he change the pub television channel; then there are the two clueless, low-rent bandits (Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire) who burgle the smoking barrels of the title with plot-twisting consequences; there's Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), a merciless hit-man who is yet intent on raising his son with manners, and a hardened bar owner, JD, who shuns the maelstrom, not for want of street-cred, but because he is miles beyond mustered (played by Sting, as hard as the day he formed The Police).With a source-music soundtrack that swivels effortlessly between savage, scarring guitars to ska figures and traditional Jewish plucking, and slang so rich your ears will gain ten pounds ('not with Liberia's deficit in ya skyrocket,' 'orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong tiddly in the nuclear sub'), Lock, Stock wends its complex way to a furiously satisfying climax, twists aplenty and a final shot that will renew your faith in creative storytelling like a date with a drunk Hans Christian Andersen.This movie is a modern classic.No matter the Serious Critics denigrating style over substance, this movie - stylistic to a fault Â defiantly does not lack for substance. It is no secret that the nature of the medium is *reliant* on style, so it is as silly to say that a movie should lack 'style' as a rock band should lack 'image' Â these are the selling points of the products. Style is an integral aspect of a modern director's toolbox and Ritchie has consciously chosen to present his product this stylishly - and his cup overfloweth with substance too.Yet Ritchie's stylistic verve earns him his share of detractors, some rationally decrying the new breed of crash-cutting, shotgun storytellers, some just too slow-witted to keep up with the swagger of the Ritchies, Tarantinos and Boyles Â subsequently, there are only two ways to take this movie: either not at all, or lock, stock and two smoking barrelsÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",10,9,14,5 November 2006
The Da Vinci Code," The Gospel According to Fluke
","Christians are a gutless lot.Whenever a new fiction dares question their established fiction, they turn into the very backbiting, provincial bigots they accuse everyone else of being.The 'new' fiction is Dan Brown's novel, *The Da Vinci Code*. The 'established' fiction is *How to Murder with Impunity*, otherwise known as *Common Sense for Dummies*, aka *The Holy Bible* (the word 'holy,' as always, used in its most broad and ambiguous sense.) Through director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, Brown's fable has been demoted to Over-Hyped Hollywood Movie, bringing out the backbiters in force, which says something about the condescending attitude religious leaders harbor towards their 'sheep' (so judiciously termed), whom they do not trust to think for themselves. In order to 'save' their flock from Â who knows what they're afraid of (maybe 'independent thought')? Â and proving once again that they have absolutely no faith (that's the million dollar word, right?) in the supposedly omnipotent invisible guy they claim can do just about anything, religious leaders take it upon themselves to attempt stymieing this harmless, edge-of-boring media. Trickling this attitude down to the sheep themselves, we end up with protests and undue animosity towards free-thinkers, which of course, eventually escalates to murder and topless dancing.I have not read the book. Apparently, it's a page-turner. Or a well-marketed fad. But *The Da Vinci Code* movie - for all its touting of 'shaking the foundations of Christianity' - is just not all that compelling.Threatening to bog itself in esoteric jargon and weighted with *faux-gravitas*, this fable posits an interesting twist to that hoary tale of virgins and saviors and whores (oh my!), maintaining that Jesus took Magdalene as his wife and sired a bloodline that exists today. (I'm already feeling unholy.) Symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, sporting Vitruvian Man mane, and working from his Handbook on Furrowed Brows) and Detective Sophie Neveu (dull Audrey Tautou) find themselves embroiled in a murder frame-up which leads them on a Quest for The Holy Grail, no less (without the aid of Monty Python, who undertook The Quest 30 years ago on a smaller budget in a superior film).Pursued by Detective Fache (Jean Reno), and by a self-flagellating, Opus Dei albino monk (Paul Bettany), who kills with the blessing of the church (which is what Christianity is *all about*), Langdon and Neveu seek asylum with the old man from Scene 24, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), a Grail expert, who exposits most of the 'sacrilegious' aspects of this tale, invoking Leonardo Da Vinci, Sir Isaac Newton, The Knights Who Say Templar, the fictional Priory of Scion and the real Â though not self-flagellating Â Opus Dei order (a kind of cult within the larger cult of the Christian church).Trapped between the desire to deliver a 'summer blockbuster' and to stay true to the cerebral nature of Brown's text, Howard serves us a kind of *Columbo* episode on crank, where clues and riddles click into place like jigsaws. Though it delivers on the mystery and mental levels, the movie trips over in its execution.*The Da Vinci Code* is intriguing, yet far-fetched enough not to affect any person over the Age of Reason. Unfortunately, Christianity has no place for reason.And what most scares religious leaders is not that this world-shaking fictional 'secret' is *provable* Â exactly the opposite! The secret is itself based on 'faith'! Who is going to test Jesus for his DNA? So how can anyone prove, through documents or riddles alike, or by chopping down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring, that they are of JC's bloodline? The real life church is scared not because it believes its followers will intelligently discern that *The Da Vinci Code* is guff; it is scared because it knows its followers already have the propensity to believe inexplicable malarkey Â they've been feeding it to those followers for the past 2000 years! Lose enough followers to other religions/cults/Reason and your 'church' is demoted to merely 'cult' status (where it rightfully belongs), with no tax exemptions or impunity to fiddle with boys.Langdon cracks the final code on the strength of a fallacy. In recalling Newton's grave, he remarks that 'all the orbs were represented, but one Â the apple that inspired Newton to work out the laws of gravity.' Firstly, Newton died in 1727, before the discoveries of Neptune, Uranus and Pluto. How then could 'all' of the orbs (planets) have been represented on his tomb? Secondly, Newton's apple is an apocryphal tale. Thirdly, relating a fruit to a planet is stretching a premise to begin with; the fact that the puzzle is solved through this fatuous symbolism only further illustrates how the church can sell provincial fables from Israel as Holy Writ.As Langdon laments, 'Why couldn't Jesus be married and still be an important figure?' But instead of standing his ground on the evidence that points to the supposed 'truth' of Jesus' bloodline, Langdon folds to the gutless notion that a lie based on faith is more honorable, or more worthy, than the truth that would destroy that faith. Why are we being inculcated to believe this insanity? In a movie that trumpets its heresy, who is it trying to appeal to with its eleventh-hour recantation? In the greatest paradoxical idiocy of all, the movie's slogan entreats: 'Seek The Truth.'(Read this review unabridged at: http://www.poffysmoviemania.com/DaVinciCode.html)",6,1,3,23 July 2006
Titanic," The King Of The World meets The Bitch Of The Sea.
","Let's get one thing straight before we embark on this perilous journey into Hollywood History: the only 'truth' in this movie is that the RMS Titanic did sink in April 1912 and that Leonardo DiCaprio is prettier than Kate Winslet. Everything else in James Cameron's *Titanic* is marshmallow fancy.Movie opens in the modern Atlantic, with a Titanic salvage crew helmed by amiable Brock Lovett (sun-weathered Bill Paxton), who haul surfaceward some intriguing artifacts. 84-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) claims she was a Titanic passenger, so is brought aboard Lovett's vessel to provide information.In a cheeky foreshadowing of the breath-hammering visuals to come, Lovett's crewmate outlines Titanic's death throes, aided by computer graphics (probably the selfsame graphics that the actual movie used as storyboard for its final visuals), before Lovett asks Rose for a firsthand account of the RMS Titanic and she, in a rheumy Percodan haze, starts relating a chick flick with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.And under the chick flick, the film's main premise - a story of White Pride, sautÃ©ed in eleven million gallons of seawater.Rose's narration is the anomaly that eats at this film's verisimilitude: though we humor her spinning her tale of irrelevant romantic rhetoric, when it comes to events outside her sphere of experience (such as private meetings between the captain and crew), she relates them as if omniscient (if we are to regard all the film's action aboard Titanic as her testimony). Even the iceberg impact is comprehensively covered from all angles (from the lookouts, to the bridge, to the engine room, captain and crowd) by Rose's 'flashback.' Not bad for someone who was backseat bonking her body-shaved boy-man at the time.Rose laments that she 'doesn't even have a picture of Jack,' her steerage-class lover (Leonardo DiCaprio). Maybe that's why she remembers him as so staggeringly beautiful.It's a pity that writer-director Cameron leaned so heavily on the vapid love story as this movie's propeller, as the rest of the film is a chest-clenching stunner.The grandeur of the Royal Mail Ship Titanic is beautifully captured in its restored filmic incarnation. Costuming, characters and exterior shots are paid the utmost detail Â although it must be said that, historically at least, DiCaprio's character (Jack) was probably treading a time period more acquainted with the use of recreational drugs with his yells of 'Woooo!' from the ship's prow. His friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), didn't help with the authenticity; supplied by a casting agency specializing in Ethnic Stereotypes, Nucci is about as Italian as a Domino's Pizza, sporting the absolute worst 'Movie Italian' accent of all time Â the exact same accent my friends and I would adopt in the schoolyard when we were 'pretending to be Italian.' Winning their tickets in a card game, Jack and Fabrizio are overjoyed even in their steerage quartersÂ ÂWhilst above the water line, onto the first class decks desultorily rambles Rose (Kate Winslet) with her demanding mother (Frances Fisher), stormy fiancÃ© (Billy Zane) and luggage enough to kill three pack-elephants. Elbow-gloved and triple-corseted, she remarks via voice-over, 'To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains.' Try telling that to an African-American, honey, in your big feathery hat and frothy bloomers.Meeting Jack during a spoiled brat suicide attempt, Rose is drawn to his vagabond swagger and hairless torso, falling for idiot lines like, 'You've got a fire inside you and I'd hate to see it go out.' (George Lucas wrote that one.) The film world does not communicate 'smell.' The super-privileged have a way of 'deodorizing' themselves that is wholly alien to the super-poor. Hence, no matter how much prettier Jack is than Rose, as soon as she stood downwind of his below-decks stench, the romance would have come to an earthy halt (retching optional).Instead, Jack is invited to sup with the pinky-raisers, where he blathers about his itinerant lifestyle as if it was a blessing; living the devil-may-care bum's life of cobbling his sustenance from whatever rat-brained scheme comes along, and literally not knowing 'where he'll be sleeping the next night' may be a romantic notion if you are a successful writer or an independently wealthy traveler Â but not if you are, in fact, a REAL BUM.An ocean liner has to sink before Rose lets go of this vagrant (whilst staying in Spoiled Byoch character by selfishly hogging the one floating plank in all of the Atlantic).A well-made, mind-numbing romance this cheesy usually scores low Â but Cameron gained his points purely due to his magnificent boat-tipping.The climax of *Titanic* is a startling visualization of an historic event which no one alive on earth today saw first hand. Drawing from the latest forensic knowledge, combined with the physics of the process, Cameron places us directly on deck during his nightmare vision. We see the situation mount, from berg impact and apathy, to incredulity and ultimately panic, capturing the violent and colossal majesty of the ship breaking in half and pulling its aft section downwards vertically.The death throes of the RMS Titanic are astounding in their realism; we cannot help but compare the final scenes of *A Night To Remember*, with its wholly inaccurate, romantic portrayal of the doomed passengers aboard that black-and-white Titanic singing nobly together as their ship slipped away under them at a 45 degree angle. Not only is collective humanity never that level-headed, the physics of the sinking process was entirely ignored.With humanity onboard Cameron's boat ignobly screaming and selfishly grasping and punching and shooting and falling violently onto propeller blades, with smokestacks crushing passengers, decks splintering, cables whiplashing through foaming brine, and the final cataclysmic submersion at a vertiginous ninety-degree angle, Cameron's *Titanic* is Â titanic!If even for a brief, awe-inspiring moment in time, it's good to be the King of the World.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,8,13,27 May 2006
The Happening," Nothing Happening
","M. Night Shyamalan is a film-making genius.Okay Â that's outa the way, now to THE HAPPENING. Or - 'wha' happuhned?' In M. Night Shyamalan's latest producer-writer-director effort, people of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard suddenly start offing themselves in an epidemic eventually diagnosed as a neurotoxin spread by plants via the wind. Film follows a young couple (Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) on the run inland from the airborne toxin, wrenching intrigue and tension from every wind-tossed field and creaking tree bough they encounter. Underneath the eerie set pieces is a larger portent of a planet grown weary of its most destructive species, bringing about that species' extinction on a grand scale.Grandiose concept + morbidly inept cast = mediocre film.There are reviews aplenty on this clunker from M. Night, trying to identify the source of all the nothing; profound epistles exploring everything from M's misanthropy to the film's philosophical anomalies Â but this film's missteps are in full view of we the abused viewersÂ Misstep Number One: Mr. Night, no matter how introspective Mark Wahlberg might have seemed playing an underdog footballer (INVINCIBLE, 2006), or how hard he slammed into his detective role in THE DEPARTED (2006), he was, in essence, just playing to type Â a dumb jock and a mean dick. He has never actually been asked to 'act' before. And though I'm sure you asked him to, no one has coached him past 'concerned face' on page 7 of the Acting For Dummies Handbook.Misstep Number Two: Mr. Night, Zooey Deschanel's emotional palette runs from bland all the way to paint drying, her primo roles being ELF (2003) and THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (2005) Â need I elaborate?; whereas your movie needed a lead actress who could juxtapose pathos, terror, empathy and devotion. That's four emotions too many for zoophyte Zooey. And those constant bug eyes didn't help, nor that miscast hairdo almost as bad as Gene Simmons.John Leguizamo is sorely underused; he delivers one very powerful, tear-jerking line, 'Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!' when he must choose to forsake her in search of his wifeÂ Oh, that's right, he didn't really forsake his daughter, but entrusted her to the care of Marky and Zooey Â kinda same result thoughÂ Two character actors, Betty Buckley and Frank Collison, act eccentric circles around the lead dishrags, Buckley's screen time as an old recluse coot, genuinely eerie Â anything involving life-sized dolls sleeping in your bed as if they were real Â I feel the hairs rising on my scary bits as I write thisÂ M. Night's storytelling is still inimitable, his film-making talents still exceptional, but his leads simply haven't the nuance required for a world-girdling, life-altering Happening. Throughout the movie, we are in constant vacillation on whether we are watching 'bad acting' or whether we are just unaware of how people would realistically react in such mind-numbing situations. The irony is: an inexpressive person like Mark Wahlberg probably WOULD react so woodenly in situations where people were taking their lives all around him.Some of the extras haven't even reached page 7, and attain lofty heights of distracted apathy and leaden aloofness. Speaking of distracted, the movie opens with Marky as a science teacher. Our first thought: 'Not buying it!' Despite that, the cred levels out by showing us a quote attributed to Einstein: 'If the bee disappears, man would have four years left.' Then the movie goes in a completely different direction. Wha-? Who-? Is this M. Night Shyamalan or Ed Wood Jr.? It doesn't help that the 'villain' of the film is a microbe transported on an invisible breezeÂ Whereas Night's movies have come to signify never wasting a frame on superfluity, ideas coalescing into a fist of compelling tale-telling, in THE HAPPENING, it comes as quite an irony that ...nothing happens. Here, 'no frame wasted' means stooping to that *Gilligan's Island* staple of turning on a radio or TV and having it play exactly what is relevant to you at that moment: click on! 'The virus is affecting the northern part of the state-' click off! His foreshadowing and otherwise spectacular eye for detail comes to no fruition in this banal and obvious film. Not that I am one of those screechy Night detractors puling for 'The Twist' in every movie he cooks up, no Â I look for Night's ingenuity in the weaving of his tales. Here, his film-making ingenuity is egregiously stultified by lack of actors.Night also over-reached with his self-referential slogan: 'We've Sensed It. We've Seen the Signs. NowÂIt's Happening.' (They've just replaced tacky in the dictionary with this tagline.) One marvelous device is the ABSENCE of sound during scenes of monstrous violence Â two boys get shot point-blank and the audio is totally removed for just those murderous seconds. There is gore galore, as if Night threw up his hands and figured that if they were gonna hate my movie after all this effort, I might as well show a guy's arms torn off by lions and skyscraper workers in deadfall onto concrete.The tepid love story was inserted sideways into the plot to please some Screen writing 101 exec who wanted character arc for the sole purpose of adhering to Movie Rule Character Arc. Marky's and Zooey's estrangement and subsequent reconciliation serves no purpose whatsoever, except to make us cringe every time Zooey bugs her eyes at Marky, and Marky blandly flaps his mouth at Zooey. A mood ring on his finger inexplicably keeps changing colors, even though Marky only displays one emotion throughout the film (see page 7).One of the movie's many catch-phrases 'There are forces at work beyond our understanding,' describes how Marky's and Zooey's casting agencies got past Night's defenses.",6,0,3,25 June 2008
The Fountain," Doubtin' The Fountain
","Raving beauty, rabid camera angling and startlingly somber performances almost save this movie from its own convoluted and ambitious storyline.The trailers for *The Fountain* were extremely well done and conveyed the hero (Hugh Jackman) as traveling through time, pursuing his true love across the ages (Rachel Weisz) Â then I watched the movieÂ and I lost track of which flash-forward was which time-backward in the first flash-sidewaysÂ so I read Roger Ebert's review for a smidgen of probable comprehension and apparently, the movie is about ONE time-frame with two other 'fantasies' piggybacking off the reality of the main storyÂ.ErÂ then, uhÂ Sigh.If my description confuses you Â wait till you see the movie.Written by Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel, and directed by Aronofsky, the 'realistic' thread is the story of a scientist (Jackman) trying desperately to discover a cure for the necrotic effects of a brain tumor on his wife (Weisz). While she dies daily before his eyes, he loses his own health and sleep experimenting on apes.Weisz keeps a diary concerning some mythical Fountain of Youth, which Jackman's other characters pursue in other realities. I'm sure that the metaphors of the 'imaginary' realities are profound, but it will require more than one viewing and probably about ten viewings of the 'Making Of' reel to untangle those metaphors. The three 'realities' are linked by the two main protagonists appearing as various characters in those realities; Jackman as a conquistador, Weisz as a Spanish queen, Jackman as a shaved-headed recluse in a space-bubble Â wha-? I'm telling ya, this thing is WEIRD with a capital D.It would be easy to dismiss *The Fountain* as a failure, but then we are haunted by the fact that in misunderstanding Aronofsky's vision or depth, we'll be called ersatz reviewers and never be invited to another *Spiderman* screening. Reviewer James Berardinelli hits the perfect note in describing the film thusly: 'There's little doubt this is an ambitious effort, but one can argue that Aronofsky's vision has exceeded his ability to bring it to the screen within the allotted running time.' This cucumber concurs, Mr. Berardinelli.",5,4,7,1 May 2008
Zombieland," Fun for the whole (undead) family.
","ZOMBIELAND is no classic comedy like SHAUN OF THE DEAD (which it emulates in small snatches), but it still gives veteran zombie auteur George A. Romero a lesson in how to insert all that 'black humor' and 'satire' that he never puts into his movies yet that he is famous for.Directed by video nobody Ruben Fleischer (written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick), ZOMBIELAND also addresses a deeper theme that Romero could never envision: that of its characters running FROM zombies but running ever TOWARDS the past that they lost; the 'innocent' time before Zombieland.Surface story follows four people with guns that never run of bullets, traveling across country while trying to remain un-undead. Guns, guts and gore, hero shots, geek-gets-girl, blood-spattered undead end to end. 'Nuff said for most rednecks, and a subtle character study for normal-colored necks.Woody Harrelson brings his NATURAL BORN KILLER, as laconic cowboy loner, Tallahassee, who picks up Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus (doing such a good Michael Cera homage, I feel like beating him up for his lunch money); Emma Stone wearing enough mascara to embarrass a prostitute dressed as Jack Sparrow; and Abigail Breslin growing up on screen in front of our eyes.Once again, the 'realistic' reason behind the zombie epidemic is updated. In the '50s and '60s - radiation; the '80s and '90s - genetics; 2000s - now a virus, spawned from mad cow disease.Amber Heard cameo - not naked. Waste of skin. Bill Murray cameo, admits his one regret in life was 'GARFIELD, maybe.'",6,0,0,29 August 2010
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Fueled by Rocket SauceÂ oh, and Satan.
","To paraphrase Salieri from Amadeus, 'Displace one 'f*ck' and there would be diminishment; displace one 'suck my c*ck' and the structure would fall.' Belched forth from Satan's unholy vagina, the dynamo Jack Black and the cherubic Kyle Gass master-explode in Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, their foul mouthed vernacular so integral to the comedic fabric of this film that when the Prudies bellyache 'every second word is f*ck,' they aren't far from the truth.And that's a GOOD thing.In making the transition from the live stage and television to the big screen, Tenacious D thankfully steered into the curve and in chronicling their 'rise to power' did not bow to the corporate whiners who would try to widen this movie's demographic by softening its blows.And Tenacious D blows a lot.This movie is a road tale, a rock paean, a musical odyssey, a combo of Jesus Christ Superstar, The Who and Ren and Stimpy. A veritable Gospel According to Tenacious D.In the beginning there was Lil' JB (Troy Gentile, playing young Jack Black like electrodes attached to testicles) whose father (Meat Loaf) would not let him rock. So he petitions the master piper, Dio, for advice (just to hear Ronnie James let fly, 'Go - my - son - and - ROOOOOCK!' is worth the journey), following his dream to Venice Beach where verily he didst meet solo minstrel, KG, in a conflagration of Bach, Beethoven and Mozart. Thus - with Jack Black's rocket-fueled psycho-tenor and Kyle Gass's axe-tastic acoustic - was Tenacious D born from rock thunder and stale pizza.In contemplating how their legendary heroes could be so barbecue tasty, they notice that all - Rhoads, Van Halen, Young, Townshend - wield the same guitar pick.After The Tale of The Pick is revealed by a grizzled master of disaster (Ben Stiller) at - where else? - Guitar Center, they begin The Quest to acquire The Pick, to chase down the Creamy Rock Greatness that it promises.In a movie carved from the same black sabbatical cloth as *School of Rock*, Jack Black once again flies slam-banging, accompanied by the rock soundtrack of MY generation. It is a wonder to behold this hurricane of adrenalin, his every minute action tailored for maximum overdrive. Not since Martin & Lewis has there been a comedy duo so adroit; like Martin and Lewis, the seeming 'straight man' - Kyle Gass - is a master comedian himself, knowing his place in the matchup and lending impeccable timing to the mix. And his guitar-work is freakishly astounding.Splashy standout tracks are Kickapoo (the opener), Classico (Gass's composite arrangement of Bouree in E Minor, Fur Elise and Eine Kliene Nacht Muzik, with Black inserting as many filthy lyrics as humanly possible), Master Exploder (the metal fantasy sequence) and Beelzeboss (the final showdown with Satan, played by a very outraged, very red Dave Grohl).Though Spinal Tap was the progenitor of this genre of rock obliviousness, the lines are fast blurring between the cheese and the rock. Master Exploder scares us into realizing that the parody(Tenacious D) are actually more talented than the 'serious rockers' they spoof - this is what the Cinderellas and the Y&Ts and the Great Whites actually look and sound like! Ultimately, Master Exploder - featuring Black banshee-wailing as ominously as Ozzy or Chris Cornell - is Real Rock. Shot from the engorged penis of hell.If you were weaned on metal, if you are fueled by Satan, you'll love Pick of Destiny and find much to be amused by: from the Guitarway to Heaven (director Liam Lynch could not secure the rights from Page and Plant to actually call it the 'Stairway'), to the subscription rock magazines, to the big-talking small-fry (Kyle comporting himself around his sh*t-hole like it was a palace that 'his albums' were paying for), to the rock idol worship, to the Clockwork Orange reference, to the Power Slide from The Who's Wont Get Fooled Again (which, as any rock geek will tell you, is the most awesome moment in that song), to the fact that Stiller's rock burnout sage cites Robert Johnson as the first owner of The Pick of Destiny (very cool, considering that Johnson is regarded as the first true guitar god, the man who started rock rolling through the blues).Paying homage to their wonderboy HBO series, a wealth of familiar faces and situations appear, from the open-mic gig (with announcer Paul F. Tompkins raising ambivalence to suicidal heights), to policeman Kirk Ward, to meeting Lee and battling Satan, with a host of cameos, from Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins (doing his Rade Sherbedgia), Colin Hanks - and Sasquatch! In the most beauteous twist of all, Tenacious D's quest to worship Satan through the majesty of rock leads them to a great inner truth: that 'Satan is not in a guitar pick - he's in all our hearts.' How right they are.(Read this review unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/TenaciousDPickOfDestiny.html)",8,1,2,14 May 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Emasculation Proclamation
","Almost - but not quite - Bennifer.Idiotically tagged 'Brangelina,' the publicity-romance dream team of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie explode in popcorn bedlam in *Mr. and Mrs. Smith,* as married super spies who are unaware that each other is a spy....Real pros.Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to popcorn and die Â that's how stupid this movie treats us. Employ the two hottest people in the world and we'll just sit here and droolÂ never mind that they each have secret compartments stashed around their house, concealing weapons and money and neither of these supposed super spies ever stumbles upon the other's stashes; never mind they hired actors on both sides for their wedding because they don't have family ties and that neither of them were canny enough to discern this; never mind that when they are contracted to rub out each other we are allowed to see the WOMAN doing far more damage to the man than the other way round Â and that's meant to be 'funny'Â Never mind all that: look at those abs!...look at those ta-tas! When both their spy agencies contract each of them to coincidentally take out the same target, Mr. Smith (Pitt) steps on Mrs. Smith's (Jolie's) death trap, leading to both of them discovering each other's secret identity. Now the fun is supposed to begin. But it just gets annoying.Both try to snuff each other while subsuming their wild sexual urges towards the other. Which leads them invariably to rough sex - in a house demolished by their feuding. The sex is so good (hey, it's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) they end up banding together against both their agencies. It is the annoying lopsided battle netween the two which gives this film away as the half-baked, politically-gutless, emasculating popcorn-pleaser it tries so hard to be. And succeeds at.She rams the side of his car and keeps driving, uncaring of whether she has killed him Â now think about how incongruous that would look if the MAN was the aggressor. In the house-battle, she carries a giant automatic rifle, he uses a handgun. When she brutally smacks him to the floor, she can ask, 'Who's your daddy now?' Â yet how 'funny' would that line be if the tables were turned? Even when he *does* beat her in a basic fist fight, it somehow feels 'wrong.' But in a society that applauds equality for women, why SHOULDN'T he be allowed to kick her ass with impunity? By putting herself on his level Â an assassin aiming to kill him Â she has no recourse to call foul on anything. Yet the film-makers very consciously and carefully never show the female being bested. And when bested, in a trite, unthreatening manner. Why is emasculating a man 'funny' but derogating a woman politically incorrect? Because the asymmetry is so ingrained in our society that there would be an outcry if the female was topped in a 'masculine' manner. I've said this many times: women don't want Equality Â they want Superiority. Women seek to empower themselves at the EXPENSE of men, never to actually improve themselves on a truly 'equal' level. And the only reason men ALLOW women to be portrayed as 'superior' is because men want to curry favor TO GET INTO A WOMAN'S PANTS.That may sound even smugger than Angelina Jolie and her magical dancing ta-tas, but you can't argue with Truth.There are a few funny moments. Vince Vaughn, as Mr. Smith's assistant, does his Vince Vaughn, but most of the laughs are due to Pitt's impeccable comic timing; the incongruity of marital arguments while escaping for their lives - but again, the humor is in HIM being bested in myriad ways. She's a better driver, more tactically canny, he's cheerful instinct and she's anal planning (or should we just stop at anal Â it is, after all Angelina Jolie? - after a job, he says, 'I improvised,' she counters, 'You deviated from the plan!'); she even has more kills than him (312 to his '60s', in a scene that is analogous to a couple comparing past partners). So why is being more adept than him at everything considered 'funny'? You lost me at burning your bra.Speaking of which, in their last Butch Cassidy & Sundance sequence, his bulletproof vest covers his whole torso, hers exposes her midriff. Reason? Dunno, maybe none of the MALE assassins would think to shoot at that smooth, flat-bellied section of her body where they fantasize plucking grapes from her bellybutton with their tongues roving wetly over the smooth hairless flesh.Sexism? That's what funded this movie in the first place!!!",5,2,4,22 May 2008
The Departed," Martin Scorcese's Badfellas
","Cops who are robbers. Robbers who are cops. And a hip hop star synonymous with exposed underpants who steals the show.A welcome return to form for the premier gangster movie-maker, Martin Scorcese bats one outa the park with *The Departed*. Ferociously funny, doggedly compelling, a *tour de force* of gritty production, tightly-wound storyline, sneeringly salty language and flame-throwing acting chops. And there's Leo and Matt and Martin and Alec and Marky Mark. And Jack. All so deliciously at the top of their game that the word Oscar is bandied about this movie as profligately as it is around Sesame Street's resident Grouch. Deservedly so.Jack Nicholson is Irish mafia kingpin, Frank Costello, who opens the movie cultivating the trust of a young street kid, who grows to be Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a Massachusetts Police Officer whose loyalties lie not with law enforcement, but with his mentor, Costello. Concurrently, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a former street thug who passes his academy training with flying colors, and who also applies to the Massachusetts P.D., is rejected on the grounds that you can take the thug out of the street, but not vice versa, and is 'invited' instead to go deep undercover within Costello's mafia. Confronting Police Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), being forced to relive his checkered past, though DiCaprio mines incredible emotive shadings, that scene is definitively stolen by Mark Wahlberg, as the Cynicism juggernaut, Detective Dignam. With this film, Wahlberg comes into his own as an Actor; though his scenes are short, they are as cuttingly sweet as limes and salt rubbed into paper-cut wounds.*The Departed* quickly establishes its triangle of the gangster (Costello), his mole in the police (Sullivan), and the police mole in his outfit (Costigan) Â and then sits back and lets the plot twist, as each faction tries to untwist its knickers and weed out their respective moles.Right hand man to Costello is Mr. French (Ray Winstone, almost unrecognizable under heavy beard and faux-Boston accent Â given away by his customary Ã©lan, i.e. as tender and subtle as a crucifix nail). Under Captain Queenan is Ellerby (Alec Baldwin, in another of this movie's smallish roles that is eaten alive by its actor Â Baldwin gives Wahlberg a run for his money as comic relief scene-stealer). Amongst the battle-scarred veterans, Scorcese chose wisely to insert a 'new' beautiful face as female lead - Vera Farmiga, as police psychoanalyst, Madolyn, who moves in with Sullivan and then begins an affair with Costigan (nice!), setting up a tangential triangle which might have obscured the larger criminal drama in a lesser director's hands, but otherwise only served to verify that old saw, 'chicks dig bad guys.'Sullivan is a policeman, sure, but as a mole for Costello he is inherently a Bad Guy Â whether Madolyn knows this or not, she is drawn to his duplicity and callousness. Costigan, though also a cop, is so deep undercover that the street is rubbing off on him in ways that make Madolyn's pants-suit pants moist - once again, no medals for figuring why she prescribes him 'private therapy.' *The Departed* is unmistakably Scorcese, with all the classic Scorcese stamps; his characteristic camera moves, angles and smash-cutting; foreboding or calming source music juxtaposed over contrary visuals, and pulling a depth of performance from his actors that must take them places in their heads they never want to visit again without an attorney.Selling Leo as a hard case in Scorcese's *Gangs of New York* was mildly obtuse; here, in their third collaboration, DiCaprio is steaming with mental muscle, street smarts and a spring-wound temper that turbo-charges his screen presence like no other role he has ever attacked. Not only might it be one of *his* best performances on film, the same can be said of Nicholson, whose conniving and ruthless Costello seems always to be on the verge of either welcoming you as a brother or snapping your spine and appending a pun.Re-made from a recent Hong Kong movie *Mou gaan dou* (*Infernal Affairs*, 2002) (written by Felix Chong and Siu Fai Mak and directed by Mak and Wai Keung Lau), it is a slight annoyance that Scorcese would insult his audience by performing that patronizing surgical act of re-rendering foreign art for the Great American Unwashed; on the other hand, *The Departed* (screenplayed by William Monahan) stands extremely tall on its own merit, not exuding that alarmist *stanque* of 'remake' (*Oliver Twist*) or worse, 'bad remake' (*Fun with Dick and Jane*) or worse still, 'pointless remake' (*Psycho*).Whereas Scorcese's *Goodfellas* showed us the world through the eyes of only bad fellas, *The Departed* slews its camera over the wrong AND the right side of the law, graying the line between honor and justice and law and order with its complex layers of hypocrisy. Among thieves, among cops alike, we see honor and duplicity and lawlessness and order.The worlds are exactly the same. But the chicks dig the bad guys.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",9,0,0,6 November 2006

Still smarmy.Directed by John McTiernan (PREDATOR, 1987), with Jan de Bont as Director of Photography (a lauded action director himself now, starting with SPEED in 1994, often referred to as 'DIE HARD on a Bus'), DIE HARD became such a shorthand for action movies that pitches would start 'It's DIE HARD on a boat,' or 'DIE HARD on a plane,' until - the apocryphal story goes - some genius started his studio pitch, 'It's DIE HARD in a building'...John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop, arrives at the Nakatomi Tower skyscraper in Los Angeles, invited by his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) to attend her company's Christmas party and spend a few days ('Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs...').Meanwhile, Euro Bad Guys are sealing off the building, dispatching the perfunctory ineffectual security guards, then crashing the Nakatomi Christmas party with their automatic weapons and Euro accents.Led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman, deliciously taking big bites of cheese), we discover these terrorists are after the Nakatomi vault. Everyone hostage. Except McClane, the fate of the hostages in his wise-cracking hands.Thus is birthed McClane's own brand of Everyman, sweaty t-shirt, fly-in-the-ointment action-heroing, as he avoids capture by shimmying through Nakatomi's unfinished floors and elevator shafts, killing the terrorists one by one, throwing spanners into the Euros' plans while blowing things up.Waitaminute - this is starting to sound like 'DIE HARD in a building'...During the siege, McClane allies with a beat cop on the ground via walkie-talkie, Al (Reginald Veljohnson), who can only talk in clichÃ©s. Paul Gleason, direct from THE BREAKFAST CLUB's (1985) detention room, is Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson, and if he had his petulant way, everyone here would be in detention.Suddenly - Ellis! What a scream! Hart Bochner brings the smarm like a smarm junkie on smarm steroids, sideways-mouth, fastidious beard, waggling head, pick-up-line 'tude, smokin' ego, coked nose, coming onto McClane's wife... trying to smarm his way out of hostage situation.'I close million-dollar deals for breakfast... Hans - booby!' Ellis negotiates with McClane via walkie-talkie to stop throwing spanners and give himself up, so that the Euros can do their bad stuff in peace and everyone can go home. (Now we know the 80s loved the venetian blinds look - from movies to music videos - but in the offices at the top of Nakatomi Tower, where Ellis negotiates with Hans and McClane, there are no other buildings as tall, no other light sources higher than Nakatomi, and it is night - yet everyone in the office is COVERED in venetian blind shadows!) Ellis fails, pays the price. And Gruber's albino sidekick (Alexander Godunov) goes hell-Euro to kill McClane, as does Gruber himself, to no avail. McClane is just too slippery and his t-shirt too grubby, to be caught. We find out that Hans Gruber's takeover of Nakatomi is more prosaic than it would seem at first - they are not terrorists, just 'exceptional thieves,' going for 600 million in Negotiable Bearer Bonds - until The John McClane happens.With Beethoven's Ninth Symphony motifs running passim, DIE HARD explodes from one action sequence to the next, nary a breath in between, loaded with every action movie clichÃ© that didn't know it was an action movie clichÃ© until a decade later: the callous FBI, the ranting Police Chief, the rebel policeman flatfoot, the renegade lone cop out of his jurisdiction (is that three-clichÃ©s-in-one?), pretty orange explosions, outlandish action sequences (why must McClane take a fire hose off the roof when he could've run down the stairs with the other hostages? Stairs not good enough for Action Heroes?); the downed Bad Guy coming back to life for one last scare-thrill...Though we would not realize it at the time, this first DIE HARD was thankfully 'R'-rated, so the profanity and violence was at a premium. Though the action is all hyperbole, the offhanded swearing lends this piece a harsh reality when it comes to bad men and the Action Heroes who love to fight them - something which the makers of LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD (2007) sacrificed for a wider, younger, dumber audience.From a novel by Roderick Thorp (Nothing Lasts Forever); bet Thorp would never have guessed The John McClane would actually last forever...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,1,2,28 April 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The PC-vs-Mac wars escalate.
","Well, what did you expect? If there is such a thing as 'too many effects,' this movie has too many effects for TEN movies. Effects effects effects, for the love of God, effects. Just for the sake of effects. And then for the love of God, more effects. Stir. Vomit.Michael Bay directs TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the fantastically stupid sequel to TRANSFORMERS (2007).Writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Ehren Kruger pile unnecessary complicated backstory on unnecessary complicated backstory, piled on juggernaut computer action that makes our optic nerves jigger like topless dancers in an earthquake.Sam (Shia LeBeouf, still giving it his best Jerry Lewis meets Ben Stiller) is now in college. His girlfriend, Mikaela (Megan Fox) is still a whore (we meet her as she's lubing up, doggie kneeling over the seat of a motorbike, airbrushing the fuel tank, which I'm sure is the prescribed position to achieve the best Frank Frazetta effect). His parents are still kvetching Kevin Dunn and Julie White. And, like every nerd, his best friends are still robots from outer space.(By the way, how does Megan Fox feel, knowing that the girl who pursues Sam in college (Isabel Lucas) is hotter than her, with the same fluttering do-me eyes, the same pert breasts, the same cupid bow lips, red as a baboon vagina in estrus, arcing over nubile wet mouth? How does it make bighead Fox feel to know that spinners like her litter campuses across America? And without toe-thumbs!...) The Autobots, led by drama queen Optimus Prime (still trying to rasp like Clint Eastwood) are now aiding the American military in their battle against Decepticons (the bad robots, whom we know are bad because they're all trying to rasp like Gozer from GHOSTBUSTERS).A shred of the McGuffin from the last movie - the All-Spark crystal - becomes the McGuffin for this movie. But the writers cannily transfer the crystal's mechanics into Sam's brain (because as it is, we could hardly care less about the crystal, not that we care that much more about Sam), so HE can be the target of the Decepticons, led by a robot named The Fallen. Made even scarier by his name being an adjective.Story is structured along the same lines as a George Lucas tale (i.e. they make it up as they go along), and never have I seen a movie with so many explosions with nothing happening.Suddenly - just like the last movie, in the midst of raping our optical lobe - John Turturro as paranoid Agent Simmons again! Raises the funny level. Mildly. Then, in a movie filled with unnecessary visuals - the John Turturro buffalo shot. And I'm not saying his thonged ass is not a beautiful thing, I'm just sayin'...They're robots - shouldn't they be fighting with viruses online, rather than pushing each other? Why do they blink? How come none of them can aim? These technologically superior behemoths have Faster-Than-Light travel, targeting mechanisms and rocket launchers built into their forearms; I mean, how many rounds can they possibly fire without hitting a damn thing? Starscream is a JET with ROCKET LAUNCHERS and he can't shoot down Sam, because apparently Sam is such a good hider - amongst Egyptian huts so volatile, one bullet causes them to explode like gas stations. Guess Starscream can't keep up with the editor's lack of continuity jump cuts - oh, a nice slow motion shot of Megan's bouncing boobies - so why don't the tigerbots scour the huts and find Sam?; what is the purpose of those tiny mini-me-bots except to annoy me?; then Simmons is climbing Khafre's Pyramid near the giant Decepticon, calling a naval vessel to unleash a classified weapon on it - but why is he in the target area? Apparently so he could crack the 13-year-old mentality scrotum joke... You lost me at ophthalmologist.It is no secret this movie's target demo is 13 year old boys. But the movie makes no attempt to hide the fact that the American military are also arrested development 13-year-olds. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson reprise their roles as military guys in denial that their bullets are useless. They talk real tough to impress 13-year-old boys and keep firing.If the Transformers were not so radically detailed, I wouldn't be in so much pain. If they looked like the Hasbro toys they were inspired by, they would be cool, streamlined giant robots. Instead, the on screen designers try to melt the vitreous gel in our eyeballs with more mechanical ganglion than the human eye could possibly digest.A Blackbird jet transforms into an old geezer who insists on giving us more illogical backstory about the Original Gangstas - the Primes who came to Earth during caveman times who turned into rocks to protect a magical Spear of Destiny and then ate Little Red Riding Hood. Or something.Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron, but is resurrected with some magic dust that reconstitutes itself into the Spear of Destiny that Sam stabs into his chest. Just like Jesus, except more believable. Then he pimps his ride with some hardware from the Blackbird and conjugates the adjective robot.Isn't it great when a deus ex machina plan comes together with magic? But we can't see anything because it's all just a mash of mechanical CGI. I hope the good guys won. Megan Fox's boobies seem to be okay. That's all that matters to 13-year-old boys.",4,2,7,16 August 2011
Crazy Heart," The Dude Abides
","We meet Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) getting out of his van after a long drive, his belt buckle and fly undone; he pulls a plastic bottle out of his car and empties the pee. It's The Dude! The star of THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998) brings his Dudeness to CRAZY HEART, the tale of a country music singer-songwriter. Unlike Jeff Lebowski, Bad Blake is slightly older, slightly more talented, and slightly more confused. He's 57, he's had the hits, he's had the fame, he's played 'sick, drunk, divorced and on the run,' and he's on the road for what may be his last tour, considering he's playing bowling alleys and toilet pubs with pickup bands. Alcoholic, smoker, tail-chaser, burnout, he instinctively feels this is the road to nowhere, but meets a vivacious young female journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who turns it into his road to redemption. (Shed tear here.) CRAZY HEART is compelling for the performance of one man - Jeff Bridges. He has always been a marvel to watch, from his simplistic toyishness in TRON, to his naturalistic disarray in THE BIG LEBOWSKI to his presidential mien in THE CONTENDER; here we feel the weight of his experience and road warrior grit in a performance that leaves us amazed. There is a harsh scene where Bad tries to connect with his estranged son on the phone, which leaves us with a cold stone in our guts.Maggie Gyllenhaal, as always, brings a smile that can defeat armies and crush rainbows. As Jean, music journo for a local paper, she interviews Bad and ends up victim to his musician charisma (i.e. she beds him quicksmart, like any old groupie).The writers (director Scott Cooper, and Thomas Cobb) try to imbue Jean with a wifely charm and weigh down her character with import and a young kid, but Bad ultimately means nothing to her if she can't accept his foibles without pouting and imposing conditions on him. And she ultimately doesn't mean much to Bad either, for when she entrusts her son to him, he loses the boy during a pub stopover, his 'drinking' supposedly the cause of his inattention.Besides his Dude-ish interaction with his road manager (Paul Herman - 'Beansie' from THE SOPRANOS), there is a comical and endearing relationship between curmudgeonly bar owner Wayne (Robert Duvall) and Bad, who are such comfortable old friends that when Wayne walks into Bad's house, yelling for him to get ready for a fishing trip, upon finding Bad unconscious on the bathroom floor - a serious matter for most people - Wayne chuckles to himself, 'Not again!' and nudges Bad awake, telling him to get dressed and that he'll be waiting in the car.Eventually, after one bender too many, a car accident and a doctor's life-alert warning, Bad calls Wayne and says, 'I wanna get sober,' which is the downright most ignorant thing anybody, alcoholic or otherwise, could possibly say. Because we're all born 'sober' - you 'get' drunk! Colin Farrell is Tommy Sweet, overdosing on Too-Cool-For-School 'tude. He's an ex-member of Bad's old band, Bad's Boys, and we don't realize why Bad hates him so much at first, because he is nothing but a sweet, courteous man who never forgets to cite Bad as his mentor and the talent that started him. We realize Bad must have been simply shallowly jealous of Tommy's success away from his skirts.The musicality and synch is well done, and Bridges, Farrell and even Duvall all give voice to their own performances, carrying tunes well. Only one scene spoils the movie's musical accord. When sound checking for an arena show, Bad complains about the front-of-house sound - from the stage! Shouldn't he know better after 50 years? When soundman Bear (J. Michael Oliva) says 'The mix is good, man. You can't hear what I'm hearing out here,' Bad replies, 'You'd be surprised.' What the hell is that supposed to mean? He has a disembodied spirit self out in the FOH sound booth? How can he POSSIBLY hear the FOH mix? Why didn't the filmmakers just have him argue with the foldback engineer? If Bear is providing a FOH mix to the performers (through their foldback monitors), then Bad can complain. But Bear just said, 'out here' meaning there are two different mixes - the front-of-house mix and the stage mix.Now I'm not in any way standing up for sound engineers: all of them ARE frustrated musicians/mongoloids, and they DO - as Bad says - 'try to screw up the opening act, makes the headliner sound that much better,' but they don't do this actively. They're just too apathetic to be competent. Through a combination of jealousy, arrogance, laziness and hubris, they throw up a mix that they believe an act should sound like, usually not even marking the levels that they've set during soundcheck, so that during the actual set, it will sound different anyway. Jackasses! Still, that's no excuse for the senseless exchange between Bad and Bear.'Pick up your crazy heart and give it one more try...' The original songs are penned by T-Bone Burnett. Bad ends up writing and selling songs to Tommy Sweet, this title track being a big hit, creating much income in a time of sobriety.What to do with the cash - except create a sappy ending? 16 months after being dumped by Gyllenhaal's smile, Bad runs into her at a gig. She's got a ring on her finger. And yet, out of niceness, kindness, senility(?), he gives her a huge check he just received - to put into the bank for her kid. Maybe he's a little more civilized than me, but isn't the financial wellbeing of her kid the responsibility of the guy who put that ring on her finger?The Dude needs to get a grip on that crazy heart.",7,0,0,21 July 2011
War of the Worlds," Spielberg and Cruise: Reign of the Smugs.
","One good thing can be said about the alien attack in WAR OF THE WORLDS - at least it achieved the mission impossible of wiping that insufferable smirk off Tom Cruise's face.Steven Spielberg wields this remake of H.G. Wells' 1898 classic tale like Mel Gibson wielded his recounting of the crucified guy's passion back in 2004: everyone in the world knows the story, so Spielberg - like Gibson - neglects to put any 'story' into the movie. He doesn't even need junkets to tell the tale prior to the movie (as George Lucas wielded his STAR WARS catastrophes) - he's got a century's legacy of societal inculcation holding up his plot holes with Atlas shoulders and tripod-girded loins.From H.G. Wells' original 1898 book (with its rank scientific inaccuracies), to Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast (which caused nationwide panic), to George Byron's 1953 film (as melodramatic and goofy as any 1950s B-sci-fi thriller), to Jeff Wayne's 1978 concept album (whose opening chords were so powerfully reminiscent of Beethoven's Fifth that I used them on an intro tape for a live rock band), WAR OF THE WORLDS is embedded in what might be called our memetic consciousness (a chunk of societal inculcation, passed down generations). So Spielberg smugly rolls film and lets people Run and Scream until he runs out of budget. The End.Though Wells' story of Martians arriving in tripods and using death rays worked gangbusters during a more unsophisticated time (when delusional astronomer Percival Lowell (1855-1916) was feverishly sketching canali on Mars and speculating on its intelligent life), our current technology definitively shows there is no 'life as we know it' on the red planet, let alone a dying super civilization which might usurp Earth for their next home.To circumvent the fact that Mars is such an open book today, Spielberg and writers Josh Friedman and David Koepp opt to BURY this movie's alien invaders under the Earth, presumably for millennia, and presumably so deep that our modern equipment nor our extensive sinking of foundations would detect them. Also, there is never specific mention of 'Martians,' that term being out of fad since humans have explored so much deeper into space and envisioned so much more exotic extra-terrestrials in INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK. (Maybe they're from the even scarier planet of L-Ron-Hubbard?) Cruise is Ray Ferrier (which is irrelevant, as you'll see), a divorcÃ©e who cannot connect with his teenage son (Justin Chatwin) and whose daughter (Dakota Fanning) is precocious enough to be either a Hollywood Brat or possessed by the devil. (Where did this convention originate of ten-year-olds smarter than their 40-year-old parents?) After smugly smirking his way through twenty-five minutes of film stock, Ray witnesses a giant metal monster rise from under Chicago's concrete and start vaporizing people and buildings with its 'death ray' (sounds kooky, but there it is), effectively wiping aforementioned smirk off aforementioned huge-salaried, delusional movie star's self-satisfied mug.Cue Running and Screaming. Shortly after this, there is some Running and Screaming, with a cameo by the World's Ugliest Man (Lenny Venito), who is thankfully vaporized before the nausea starts. Oh, and did I forget to mention the Running and Screaming? Then it gets interesting. There is some shouting... then Running and Screaming. Through it all, Our Heroes never seem to Get A Clue, taking the obligatory unnecessary risks at every turn (running 200 feet to bushes to take a pee; teen son constantly rebelling against Ray, for the sake of being the rebellious teen son; driving slowly through a pack of crazy people, just asking for their car to be stolen). A plane crashes, Tim Robbins cameos as someone crazier than Tom Cruise, the American military once again get bitch-slapped by foreigners (hey - I wasn't even thinking about mentioning Dubya); there is the perfunctory 'tension-filled' scene where an alien recon arm sniffs around a basement that Ray is hiding in (same old Spielberg - it could have been an axe-murderer or a velociraptor - the conventions are there, let's use 'em) and there are lots of big orange explosions; Ray's son gets killed, then is alive at the end, and Tom Cruise does a lot of driving with his daughter born of Satan.Over 20 years ago, Spielberg gave us a message of hope - a Sagan-esque paean that there was intelligent life somewhere else in the galaxy, yearning communication with our idiot species (in fact, these WOTW 'tripods' sound suspiciously like the CLOSE ENCOUNTERS aliens with their musical air blasts) - and now he delivers this overblown ode to the guttural nature of that idiot species, showing us selfish humanity in all its gory.When Ray is captured by the tripods, he is carted about in a cage under the machine's belly. No one looks twice when an extra is sucked into the underbelly of the tripod to fuel the machine with human flesh. But when it grabs Ray, suddenly EVERYONE in the cage piles onto Ray to pull him from the maw. Why? Because he's TOM CRUISE, dummies! The opening shots of the film portends the aliens' downfall, as we see a shot of space, which transforms into microscopic bacteria, which transforms into the Earth as a drop of water on a leaf; after the aliens die of Earth viruses, the closing shot bookends the film by reverting back to the bacteria, which morph into the starry blackness of space. If only this creativity was employed in the rest of the movie",5,1,3,14 August 2011
There Will Be Blood," Bloody Awesome.
","'I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.' - Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), THERE WILL BE BLOOD.In the words of Jack's Joker, 'I like him already.' Yet I fear him like I've feared no other man. Speaking of Jokers, Daniel Day-Lewis is probably the only person on Earth who could replace Heath Ledger in a sequel to THE DARK KNIGHT and still scare the makeup off our pants.In THERE WILL BE BLOOD, as in many of his films, Day-Lewis is once again the char-blackened engine and screaming lifeblood of the movie. Without him, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's tale of a ruthless oil baron would simply be a very good movie, rather than a steel-toed boot to the groin and a good cry on the shoulder of a wild west hooker.Daniel Day-Lewis won the Best Actor Oscar 2007 for this role as Daniel Plainview, a hardworking prospector who exploits the turn-of-the-century American oil rush by buying drilling lands from uninformed homesteaders, convincing them of his good intent for their properties with a charm and duplicity like the talking snake from the King James bible, ultimately elevating himself to power so absolute that it not only teetered on the edge of madness, but dove in and sensuously rubbed madness all over its thrumming willy.A brutal accident kills one of Plainview's oil-hands, who leaves a baby, which Plainview informally adopts as his own, calling him H.W. At first we believe this shows a tender, humane side of the monstrous Plainview, but we soon realize H.W. is merely a strategic prop for Plainview's pitches to land-owners, to lull them into believing a doted-upon son signifies Plainview is a 'nice family man.' Which is farther from truth than the King James bible is from reality. When an oil-rig explosion deafens H.W., Plainview spends the whole night kneeling before the shattered rig, before visiting his son and discovering his deafness.From a novel by Upton Sinclair, with a soundtrack that threatens to beat you senseless (by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood), THERE WILL BE BLOOD is not concerned with the macro historical significance of the oil rush, only with this one amoral, irreligious sociopath whose veins flowed with the viscous black lubricant of the land, intent on keeping humanity at a distance - he never takes a wife, sends his adoptive son to a home, and a long-lost brother proves fake - to the extent that he will ultimately forget what made him strive so hard to amass a fortune he would never have the capacity to enjoy.Paul Dano plays Eli Sunday, who also sees potential in the untamed wild land and takes advantage of the simpleminded folk - but in a diametrically opposite manner to Plainview - as an evangelist. In any other movie, his flamboyant, frenetic performance would have gobbled scenery more than Matthew McConaughey in REIGN OF FIRE, and stolen the show. But there is no overshadowing Daniel Day-Lewis and his scary mustache.Not averse to faking remorse in order to secure the contract for a piece of land, Plainview 'confesses' publicly at Eli's church, to handing over H.W. to a tutor, sending him off to the city for want of patience in raising the deaf lad. Eli badgers Plainview into screaming 'I've abandoned my boy!' Later, Eli is bitchslapped by Plainview for his troubles. By movie's end, Plainview has forced Eli into 'confessing' himself that he is a false prophet and that God is a superstition - on the proviso that upon his recant, Plainview would buy land from Eli and save him from bankruptcy. One of the movie's best scenes, illustrating the shallowness of the Christian 'faith' when poverty scratches at the door.Some may say Plainview's 'descent into madness' was foreseen, but he was already there at the start of this tale; movie opens by showing us his formidable resolve to power, as he breaks his leg falling down a mine, then claws his way out to strike black gold. His soaring dollar value only heightened his ambivalence towards humanity - if that is called madness, I wanna be in that straightjacket. 'I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.' Plainview wielded unlimited power as flippantly as any man with inherent power who knows how to bend people to his will. In this story's telling, that characteristic proves to be his downfall. But we don't see his undoing unfold as - An unresolved sudden ending snaps our necks, and we wonder how to stand and exit graciously while kneeling in awe at the altar of Daniel Day-Lewis.",10,3,5,11 December 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," To Live and Die in Americana.
","TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD opens with a female narrator describing the small town she was raised in, her poetic drawl and the lilt of her language dropping us smack in 1933 Alabammy - 'recently told we had nothing to fear but fear itself' - just after the crash heralding the Great Depression; you know, the REAL Depression.From the 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Harper Lee, this movie, this tale itself, at first seems like a stream of Southern consciousness reminiscence, as we follow 10-year-old Jem (Phillip Alford) and his younger tomboy sister Scout (Mary Badham) on their daily adventures, with big-eared pal, Dill (John Megna). But MOCKINGBIRD is a crafty coming of age tale; what the kids believe to be their comforting haven - the tired town of Maycomb - turns out to have whitey fangs, and the person whom their wayward fantasies paint as a lunatic killer of children - their unseen neighbor, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) - is ultimately a mundane dark angel.Lording over the proceedings, Gregory Peck as Jem and Scout's respectable pater, Atticus Finch - wise lawyer, moral pillar, the father we all wish we had; this legendary role cementing him so powerfully as the subdued, majestic voice of reason, at times it seems like Atticus Finch is doing Gregory Peck.To the kids, Atticus is an old fogey, too timid to let Jem wield a gun like the other kids, never letting Scout fight at school - until new-found respect dawns in their eyes when Atticus shoots down a rabid dog with one shot, Sheriff Heck extolling him as the 'best shot in the county'; until Atticus represents a black man in court, the black community standing silently, poignantly, in respect for him, 'Stand up, Scout. Your daddy is passing.' The title is a metaphor for the main plot. Atticus tells his kids of the sin of killing a mockingbird. 'They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.' A person who would kill a mockingbird must be a special kind of crazy. Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), the black man whom Atticus defends, is accused of raping a white woman, and after all evidence points to the woman's father beating her, after Atticus gives a racism speech that would make Obama proud - yet Tom is convicted. 'And the all-white jury agreed.' Before Atticus can request an appeal, Tom is killed for trying to escape.Jem and Scout sit through the whole trial, their respect for their father growing as large as their disillusionment with the justice system.In what seems like a coda to the movie, Boo Radley's identity is revealed, robbing the kids of the last of their illusions. The child actors are magnificent, even outpacing the great Duvall in his first film role playing nothing more than a gentle, enigmatic mute.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is vibrant with the spirit of America - everything that made America - the intolerance and the acceptance, the killing of innocence and the crushing of human spirit; the poverty and the small towns where that poverty emanated from; and the children who would see injustice and one day work to thwart it.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,1,1,5 January 2010
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Delicious, with a hint of sour Keanu.
","In BRAM STOKER'S Dracula, Gary Oldman shows us what acting IS and Keanu Reeves shows us what acting ISN'T.We all know the concept of Dracula; it is in our - ahem - bloodstreams, but in cinema, we rarely see Dracula's origins. Director Francis Ford Coppolla opens the movie with the event that made warrior Vlad the Impaler/Count Dracule the blood-drinking psychopath he would become.In 1492, Count Dracule's wife (Winona Ryder), believing him to be dead in the Turkish wars, commits suicide. The Bishop pronounces her soul damned. Upon his return, Dracule (Oldman) renounces God and stabs a holy statue with his sword. Apparently, all you need to retrieve that elusive blood-from-a-stone is to stab it, for it gushes blood - which Dracule drinks lustily, then swears an oath that with all the powers of darkness he will return from the dead to avenge his wife. (Can't figure who he wants revenge on, since she took her own life.) Which is also educative, as we see how easy it is to come back from the dead: if you vow something supernatural with a Gary Oldman level of psychodrama - it's gonna happen! Suddenly - Keanu, as Jonathan Harker. (Uh, what's with the accent?) In 'modern times' - 1800's England - we meet the peripheral hero of Stoker's novel embodied in Theodore Logan Esquire, play-acting in a posh accent like he's attending a little girl's tea party for dolls.He leaves his virginal lover, Mina (Winona Ryder in another role, different dress) and travels to Transylvania to meet The Count (Gary Oldman in the same role, different dress) to strike a real estate deal for property in England. The Count is deliciously cordial and ominous at the same time, his shadow moving independently of his actions.He sees a picture of Mina that Harker carries and is besot with remembered love, ageless as oceans. He believes Mina is the incarnation of his lost wife and sets his black soul on reclaiming her. (This 'eternal love' aspect was inserted into Stoker's story, for the better I believe, as it adds depth to the tragic hero). After entrapping Harker in his castle (at the mercy of his three vampiric wives), The Count journeys to England to seek out Mina and cause havoc with his drinking of blood, sleeping in coffins and out-acting everyone with one wing tied behind his back.In London, while Renfield (Tom Waits) heralds Dracula's glory from within the walls of a sanitarium, Mina playfully frolics with her best friend Lucy (Sadie Frost), unaware that plans are afoot to taint Lucy's blood with disease, whilst destroying her virginity and independent thought - yes, marriage. The three men courting the libertine Lucy are Cary Elwes, Richard E. Grant and Bill Campbell. When Lucy becomes deathly pale and blood-sick long before any of the men put their tallywackers inside her, it is suspected that only a superstitious old curmudgeon can diagnose her disease, so of course they call in Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins).Van Helsing is also a vampire expert and realizes that the man-sized wolf prowling the property, the intermittent liquid nitrogen fog and the BITE-MARKS ON LUCY'S NECK means only one thing: there's someone on set who is overacting even more than him...Unfortunately for the production, Coppolla did opt to go a little cheap, shooting everything on stage sets, and though the indoor sets are as lush as blood-drenched wine, the medieval cello theme lending acres of trepidation to the shadowy palette, the fake outdoor sets are quite distracting.Oldman sells not only the horror that his bat man brings, but the tragedy of his own immortality and love lost. When he tracks down Mina amidst a throng of cityfolk, it is as if they are the only two people on the street, as he tells her, 'I have crossed oceans of time to find you.' Beyond the tactile horror of blood-drinking and stake-thumping, this Dracula is a romantic tragedy, which is not the norm with Dracula stories. Only Oldman could sell it this way. And sell it he does, in every incarnation of The Count: from his warrior Vlad the Impaler, to the Continental Count with the big hair; he sells it as the uber-romantic tousle-locked Euro bounder, and as the knuckle-twisted, fur-covered man bat.Gary Oldman's thespian talents are on such display in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula that it is simply unfair to dismiss these roles as cheesy overacting, because though he does camp it overboard, his emotional spectrum runs deeper than the worm-infested soil he snuggles in at moonset. He is, so to speak, the hammer behind the nails in the coffin.Gary Oldman is immortal.",7,4,5,16 August 2011
Con Air," Just Another Con
","Nice mullet, Nic! His pooch hairdo effectively takes attention away from his massively-developed arms and Kirk-body-oiled man-chest.Written by Scott Rosenberg (complete with every stereotype known to Western Civilization: the quiet serial killer (Steve Buscemi), the Badd Mexx (Danny Trejo), the black guy (Ving Rhames), the gigantor redneck (MC Gainey), the gopher (Dave Chappelle), the sick con who is automatically regarded as 'wrongfully jailed' simply because he's sick and a friend of the Hero (Mykelti Washington), even the obligatory fruity gay guy); Simon West directs *Con Air* with the Michael Bay Handbook on his lap.Convicts, led by an especially-maladjusted Malkovich, overrun a prisoner transport plane and Elvis comes to the rescue in the form of morose Nicolas Cage, who eventually commandeers the craft to land it ostentatiously on the Vegas strip amidst traffic.The great John Cusack is completely wasted as a Marshall pursuing the hijacked plane and bland Monica Potter has outdone herself - in a career of vapid, unconvincing roles, this is surely the best and blandest in her reel, as Nicolas Cage's wife, awaiting him in desperate ambivalence with a daughter who looks like she was cast five minutes before cameras rolled.Everyone pretends to be really Hard (even the winsome Dave Chappelle!) and there are lots and lots and lots and lots of pretty orange explosions and guys diving in slow motion while shooting big guns, but ultimately this movie is just another excuse to land Nicolas Cage in Las Vegas.So bad I accidentally grew a mullet.",4,4,9,26 April 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," When The Anchorman was Man-Anchor.
","Will Ferrell makes me laugh. I'm not afraid to say it anymore. His shamelessness knows no bounds and I, for one, salute his strangely misshapen nude torso.In 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,' Ferrell is the blowhard, brain-soft title character, in love with his own self-proclaimed legend. And why not? His veteran standing and perfect hair have made him San Diego's number one anchorman and a veritable god amongst newsfolk.Into this perfect 70s world of Men (Men who 'discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and brawn'), bringing her 'exquisite breasts!' - comes Veronica Corningstone (severely luscious Christina Applegate), aspiring anchorwoman.Of course, this is open invitation to Burgundy's all-male news team to conspicuously seduce this 'woman with a small brain; with a brain a third the size of us. It's science.' Simply by being The 70s Male, Ron's team gives us Truth In Jest: There's Field Reporter, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), muttonchop sideburns and a cock of the head to match his jaunty, bellbottomed step; Sports Desk, Champ Kind (David Koechner), cowboy-hatted, beer-swilling Man's Man, with an affinity for Ron Burgundy's 'musk'; and ambiguously-retarded Weatherman, Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell, whose way-off-script performances here and in 'Bruce Almighty' and 'The Forty-Year-Old Virgin' indeed prove his mettle as a comic, yet which doesn't excuse him from accepting the job in the remake 'for American audiences' of Ricky Gervais' comedic masterpiece, 'The Office.' That ain't right.) And there's Ron Burgundy himself - Anchorman ('I'm very important. I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany'), Jazz Flautist ('Hey, Aqualung!'), Legend ('Last time I looked in the dictionary, my name's Ron Burgundy!'). From doing shirtless barbell curls in his office to impress Veronica ('sculpting my guns'), to wailing, 'I'm in a glass cage of emotion!' when asked where he is calling from (a phone booth), Ferrell (who co-wrote the movie with director, Adam McKay) takes Burgundy on a mad joyride and abandons him somewhere between 70s chic and imbecile.Ron's team must endure the infiltration of female Veronica into their complacent All-Male world, as she steals away the heart and job of their beloved leader. Along the way, every aspect of seventies normalcy is tweaked to hyperbole, from the news team suddenly bursting into an a cappella rendition of The Starland Vocal Band's 'Afternoon Delight,' to Ron's appraisal of the 'new fad called jogging, or 'yogging' - I think the 'j' may be silent,' to hosing off Brian Fantana's almost-lethal man-fragrance, Sex Panther.The comedy hits on all levels, from the subtle (the television spots, with the News Team all looking up at the camera on cue) to the broad (Burgundy's and Veronica's love-making fantasy), to the insensate (the street battle of the Network News Teams, involving tridents, amputations and Roman gladiator man-nets). The usual suspects all cameo: Vince Vaughn (as competing Network Anchor, Wes Mantooth - after bequeathing this character name, where else can you turn?), Tim Robbins with a blond-fro (ditto with this 'do), Ben Stiller as a seedy Spanish News Anchor, Luke Wilson (whose amputations in battle cause him much annoyance), and Jack Black as a hard-ridin', hard-vengeance biker ('Did you just throw a burrito at me, Brosef?!').The dependably hilarious Fred Willard is Station Director (constantly apologizing on the phone for his son's felonies at school), who fires Ron after a practical joke by Veronica goes awry, which sees Ron unwittingly swearing at San Diego on air.So begins Ron's spiral into oblivion, wandering the streets in a hermit-beard, drunk on milk, whilst Veronica's star rises as the world's first female anchor. Ron must mine untapped reserves of Man-Reportage to rise to the occasion and come to terms with Veronica's equality. In a bear den at the San Diego Zoo, all is resolved.With its dialog generally more 'cerebral' than most SNL alumni offerings - as ridiculous as that may sound - and a cast willing to take themselves beyond the fringe for the cause, Anchorman ranks alongside A Night At The Roxbury or Wayne's World as a stupid, stupid idea that somehow entertains despite itself.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,0,1,26 February 2006
American Gangster," Smooth Criminal
","Whadaya know - Crime DOES pay! Or so it seems at the conclusion of *American Gangster*, when a career gangster and a struggling cop are laffing it up in a montage, collaborating to bring down the gangster's empire. I'll get to that subtle mismanaged message in a moment.Denzel Washington plies his smoothie-smooth smoothness as Original Gangster, Frank Lucas, simultaneously elevating the movie and ruining it. You see, the real Frank Lucas in 1968 Harlem was a devil of the streets, an iron-balled, malevolent drug boss, who ran the ghettos and 'burbs like a chinchilla-coated, pimp-fisted Hitler. Casting Denzel was less about conveying the horrifying aspect of a sociopath crime lord than it was about presenting a man-toy whom women wanted to DO as much as men wanted to BE; his velvety charm, less about repulsing people than coercing them through box office turnstiles.Russell Crowe is Lucas' nemesis, the dogged, disheveled detective, Richie Roberts, as unsophisticated and unorganized as Lucas is classy and controlled. Roberts alienated his police pals by turning in a million dollars drug cash he found on the streets, instead of swanking it amongst himself and friends. Everyone is painted as morally swingshift, only looking out for themselves; even Roberts, though he is determined to smoke out Lucas, cannot get his own house in order, as he studies for bar exams while his Movie-Convention Nagging Ex-Wife (Carla Gugino) never has a decent thing to say about his child visitations or his three-day-growth existence.Then there's Josh Brolin, struttin' leather-coated and coolly cruel through Harlem's underbelly like a kingpin himself, until it is revealed he is a dirty cop playing both sides of the street.Lucas inherits legendary Bumpy Johnson's street empire when Bumpy dies in his arms. Rather than allow the neighborhood smack to wind its way through innumerable middle men, Lucas goes straight to their Bangkok source and sets up a direct line of purchase, smuggling the heroin into the U.S. in the caskets of dead G.I.'s returning from Viet Nam. They called it the 'Cadaver Connection.' His sizzling-pure product (called Blue Magic) becomes renowned for being twice as good for half the price. Even Richie Roberts' partner succumbs to the taste. While Roberts and his ragtag team of do-gooders try to sniff out who is flooding the streets with H so good that veteran junkies are dying from its potency, Lucas is busy buying a mansion for his mama and setting up his many brothers in positions of power on the streets, a familial tactic employed by old school Italians.This movie lacks for iconic moments: *American Gangster* might be taking its cues from *The Godfather*, and may be aiming for characterization rather than shoot-em-up, but there are few magic moments that burn themselves into your brain.Ridley Scott directs excellently, but his writer (Steven Zaillian, from an article by Mark Jacobson) gives him no moments like Brando's opening monologue, or Michael proclaiming, 'It's just business, Sonny'; or Luca Brasi's tongue-tied meeting with the Godfather et al. When Lucas ironically proclaims 'This is America!' it is as far removed from Amerigo Bonasera's sincere proclamation of 'I love America' as Denzel is from Brando.Even when Denzel is quoting some of Lucas' own priceless thuggery, he is just Too Sexy-Smooth to pull off a chilling take. We are never 'horrified' by this monster of a man Â the first scene features him expressionlessly shooting a man dead who is already on fire. But it's Denzel. Lucas set up one of his initiation moments himself and the reality is disturbing: giving one of the baddest neighborhood thugs $5000 in dope and then harassing him for payment publicly, with the unswerving intent to shoot the guy as a lesson for the neighborhoodÂ The paradoxical message in *American Gangster*: obviously, the MPAA forces scriptwriters to bring gangsters to justice Â and ultimately, Lucas is caught - but the overarching message this movie sends is that life's gonna suck anyway at some point (just look at Roberts' sorry life, even being on the 'right' side of the law), so while you've got a grip on Life Â squeeze! For all it's worth. You may stay on top, but if it all falls through, you would have still lived a better life than the average bear. For didn't Lucas live miles above Roberts throughout his life? Money and cars and mansions and a Puerto Rican model for a wife. At the end, the Robin Hood of Harlem was reportedly worth more than $150 million. And then when he *did* get caught, he sang like a canary, gave up his backstreet boys and was sentenced to 70 years, out in five. I think that five years of confinement is worth 20 years of mansion living. How 'bout you? Denzel and Crowe play the final laughing scenes like a coupla buddies over beer and pizza. Why not? Lucas cut a deal finer than his Blue Magic. In real life, Roberts even became Lucas' defense attorney in the 1990s.Crime = glamour. Crime = hotness. Crime = smoothness.Now where'd I put my chinchilla fur coat?",7,0,3,6 January 2008
The Reader," Bedtime for Hitler.
","Post-Nazi West Germany. A young boy vomits on the street in a rainstorm, in Neustadt, 1958. An older woman helps him. What follows? Full frontal sex, sex and much more sex. In between reading, reading and much more reading.Well, the movie IS called THE READER, a heavy-handed, manipulative 'romance' tale that will tear-jerk those who are inclined to be that way jerked, but will infuriate others with a shred of ethics.German-born David Kross is the young boy, Michael (looking like Peter from NARNIA, with much more beaver surrounding him). Kate Winslet is the older beaver--I mean, woman, Hanna, unafraid to tap a 15-year-old for his endless spermatozoan reserves. And, apparently, his reading skills. She's a poor illiterate tram guard who relishes his knowledge of the written word - from Tintin comics to Homer epics - but keeps her illiteracy a secret from everyone.Romance protocol ensues - passionate arguments, frenzied love-making, uncomfortable silences, pathological insecurities - until Hanna and Michael go their separate ways.Years later, law student Michael witnesses the trial of six female war criminals - one of them, his beloved Hanna, a former guard at Auschwitz! She would pick out young girls for execution, but first make them read to her; even sicker than the other war criminals who just used to gas everyone.In keeping her illiteracy a secret (out of vain stupidity, it would seem), Hanna takes one for the team when she is accused of writing and signing orders for executions - something which only Michael knows she cannot do - and is sentenced to life.Fast forward to 1995, and Michael, now a mourning-faced Ralph Fiennes, decides to perk up Hanna's incarceration by reading books onto tapes for her. Hundreds of tapes, which enable Hanna to teach herself to read. Yet he refuses to visit her or return her scrawled letters. We realize he is torn between the beauteous memories of his spanking he got from her as a lad, and the ethical ambiguity of loving a ruthless Nazi.The novel by Bernard Schlink is a giant in German literature, that I presume asks many more questions about the Holocaust than screenwriter David Hare's and director Stephen Daldry's film is prepared to do. Though the film is an emotionally powerful drama, only two major profundities are explored.One is voiced by a law student regarding the scapegoating of the six female guards - which also hits the criminal Bush-Cheney administration right on its head: 'The trial of these six women is a diversion. You put them on trial, you say they were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones, because one of the victims happened to write a book. Do you know how many camps there were in Europe? People go on about, How much did everyone know? There were thousands of camps. Everyone knew! Our parents, our teachers; that isn't the question. The question is, How could you let this happen? And better, Why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?' The film's other profound strength is portraying Hanna - the heroine - as an indoctrinated Nazi. It is easy to convey Nazi amorality in soldier characters with blue eyes, SS uniforms and severe 'Cherman' accents - much more jarring when the indoctrination is manifested in a simple woman who is the love interest.Michael is shattered when he meets old Hanna (Winslet in excellent aging makeup) and finds no remorse in her, 'It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead.' Her blind ignorance furthers his mourning face, 'They had to be cleared! More were coming in!' Poetic ending: Hanna piles books on a table to attain a good height to hang herself... shouldn't we be saying, Good Riddance? Especially to someone weak-willed enough to be inculcated to war crimes with no discernment or remorse (N.B. the Ku Bush Klan: Rove, Addington, Woo, Cheney, W., Rice, Ashcroft, Wolfowitz, CIA torturers, soldier grunts who committed atrocities at Abu Ghraib, et al).Instead, tears for the beaver... because she's Kate Winslet. Movie manipulation at its best. Get the great Ralph Fiennes to cry over her and one tear-jerk fest coming right up.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,0,0,20 June 2009
Jaws," A Whale of a Tale.
","Da... dun....Da-dun...Dun-dun Dun-dun Dun-dun Dun-dun Dun-dun - toodle-oooo (those are the French horns)...When Steven Spielberg first heard John Williams's simple, ominous JAWS theme, he apparently thought it was a joke. Now who's laughing? They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Matter of fact, even this film's director, Mr. Household-Name himself, Steven Spielberg, don't make 'em like this anymore. JAWS put Spielberg into the A-Plus List. He has been trying to capture the natural ease and gutshock power of JAWS ever since.Amity Island - a great place to get eaten. A white pointer shark is terrorizing beach vacationers and Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) must battle the tourist-minded Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) to keep the beaches closed. Death in the water and death upon land (for the tourist trade) forces the town to employ a grizzled seadog, Quint (Robert Shaw), a funky marine biologist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and aquaphobic Brody to hunt the Great White down.I still cannot explain why Method acting in the 70s was so much better overall than it is in the late 2000s. Look at Brody interacting with his kids (the same interaction is captured by Spielberg in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, 1977); look at the extras, not behaving like they're one step closer to a SAG card, but behaving like hick islanders without a camera filming them; look at the snide asides between the excitable Dreyfuss, the intolerant Shaw, and the frustrated Schieder, inhabiting their characters like scales on fish.Movie deviates from Peter Benchley's book of the same name. In the book, Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife, the Brodys' class issues with the upper-class island community are prevalent, Mayor Vaughn is in deep with the Mob, and Quint dies when a rope lashed to his leg drags him under with the shark (Benchley trying for an Ahab moment?).TV writer Carl Gottlieb was brought in to tighten Benchley's screenplay (of which many drafts were rejected, according to IMDb), restructuring the longwinded book into the compelling movie we love and fear.In 1975, JAWS was not only the highest grossing film of all time (until STAR WARS would wrench that title from its fins in 1977), the head-game impact it made on the world depleted beach trade in the mid-70s; people stopped swimming for fear of sharks; untold shark television specials and documentaries were greenlighted, not to mention Peter Benchley's average novel going 'superbestseller' (was that before or after JAWS went supernova?).All on accounta Bruce - the nickname given to Spielberg's temperamental mechanical shark and the unworldliness of his dead, dead eyes and razorkill jaws.",10,2,4,13 May 2009
The Wrestler," Emotional Pounding.
","'Well I'm frustrated, outdated, I really wanna be over-rated. I'm a finder and I'm a keeper; I'm not a loser and I ain't no weeper. I got the boys to make a noise Won't ever let up - Hope it annoys you! Join the pack, feel the crack! Well now you're here - There's no way back!' -- Quiet Riot, Bang Your Head.Director Darren Aronofsky bodyslams us for a three-count with THE WRESTLER, a modern masterpiece; controlled, poignant, inspiring, funny, ultimately heart-wrenching with a Ramjet dive off the turnbuckle. All that wayward talk about Mickey Rourke winning Mr. Oscar; it's well-founded. His performance as The Wrestler is music sweet music - specifically, 1980s hair metal. Not only does he pull the shameless Oscar Moments ('I'm a broken-down piece of meat' - you've seen the trailers), he also does the most natural on screen acting since the 1970s (think: JAWS or THE EXORCIST) - and that's him in the ring, performing all his wrestling stunts himself. A triple-threat performance so remarkable *should* be rewarded - even if it's just the political hokum of the Academy Awards. THE WRESTLER opens with posters of wrestler, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke), in a montage of his glamorous, storied career, while Quiet Riot's 'Bang Your Head' slams at the soundtrack; some posters feature his watershed bout with 'The Ayatollah' at Madison Square Garden. Crash-cut to 20 years later in a lonely dressing room after an exhibition match, with Randy accepting a light pay packet (the usual managerial excuse 'Not as many people as I thought'). He is down but not out, long dyed-blond locks, long in the tooth, long past his Use By date, yet punishing his body in small matches for small pay. 'Well I'm frustrated, outdated...'With a Steadicam following so close behind him we can hear his labored breathing and count the wrinkles on his puffy, battered face, our first intimate adventure with Randy is him being locked out of his trailer (for late rent) after returning from a match, eventually sleeping in his Dodge van. Some glamour. 'I really wanna be over-rated.'Aronofsky is intent on showing us the side of this vocation farthest from the bright lights and the crowd roar, following Randy so closely we almost get a steroid high from breathing in the stank of his sweaty, bloody tights; blonding his hair, tanning his hide, doping on painkillers, buying a sweater for his estranged daughter... He makes time at a strip club with stripper, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) who - ironically - doesn't treat him like a slab of meat, and though they share a few tender moments, she forces herself to regard him as 'just a customer.' And though we know he feels for Cassidy - not least because she spends so much time rubbing her firm naked ta-tas against his brickhouse biceps in private dances - he keeps up that tough man-facade...'I'm a finder and I'm a keeper; I'm not a loser and I ain't no weeper.'Mickey Rourke has always had a body carved from unyielding rock; a background in boxing and self-abuse has brought him this wrestler's meat-muscle frame. The Wrestler IS Mickey Rourke. Though something seems very 'wrong' and misshapen about that steamtrain frame, like it is being driven by will alone and one misstep will implode it.Randy is obviously the oldest still on the circuit, yet the camaraderie of the wrestler brotherhood is apparent - backstage, they all give him the respect he has earned. But he is not fighting these young man-mountains anyway - he is battling his own failing body. 'I got the boys to make a noise; Won't ever let up - Hope it annoys you!'Wheels go into motion for a 20th Anniversary Rematch against The Ayatollah, but after an exceptionally gruesome match, Randy is felled by a heart attack and doctors warn him 'never to exert himself again.' 'But doc, I'm a professional wrestler.' 'Join the pack, feel the crack!' Faced with potential death if he steps into the ring again, Randy reassesses his stagnant life and bleak future. He tries to stomach the nostalgic sludge of a reminiscence tour, but realizes being put out to pasture and signing autographs for $8 a pop won't sustain his spirit.His day job behind a deli counter becomes intolerable (his dweeby boss denigrating him at every turn); his reconciliation with his daughter goes awry (for Randy is, in fact, a shiftless, unreliable broken down piece of meat); his uncertain courtship of stripper Cassidy falls flat, and Randy realizes that for all the battering he has taken in the ring, 'The only place I get hurt is out there.' He is a Wrestler, only alive in the ring. Neither doctors nor time nor his body nor his heart can make him stop being one. 'Well now you're here - There's no way back!'THE WRESTLER is a tragic commentary for those who chance into the insular world of stardom; we have made no place in our shallow, blitzkrieg society for them to graciously decompress. Streetfighter Jack Wilson warns Philo Beddoe in ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN: 'You're fast and you like pain. You eat it like candy. I've seen a few cases like that in my time. The more they get hurt, the more dangerous they become. But you gotta be durable, too. Real durable. Most ain't.''Bang your head!

Hancock," Upping the Ante on Anti-Heroes
","Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It'sÂ HANCOCK?! (Will Smith) Endowed with all the powers of Superman, *sans* the gay Mardi Gras jockstrap. Fighting for Truth and Justice with a massive puss on his face.HANCOCK is a 'superhero movie' only on its surface. Deeper, where emotions are torn from desires and sorrow abides like ravenous bile, HANCOCK is a misunderstood gem; an insidiously brilliant take on the pitfalls of superherodom.All humor stems from tragedy and HANCOCK is a Greek tragedy for the comicbook generation, using the superhero idiom as a launching pad for its exploration of isolation and the cavernous ache of loneliness.The tragic figure is introduced as comic Â movie opens with Hancock foiling a bank robbery by planting a getaway car on the spike of the Capitol Records building in LA, after some of the best flying and destruction scenes ever staged in CG technology.We learn that Hancock is 'the only one of his kind'; once a regular human, one day waking in a hospital with a fractured skull, no memories of his past - and super powers. With a tragic lament, 'What kind of bastard must I have been for nobody to have claimed me?' In his pocket, two tickets to the movie FRANKENSTEIN. That was eighty years agoÂ now he walks the lonely Earth, ageless, directionless, with no one to relate to, who can comprehend the ramifications of his powers or immortality.Smith plays Hancock's melancholy note-perfect, in one of the best performances of his career. He never takes the self-pity so far that we dislike Hancock, yet his plight is permanently etched into his demeanor. How can he forget for one second his alienation amongst the throng? Yes, it's funny at first: modern Los Angeles vilifies Hancock at every turn for the wholesale destruction that accompanies his heroic deeds; flying drunk with a bottle of wine; hurling a beached whale back to sea that hits a yacht; putting out a fire, then pushing in front of kids for an ice cream to cool down while half-naked; destroying property insouciantly during landings and takeoffs. The satire works because we are so inculcated with superhero lore - yet we don't see Hancock's tragedy for the same reason: our inculcation erroneously informs us the dark aspects of a superhero's life can't get any worse than the Death-Of-Parents or some X-Factor-Creating-Implausible-Powers. We never stop to consider it from the *hero's* point of view.All superheroes are alienated (from SUPERMAN to SPIDERMAN and all the X's in between) but with HANCOCK, the movie-makers plant themselves square in his stinky shoes and ask 'How would *I* feel?' You can't die, yet you can't really 'live.' You are basically moral, so you prevent some evildoing, yet whenever you act, there is puling over the damage rather than thanks for the deed. But that is the price of super deeds Â not pretty or cheap, but monumental repercussions. So you drink. You remain disheveled, you disregard all manners and protocol Â why care? No one can harm you. If you care for no one and no one cares for you, they can't even get to you through someone else. Can anyone blame you for the puss on your face? Smith is all over this character like stank on his beanie.A plot emerges when Hancock saves the life of a publicist stuck on a railway crossing, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman, as dry as a Bond martini). While most onlookers condemn Hancock for not 'flying straight up' instead of dumping Embrey upside down on another car, Embrey is so thankful, he offers to PR Hancock's image.'Don't come in too hot; don't come in too boozyÂTell the cops they're doing a good job.' Embrey suggests jail time - a totally laughable proposition for this man who can fly and stop bullets, yet which would serve as a gesture he is sincere in improving his social persona.When Hancock meets Embrey's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), something sparks and the two engage in Meaningful Looks in every scene Â we soon discoverÂ Mary is a superhero too! Hold your Roald Dahl-horses: this is not a 'twist,' this is the Greek tragedy kicking in.Mary explains: both she and Hancock are the last of 'angels, gods, now they call us superheroes' and The Rules Sez if they pair up, they do the HIGHLANDER and become mortal. For 3000 years their kind walked the Earth, diminishing as they coupled and died. (I'll refrain from the obvious gag about women killing you slowly once you commit.) Now she and Hancock have run into each other again and must make a life-decisionÂ The public miss Hancock soon enough and he is summoned from jail to foil a hostage situation, arriving in a blast of Superman fanfare, clean-shaven, in brand spanking homo superhero duds (courtesy of Embrey), looking like Wolverine. Hancock's makeover a success, the movie skews from slapstick towards its dramatic climax.Many complain over The Villain (Eddie Marsan) being vapid. True. He is only a plot tool to spur Hancock into making a fateful decision on his immortal beloved. When Hancock is shot during a robbery and hospitalized to save his life, he realizes he has been around Mary too long Â Mortality was bearing down on him - and The Villain is not the focus in the final scenes - it is whether Hancock will choose life or death. To die, having loved only a few hours in recent memory, or to live loveless forever.No matter the decision, he loses. And this, faithful superhero fan who walked into the wrong movie, is the complex funny intriguing tragic conundrum of HANCOCK.And we wonder why he's got that puss on his face. Now get that puss off yours...",7,0,2,13 July 2008
Hitch," Hitch Cock.
","This film needs a brain-frying dose of Tom Leykis (radio 'professor' with strict set of dating tenets - 'Leykis 101': 'Never spend more than $40 on dates; Three-date limit until tail; Never sleepover at your place; No gifts ever to booty calls and women you date; Do not change who you are for a woman; No weekend dates unless guaranteed sex; Your income level determines your date's level on a 1 to 10 scale Â more income = higher numberÂ').Dating guru, Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith, in customary Mr. Nice Guy gear, arguably the black Tom Hanks), runs a thriving 'consultancy' business offering advice to introverted guys on how to score A-List women. Known in hush-hush circles as The Date Doctor, his own dating life suffers a muscle cramp when he meets a lowlife scum whore (i.e. a gossip journalist) in the form of Sara (Eva Mendes, looking quite 'rumpy,' wearing a pushup bra that can't possibly be comfortable).Let me guess: they meet, they likey, they fighty, they marry. Underscoring the egregious romantic claptrapping are Hitch's 'basic principles' for dating: 'No matter what, no matter where, no matter who, any man has a chance to sweep any woman off her feet.' A strong start, but then reads like a vanilla Tom Leykis, shying from all the darker social realities like self-esteem, insecurities, financial hooks, Oedipal and Electra complexes, and cutely avoiding the fact that to 'win' this out-of-your-league woman, you have to begin with deceit (i.e. NOT being yourself).This movie's monotonous agenda is to once again push the moribund precept of Marriage Equals Happiness. No matter the disparate backgrounds of the married pair. Firstly, women 'out of your league' are never going to be your 'soul mate'; they surf shark-infested waters miles above your tiny pond. This doesn't seem to matter to Albert (Kevin James), an accountant who desires heiress, Allegra (Amber Valletta). Adhering strictly to Insufferable Romantic Movie Protocol, when a pathetic character like Albert exclaims his 'love' for a woman he's never met, we are meant to believe wholeheartedly and goodsomely in his sincerity, as Hitch does. Snappily written by Kevin Bisch (placing words in the lead chick's mouth way too witty for a real life woman to ever utter during a pick up), adequately directed by Andy Tennant, there are actually two laugh-out-loud moments in Hitch, both surprisingly involving Kevin James (whose long-running sitcom, *The King of Queens* is about twice as funny as *Everybody Loves Raymond* - which means it isn't funny at all): there's something inherently disturbing about a Fat Man-Dance, and James milks it like prize-winning cow-teats ('The q-tip, the q-tip, throw it away'); and scrunch your lips in sympathetic fervor when Smith teaches James how to lean in for a First Kiss ('Go 90-percent and wait for her to come the other 10-percent').Hitch (his name cunningly allusive to 'getting hitched' - and he's a confirmed bachelor, get it? - That's almost as ironic as *The King of Queens*) eventually recants his 'basic principles,' even though the whole movie has been based on them: 'If she jangles her keys she's interested,' 'Women relate dancing to sex,' 'Treat it mean, keep it keen' (that last one is not one of Hitch's; it's one of mine, but you can have it *gratis*). There is the standard man-hating chick-whining (once again, the female double standard allowing Sara to get away with kneeing a man in the groin Â with no repercussions) and the usual misogyny-disguised-as-thoughtfulness ('Of course she's going to lie to you Â she doesn't want to hurt your feelings') Â but the movie ultimately preaches to both its choirs. And, of course, there's the gay friend (simply for the audience to laugh at for being gay).Ask any Southern Californian Â they'll tell you the REAL Date Doctor is Tom Leykis.",5,0,0,5 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Force-ing A Point: How George Lucas Fooled All Of The People All Of The Time.
","Revenge Of The Sith is darker than other Star Wars episodes in the sense that 'Scooby Doo Meets Dracula' is darker than 'Scooby Doo Meets the Harlem Globetrotters'.George Lucas, still has not learned that 'more' is not 'better', just 'more annoying'; STILL throwing everything he possibly can at us, in the hopes that we won't notice his inadequacies. Ultimately, his ploy is working, for he has fooled a lot of the people a lot of the time. It's HIS world Â we're just buying the merchandise.Lucas is not so much interested in creating an admirable movie experience, as he is in cross-marketing his CGI product for video games, action figures, ring-tones and thrill-rides; whilst simultaneously publicizing his remarkable suite of computer tools, via the distribution of this deplorable excuse for a 'finished' film. As to its 'unfinished' aspects: plot line, character arc, motivation, dialog Â none of which is rendered with any clarity. It is HALF a movie Â the computer parts have been finished Â they look great, thanks! Â but did someone lose the rushes with the cogent elements of Anakin (Hayden Christensen) Skywalker's 'descent into darkness' that all the press releases harp on about? One minute he's doing his usual unconvincing whining - this time about a 'vision' of his wife's death, not even her REAL death - the next, he's bowing down before Palpatine and being called Darth Vader. I laughed out loud as my mind attempted to yoke the mantle of THAT NAME on this STRAWBERRY-BLOND CRYBABY. (By the way, for the sake of anyone who has been misled by the press releases or startling special effects: Christensen's acting still STINKS.) The storyline for this movie seems to have been written in the press releases, rather than into the movie. There is no legitimate concatenation of dire circumstances pervasive enough to elicit Anakin's bodyswerve to the Dark Side. That's point one. Space, and consideration that my readers all have REAL LIVES to get back to, prohibits me from outlining the thousands of faux pas and inconsistencies in this visually-overwrought and ultimately soul-less excursion.George took a leaf from Mel Gibson's book: In Passion Of The Christ, the bulk of the earth's population is in on the gag, so film-maker Mel did not need to burden his movie with silly facets like exposition, character development, or motivation, for the mythology of Jesus is embedded in humanity's consciousness. So too, George, arrogantly and somewhat correctly, believes that enough of humanity has been inculcated with *his* mythology to allow Episode III to also stand alone WITHOUT any of the above facets. We've walked into this movie after being thoroughly drenched in press junkets and fan gossip, which 'joins the dots' *for* us, so instead of giving us REAL motivation for Anakin's fall from grace, the void of exposition and development is land-filled with searing eye-candy.'It's a trap!' In Episode I, Darth Maul had a double-sided Lightsaber, so in Episode III, in deference to George's credo (More Is Better), General Grievous must necessarily joust with FOUR Lightsabers - eliminating any chance that the human eye could possibly track the action on screen. The dogfights and ground battles have become so detailed and overloaded with imagery that they've become meaningless, eliciting no tension, or even enjoyment, as your pupils are exerted to the point of exhaustion just trying to discern exactly which way is up, let alone who just blasted what.It's a trap which the video game-wielding generation have fallen for, joystick, wire and screen-pixel.And amidst all these glorious computer-woven dreamscapes, Lucas has lost the plot of WHO the story of Star Wars is really about: first, it was about Luke, the boy-child hero awaiting his transition into manhood; turn our backs for one movie and suddenly Han Solo has all the best lines and is looking ruggedly more do-able than that farmboy from the last film; a couple more years and we're suddenly witnessing a character arc of Â Darth Frickin Vader?... whilst that forgotten farmboy and rogue are frolicking an emerald forest getting it on with mounds of sentient carpet called Ewoks. Twenty years later, George even reneges on his own created dogma and springs us with the specious assertion that 'The Force' itself has NOTHING to do with 'mysticism' or 'spirituality', but is a mathematically-calculable physical manifestation in the bloodstream called 'midi-chlorians' Â Christ, George! We waited 20 years for THIS malarky? Episode II saw Yoda go medieval, whilst Obi-Wan and Anakin were relegated to bodyguard roles (we also learned that 'padawan' is an old Jedi translation which means 'whining bee-atch'). Now comes Episode III and George, with a completely straight face, has the gall to tell the world that the story of Star Wars Compleat is, and always was, the tale of how Darth Vader came to wear such tight black trousers.And I'm not buying it.George is 'making it up as he goes along' - evidenced by the fact that he feels he needs the small screen to expand on the story between Episodes III and IV, to add EVEN MORE explanatory fluff to an already-bloated and over-written, un-thought-out tale.Lucas would not need to explore the TV option if he had simply edited out the irrelevant content in Episode III. To wit: deconstructive droids eating Obiwan's fighter, Yoda's trip to Wookie-World, interminable battles between Obiwan and Grievous and Yoda and the Emperor, ANY scene with Anakin and Padme (which dragged the meandering plot to a standstill). These few elements alone, with strategic editing, could have saved us all from a lifetime of Star Wars spin offs and TV mini-series.Hold tight, my brethren, the next ten television years are going to be rough.

Shooter," Shooter is Sharp but Misses the Marky.
","*Shooter* achieves that sensible balance between action, political skullduggery, pretty orange explosions and Mark Wahlberg's big guns (and I don't mean his military sniper rifles), which notches it a cut above most political thrillers of its paranoid ilk Â until its pat ending.With his shrapnel-explosive performance in *The Departed*, Wahlberg shrugged off the last vestiges of Marky Mark, so from now on Â in deference to this bona fide Actor Â I respectfully abstain from any allusions to wigga rap, funky bunches and exposed under-pant. (But we've still got his biceps and obliques Â give a reviewer SOMETHING to work with!) Wahlberg is patriot Bob Lee Swagger, USMC sharpshooter, able to hit moving targets over a mile away, who leaves the corp disillusioned after a morally-ambiguous mission in Ethiopia goes all hela-snafu. After three idyllic years isolated in panoramic mountains with his big dog, a copy of the *9-11 Commission Report,* and web-surfing to 'see what propaganda they're feeding us now,' he receives an unannounced, unwelcome visit from Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover, lisping badly through his dentures Â he really is getting' too old for this sh*t), who wants to hire Swagger for a unique mission Â to deter a presidential assassination by scoping out potential methods on how a sharpshooter of Swagger's caliber may be able to pull it off.Though we could hear a frame-up coming like an eighteen-wheeler with a bad clutch, our boy Swagger obliviously swaggers into it. If his mind is soft, his body is still hard (calm down, ladies!), and he fields two bullet wounds and a green FBI agent (Michael PeÃ±aÂ last seen under a *World Trade Center*) to escape narrowly with his life, while a whole government arm deploys to manhunt him when they should be saving hostages in Iran or fixing potholes on my street.PeÃ±a is Nick Memphis, who refuses to accept the 'official' FBI version of Swagger's assassination attempt, due to inadvertently being bitch-slapped by Swagger himself during his escape. His jigsaw construction of the clues leads him to ally with Swagger, who has in turn allied with Sarah (Kate Mara), the girlfriend of a dead fellow soldier. Which kinda annoys for its clichÃ©. Let's not kid ourselves - when the 'ally-with-the-dead-buddy's-ex' scenario arises in a movie, the girl is ALWAYS single and it ALWAYS leads to panty Â I think the first clue might have been when Sarah opens her door to the filthy, terrified, near-death Swagger (who is no more than a mild acquaintance), dressed in nothing but see-through top and undies, not bothering to close her robe. Then we just sit back and wait for Wahlberg to get the guns outÂ which he does, as she dresses his wounds, which in movie parlance is just another method of foreplay.Swagger and Memphis uncover the all-purpose 'corrupt government plot' behind Swagger's setup, with quite obvious digs at the George W administration along the way. (At this juncture Â 2007, four years into an unwinnable war after two years in an unwon war Â it's quite easy to dig and get a collective amen.) When Colonel Johnson lisps, 'Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?' Swagger replies, 'Some years we do.' Oh, snap! Directed by Antoine Fuqua, from Jonathan Lemkin's screenplay of Stephen Hunter's novel, *Point of Impact,* Swagger's quest terminates Rade Sherbedgia and Elias Koteas as bad guys along the ladder, Ned Beatty eventually uncovered as the corrupt senator atop the ladder, reveling in the nation's political audacity and his perceived impunity, 'We live in a country where the Secretary of Defense can go on national TV and say it's about freedom and not about oil.' 'The bosses know. We know their bosses know. The problem is in admitting that the leaders know.' With his words, this movie might as well be handing out subpoenas to Rumsfeld, Bush, Rove, Cheney and Libby.It is astounding to realize that the definition of Patriot has flip-flopped to someone who DOES own a copy of the *9-11 Commission Report.* Not ten years ago, anyone surfing the web, mumbling about propaganda would have been considered treasonous. But Swagger is painted as the reddest, whitest and bluest Patriot in this film Â BECAUSE he questions the government. Illustrates how adversely the George W. Bush Klan has affected the United States: that the HERO of a popular movie Â not 'anti-hero' or 'ambiguous villain' - can criticize the administration so loudly and meet with vindication rather than stultification.But this is where the film meanders into 'We Can Dream, Can't We?' status. The conspiracy reaches to such high government offices that Beatty's character is right in contemptuously sneering that one sharpshooter can do nothing to curb it. But after a faux-climax that does not payoff (a grand, panoramic shootout in snowy mountains) and a military hearing which also does not payoff (where Swagger demonstrates his big gun Â the one that can counter the earth's Coriolis effect with its power, not the one that can make ladies drop trou when body-oiled), we know that a REAL climax is coming, one of insensible Â yet Eastwood-ian avenger Â proportions. (Cue pretty orange explosions.) It doesn't seem to matter to the film-makers that Swagger's methodology is only the corrupt administration's Decider-like tyranny and Might-Is-Right anarchy turned back on themselves Â which therefore does not raise the Hero morally above his opponents but abandons him right amongst them. The paradox is that the parochial W. Bush administration regards only those people who support and behave like them (i.e. morally bankrupt) as the only true Patriots.So after *Shooter* succinctly sends the disheartening, yet intrinsically correct message that you can't clean up the insidious corruption amongst elected officials with a big gun Â Bob Lee Swagger does just that.Now that's a Patriot.",7,1,5,22 May 2007
Defiance," In defiance of stereotypes.
","In the movie KNOCKED UP, five Jew friends trying to score in a night club talk about the credibility of Jews being raised by one man: 'If any of us is gonna score tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in MUNICH.' Soon they'll be talking the same way about Daniel Craig in DEFIANCE...1941: during World War II, three Jewish brothers in German-occupied Poland lead a band of Jewish rebels and refugees in fleeing the Holocaust and fighting back against Ze Chermans.From a book by Nechama Tec, Defiance: The Bielski Partisans, Edward Zwick directs DEFIANCE, following the Bielski brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and Zus (Liev Schreiber), as they lead over 1,000 refugees to safety in the Belarussian forests. Jamie Bell plays their younger brother, Asael.It's Based On a True Story. But seriously - who cares? Besides the descendants of those refugees. Haven't we exhausted the compelling 'true stories' from World War II? We're into a generation of viewers whose knowledge of WWII comes from the History Channel and boring school teachers; they're more familiar with al Qaeda, Iraq and maybe the 1990 Gulf War. To this younger generation, The Berlin Wall was something that Reagan told Mr. Gorbachev to tear down. How uninterested can they possibly be in the tribulations of a few Jews in 1941 Europe? Well, I guess that's why Daniel Craig is so hot. To draw in the target audience of 19 year old girls. Who will be followed by 21 year old boys.Best thing about DEFIANCE is its ruthlessness. Tuvia mercilessly - and very satisfactorily - executes the Germans who killed his parents. Yet he tells brother Zus 'We must not become like them.' I guess he means they must not take joy in their killings, as they both seek out and execute all the Jewish traitors to their cause. Revenge is sweet, poison and all.It is great to see Jews fighting back for once in a war movie. Up to now, the image of the war Jew has been Auschwitz victims, sunken faces, long woolen overcoats, crumpled hats, queuing for gas chambers. DEFIANCE gives us sexyboys with machine guns, muscles and mojo. Not whining about their constant persecution or their bad gout. No lawyers and bignoses and funny hat wearers, but warriors leading a bunch of lawyers and bignoses and funny hat wearers. Not mournfully sitting around for God to deliver them, bellyaching prophecies of a chosen one who would bring balance to the Force (as a large contingent do, cowering hidden in the city, led by Mark Margolis).The Bielski brothers are movers and shakers who deliver all these stereotypes out of the defeated city, build a forest community, ally with Russian resistance fighters, cut down troublemakers in their midst, and mow down Germans with guns blazing.DEFIANCE suffers for being too far removed from our sensibilities. I guess a patriotic Jew would find it inspirational, but it is just one basic idea stretched over two hours: furtively hide, shoot Germans, furtively hide, shoot Germans, furtively hide, shoot Germans... okay, two basic ideas.If Jesus had been this badass, we'd all be speaking Aramaic...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,0,4,6 September 2009
WALLÂ·E," Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto!
","Earth. 700 years in the desolate future. A small robot that looks like E.T. blissfully rolls along on little tank treads, compacting trash into cubes that he builds into towering trash skyscrapers. He is a Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth class Â WALL-E.Humankind has abandoned the ravaged Earth, leaving only their refuse behind, which stretches into orbit like filthy facsimiles of Saturn's rings; a dystopian, disturbing, Terry Gilliam-like vision, tempered by a smarmy CEO (Fred Willard, the first live human integrated into Pixar animation) entreating us with space as the final frontier, in holograms re-playing to dead cityscapes.WALL-E is the last of his kind - broken-down WALL-E's litter the blighted garbage-land. Unmindful of the dead planet, he plies his trade in simple joy. On his time off, he fills a cooler with artifacts, retiring to a derelict trailer each night (with a free-roaming pet cockroach) where he files everything, while watching HELLO DOLLY on VHS and yearning for tactile contact.Pixar Studios have slammed another one right outa the park! Written and directed by Andrew Stanton (FINDING NEMO, 2003), WALL-E is one of the few *original* movies this season (not a sequel or remake or derived from a TV show). How does Pixar craft these ingenious, inventive nuggets (where each viewing reveals new discoveries)? Their movies and characters are imbued with so much energy and verve, authenticity hits our nerves in all the right g-spots. A combination of effective storyline, unbridled 3D animation and cuteness so contagious it'll burn your breakfast.One day a thunderous spaceship leaves behind a sleek, pill-shaped 'female' robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), with a lethal power-blast right hook. Her mission: to find Life on Earth. (Waiter, there's a little iron in my irony.) WALL-E immediately falls in love.So begins a wondrous, accidental journey for WALL-E and EVE, back to the AXIOM, the spaceship housing all Humankind. By bringing back a lone plant, EVE signals Humankind may safely walk the Earth again. But there is a slight problem: over seven centuries, Humankind have become hover-chair blobs, insensate slaves to Big Brother holo-screens in front of their triple-chinned faces Â Humankind can't think anymore, let alone WALK, their bones having deteriorated.Again, the horror of this totalitarian society might have slapped us in the BRAZIL bone was it not for the Pixar team injecting robot buffoonery at every pixel.EVE's plant becomes the symbol for freedom and sparks a power struggle between the ship's evil computer (voiced by Sigourney Weaver), who wants to destroy the green and continue cruising amongst the black, and the AXIOM Captain (a more cognizant blob than the passengers, voiced by Jeff Garlin), who is aided by WALL-E and EVE in potting the plant to drive the ship Earthward.And this is why Republicans are outraged! As juvenile and unbelievable as it sounds, the duplicitous, traitorous, treasonous swine of the Republican Klan of George W. Bush's Amerika vilify WALL-E for its 'message.' And what 'message' are they protesting?...The ship's Manual instructs a return to Earth when organic life is found, yet the ship's evil computer has been instructed by Fred Willard to 'Stay the Course' (Willard's exact words!) instead of ever returning to Earth if 'conditions on the ground change.' Sound familiar? Exactly! Though there is *no intent* to analogize Iraq and George W. McCain, the plot line accidentally highlights how unutterably asinine the McBush-Cheney administration's foreign policies are.Only the insane are offended by the insanity of the ship's computer, who *Stays The Course* supposedly for the good of Humankind, while keeping Humankind blind to the actual good it can bring upon itself.Trust the Repubs to focus on this paradox of their own laughable design, while the movie gets away with so many other anomalies: from anthropomorphism, to the ship's 'gravity' which causes it to 'tilt' when the computer twists the steering wheel; and the decision to go deep space, when two stable Lagrange Points exist on Earth's orbit where a ship could perch without any fuel expenditure at all, and could make the short trip back to Earth without having to traverse billions of miles through theoretical hyperspace and wormholes.Of course, I only mention these anomalies because I am a stickler for educative fiction. If WALL-E caused even one Republican's refried brain to reconsider their satanic party's non-ethics, I say: 'Thank you very much, Mr. Robot!'",8,3,7,22 July 2008
The Terminal," In-Terminal-ble
","Cast Away meets Perestroika in 'The Terminal', a movie which cannot decide whether it wants to be a drama, a romantic comedy, or just a silly waste of time. Unspooling like a film student's exercise in padding, one has to beat oneself about the head to comprehend how the world's arguably greatest director and the world's arguably greatest actor ever acceded to participating in this mundane project. Forget plot. Forget realistic human behavior. Forget empathy with the characters. But for a few moments which sparkle with the genius of the mega-powers involved (such as the scene where the camera drives home the hero's alienation by panning away from him, showing us his insignificance amidst the madding crowd; also, the 'promise' fulfilled is a moving affair), the movie is a herky-jerky mish-mash of pish-posh. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks, sporting a darn good 'Russian' inflection) alights at JFK Airport just as his (fictional) country of Krakozhia slides into a military coup. As a result, all Krakozhian passports are suspended and 'unrecognized' by the U.S. Government; in effect, Navorski cannot go home, nor can he enter the United States - hence, Homeland Security Officer Dixon (the marvelous, multi-faceted Stanley Tucci) relegates Navorski to the confines of JFK Terminal, hoping that he will exit 'illegally' and become S.E.P. (Somebody Else's Problem). Innocent Viktor, though, chooses not to exit, thereby remaining Dixon's responsibility and causing him insufferable agita. While squatting in the Terminal, Viktor's adventures make us realize just how much more enjoyable it would be to watch paint dry.I, like many others on this planet, have seen every one of Spielberg's movies (except 'Always' Â n.b. chick-flick!) and I think it's safe to say that not even in the irritating 'Lost World: Jurassic Park 2' are there so many instances where we, the audience, 'fall out' of the movie so painfully. The 'falling out' starts with Dixon's first meeting with Navorski. One wonders how Dixon squishing a bag of potato chips over Navorski's jacket will allow Navorski to allegorically comprehend that his country is in political transience. This scene's deeper message is that government officers like Dixon are so wrapped in their jobs that even a language barrier cannot curb their adherence to verbal protocol. Rest assured, I get it. But inserting that juvenile chip-squishing act removed me from the movie Â it was gratuitously Three Stooges and all I could think of were the oil stains that Navorski's jacket would forever be residued with. Other sequences also offer deeper messages overlaid with trite screen writing, such as the 'medicine-for-goat' sequence (which almost succeeds Â until Dixon recites a statute word-for-word for the viewer's benefit), or the 'juggling waiter' scene (performed by a character who has just been trying to boost Viktor's chances with his date - now jeopardizing them with his intrusion). How could the great Spielberg allow so many of these jarring sophomoric idiocies into this movie?Filmed on a gargantuan movie set which could have stamped out Liberia's deficit, stranded Viktor realizes he needs to find: a) food, b) shelter, c) something named Wilson to talk to. The movie's numerous, obtuse sub-plots provide all three. In one exceptionally inane sub-plot, Viktor intercedes between a shy baggage-handler and the INS officer he worships from afar. Whimsical teens clasp their breasts and sigh deeply Â but how many stalking baggage-hounds have those whimsical teens dated recently? That Cyrano de Bergerac vamp only goes so far before you have to reveal the Dork Death you really areÂ That romance led to a contrived marriage, whereupon I 'fell out' yet again. Most prominent of the sub-plots is Viktor's romance with stewardess Amelia (a pore-less Catherine Zeta-Jones), who carries so much obvious emotional baggage, she should have 'Samsonite' tattooed on her forehead. Incessantly nattering about Napoleon, incorrectly deemed 'far-sighted' by the desirous Viktor, the fact that he meets this neurotic slattern whilst she is arguing with her adulterous lover about leaving his wife should have raised red flags immediately. (Guess Tom Leykis isn't broadcast in KrakozhiaÂ) Subsequently, after all the energy Viktor expends on this 'romance' - including building Amelia a fountain! - it amounted to a waste of time (when she declines his love for her married adulterer's) and a wrongful investment of the audience's emotions. The film lost our Trust. Viktor and Amelia's parting scene is also the worst 'falling out' example: in a pub, patrons clamor around Viktor, talking to him directly, He ignores them, while Amelia backs away from him. In the real world, if a stranger abjectly pays you no mind, your first instinct is to find others to direct your attention to Â but these extras continue blathering at Viktor, the 'rhubarb audio' progressively getting quieter as the poignancy between Viktor and Amelia grows more intense, thereby dumping us headlong into the Real World, where 'extras' blather in movies simply to create atmosphere.In assimilating his English from travelogues, television commercials and baggage-handlers, Viktor becomes far too cognizant of English vernacular; of words and concepts which one could never glean from those lowbrow sources. Thus, communication becomes 'easy', and the sinister atmosphere pervading Viktor's alienation is diluted. Can we expect anything more from Spielberg these days? After 'Jaws', he has only colored *within* the PC lines; the world is good and kind and rewarding - Oops, I've fallen again. Dixon's boss commits a grand 'fallout' offense when he advises Dixon, 'Compassion Â that's the foundation of this country.' I believe he was referring to the pilgrims compassionately liberating the land from the Native Americans. Or was he speaking of the land-owners who compassionately bull-whipped their African slaves? Maybe he meant the Union and Confederacy compassionately disemboweling one another during the American Civil War?ÂMr. Spielberg: I've fallen Â and I can't get up.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",4,0,5,11 September 2005
Halloween," Carving Teen on Halloween.
","Arguably the first Senseless Knife-Kill flick; arguably the first 'serial murder' movie mislabeled as 'horror'; arguably the only movie to ever use a Captain Kirk mask to scare people. Intentionally rather than accidentally.HALLOWEEN is historical; like Friday THE 13TH and a handful of seminal horror movies that spawned an unstoppable tide of sequels, it has entered into world consciousness. Unlike Friday THE 13TH and many of those other seminal horror 'classics,' HALLOWEEN is actually a reasonably good movie.After all, John Carpenter writes and directs. And HALLOWEEN features two actual actors in its leading roles: Donald Pleasance, who intimidated everyone with his experience and British accent, and Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature film debut, disguising her striking man-features with a luscious mop of brown locks and displaying a conviction and commitment to her pear-shaped bellbottoms that outshone all her idiotic teen co-stars.HALLOWEEN has nothing to do with the American-celebrated night of October 31st, Hallows Eve; it's just a nice night to kill teenagers having sex.15 years ago, young Michael Myers in a clown mask knifed his sister and was sent to a mental institution, where he was treated by psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis (Pleasence). An adult now, Myers escapes, with Loomis hot on his trail, tracking him to the tree-lined suburb of Haddonfield, Illinois, his old home.In the script, Myers was known only as The Shape, as Steadicams portrayed his Point-Of-View, Carpenter not allowing us many clear views of the psychopath whom Loomis describes as 'pure evil' - which is a simple way of getting out of any real character motivation. It's the movie version of 'Because I said so.' So Myers can kill anyone at any time for any reason - because he's Pure Evil, see? The stoic flesh-colored mask he wears is actually a spraypainted Captain Kirk mask - ahh, now that's Pure Evil.Myers stalks Lori (Curtis) for no reason (maybe cos he's 'Pure Evil'), until Halloween night when he starts killing teens in his hometown for no reason. Even Lori's ultimate Running and Screaming relationship with Myers only comes about because he kills her bad actor teen friends across the road and she investigates in her pear bellbottoms.In the late 70s, in theaters across the nation, HALLOWEEN's iconic, chilling music guaranteed girlfriends would be grabbing their dates in the dark, instead of the other way round, and I'm sure the jump-scares gave teen boys valid reason to spill sodas over their date's bra-less blouses. And offer to wash them back at his place...Kids, have you learned nothing from this movie? Teen sex could get you killed. (Of course, the Puritans who run America needed an even stronger wrongful message that 'sex causes death,' so they invented AIDS.) Ironically, the man who was the inspiration for Dr. Evil saves the day, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,3,5,23 November 2009
Paths of Glory," Paths of Gory.
","'When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all.' --Paul (Lewis Ayres), ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT.The quote from ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT may be misconstrued. If there really was such a thing as 'dying for your country,' it would be stupid enough, but no one ever really dies for their country - they die to appease the small-penis insecurities and greed of the low, gutless swine who ordered them into war.From the book by Humphrey Cobb, Stanley Kubrick directs PATHS OF GLORY - an outraged, frustrated scream against the duplicity, mendacity, idiocy, inhumaneness and ingloriousness of war.For two years, a platoon of WWI French soldiers have been fighting futilely against Germans in trench warfare. Led by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), they are ordered to storm a German fortification by their cowardly commanders, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) and General Mireau (George Macready, who looks and acts ominously like Dick Cheney). The attack is a failure, but the Generals - who think nothing of losing '51-percent casualties for the sake of moving their line ahead,' refuse to acknowledge the impossibility of success or their own lack of strategy and stupidity, and scapegoat three men from Dax's platoon to be tried and executed for cowardice, as the reason for the failure.Outraged at the injustice, Dax does all he can to stay the execution, meeting with Broulard and Mireau to plead not just clemency, but to avoid descent into the madness of arbitrary slaughter of their own men simply for the Generals to save face; further, Dax acts as legal counsel for the doomed men. All in vain. High command will have its blood - from the enemy's side, or their own.Cobb's tale has not dated in half a century, its message, its impact, its depiction of low men in high places. Though PATHS depicts French officers heartlessly regarding their men as cannon fodder, the same attitude is adopted by every single faction that enters into war - the high commanders seeing their militia as statistics and the officers closer to the ranks becoming greater idealists, like Dax. (But who am I to talk? The closest I've come to trench warfare is taking cover behind rows of school desks and launching lethal shoes at my enemies before the teacher arrived and sent us all to the principal.) For its unafraid camera (Kubrick pans through rows of trench gutters, over shattered bodies, through glutting mud and ear-damaging explosions - all in stark black and white) and fearless unpatriotic concepts (Mireau orders his own men fired upon to get them out of the trenches, Dax goes hell-bent insubordinate against his superiors to save his men), PATHS inspires outrage, but could it have been all that hard for Americans and Brits to enact these foreign roles so convincingly and make the Froggies look like buttered croissants? Even though Kubrick portrays war as ludicrous on every level, from the fighting to the politics, we are left with the image of the French being ludicrous. So ludicrous that the French banned PATHS OF GLORY in France until 1975.But the message is still damning in its intensity. PATHS is so disturbing and cloying that the irony of its title is like a sledgehammer to the spine - unlike almost every other war movie existent, from then to now, we clearly see there IS no 'glory' in war. And 'war' these days covers every underhanded business decision (like George W. Bush's ignominious Iraq defeat) and political and religious skirmish (from monks in Myanmar to Iranian elections). And the very same contradictory insanities in PATHS OF GLORY continue right now: The Geneva Convention clearly delineates torture as a war crime (Article 17, Article 130, and others from 1949) - yet Bush tortures in the name of America and remains unconvicted, he jails soldiers who refuse to torture for their disobedience to his dictatorship, then jails scapegoats who DID torture to gain political capital; while Barack Obama allows CIA operatives who tortured to remain free, citing their excuse ('just following orders') as valid, even though this same excuse incarcerated those at Nuremberg...There is no Hollywood Eleventh Hour stay of execution in PATHS OF GLORY. Kubrick and Cobb are intent on driving home the message that war means the bad guys will always win. Even if they're supposedly the good guys.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",9,0,3,14 August 2009
Despicable Me," The Cute Face of Evil.
","Supercute, superfluffy and superevil, the CGI cartoon DESPICABLE ME follows ambiguously-continental, flamboyant do-badder Gru (Steve Carell, outdoing himself with the half-Transylvanian, half-Albanian accent) in his quest to be the Greatest Supervillain in the World.The theft of the Great Pyramid by New Villain on the Block, Vector (voiced by Jason Segel) spurs Gru to strive for even greater glory - with his evil scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and his army of Minions (hundreds of maddeningly cute diminutive yellow beings dressed in overalls and goggles, one of them voiced by Jemaine Clement of FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS), Gru plots to steal the Moon itself.To build a rocket, Gru must request a loan from The Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Bros), and must find a way to steal a shrink ray from Vector, to shrink the Moon. To infiltrate Vector's HQ, Gru adopts three cute little girls (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher), who unknowingly aid Gru by selling Vector cookies with little cookie-bots built into them.Written by Ken Daurio, Sergio Pablos and Cinco Paul, and directed energetically by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, DESPICABLE ME is memorable because of Gru's ubiquitous sidekicks, the Minions.No matter the cool jazz feel of the hip hop title song by Pharrell Williams ('I'm having a bad, bad day / If you take it personal, that's okay / Watch, this is so fun to see / Uh, despicable me!'); no matter how cute the little girls are ('He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!'), and no matter the excellent writing in avoiding maudlinism in the unavoidable character arc of Gru becoming a loving surrogate father, the Minions sell this film, with their chattery language and peripheral sight gags, constantly doing something so despicably cute you just want to slap somebody.",Null,0,0,21 July 2011

Inhabiting the role of Elizabeth II like she was born into the English monarchy, giving the old biddy some reg'lr ole toughness, independence and spunk, at one point reminding her aides that she was a mechanic during The War.THE QUEEN is not a biography of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, it merely covers a short period of her life in the aftermath of the paparazzi-induced death of Diana Spencer, Princess of Wales. The Queen's protocol reaction and the public's kneejerk perception of the Royal Family makes for an interesting well-acted and directed couple of hours.Movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as Prime Minister of England, and the death of Diana (artfully done in swift shots interspersed with real footage). Blair is made to look like a strong, acute leader; the only head of state who discerned which way the populist wind was blowing. (Of course, this was before he became Bush's bumboy in 2002, when he failed miserably on predicting the gunmetal winds).Time and again, Blair would try to advise Elizabeth to make a public statement of grief over Diana's death. But the Royal 'we,' supported by imperious husband Prince Philip (James Cromwell) instead turned to protocol, insisting Diana was no longer a member of the royals (which was correct) and so deserved no public display of royal commiseration.Even as the Queen's British approval ratings plummet, she continues to insist she knows the tenor of 'her people.' Yet how could she, being holed up since her twenties in that gilded cage? Director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan walk a delicate tightrope with the Queen's character; though she comes off as snooty in dismissing Blair, she retains a fragile humanity, which I credit to Mirren's performance. I'd stake my life that the actual Queen - after so many insular decades behind those lascivious, hedonistic palace walls - has no clue what humanity IS anymore.As much of the action takes place within the palace, I'm intrigued as to how many details of the Queen's bedchambers and private quarters they got right. Every time a movie is made on an Oval Office set, the filmmakers crow about the intricate detail they put into it (because Americans are allowed to take tours through the President's domicile and office), but who's going to know if the halls of Buckingham Palace are authentic, except the few hundred people who work within them (and they're not talking for fear of being beheaded)? Throughout the movie, Mirren is suitably regal and British, yet when she goes on national TV for the Diana statement, suddenly we hear her adopt that super-posh 'Queen voice' - up to this point, she needed to do nothing else to secure the Academy Award she would win (2007, Best Actress, Leading Role), but as soon as she dropped that Queen voice on us - it was all over. Everyone else could tear up their acceptance speeches.Sexyregal was the new Streep.",7,0,0,20 July 2010
Iron Man," Man of Steel, Ethics of Plastic
","*Iron Man* is a steel-belted planet-crusher of a film; alloy feet on the ground, red-and-gold armor streaking for sub-orbital skies. Based in a reality close to current, like the shrapnel lodged in Tony Stark's chest, we feel it close to our heartÂ technology, physics, corporate backbiting, intimate asidesÂ and a self-made hero that speaks in tongues to our wild fantasies of power.Not just for 14-year-old boys.Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, all-American, arrogant, insouciant, egomaniacal billionaire playboy weaponry wizard, who sustains a shrapnel wound in Afghanistan (comic book lore tells us a land mine in Nam; movie places Stark in a *current* non-essential conflict), imprisoned by generic Arabs and forced to make a WMD for them, instead designing an armor suit, first for escape from his oily-complected captors, and then as avenger (wink wink) *against* his own weapon creations and the corporate back door deals that cede those American weapons into oily-complected hands.Departing considerably from comic book canon, all the familiar characters are here, but tweaked: Jim Rhodes (excellent Terence Howard) is not just Stark's pilot, but a high-ranking air force officer; Pepper Potts (moderately cute Gwyneth Paltrow) is Stark's yearning Girl Friday, who sees the parade of fluff through Tony's bedroom as a prelude to her ultimate spanking; Obadiah Stane (an uncharacteristically sinister Jeff Bridges) is not a corporate competitor but in Stark's trusted inner circle, making his betrayal all the more treacherousÂ Directed by Jon Favreau (Vince Vaughn's wife) and screen played surprisingly well by its four writers, *Iron Man* takes its time focusing on the man inside the metal, rather than the mayhem the metal man musters. (Can I have a prize for that one?) In captivity, a fellow prisoner, Yinsen (Shaun Toub) creates an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from entering Stark's heart, which Stark refines into a glowing 'reactor' or something, forever to remain his albatross - and simultaneously a cool superhero chest-piece.Yinsen turns Stark from unrepentant war dog to humanitarian avenger by telling him of his 'life's work in the hands of these murderers.' Let's get the 'murderer' definition straight: when Stark shows off his death-dealing toys in callous arrogance ('Respected or feared? I say, Why not both?'), he merely echoes the stance of the Amerikan Military War Machine, who also believe the 'best weapon is the one you only need to fire once.' Who are the murderers again? Secondly, a business genius like Stark should know how the supposed 'enemy' market is the house of sand the Amerikan military economy is built upon. When it comes to killing for profit, Amerikan ethics are quite, quite plastic. The first taste of the crude, silver armor is magnificent. Though the '63 comic book version now looks like a clown suit next to his red-and-gold juggernauts, the movie gussies up the suit with mechanical ganglions to lend it cave-cred. And in this roughshod mechanical man, Stark escapes the Arabs like a runaway tank.Back in 'civilization' Stark turns his focus from corporate warfare to one project Â his new armor. Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges scares us with his shaved head.Seeing Stark create and test the powers of his technological marvel is half the fun of this origin tale - and when the full armor suit is eventually revealed, it is the sexiest beast this side of Optimus Prime! CGI is used as sensibly as Ridley Scott used it in *Gladiator* Â to enhance the story rather than to blow our minds with cheap shots. Seeing Iron Man out-fly combat jets and take on tanks is action enough ÂAND - the worst part about Doctor Doom in *Fantastic Four* was his voice remaining the fruity scientist's drawl even when he donned the mask Â but when Stark slams on his iron man Â yeeees! - he has a Vader thoom! We have CGI to thank that Favreau didn't put Downey in a rubber suit and dub in clanking foley. And with the armor's complexity, it is only logical a machine should suit him up - and only CGI could render that machine, rather than having to see him pull on his gleaming jeans one pants-leg at a time.The CGI only falls overboard once, when Stane dons giant armor to battle Iron Man in the final scenes, the movie suddenly turning into *Transformers 2: Electric Boogaloo* for a bad second. In the final cut, no one will notice the ethics paradox Â it's not for this movie's target demo to tangle with. *Iron Man* is still one of the great superhero movies.IRON MAN opens with AC/DC's *Back in Black.* And we're played out by Sabbath's *Iron Man*! Not just for 14-year-old boys. But it'll sure make you feel like one.",9,8,12,18 May 2008
Tombstone," When The West Was Huckleberry.
","The *Pulp Fiction* of westerns, with its vivid dialog and firestorm set pieces. Also, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer together in one film Â and that's a big YUM for the ladies. Russell's and Kilmer's opening scenes establish them as powerhouse masculines, something which this film veritably bleeds with, yet these two tower over every other dusty gunslinger and scenery-chomping henchman.Russell is Wyatt Earp. We meet him alighting a train and whipping a wrangler across the face with his own whip for beating Earp's horse, growling in a rasp that would make The Clint proud, 'Hurts, don't it?' Kilmer is Doc Holliday. Drawing his guns like proverbial greased lightning in a card game gone sour, then knifing his antagonist and exiting stage right with a fistful of cash and a hard, sexy woman, Kilmer has only begun to amaze usÂ as he takes his character a mighty step further, endowing his Holliday with a pseudo-continental accent of his own nefarious design and an educated panache that we doubt anyone on the frontier could have seriously exhibited WITHOUT being a lightning gun (i.e. he'd be killed in a hot second for being such a dandy). To this day he has never commanded a role so deliciously elitist. Yes, *Tombstone* is yet another Gunfight at the O.K. Corral Â but related in such a way that this fact is peripheral to the characters at the heart of the tale. Directed by George P. Cosmatos, written by Kevin Jarre, *Tombstone* presents a vision of the frontier as half brutal reality, half snakeskin Hollywood, all guilty pleasure. Ten times more entertaining than that OTHER *Wyatt Earp* - poor Kevin Costner's epic, drawn-out, tedious June 1994 release, coming in a weary second to this film in release date and pure animal fun. The Earp brothers, Wyatt (Russell), Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton), with their three blond wives in tow, arrive in Tombstone, eager to settle in and seek their fortune. Wyatt especially wants to leave behind his bloody rep as a 'Kansas lawdog.' The frontier has other ideas, crawling as it is with The Cowboys Â rowdy, red-sashed troublemaking gunhands who 'rule' the vicinity like mobsters; led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and his sidekick, Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), the 'deadliest pistolier since Wild Bill.'As the trailer said, 'JusticeÂ is coming to Tombstone.'Setting themselves up, unwillingly at first, as keepers of the peace, the Earp brothers' fate inexorably leads to the gunfight at the you-know-where, due to The Cowboys refusing to disarm while within town limits, the Earps sensing anarchy in the air and attempting to simply disarm them where they had congregated behind the O.K. Corral. Because this movie piles on so many entertaining vignettes, the O.K. is the least of our climaxesÂ from Wyatt driving out the Faro dealer (Billy Bob Thornton): 'Go ahead, skin it! Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens!'Âto the tasty, intelligent, Latin exchange between Holliday and Ringo (you can see the full translation in the 'memorable quotes' link): 'Eventus stultorum magister.' 'In pace requiescat';Â this movie roars like a stallion on steel hooves, in a hail of Peacemaker gunfire and very real handlebar moustachios.",8,19,24,22 May 2008
Mr. Holland's Opus," Mopus Opus.
","A well-intentioned redemption movie that follows all its formulas sweetly, then tries one last tear-jerk that just makes us feel dirty, paying off with a nice piece of elevator muzak that is so memorable, it will have you humming something else within five minutes of hearing it.Richard Dreyfus is Mr. Holland, a composer who begrudgingly takes a job as a high school music teacher to make ends meet. His methods are rigid at first, as he forgets that music is meant to be fun. Then he remembers. Then his students forget. And so on.There's the faithful, supportive wife (Glenne Headly), the brash football coach buddy (Bill Meister), the anal principal who butts heads with Holland over his 'revolutionary' teaching methods, like teaching rock and roll and other devil's music (William H. Macy), the wet-mouthed schoolgirl with the crush (Jean Louisa Kelly, who sexes Holland with a sensual rendition of 'Someone to Watch Over Me'), the black underprivileged kid with no rhythm-- hang on now!-- The wha-? Terrence Howard pretends really badly that whitey Dreyfus teaches him soul... and finally, for this man whose life revolves around hearing - his wife births a deaf son. Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan shows us the Poignant Plot Device Handbook is a harsh mistress.Throughout his career of coaxing musicality from his students and sending out into the world, Holland slaves over a masterpiece that we only hear in snatches as he toodles on his piano and scribbles notes.Then the big payoff. Holland, old, exhausted, forced into retirement, is given a final surprise by his students, as they assemble in the auditorium as an orchestra to perform his magnum opus for the first time. And after 30 years of working on this piece of music which he brazenly calls 'American Symphony'; after all that sweat and sacrifice and slaving, his magnum opus sounds like - elevator muzak! In 12/8 time, a tuneless, embarrassing, meandering piece of unmemorable laundry detergent commercial. And look at the faces on the crowd: inspired, majestic, flavor bursting in your mouth not in your hand.MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is a cry for art, a plea for creativity, a pledge against mediocrity - and The 'American Symphony' is the turd in the swimming pool of musical appreciation.It is blathered quite overtly that Mr. Holland's true opus is the collective education of his students over the years. THEY are his masterpiece... Thank Christ! For a moment, we thought we'd have to continue to hold our 'inspired' faces for your laundry detergent commercial...",6,2,5,29 August 2010
Toy Story 3," A decade later, we're still a bunch of kids.
","'After all the hype for TOY STORY 3, it should give me an actual buzz and an actual woody.' --Bill Maher, REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER, June 2010 Is it the best TOY STORY ever? Well, that's subjective as a pudding bear on Tuesday, but TOY STORY 3 is another plastic fantastic, wild child, great escape, life and death extravaganza that should thrill Bill Maher sufficiently.In TOY STORY 2 (1999), Stinky Pete mocked Woody, 'Do you really think Andy is going to take you to college?' TOY STORY 3 is that very plot line - Andy, now a teen, is headed for college (played by the same voice actor who played him as a boy, John Morris - it's been eleven years between sequels!). He packs Woody in his college bag (Stinky Pete was wrong!), putting all his other toys in a box bound for the attic. Through a mixup, Woody and the toys end up at Sunnyside Day Care Center for kids. Kids who rend and rip and scream and crush kill destroy... you know, normal kids. Upon first arriving at Sunnyside, Andy's toys are in Toy Nirvana. Lotso the strawberry-smelling huggy bear (voiced by Ned Beatty) welcomes them with a whole slew of new characters, including Ken (of Ken's Dream House fame, voiced by Michael Keaton.Already suffering neglect issues, Andy's toys embrace Sunnyside's lifestyle of being common property playthings. Lotso tells them, 'If you have no owners you can never be outgrown, never neglected!' (Ah yes, the Gene Simmons mantra against marriage.)Best friends Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) are at odds on whether to stay at Sunnyside. Woody leaves to return to Andy, while the other toys stay - and discover not only the barbaric kids but that Lotso runs the Center like a mafia kingpin, a big doll-baby his muscle, Ken and some monster toys his enforcers. At night, Lotso imprisons Andy's toys (Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex Dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as Hamm) - and thus begins Woody's quest to rescue them. Of course, the magic of every TOY STORY is not in its synopsis, but in the execution of the movie and the depth of its characters. And cuteness. Don't forget cuteness. Kids will enjoy TOY STORY 3 because it's a great movie, but when they re-watch it ten years from now, they will bawl their eyes out - not only for the nostalgia, but for all the complex minutiae and emotional connections they missed as kids.Â As he became Mrs. Nesbitt in TOY STORY, Buzz once again adopts another identity, when his switches are tampered with: Intergalactic Spanish Romancer. Buzz is all over Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) like cheese on nachos, dancing with rose in teeth, sweeping her off her feet, and valiantly rescuing her from peril, all in the manner of Antonio Banderas at his mariachi man-best. Â Woody falls in with a cute owner named Bonnie and her happy happy toys, including a dolly named Dolly, a unicorn, a triceratops and an echidna named Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton), intent on Shakespearean thespianism.Â The perennial abandonment scene (which is sad, but not on the level of TOY STORY 2) features Lotso, doll-baby and Chuckles the Clown hitching a ride on the bumper of the Pizza Planet van. Safe to say TOY STORY 3 contains the most poignant hammers of the trilogy: themes of abandonment, of age overtaking us all, of the passing of torches, of the wonder of youth, and leaving that wonder behind...I promised myself I wouldn't cry. Death comes calling. The most serious circumstance they have ever faced, as Woody, Buzz and the gang inexorably slide slowly towards an iron smelter. Unlike any threats before it, this death is unthinking, unyielding, unable to be reasoned with like a fierce dog or a bad kid, it is overwhelming. And as they struggle vainly against the relentless landslide of scrap metal, Buzz, with his arm around Jessie, looks around and sees Woody. His look is final. It says there is no way out. And wordlessly he stretches his hand toward Woody. Woody takes it. Woody looks to the Potato Heads holding each other. He reaches out to them. They hold his hand. As all the toys join hands, there is no sound, but the relentless scream of metal melting in the maw of the furnace. No words, no tears, only an abiding, crushing love between them. They are not toys any more. They are our friends. We've lived with them for over a decade; now we're going to die with them.One deus ex machina later...Though we thought we'd have to hold it in for the incinerator scene, the makers of TOY STORY 3 (director Lee Unkrich, writers Unkrich, John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Michael Arndt) save the best for last and hit us right in the heart with the final scene: Andy bequeathing his toys to shy, generous, tender Bonnie. Just before he drives off, he turns for one last look at his beloved playthings now in the care of Bonnie playing in her front yard, says softly, 'Thank you, guys.' And thus do we fulfill Bill Maher's criteria: even if most of the movie is chase-action-rescue, the emotional wallops will leave you with that contact high headrush that all good movies aim for and few achieve.",8,0,1,10 January 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," On its merry way to extinction...
","Part road movie, part dinosaur actioner, and fully gushing with family values, ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS is the third and most spectacular in the ICE AGE series - and probably the least interesting.If you're not as tired of these characters as I am, you'll enjoy Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabretooth (Denis Leary) espousing their thinly disguised lectures on how syrupy-sweet it is to be a part of their misfit family. In the original ICE AGE, the family angle was very subtle and touching - but the writers of DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS seem to think we need it said very obviously very many times by as many talking animals as possible. We get it: Family Good, Loneliness Bad.When Manny and his mammoth 'wife' Ellie (Queen Latifah) are expecting, Sid and Diego are psychologically affected: Sid finds dinosaur eggs buried in the ice and pretends to be a mother to them (pretty disturbing stuff if it weren't for being a cartoon) and Diego decides to pursue his bachelorhood elsewhere.The dino eggs hatch little tyrannosaurs, whose mother comes looking for them, taking them - and Sid - back to her underground world. (There is one sensational transition: when a crack in the ice dissolves to a cracked eggshell of the same shape.) Blatantly ripping off Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, Manny and friends, in an effort to rescue Sid, track the dino down a hole in the ice to find a subterranean world with an artificial sun where dinosaurs still rule the Earth - or at least, the middle part of it.They meet Buck (Simon Pegg), a crazed, one-eyed weasel who knows how to survive in this wilder world, who leads them through its dinosaurian dangers. His raison d'Ãªtre is lifelong battle with Rudy, a mysterious dinosaur that the film reveals only in its last scenes for maximum impact - a giant, scientifically-incorrect dinosaur that is a cross between a crocodile and a Spinosaururs.The animation and creativity is spectacular, and the film is entertaining, but it just doesn't grab me. Either I'm getting too old, or these animals are. And neither of us is getting any funnier.And that squirrel Scrat - always an acorn-chaser, never an acorn-eater - is wearing on my nerves. A female Scratte is added to the acorn chase, using her sexual wiles and any other trickery on Scrat to get what she wants - in other words, a typical female.We sincerely hope that the kids watching this cartoon have already learned that dinosaurs were extinct millions of years before large mammals like mammoths evolved. Yes, we hope. We won't go into the disinformation perpetuated by creationists, fundamentalists, ignoramuses and Republicans.For every cool detail the animators include - such as velociraptors with shivering feather-spikes or the maternal portrayal of tyrannosaurs - it is tempered by silly aspects like not being allowed to show meat eaters actually eating meat or running down prey. (Blame the characteristically gutless MPAA.) No wonder I couldn't get my teeth into this film.",5,0,1,20 November 2009
Signs," Cream of the Crop Circles.
","SIGNS is a storytelling masterpiece from writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan; a master moviemaker's layered mosaic of fear, faith, family - and alien invasion.Like every Night thriller, SIGNS is not of the Running and Screaming stripe, rather, a beautifully crafted lesson in film 'making'; creative angles, smart reveals, subtle foreshadowing, tension-filled tableaux, nuanced humor. No frame wasted, no scene superfluous, no Night un-Shyamalaned.Mel Gibson is widower Reverend Graham Hess, a priest who has lost his faith, one day waking on his farm to discover - crop circles. Resurrecting that grand hoax, Shyamalan comes right out and attributes crop circles to extra-terrestrial aliens. But the aliens are the McGuffin - we only see this 'invasion' through snippets on TV news and one chilling scene at a children's party. SIGNS concerns itself only with Graham's family and their unbidden involvement in this world-shaking event.Joaquin Phoenix is Merrill, Graham's brother, helping him tend his farm and raise Graham's two young kids, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in sensational performances). In most films, when a person 'loses their faith' it doesn't mean they have come to their senses - it means they are waiting for some supernatural event to turn them BACK to that faith. Graham stopped practicing priesty things after the death of his wife, run down by a town local that fell asleep at the wheel (M. Night himself, in his usual Hitchcock-ian cameo). Usually a gutless filmic device, Night uses Graham's loss of faith as part of a much bigger picture, working it as another reference to the movie's title.The crux of SIGNS is a foreboding monologue that Graham shares with Merrill, about 'two kinds of people' - the type that believe someone is watching over us, and the type that believe no one is. As they watch television reports of crop circles and hovering spaceships appearing throughout the world, Graham confesses his wife's unnecessary death made him cross over from 'someone' to 'no one.' Religionists regard this as a tragedy. The only tragedy was his wife's death. 'Losing faith' is the best thing that could happen to anyone in this delusional society - they become responsible for the first time in their lives. What Religionists fail to realize is that if no one is watching over us, we are the rulers of our own destiny. Why imagine some great clockmaker planning our floods, quakes, flat tires and stubbed toes? We forgive Night these pseudo-theological forays because every scene in SIGNS ratchets the tension higher; Night can conjure fear from the whisper of the wind, a rustle in the cornstalks, a hand groping under a pantry door.The passive ominousness of crops laying flat shows us we don't need screaming chase scenes to create excitement, nor knives stabbed through eyes to create horror - all it takes is a shift in normalcy: a shadowy figure on the roof, clicking sounds on a baby monitor, a shin disappearing into foliage.James Newton Howard's chilling, eerie, evocative soundtrack only raises the hairs more.Every subplot in SIGNS is a sign itself, as it jigsaws into the fabric of the last scene, where the Hess family confront a full frontal alien, left behind after the 'invasion' forces abandon Earth. Graham finds that everything his wife said to him with her dying breath attains fruition to save their lives - from Bo's obsession with leaving 'contaminated' water glasses around the house, to Morgan's asthma attacks, and Merrill's impulsive cannonball batting arm. 'Tell Merrill... swing away!' Many people try to find signs, allegories and messages in movies with this tone, but few deride SIGNS for being absolutely bereft of intelligence when it advocates predestination. Graham's wife, while pinned to a tree by Night's car, blabbers all the info Graham will need to save his life later, explained away by Graham as 'the last sparks of her brain firing arbitrarily.' You lost me at medulla oblongata.Predestination negates free will. I've said it at least 4,560,670 times. But Christians never seem to get it. Graham actually believes - as many viewers do - that events can be foretold by a dying woman who was fed information by some outside source powerful enough to mind-meld with her (yet not powerful enough to keep the car from hitting her); an outside source with such dubious discernment that it would relate life-saving info through a dying woman instead of simply mind-melding the info into the living people who needed that info. Smart. Graham's 'faith' must have been Church of Nostradamus, or whatever you prophesy weirdoes call yourselves - oh, that's right: Christians.But I forgive Night. Because SIGNS suspends our disbelief so artfully even with the contradiction of predestination. The love and closeness of Graham's family bedrocks their adversity, and the performances breathe beyond three dimensions. What can we say about Joaquin and Mel? Both have wells of emotion so deep and nuanced, it makes us wonder why their shelves are not creaking with Oscars.As one day, M. Night Shyamalan must surely be recognized by that insular, backslapping academy. All they need is a sign.Or SIGNS.",9,0,4,6 April 2009
Identity," Identity Cleft
","More than a murder mystery. More than a psychological thriller. More than a horror movie.With most viewers being either misled by the similarities to Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians', or just pompously broadcasting their knowledge that this movie was inspired by such, they seem to have missed the point that this was not a 'murder mystery' per se, but rather, a finely-crafted journey through the mind of a multiple personality during the course of purging his violent personas.I believe that premise (and its attendant 'twists') were a TEENSY bit much for audiences to comprehend. Even taking into account the fact that film-makers construct films of this ilk to the whims of 'test-audiences' and 'focus groups', (read as lowest common denominators, i.e. swineherders), this particular case still elicits misunderstanding, even WITH the kindergarten paint-by-numbers explanation in the final minutes.It seemed to be a Patrick-Duffy-shower-scene cop-out, but director James Mangold and writer Michael Cooney, were using sleight-of-hand to misdirect viewers through most of the film.I envision those loose-lipped test-audiences (comprised of societal castes who have nothing better to do with their Tuesday afternoons) believing that the movie was taking place in real time, only to be chagrined when it is revealed that most of the action was occurring in a psychopath's disturbed mind. Instead of appreciating WHY this filmic device was used, they immediately wished they'd spent their Tuesday afternoon downing that Haagen-Daaz tub and watching McMillan & Wife explain every last G-rated detail to them like they were the last retards on earth.Ten guests are flood-stranded at a Motel: among them, Rebecca deMornay, almost unrecognizable with her ample boob-job and burgundy hair, playing a character whom she is assuming the mantle of with each passing botox-ed day - a woman who 'used to be that actress'; Amanda Peet, whose stage direction was kept simple - 'Back that booty up some more, honey!'; John C. McGinley playing against type as an uber-dweeb, Jake Busey playing *exactly* his type Â uber-psycho; Ray Liotta Â always darkly mysteriousÂ One by one, these refugee guests start dying all Agatha-Christie-like.Intercut with this storyline is a somber eleventh-hour appeal by doctors and lawyers to an ill-tempered judge to stay an execution. We are intrigued as to how these two disparate tales are related, but we DO sense a connection in due course, because the dry, somber doctors are talking about a 'killer' and in that wet parallel Motel story there're KILLIN'S GALORE.By the end of the second act (after the film's most neck-hair-raising moment, when all the corpses at the Motel are found to be missing), it is revealed that the Motel scenes have been taking place within a psychopath's mind, and that each Motel character was merely one of the multiple personalities of the psychopath.That's Twist No.1 Â that all this rain-drenched piling in and out of rooms like the Spanish Inquisition with shocked pusses is merely a psychopath's IMAGINATION.For a few moments we are led to believe the Shyamalan trap has been sprung Â but there's a trump card Â through Grand Misdirection on the film-maker's part, the doctors believe they successfully purge the psychopath's mind of his 'killer' persona, but it is revealed in the last few seconds of film that the psychopath was too adroit in concealing his *real* 'killer' persona in the form of the least likely hotel guest.THAT was the true 'twist' to the movie: discovering that the doctors' cure did not go deep enough; discovering that the psychopath was able to disguise his persona as a benign presence in full view of both the viewers and doctors.The movie could have opted to wrap neatly with the first Twist, or could have taken any number of juvenile turns, blaming spirits from an Indian Burial Ground, or any of the lesser characters (who all sported damaging secrets), but the writers led us on a merrier, more interesting goose chase.Thus, this deponent sayeth: Bravo to the road less traveled. On the other hand, my 'feminine personality' thought the movie brutalized women too overtly and my 'killer psychopath' personality is going to make the film-makers pay for giving away my secrets...(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,18,29,29 July 2005
Beowulf," So Close... Yet So Beowulf
","'I am Beowulf!' yells Beowulf.Five minutes later, he full-throats again, 'I am Beowulf!' for those arriving late, we presumeÂ Divebombing into a raging sea of serpents, sword slashing on bloodied sinew, warrior man-meat glistening with sev-- 'I am Beowulf!' â Okay dude, now you're just feeding some deep-rooted insecurity complexÂ 'Beowulf' is the oldest known English epic poem (Anonymous author), one of the first pieces to be transcribed from its oral tradition to manuscript (somewhere between 700 and 1000 AD.) That's a pretty awesome pedigree, with a hundred modern media incarnations shouldering their claim-space, so to tackle another incarnation one needs to bring something pretty extraordinary to the table. And Robert Zemeckis's BEOWULF is definitely extraordinary â in one sense. And definitely mediocre in all othersÂ The extraordinary aspect of this 2007 incarnation is its 3D-motion-capture method. Pioneering this 'realistic' method on THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004), Zemeckis now hones it to breath-defying proportions. Nothing is real, but it is obviously emulating reality through sensors on actors' faces and bodies, and the zenith of '3D-cartoon' technology. At first, those bi-color glasses suck all the joy out of the movie-going experience; then once you get used to them, you marvel at the whizbang technique itself, even though many action passages threaten to incite ocular myasthenia; after all the 3D wonder has dissipated, you can sit back to enjoy the movie on its movie merits, but by then, you've figured out it has sacrificed most of those merits for the sake of whizbang and annoying glasses.Now that was a whole lotta something for a whole lotta nothing. But I'd already paid for the parking, so I guess I was obligatedÂ In this Ye Olde English tale (set in Denmark and Sweden), lush lech King Hrothgar (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) and his reveling court are regularly terrorized by the ugliest person/creature in the world, with an oversensitive external eardrum, named Grendel (Crispin Glover, whose main dialog outbursts consist of the word 'Raaaargh!'). From across the treacherous seas (we imagine Zep's The Immigrant Song accompanying him) comes Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone) and his merry men, borne only with the desire to accrue glory in slaying Grendel. A tacit bonus prize is Hrothgar's nubile queen, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn), whom Beowulf wastes no time in showing off his pecs to.In the Great Mead Hall, Hrothgar's manservant, Unferth (John Malkovich), pooh-poohs Beowulf's tall tales (causing more unnecessary proclamations from Beowulf about being Beowulf) and Hrothgar unveils a gleaming chalice as a prize for Beowulf were he to defeat Grendel. Beowulf illogically figures that to beat Grendel, he must strip naked. That, and to give the queen a no-hands 'wassup.' In response to Beowulf's men roaring ribald drinking songs into the night, Grendel appears at the Mead Hall and kills almost everyone, before his arm is ripped off by a nude Beowulf with artfully-obscured genitalia. (It irks me that our society still giggles whenever male genitalia are scantily-hidden by foreground objects â it's a juvenile practice for juvenile viewers and pulls you out of the story quite forcefully.) Beowulf's liege, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson), survives the attack, to fight and make running gags another day.Grendel retreats to his dank subterranean domicile, mortally wounded; a poignant moment when we realize this 'monster' is only a pathetic wretch with oversensitive hearing who, like many young garage bands will attest, only wanted the neighbors to 'turn down that damn noise.' His most powerful witch mother (who looks like Angelina Jolie, only hotter), cradles him in her lullaby arms sadly, at which point Grendel whispers another gratuitous 'Beowulf!' and dies (thereby promoting the second-ugliest person in the world to first place), which sends his mother into a dragon vendetta against the man so named.There are plot twists which depart from the original tale, but this movie ties all the familial threads together very intriguingly: We discover that Hrothgar had 'relations' with the witch to spawn Grendel â his son! When Beowulf enters the dank chamber to finish off the witch, she seduces him by simply turning up as Angelina Jolie. Years later we will discover that the dragon that firestorms Beowulf's castle and causes the sacrifice of his arm and life is, in fact, the spawn of Beowulf from his union with the witch. It's all very DAYS OF OUR LIVES and kept pretty succinct, whereas the original legend rambles on with trysts hither and thither complicating things... and that Olde English doesn't helpÂ There is minimal exploration of other themes, but they seem forced at best: Beowulf's lament of his legend growing greater than he ever was; of his age precluding him from iron-thewed battles, etc. but the movie itself knows that there is not much to itself, except its grandiloquent Things That Come At You From The Screen.Though some viewers had trouble adjusting to the eyes of the characters, it all seemed quite realis-- 'I am Beowulf!' Oh, give it a rest!",6,5,9,6 January 2008
Speed," Driving Miss Dazey.
","Play the drinking game to this movie, for every time you hear the words, 'Hang on!' You'll end up drunker than Lindsey Lohan.SPEED - an action movie that delivers a thrill a minute, almost as often as you have to take a drink - arguably put Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves and director Jan de Bont on the blockbuster map.Though this movie is best known for its extended bus sequence, it is composed of three vignettes - elevator (vertical speed), bus (variable speed) and train (accelerative speed).Segment One: People trapped in elevator - two elevator repair men arrive in a gratuitous flying police car. They are Jack (Keanu) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). One of them is the Brain, one of them the Overactor. I'll let you decide which. Elevator blown up by mad bomber, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper, doing his Dennis Hopper). Take breath. Onto next segment.Apparently, driving a bus is so easy a caveman can do it, as a Downtown Los Angeles bus is piloted by Nearderthal-browed Sam (Hawthorne James), transporting a bunch of extras for a Bennetton ad. Bus boarded by gregarious Annie (Sandra Bullock, back when she was just a cute little comer with great legs, not the big-headed icon she would become).Writer Graham Yost seems to have gotten every ethnicity and job description on that bus, The Construction Worker, The Tourist, The Old Lady, The Asian, The Paka Lady, The Policeman, The Token Blacks, The White Preppy, The 1930s Lady, but I think he forgot the Indian Chief.Mad Bomber gives ultimatum to Jack: 'There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus reaches 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do?' Well, considering it's 9:00 a.m. in Los Angeles peak hour traffic, on the 10 freeway near Santa Monica, I'd start placing bets that the bus couldn't possibly get up to 50 miles an hour in the first place. Then I'd have breakfast.Instead, Keanu clambers onboard the moving bus to try to smoosh up against Sandy's legs as much as possible. Luckily, one of the stereotypes has brought a gun - to shoot the caveman bus driver - precipitating Sandy's Legs having to take the wheel and drive herself into the hearts of America.Joe Morton is the bomb squad chief whose stage directions from de Bont were, 'Okay, see these lines of script? Now shout them into a walkie-talkie.' Jack assesses the bomb with technical jargon: 'There's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world!' Is that a lot? We could complain about the unreality of taking hard right turns at 50 mph, or the physics impossibility of a laden bus jumping a freeway chasm without an approach ramp, or the fact that Keanu couldn't possibly consider his performance 'acting' - but everyone's just having way too much fun.By the time we are onto Segment Three - the runaway train - our adrenalin is kinda tapped out and it seems superfluous. But Keanu gets to smoosh up against Sandy again, with an added bonus - she's handcuffed to a vertical bar in the carriage.By the time the 752nd 'Hang on!' comes, we're ready for rehab.",7,0,0,26 July 2010
X2: X-Men United," X-traordinary
","X-SPOILERS.Unfortunate that X1 and X2 are now associated with these mutant movies, instead of their original references Â Bell's X1 aircraft, piloted by Chuck Yeager, was the first documented to break the sound barrier in 1947 Â never forget that, young-uns! Successive X-numbers denoted successive prototypes.Has there ever been a more perfectly-cast movie than X2? So many characters fitting our preconceptions so absolutely Â er - except for Cyclops, whose role is disconcertingly minimal, as it was in X-Men. Comicbook Cyclops Scott Summers was always the undisputed Leader of the group, exuding a patriarchal air amongst the very first x-youngsters to the present. Movie Cyclops James Marsden exudes all the presence of a day-player, or some guy in a bar in Miami in an episode of Girls Gone Wild.Jean Grey's character is also abused somewhat. Firstly Â that hair Â not working, honey! Gone are comicbook Jean's cascading, volcanic-red, lava-locks (too 80s for this modern film? - but no worse than the Anime cartoon hairstyle she now sports); will it have to come down to an episode of VH1's 50 Awesomely Badder Hairdos to acknowledge this soccer mom abomination? And before we know it, Jean is gone. In a dramatic high-point, sexily holding back a wall of water while simultaneously powering up the X-Jet, she is sacrificed; a device which had to occur for Jean Grey's overwhelming Phoenix force to achieve illimitable psionic freedom (Hep me! Hep me! I'm sliding into geekery!...) In essence, in just two movies her character traverses an arc which took decades of comics to develop. Movies, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of comicbook shelf-life; plots that were developed over thousands of inter-connected comics must necessarily be composited into a few films, before the franchise goes to pot with new directors, unfamiliar and unlikeable cast and widened demographic mundanity. i.e. it ALWAYS ends up G-rated, with scenes of soldiers crawling out of exploded military vehicles to prove that they are still alive.The film unflinchingly supplies each major character with an interesting arc; an almost insurmountable undertaking, considering the plethora of varied roles and interlocking story lines. Director Singer and writers have done an incredible job, full tilt boogie Â even the day-player Cyclops gets his moment to kick butt and take names - but is ultimately taken down by a chick Â girly-man style!Before I go on, I must clarify: this is an excellent movie, well-filmed, well-written, well-acted Â and hey! Wolverine! 'nuff said! - but it is not without its illogicities.An example: Rogue is sucked out of the disabled X-Jet and Nightcrawler bamfs out and retrieves her, bringing her back onboard safely Â excellently illustrating his power's utility - BUT - well, he's back in the out-of-control X-Jet! - why not bamf to the GROUND INSTEAD, EINSTEIN? Matter of fact, why not individually bamf EVERYONE down to the ground? This is the quandary that writers of superhero films must face: all these beings put together make up a formidable force and if they logically reasoned through any predicament, NOTHING could ultimately harm them. When Wolverine barks, 'Don't we have any weapons in this heap?', the full portent of his question hits us when Storm's eyes go white Â they're ALL Walking Weapons. Yet here is another mis-use of 'power' from that same scene: Couldn't Storm (who has just conjured more twisters than there were in the movie Twister) conjure a mighty updraft to float the X-Jet safely to earth?; couldn't Jean (who has just utilized her telekinesis to explode a missile) also float the jet down safely?; couldn't Iceman create a slide of ice?; the potential list of 'saves' goes on Â yet, it's Airport '75 up in that converted Blackbird and Our Man Charlton ain't nowhere in sight. Instances like these really make you wonder whether you ARE on the Right Side, rooting for these insensate clowns, when the ostensible Bad Guy Â Magneto Â is the only one with any brains, balls or mutant clout to actually SAVE the jet.Admittedly, even in the comics, utilization of super-powers are oft-times foregone in favor of plot development.The DVD commentaries *infuriate* with their naivete: cast and crew misuse and completely misunderstand the word 'evolution', continually saying 'evolve' where they simply should say 'develop', illustrating an utter ignorance of this world-shaping concept. 'Evolution' is a process by which mutated genes, if they enable an organism to better adapt to its environment, are 'selected' and passed on. Less-adaptable organisms are leached out of the pathway of Life vis a vis 'natural selection'. Not being an essay on 'evolution' per se, this skeletal description will have to suffice to illustrate the ingenuousness of terms like 'character evolution'.The DVD also bludgeons viewers with the unsubtle 'message' of tolerance. As if the raison d'etre of this movie IS to promote tolerance and NOT to make sinful amounts of exploitative cash. By exploiting a 'minority' existing in fantasy, they audaciously attach this analogy to world problems, and then pretend they CARE. The fact that this movie issues from one of the most insular, IN-tolerant places on earth Â Hollywood Â makes that 'message' all the more hypocritical and straight-up shameless prevarication.The X-Men's 'message' has nothing to do with why this film was made - the current rash of superhero movies is not being voraciously consumed faster than they can be made because audiences wish to imbue themselves with spiritual elevation; no, superhero-mania is the latest fad in a long line of film fads Â remember all those 'war' movies after WWII?; all the 'westerns' of the forties through sixties; the 'cop' films of the seventies; 'slasher' films of the eighties; the genres of 'baseball', 'family', 'romantic comedies', et al. 'Superhero' films now join the carousel of bankable corporate products Â because the generation who grew up enamored with comics is now at an age where THEY are making the major business decisions in the world. So please Â spare us the faux-philanthropy and get on with entertaining us for our cash.",7,1,2,4 December 2004
RED," Red-Blooded American Funtime.
","A shoot-em-up, rock-em sock-em age-fest.RED is Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman; they're ex-CIA, Retired Extremely Dangerous. You betcha - each of these operatives could wipe out whole cities: Willis with his arctic cool, Malko with his leering morbidity, Helen Mirren with her sexagenarian sexiness and Morgan Freeman with his pompous voice-over.The four principals have more years between them than all the stars of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL combined. Ironically, watching HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL can kill you faster than any RED.From a DC Comics graphic novel (by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner), RED follows Frank Moses (Willis) as he evades CIA operatives sent to kill him, led by Cooper (Karl Urban). It's easy to evade bad guys in movies who still can't aim after all those years of CIA training. Yes, it's the yawn plot device of CIA trying to kill its own ex-operatives. Frank recruits his old team mates to get to the bottom of why. (Why? Because it's the CIA, stupid! That's what they do.) Cooper culls Frank's file from curmudgeonly CIA analyst, Ernest Borgnine (that guy's still alive?!).Beautiful Mary-Louise Parker is Sarah, a cubicled government accountant who dwells romantically on her spy novels, merely a phone flirtation for Frank, until he inadvertently pulls her into the chase and she finds herself on the lam with an All-American Hero more virile than any Fabio-based cover model. Her wonderment, amusement and sensual excitement are pitch-perfect, with just that right dash of spinner cuteness. Positively glowing.Brian Cox is The Russian Guy. Was Rade Sherbedgia busy? Suddenly - Richard Dreyfuss! He's a slimy weapons contractor (cough--Halliburton) who's been using the CIA as his personal hit squad (cough--Dick Cheney-- Didn't Dreyfuss already play that low swine in W.?) RED is solid action-comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, yet seriously commits to delivering cheeky China White straight-to-the-vein outlandish bombast. Just how drunk was the stunt coordinator who thought up the eye-popping gag of Willis stepping from a spinning car, guns aimed and blazing? And how uber cool (and slightly sexually arousing) is Helen Mirren pumping an automatic machine gun or Bruce Willis in hand-to-hand combat beating up on some guy half his age? Of course, the mindless action would be immaterial were it not punctuated by the personalities of the principals; Willis, Malkovich, Mirren and Freeman armed not only with guns that never run out of ammo, but a dry, deadly wit that only comes with the accumulation of years that these wolves have spent howling at the moon.",6,2,4,24 November 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Ring's The Thing
","Precognitive Spoilers. Okay, tattered robes deployed? Â check; multiple story lines at the ready to entwine and entangle viewers? Â check; sets constructed on a budget which would've stamped out hunger in Ethiopia? Â check; everyone smeared in poo? Â check Â let's roll!Trust me, Gentle Viewer, if you've not seen the first two installments of this bloated, beguiling masterpiece, or if you've not read the rambling, roiling Lord Of The Rings book (often regarded as a 'trilogy'), do not watch The Return Of The King. It will only necessitate calling the Dial-A-Geek Hotline to elicit logical explanations as to how a supernatural being could manifest itself as an all-seeing Eye and then have the Abbot&Costello mentality to only monitor the spots where this Eye is actually 'looking'; and why Gandalf, who rescued Frodo from Mount Doom at movie's end with the aid of deus ex machina giant eagles, could not have done the same three hours ago and *flown* Frodo to Mount Doom in the first place; and why Viggo looks so masculine in Return Of The King and so uber-gay in Hidalgo. Us outsiders to the Dungeons & Dragons phenomenon will never knowÂIf taken as a movie unto itself, it is merely noteworthy, though disjointed. But this movie should be regarded as the last three hours of a grand tale so epic and awe-inspiring that it *needed* nine hours to faithfully tell it. (Even so, we get the superfreaks complaining that it was *too short*!). Of the eight endings in the film, there was one in which Aragorn actually found some soap. There was also another ending in which Jackson let slide the fact that we could clearly distinguish (in rear views) the child-actors in place of Hobbits; thrown in somewhere was a happy ending, a sad ending, a token African-American ending and one which involved everyone jumping on Frodo's bed in slow motion like a lingerie ad.I must admit to shedding a lonely tear whenever I think of how massive the delight of J.R.R. Tolkein might have been had he the opportunity to see his masterpiece transformed into such a Â well, a masterpiece. Peter Jackson is a genius Â there's no doubt about that. And these Rings films are unparalleled in cinematic history. Words fail. The wealth of creative staff employed by Jackson brought a depth to the visualization of Tolkein's wonders that Tolkein himself would never have had the capacity to envision Â case in point: those elephantine war-chariots. Take a close look at their armaments and battle-ornamentation and then imagine a lad from 1950's British society seeing this on screen Â to him, this 'reality' would be literally as magical as the tale he was telling.Nonetheless, I find I am constantly torn between piling praise on the herculean movie-making task that Jackson succeeded in fulfilling, and nitpicking plot holes in the storyline, which is no fault of Jackson's, and which, if Jackson is to remain faithful to the book, must necessarily be integral to the film's storyline. For example, if all elves are immortal, shouldn't they all attain a certain age and then stop aging? Ultimately, your father should end up looking exactly like your brother - and fathers and daughters would look like brothers and sisters Â correct? Yet why does Elrond look like Liv Tyler's drunken, old, cross-dressing uncle? And why should they all go sailing off somewhere into the sunset in order to be immortal? Immortal is immortal, no matter *where* you spend your days cross-dressing.In Two Towers, why is Theoden's Kingdom located so far from their stronghold, Helm's Deep? In order to retreat to this supposedly strategic bastion, one must put the lives of the whole kingdom at stake by taking women and children over unprotected miles of open ground Â good strategy! Wouldn't it make better sense to simply make your kingdom's residence at Helm's Deep?And those Dead Souls from the Mountain Â did they really have to take a BOAT to the battle at Pelennor Fields?And I cannot, cannot, CANNOT, stomach predestination in any form; too much prophesying and foretelling and precognition and idiot phrases like, 'What does your heart tell you?' If Elrond foresaw Frodo's demise in delivering the Ring to Mount Thunder (Galadriel tells him this via some kind of mind-meld in Two Towers) - well, why go at all? Oh, that's right: because we have the power to CHANGE our destiny Â well then, all your prophesying and soothsaying is HEARSAY anyway if you're going to adopt that standpoint!Whenever Theoden shouts orders amidst a battle, or when Saruman speaks to 10,000 slavering orcs, I'm reminded of Monty Python's Life Of Brian, where Jesus speaks to the multitudes and those in the back are yelling, 'Speak Up!' and 'He said, 'Blessed are the cheesemakers!''.Inconsistency: In Two Towers, those elephantine beasts are called 'oliphaunts' by Sam, yet these same beasts are called 'mumakil' in Return Of The King. Tolkien did not describe either beast in detail in the book. The biggest question of all, surrounding this whole shebang, is, of course, if a supernatural entity has the wherewithal to forge a talisman of illimitable power Â The One Ring, that which all the poking and puking is over Â upon 'losing' it (which would seem almost impossible in the first place, for a being who can 'sense' The Ring's presence) Â well, why not simply forge another? End of story.Poor Frodo and Viggo and Don Gandalfino, when all they had to do was tell the Big Dark Guy to make another ring and leave us be; instead spending three years putting on the sour pusses and being covered in poo.

Munich," An Ingenious Fantasy by a Fantasy Genius.
","'Munich' is not about Munich. Nor is it about events which followed the massacre of Israeli athletes. It is about Steven Spielberg's ego. And how far into audacious he can drive it without becoming Oliver Stone.This movie's tagline boasts, 'The world was watching in 1972 as 11 Israeli athletes were murdered at the Munich Olympics. This is the story of what happened next.' Well, not exactly. It's what author George Jonas, screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, and film-maker Steven Spielberg *think* happened next.'Munich' opens with a brutally-graphic hostage-taking sequence; Palestinian guerrilla group Black September killing and cudgeling the Israeli barracks into submission; news programs worldwide replaying that famous footage of the masked terrorist on the balcony we all remember watching obliviously as kids.But before this sequence Â four glib words: INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS - simultaneously endowing the movie with *faux* import whilst granting Spielberg 'artistic license' Â in other words, granting him the impunity to lie off the hook. The source material for this film solely being Jonas' self-admittedly uncorroborated book ('Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team'), makes this movie as much a fantasy as 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark.' As Lew Wallace's decorative details in 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ' (1880) achieved 'fact' status simply through their compelling documentation in a powerful work of art, (even though the supposed Christian source tome, the King James Bible, is devoid of those details), it is only a matter of time before Spielberg's fiction will be regarded as doctrine if no further documentation of these events is made. (I doubt anyone will remember Michael Anderson's 'Sword Of Gideon' in 1986 Â lesser movie, from same book.) Eric Bana (still trim, taut and Troy-riffic from his last feature) is Avner, a Jewish family man and Mossad agent, called upon by Israeli Prime Minister, Golda Mier (Lynn Cohen) to lead a covert team in blood-revenge for the Munich massacre. Much is made over Mier's rationalization of morality Â every 'Munich' reviewer revels in flaunting her line - yet Mier only verbalizes (euphemistically, at best) how every individual behaves in every situation they encounter Â by 'negotiating compromises with their own values', i.e. using 'circumstantial morality'. There is *no* Kantian 'outside morality'; it is *all* Nietzschean nihilism. Truth cuts to cure. Was it not blood retribution that George W. Bush called for (admittedly less articulately) in retaliation against September 2001's terrorist attacks? Did not America rally behind him like maniacal rednecks out for Middle Eastern blood? Where was your morality then, Christians?More intriguing than morality conundrums is the mindset that would allow a person to pawn themselves out to a government who admit openly that they will deny your existence - and probably try to make you *truly* non-existent Â simply for performing a duty for your country. (Maybe the government stance on anyone sociopathic enough to accept their 'uncivilized' assignments in the first place, is to summarily excise those unbalanced personalities from society.) Whether the vengeance squad questioned the morality of their actions is simply 'writer's speculation', and is a storytelling staple akin to anthropomorphizing animals: to add dramatic flesh to the plot and to better identify with the characters Â but can people who enter into such one-way self-sacrifices be understood or 'humanized' at all?Avner's team, four misfits from various middle-class walks of life, includes Robert the toymaker-turned-bombmaker (Mathieu Kassovitz), who bears a disturbing resemblance to Arnold Horshack, and who pulls the short straw to perform the first execution with Avner. In a flustered scene, their hesitancy at pulling the triggers whilst facing their target - questioning the target insistently with no defining answers - illustrates that even with purchased 'intelligence information', Avner still has deep-rooted doubts as to whether their targets are the actual terrorists. But again, we must ask: when the original Mossad agent dictated his tale to George Jonas, did he merely add this trait to his personality to humanize himself? Or did Jonas add this element to elicit sympathy for the titular 'heroes' exacting revenge - for without this hesitancy in killing, wouldn't that make them as evil as the terrorists they were executing? Avner's operatives complete 5 of the 11 killings before the movie Â and, we presume, the piecemeal intel the real-life assassins had to work with - runs out of steam. Munich's powerful performances, masterful cinematography and direction are tempered by its slipshod conclusion, which leaves no resolution to the storyline (supposedly 'true', so left dangling and expecting forgiveness), and a hundred rhetorical questions in its wake: does retaliation benefit economically or politically?; how does a retaliatory individual or nation return to their former steady state?; will Arnold Horshack ever graduate?...Having wiped the term 'politically incorrect' from his vernacular after 'Jaws', 'revenge killing' would seem outside the Spielberg canon Â but as long as both predators and prey in 'Munich' sport indeterminate Middle Eastern accents, Spielberg could rest assured that ruffled feathers would only belong to pundits unimportant to the funding and distribution of the film. Minority groups could whine over unfair depictions, but their placarding of theaters and seeking of reparations would only lend impetus to the film in the western-dominated avenues where it is slated to reap its income.Anyway, after the bloodlust directed at all Middle Easterners after the 9/11 debacle (in such an arbitrarily juvenile manner that Public Service Announcements had to be aired actually describing the ideological, religious and national differences between foreigners of Middle Eastern descent), how much does White America *really* care about Arab nations assailing each other's jugulars - in a world INSPIRED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG?(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,1,5,9 January 2006
The Truman Show," Masterpiece in a Microcosm
","Jim Carrey is overdue being lauded as one of the Great American Actors, especially after his performance in The Truman Show.Written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, 1997) in an audacious fit of prescience, Truman Burbank (Carrey) is an unsuspecting pawn in the most ambitious reality show ever conceived - while the world watches, a complete community of actors creates an Anytown America reality for one unsuspecting protagonist - Truman - raised from birth in a massive thunderdome, encompassing the town of Seahaven where even the weather and the sky, the sun and moon are computer programs.We pick up the story when Truman is 30, ambivalently married to Meryl (Laura Linney), downing the occasional brewski with best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich) and cruising listlessly through his unrewarding insurance job. One million hidden cameras broadcast his every move.He might have continued the Leave it to Beaver lifestyle till his death were it not for a few unrelated events that created a glitch in his perception of reality, allowing him to discover that his 'reality' was someone else's 'fiction' - an intricately complex microcosm of the real world.And therein lies the hook of The Truman Show. Directed by Peter Weir (Gallipoli, 1981, Dead Poet's Society, 1989), this movie poses the ultimate question, 'Is Reality what we perceive it to be?' Long have we stood solid on the credos, 'Seeing is believing' and 'Perception is reality' but this movie proves the fragility of those precepts. We perceive all our 'realities' through points of reference - we are told this is the sky, the sun, the city, we are told a day is 24 hours long (from an arbitrary measurement which is not entirely accurate); we have agreed on the nature of things (truth, murder, war, dishonesty) and though we think that all we see is 'real,' and all we feel is untampered emotions, the media, through unreliable sources (television news reports, tabloids, governments) force our perception through a common strainer, molding reality to their ends.This movie is also testament that the inquiring mind cannot be contained no matter the inculcation. Truman WANTS to discover new horizons; to think outside his box. When computer glitches alert him to his being watched, it inspires him to get to the bottom of the mystery.The movie takes us outside the prison, beyond the dome, with creator of 'The Truman Show,' Christof (Ed Harris in a chilling rendition of a god complex - the name Christof is no accident), giving us flashbacks of Truman's early years, including a chance meeting with a female extra, Lauren (Natascha McElhone). While the script called for Truman to meet and marry Meryl, he fell for Lauren; while Christof's scripters scrambled to excise Lauren from the storyline of Truman's life, his 'true' emotions would lead him to forever pine for Lauren, going so far as to clandestinely construct a composite picture of her face from magazine models.Look for Paul Giamatti, pre-awards, as the sympathetic Control Room Director and Harry Shearer, perfect as Christof's interviewer. Brian Delate, who must be sick to death of people asking him, 'Are you Charles Grodin?' plays Truman's father.Back in 1998, it may have been considered unlikely that the major players in Truman's fantasy - his wife and best friend - would give up their own lives and aspirations to be a part of Truman's fiction, but after the advent of execrable stupidities like Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? (2000) or The Bachelor (2002), it has become somewhat acceptable for monetary gain, infamy and exposure as an ignorant git to replace brains, aspirations and even what people consider their very souls. Hollywood synergy (read as tacit plagiarism) also saw the release of a similar-themed, inferior 'reality' movie, EDtv in 1999; whereas Truman exposed numerous layers of hypocrisy in our society, EDtv was as thematically deep as a Slip-n-Slide.Eventually, Truman undergoes a reverse Copernican Revolution, where he discovers that the sun, moon and society itself really DID revolve around him - and instead of finding fulfillment, discovers emptiness in being the center of the universe.In the greatest irony of all, Truman tries to escape his Seahaven prison, knowing that after escaping into the REAL world, he would become an unknown; unlike all the drogues in the 'reality' shows that would come on the heels of this movie, Truman WANTS to be just another face in the crowd, not singled out or made a fuss over - yet it was his drive and uniqueness that enabled him to see beyond his imprisonment and yearn for fulfillment in the first place.At times poignant, at times funny, always an undertone of darkness, The Truman Show is a metaphor for the pioneering spirit which cannot be contained; never more apparent than the final scenes where Truman pounds on the blue-sky wall as Burkhard von Dallwitz's soundtrack swells to tear-welling proportions.The paradoxical and disturbing messages in this movie should be examined for decades to come. Instead, the voyeuristic aspect of The Truman Show has been catapulted to brain-leaching proportions by a society that would more readily watch 'reality' than live it.",9,0,2,26 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Legend Begins... from the middle...
","*Star Wars* was a revelation and a revolution. There will never be anything like it again. From its unique production values, to its pioneering special effects; it was cops and robbers, it was swords and sorcery, it was politics and romance; it was royalty and rebellion; it was car chases in space chariots and computer whizbangery from sentient trashcans. A villain in black, a hero in white, a wizard in robes, a cowboy and his trusted, naked animal friend...Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a farmboy on the desert world of Tatooine (even though his sandy-haired complexion screams surfer dude from Palos Verdes), who dreams of piloting a fighter plane instead of working a farm. Like all young men, he has been brought up to believe murdering innocent children in war is a more romantic idiom than toiling the soil and bringing forth sustenance for humanity. I digress.His dreams might have remained as distant as Palos Verdes is from Tatooine, had he not met two robots (nÃ©e droids), a sentient trashcan (R2-D2) and an acolyte of Dr. Zachary Smith (C-3PO Â an interpreter fluent in 6 million languages with the unfortunate default setting on Perturbed Butler). In R2-D2's memory banks, Luke accidentally discovers a holographic cry for help from a princess (Carrie Fisher). So begins a journey which will take him to the farthest reaches of the galaxy Â to him, that would be ten miles down the road to the cave of doddering Alec Guinness (as Obi-Wan Kenobi), who spins wild tales of galactic war, Imperial armies, Luke's deceased father and The Knights Who Say Jedi. At Mos Eisley spaceport, while canvassing for a clandestine captain to fly them to planet Alderaan (where the cry for help bid them go), Luke and Obi-Wan meet the most sexual character of the *Star Wars* series Â no, not Han Solo Â Chewbacca the Wookiee; after all, he does the whole movie without ever wearing any pants. It is during this Mos Eisley 'cantina sequence' that *Star Wars* does its most insidious good. George Lucas unwittingly shows us a universe where aliens were neither inherently 'good' nor 'evil', rather co-existing in a truly 'universal' society, where good or evil individuals populate *every* species and race. The term 'alien' is a moot point of reference in this movie, as every being (human and otherwise) traveled extensively between worlds. (The fact that this cannot be achieved without faster-than-light travel is tangential to the point.) The common thread of these disparate organisms is their multifarious strangeness; their co-existing diversity.Ironically, the cantina sequence - which features some of the most childish, lamest face-masks and character designs - is ultimately where the movie displays its most maturity. Meanwhile, a hulking, black-clad, helmeted menace in a fruity cape and 7-inch platform boots plots to rule the galaxy, with theme music heavy and minor and an army of stormtroopers - the military equivalent of fast food (plastic-coated and unhealthy) - bringing war in the name of hokey religion.His name is Darth Vader. To three generations, Lord Vader was the blackest, meanest, most badass villain to dress like the Pope since the Pope. Years later, we would discover that Darth Vader meant 'dark father' in Swahili, a fact which jigsawed with the puzzle pie that George carbon-scored into the *Star Wars* sequel, *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980), proving that it wasn't just Â as he liked to call it Â a 'space opera,' more like a space SOAP opera. Darth and an old lady who looks like Peter Cushing kidnap the princess and tool through the galaxy in a planet-sized battle station called the Death Star, proving its awesome utility by decimating Alderaan, whereupon Obi-Wan, en route, coincidentally suffers indigestion and attributes it to mysticism rather than his ninety-year-old intestines, 'as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.' (More like that Neimoidian calamari you ate, which was in the Millennium Falcon's fridge since before Han made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs.)(Read this full review at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/StarWarsANewHope.html)",10,5,11,3 July 2007
Get Him to the Greek," Going Greek: it only hurts if you're sober.
","Drugs, bitches, rock stars, alcohol poisoning - geez! 'Get Him To The Greek' is like one of my regular Tuesdays.In this Judd Apatow-produced road movie, Aaron Green (Jonah Hill, looking like a grounded zeppelin) has three days to get British rock legend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, intensity of a charged defibrillator) from England to Los Angeles, for a 10th anniversary concert at the Greek Theater.Sean Combs (or whatever his fad name is now: P-Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, Diddy, Poffy, et al.) brings the pain as the record executive and self-proclaimed 'mindfucking expert' Sergio, who orders Green to escort Aldous to the Greek, and then turns up mid-journey to stroke the furry walls with Green when Aldous slips him a Jeffrey.You don't wanna know.Written and directed by Nicholas Stoller, 'Get Him To The Greek' is a delicious slice of rock and roll madness and simultaneously a vacation from the thinking part of your brain. The hedonism and gauche antics of Aldous may be drawn from rock star mythos, but the simplistic idea of a concert at the Greek Theater being staged three days from its inception is patently brainless.Yet that is the ticking clock: get the rock star from England to America in three days for a gig which we just brainstormed yesterday; no need to call agents, licensing companies, production personnel or band members; no need for rehearsals, soundchecks, hiring gear; no need for contracts, negotiations, safety regulations; no need to even call the Greek Theater to see if they're booked - just plan the concert and everything magically falls into place. In this movie world, the hardest part about putting on a concert is having the artist actually appear, whereas in the real world, just negotiating the blue M&Ms on the rider is a three-week blood-letting ordeal.Deliberately British Russell Brand (known to American audiences since FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, 2008, and his devilish standup special RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY, 2009) is fierce, a pacing animal, twitching and gyrating and lip-licking in low-slung trousers; Jonah Hill was the charging beast when he was let loose in SUPERBAD - here Brand pummels him with salacious energy; it's the exact relationship Aldous shares with Aaron Green - slipping him mickeys, loose women, injecting him with adrenaline, and eventually convincing Green to patch up his shaky relationship with his girl (Elisabeth Moss) by having a threesome with them.Brand's performance reminds me of a quote from The New Yorker Apr 2007, Sasha Frere-Jones writing about Prince: 'When he simply cocked his head and smiled, it seemed like an act of public lewdness.' We are witnessing the launch of a superstar.In FUNNY PEOPLE, plump Jonah Hill tells a slim Seth Rogen, 'You shouldn't have lost all that weight, man. There's nothing funny about a physically fit man.' But someone should warn Hill that the converse is also true. While Jack Black, Chris Farley, John Belushi and Fred Flintstone may be pulling laughs with their acceptable rotundity, Hill's girth in 'Get Him To The Greek' is frankly disturbing, and a distraction to his comedic chops. As he approaches The Gabriel Inglesias he should remember that there's nothing funny about morbidly obese either.Like every Apatow piece, 'Greek' takes strange dark turns and creates sweet captured moments that seem all the more amazing for their randomness. After the banal, laugh-out-loud scene of Green shoving heroin up his bumhole to smuggle it onto a plane for Aldous, there is sudden silence in the audience when Aldous cusses out Green for destroying the heroin, demeaning Green for not understanding addiction and yet demeaning himself for being a slave to it. Scenes like this keep Apatow miles above the usual fare of lowbrow comedies that are his closest rivals, yet nowhere near him.Though it's done in the spirit of irresponsibility, Aldous takes a detour to visit his dad (Colm Meaney), a musician in Vegas, and through their eternal bickering, there is a moment where we sneak up on them sharing a song together - and then get right back to bickering. Again - Judd Apatow, you maniac genius! There are the formulaic moments, when we realize Aldous's arc involves reconciling with his girlfriend (Rose Byrne) who is sleeping with Lars Ulrich (playing himself), and that he necessarily must get off the drugs. Only by pleasing the craven hypocritical witchfynders who call themselves the MPAA will the film gain distribution; the beige activists at the Motion Picture Association of America literally blackmailing mediocrity into each and every American film release.Creative direction, split-screening establishing shots, a thousand one-liners that you will miss from laughing so hard in the frenetic middle act with Diddy attacking everyone while stroking the furry walls. And whenever T-Rex's 20th Century Boy is launched onto a soundtrack, it takes any movie to another level.Apatow has maintained 'Get Him To The Greek' is anti-drug and anti-excess - but the message is lost somewhat when the coolest cats in the movie are having this much corrosive fun roaring, rogering, gorging and puking while on drugs, drink and dames. The message to some might just be: We should all be so lucky to try a little excess sometime.Just drop by my place any given Tuesday.",7,0,2,21 July 2010
300," Body-shaved for Glory
","That reminds me, I need to hit the gym.Some say *300* is as violent as *Apocalypto*, but it's not. *300* elevates violence to a new level Â violence as art. Sure, *Apocalypto* and other movies that push the envelope on graphic pain could be construed as 'art' Â for the technicality that they are purveyed through an artistic medium - but only in *300* is the leg-lopping and artery-severing so balletic; only in *300* is the glittering pain so beautifully blood-smattered, so sensually body-oiled.*300* is ostensibly the story (legend, if you will) of 300 Spartans led by King Leonidas, who fanatically and suicidally opposed 100,000 Persians at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.But other than that base fact of 300 battle-bred Spartans (allied with a sprinkling of undisciplined warriors from other city-states) smashing up against the insurmountable forces of Persian King Xerxes, most of this movie is fancy-pants in a jester's bodysuit. Exhibit A: Xerxes himself (Rodrigo Santoro) - eight-foot tall, golden-skinned, face- and body-pierced androgyne with a ProTools voice.I'm pretty sure there were no *Lord of the Rings* elephants back in 480 BC; neither were there giant ogres, mountainous rhinos or executioners with blades for arms; *300* shoves dramatic license in our faces like a Medical Marijuana Certificate whilst paying documented historical accuracy the shortest of shrifts. But the movie Â and this review - should not be judged on didacticism. If you didn't pay attention in school, I'm not going to refresh your memory of the Hot Gates here Â read about it on the net. The beauty of this movie lies not in its adherence to fact, but, quite simply, in its Beauty. It just LOOKS so damn good.Even before we mention the director or writer, the art directors should receive their accolades - Isabelle Guay, Nicolas Lepage and Jean-Pierre Paquet. The CGI staff also warrant a hefty mention (without whom this movie would have no backgrounds!), imbuing such a vibrancy of rust colors, warmth and grit to the production that every single frame is a 70's album cover.Directed effusively by Zack Snyder, screen-played by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon (from the graphic novel by *Sin City*'s Frank Miller and Lynn Varley), *300* is a living, breathing Frank Frazetta or Boris Vallejo, screaming at the seams in four dimensions.As with Miller's *Sin City*, sex and violence is back on the big screen where it belongs.In this world where kings were Real Men and torsos were chiseled like marble statues, we meet Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Baker Â who only 4 years ago made a mule's ass of himself in Richard Donner's beyond-pathetic *Timeline*, now making mule's asses of everyone around him with his Stentorian resolve, power pecs and Abs Absolute), who holds a very modern view of the Delphic Oracle ('not taking the ravings of a drunk teenager seriously') and leads his warriors to battle against a Persian invasion contra the advice of the Ephors (a council of elders suspiciously resembling Yellow Bastard Â either lepers or really heavy drinkers Â Frank Miller's fingerprint, mayhaps?).Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) sees Leonidas off with the Spartan credo on her lips, 'Come back with your shield or on it'; as the Spartans themselves slam into glorious battle, spitting, 'No prisoners! No mercy!' Strategically using the narrow Thermopylae Pass as his stand, Leonidas negates the overwhelming might of the Persian army, who are forced to come at the Spartans in manageable numbers, breaking like ephemeral surf upon Leonidas' indestructible Spartan phalanx.When Leonidas bellows, 'No Spartan dies today!' we *know* he means it. It is the resolve of a REAL leader, the likes of which the world of politics (read 'duplicity') has long since forgotten Â this is not someone who would hide behind his disgraced office, his criminal cabinet and his unmitigated ignorance and pigeon-chested physical weakness Â Leonidas bellows from the front line of a death-dealing phalanx, shield and spear wielded for Maximum Hurting. No prisoners. No mercy. No rhetoric.After awe-inspiring battles (where film-speed works as effectively as CGI to convey the mÃªlÃ©e Â sudden slomo alternated with sudden slashing speed), where we see the machinery of the concerted Spartan shield and thrust attack in its trained glory; after building their enemies' bodies into unbreachable walls and massacring the feared, 'unkillable' Immortals in their hundreds, the Spartans are undone by betrayal.Trained from youth to be insensitive, unfeeling killing machines, even betrayal cannot make them turn tail or change their tactics. The Spartans embraced death as lustily as they lived life, so when Leonidas exhorts his men to 'Prepare for glory!' they look forward to a 'good death,' not victory. They all die (not that I want to ruin the end, but if you'd listened in school, you'd know this). Yet the 300's glorious, doomed stand served to unite the Greek states, enabling them to halt the Persian assault on other fronts.*300* uses that old ploy of giving British accents to the ancients, because Â well, somehow, it just sounds right. Baker infuses his Leonidas with a Connery-syrup brogue and a very pointy beard, Vincent Regan is wholly British as Captain, and David Wenham (in the largest leap of any of these actors - from *Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course* to Thermopylae) narrates in squinty, Aussie-Briton melodramatic over-cheese. Having seen them for years in other roles, the question remains, 'Under all their clothes, were these guys always that built and body-shaved?' Truly, a Guy Movie Â with startlingly-defined abs for the laydayz. (The Spartans did, in fact, wear breastplates, but again Â no apologies for liberties, especially body-oiled liberties.) Speaking of body-oil, think I'll work on my abs todayÂ",8,1,5,26 March 2007
Apollo 13," The Greatest Successful Failure of All Time
","'O, swear not by the moon, the fickle moon, the inconstant moonÂ' Â Shakespeare, 'Romeo and Juliet'.I smell that familiar kerosene funk in the air: solid rocket boosters firing, RP-1 propellant and liquid hydrogen surging, flux capacitor giga-watting - yes, it's the Tom Hanks Oscar-Machine chugging rugged in red-carpet mode. Trying to film a story with so many integral characters is impossible with a camera-magnet like Hanks tooling around on set. Our media-driven lifestyle denotes that 'star-power' dictates character importance in a movie, so though Hanks may be playing a prominent role as one of three astronauts imperiled by the Apollo 13 malfunction, Every Single Member of NASA is equally worthy of the limelight blindingly focused on Mr. Fantastic. Though not a Hanks-Hater, I feel credit is squandered on his character of Jim Lovell, simply because said character is played by Statuette Boy. In the real world, credit for the rescue of the seemingly-doomed Apollo 13 spacecraft is dispersed throughout hundreds of personnel, each of them a Hero, with a capital 'H': not least, the Flight Directors, Gene Kranz, Glynn Lunney and John Aaron (Kranz played by Ed Harris, the most notable actor of the FD's, thereby implying he was the most 'important' Â once again, sigh). Lunney, Kranz's relief FD, was played excellently by a stoic Marc McClure and Aaron - the FD who identified 'power' as key factor in the life-saving stakes, thereby engineering the decision to 'turn off everything but the essentials' Â was fleshed out by the clinical-tastic Loren Dean. Astronaut Ken Mattingly, dropped from the original Apollo 13 crew and earthbound for medical reasons, was personified by the suave intensity of Gary Sinise. Lovell's crew were Fred Haise (played by Bill Paxton, in his patented 'Game over, man!' swoon) and John Swigert (the ever-dependable Kevin Bacon, whose presence in this movie with so many other A-Listers puts him at least 'two degrees' closer to about 436 other actorsÂ)Unlike the DeLorean DMC-12, or the LZ 129 Hindenburg, or the RMS Titanic - all failures on a grand scale, all seemingly trespassing on virgin technology and future advancement, with each failure marking the end of an era for their respective milieux Â the 'failure' of the Apollo 13 lunar mission aided in advancing space-faring dialect and paved the future with skyward momentum for the International Space Station, the Space Transportation System (Shuttles), Mars Soft Landers and beyondÂDisabled by a wiring malfunction explosion, Apollo 13's prime directive shifted from 'frolic on moon at taxpayers' expense' to 'stay alive, no matter what occurs'. As a result of the explosion, technical problems compound, each adversity overlapping the previous one, with the spacecraft crew and Mission Control united against the exigencies of the failing mission itself.Director Ron Howard intelligently chose to have nothing more than true-to-life events provide the drama of 'Apollo 13'; as obvious as this may sound, very few 'true' or 'inspired by' films refrain from inserting Hollywood subplot and clichÃ© to ramp up the stakes Â with this tale, Howard did not need to. The phrase, 'You can't make this sh*t up!' springs to mind, as all the 'formulae' were present: 'ticking clocks', 'family stakes', 'technological adversity as villain', all encapsulated in the real life tale of three astronauts who missed the moon but unwittingly hit a jackpotÂHad the Apollo 13 crewmen died during their rescue attempt, American fortitude would have suffered a blow infinitely worse than the beating it took when either of the lightning-quick Shuttle disasters stunned the nation. With the Shuttles, it was over before anyone had time to realize problems had even arisen. With Apollo 13, manifest effort was expended over the course of four days; a public vigil during an avalanche of adversity that would have broken the back of America if the crew had not survived. And in the surviving, gradually attaining a 'success' (read as 'fame') far greater than any of the men who actually trod the Moon's surface (barring Armstrong and Aldrin). Proof? Tell me: who were the three astronauts of Apollo 14? (Not even Apollo 11 had the honor of having a PINBALL MACHINE created after them.) In the movie, responding to the notion that it could be 'the worst disaster NASA's ever experienced', Ed Harris retorts, 'I believe this is going to be our finest hour.' He was right. An exemplary aspect of this film is the unobtrusiveness of its computer-generated visuals. Though Georgie Lucas believes he has the monopoly on CGI-film-making (simply because he owns the company that icings a large percentage of A-List blockbuster), Ron Howard illustrates Â via Digital Domain's finesse - how to incorporate CGI into one's movie with class and taste. Quite simply - this is as good as it gets! Every star-field, exterior shot and moon view is seamless subtlety; without even realizing it, we see *all-new* footage of Apollo 13 rising on the Saturn V pillar of fire; Hanks' fantasy of descending to the Moon's surface (made ever more poignant by the fact that he has lost the opportunity) captures the sheer, crazy joy of raking one's fingers through regolith and gazing skywards at a gibbous earth-riseÂ No need for dandy villains, exotic beasts or killer droids, Howard's judicious use of CGI captures everything that Lucas' imprudent abuse lost Â true magnificence and awe.Lucas directed Howard in 'American Graffiti'. In sooth, the Padawan has become the Master.It is a testament to the talent of this Master that he could fashion such an involving movie from three guys stranded in a refrigerator for a week and a pack of Reservoir Dogs jargonizing at outdated computers.If not for those Apollo 13 'failures' (Lovell, Haise and Swigert), Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14 might have had a more glorious day in the sun Â or the Moon, as it wereÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",9,5,9,6 September 2005
Pineapple Express," The Fast Track to Brotherly J.
","Well, it in't MIDNIGHT EXPRESS.Welcome to the new edge of comedy. There's something very brave about Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films - how they eschew Hollywood protocol and make their leading men (their male leads) each other's love interest! Not gay. Love, you prurient, fundamentalist bigots. Two men who can swear eternal love for each other and not come off homo. But bromo.Is PINEAPPLE EXPRESS just another 'bromance': two immature boy-stoners who can't forge a 'real' relationship with a female, so run around holding hands, on the lam from drug dealers? Well, the 'bromosexual' tag (although hilarious) doesn't do this film justice; like many Apatow films, EXPRESS takes the brave stance of relegating what is considered the driving force in most movies - female approbation - to the sidelines. Amber Heard plays Seth Rogen's nominal girlfriend, a smokin' female 'lead,' but when she disappears during the second act and we never hear from her again - we don't miss her!Seth Rogen is stoner action hero, Dale, with James Franco as Saul, his airheaded dealer. Dale is process serving one day, smoking a Pineapple Express (which he just bought from Saul, who describes it as 'almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn'), when he witnesses a murder. Freaked out, Dale loses the joint in front of the murderer's house and lams it back to Saul's place. The murderer (Gary Cole, in cahoots with Rosie Perez, who seems kinda old to be here) happens to know Pineapple Express and who deals it - Plot Convenience Community Theater, here we come! So begins the pursuit of Dale and Saul by the murderer's henchman, Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson. They are joined by an Eastern-philosophizing mindless loser named Red (Danny 'thug life!' McBride, who may actually be the first to coin 'bromosexual' in the film itself). Another feature of Apatow films is their simple dialog, which avoids the tired comedic punchliner mode and turns up at our door dressed in street cred and drinking a beer, burping in our faces: Saul exclaims at one point, 'Holy cock!'; and as he is dragged towards a manhole, 'What's down there? A rancor?' (RETURN OF THE JEDI, of course); when Dale is confronted by his girlfriend's screaming father (Ed Begley Jr.), 'You assholes do exactly as I say, or I will take you outside and f*** you in the street!' he pleads, 'No! Don't f*** us anywhere!'; Dale describes reincarnation to Red, 'If you're an asshole, you're gonna come back as a cockroach or a worm or a f***in' anal bead, okay? If you're a man and you act heroic, you'll come back as an eagle; you'll come back as a dragon; you'll come back as Jude Law, okay? Which would you rather be?' to which Red replies, 'Maybe the anal bead, depending on who it belongs to.' There's much more - but that's why the movie is made...Rogen does well to hold his own against the 'serious actor,' Franco, and Franco holds his own as a comedy force against the improv gung-ho of Rogen. Judd Apatow's advice on writing comedy: 'Don't worry about making the first draft funny. The movie is going to be funny regardless because we'll cast it with the funniest people around. But for people to stick with it for an hour and a half, it's a drama. A story people can relate to and are interested in following through.' I think that's why Apatow is so successful with his formula - because audiences have had enough of the 'Women Be Everything' mode of storytelling. However, pondering Apatow's formula, we realize it isn't so new and unique - just updated. Remember Laurel and Hardy? Or Martin and Lewis? Two-man teams (or should that be two 'Man-Teams'?) where it didn't matter if they got the girls or not - their arcs involved the dissolution of their partnership and subsequent reconciliation. Women were simply props to acquire, not the central point of existence; the comedy was never centered on how pussy-whipped the men could possibly make themselves before movie's end...And what about the New Bromantics?: Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan...Apatow and Rogen.---Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",7,3,6,17 August 2009
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," How We Know the Earth to be Banana-Shaped.
","Delivered on a budget which would hardly diminish the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow, *Monty Python and The Holy Grail* boasts the production values and inherent quality of a movie ten times its cost.A lesson in resourcefulness, *Holy Grail* succeeds because it excels at what made Hollywood such a star-mart in the first place Â its writing and acting. On a meager budget of 229,000 pounds (approx. $500,000), Python schools Hollywood on the Shakespearean value of playing all the parts yourselves, attending to authenticity in set dressing and costuming, and using really, really silly voices.The first feature film from Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin Â five Englishmen and American Gilliam) would change the course of the comedy river as dramatically as Moses parted the Red Sea. Their arsenic-laced British television series *Monty Python's Flying Circus* (1969-1974) was the zenith of left-turn comedic outrage (in their lifetime, spawning the adjective 'Pythonesque') and *Holy Grail* hailed the zenith of the troupe's creativity, capturing lightning in a parrot cage.King Arthur (Chapman) is empowered by God to seek the Holy Grail, thus surrounding his royal person with the Knights of the Round Table, Sir Lancelot (Cleese), Sir Galahad (Palin), Sir Bedevere (Jones), Sir Robin (Idle) and, with his trusted steed, Patsy (Gilliam, clopping coconuts together simulating hoofbeats), he rides toward CamelotÂ CamelotÂwhere the Knights of the Round Table 'dance whene'er we're able' and 'eat ham and jam and Spam a lot.,' which Arthur surmises is 'a silly place' and avoids, instead journeying with his troop through forests rank with evil, encountering the contempt of French soldiers at Castle Guy de Lombard (who taunt Arthur's 'Ke-niggits' most hurtfully), refrain from the sensuality of all-female Castle Anthrax (where Galahad The Chaste is rescued - somewhat unwillingly - from The Oral Sex), fall into nefarious service of The Knights Who Say Ni (though Arthur provides a well-tended shrubbery as payment, cutting down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring is asking too much); past sentinels who will not let them pass, allying with Tim the Enchanter, battling a killer rabbit with the Holy Hand Grenade, fleeing the Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaaargh, muddling their questions at the Bridge of Death with the Old Man from Scene 24 and ultimately crossing the Gorge of Eternal Peril.Educated, lucid, atheistic, amoral, Monty Python could and did attack every taboo held by the stiff upper crust to the working class alike. Though many have tried - from America's *Saturday Night Live* to Britain's *League of Gentlemen*, with Canada's *Kids In The Hall* brushing up against the magic before their untimely dissolution - retrospect has proved what a *sui generis* troupe Python was.Of course, if you don't 'get' British humor (i.e. REAL humor) or if you don't 'get' Monty Python (for which there is no reason to continue living), let's not bicker and argue over who killed who; you should wait here until I come and get himÂ And no singing! Now go, before I taunt you a second timeÂ.",10,1,2,4 August 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Empirical Satirical
","A better movie than its predecessor (and successors) in every way Â acting, story, direction, set design, writing, and a vastly more mature interrelationship between the love triangle of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and C-3POÂ (I know what you're thinking, what about the triangle of Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo and Chewbacca?) Funnier (Solo is a scream), flirtier (sexual tension between Leia and Solo is almost as strong as that between Luke and Yoda), flamier (uh, C-3PO), *The Empire Strikes Back* is the most 'complete' of any *Star Wars* effort, even though it is the only movie in the series with a beginning and a middle Â but no end! Full credit to the film-makers for the decision to complete the third act *in the next movie!* (I don't perfunctorily credit hack director-writer George Lucas with this decision; about the most credit I'd give him after his atrocious track record of dumb-movies-that-look-slick is creating forward momentum for projects, ensuring they get green lighted, and creating alien names which would be stupid if they weren't so funny.) *Episode V* finds the Rebel Alliance on the ice planet Hoth, for no reason other than to flex efx muscle in the form of stop-motion Imperial 'AT-AT Walkers' Â probably the most poorly designed attack vehicles in the history of warfare.Supposedly 'All Terrain Armored Transport' vehicles, yet resembling sick Indricotheriums, these lumbering behemoths move at the pace of a man running through snow Â an attack speed of about 5 mph - with 4 guns covering only their anterior plane, leaving everywhere else completely exposed to assault from any enemy craft that can travel faster than the average tortoise; a strategic aspect which the Rebels either ignore or are too dumb to exploit, as they fly in hell-tilt FROM THE FRONT, instead of attacking from the rear, where the AT-AT Union wouldn't pay to put gunners Â probably due to new worker compensation laws pertaining to getting what you deserve if you ride in a horse's ass.George's smart move in 'Empire' was to hire a REAL director - Irvin Kershner (one of Lucas' teachers in film school). So even while the strategic lunacy of the AT-AT Walkers reeks of George's padawan paw prints, the film's other opening sequences compellingly show off the emotional ties between the love-hexagon of Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca and the 'droids, C-3PO and R2-D2.Luke has flown to Dagobah where he is accosted by Yoda: Jedi Master of 900 years and Fozzy Bear for the last four (a small green Muppet that Frank Oz operates and voices), who teaches Luke handstands so that if he fails Jedi School, he could fall back on Cirque du Soleil. Yoda's presence in this film counterpoints the frantic situations of the other characters. Amidst the furor of star wars, here was the Jesus character endorsing peace, tranquility, balance; a far cry from the scrapping avenger that Yoda would be turned into in the Prequel Trilogy, becoming more unbalanced with every Episode and by *Episode III*, light-sabering the Emperor with nary a thought about peaceable options, let alone knocking over kajillion dollar lamps and quinzullion dollar opera boxes. In creating the Prequel Trilogy, poor little Yoda was lost forever...Yet maybe the seeds of Yoda's (and by association, humanity's) downfall are sown in this episode: why study to be a Jedi Knight, a keeper of 'peace,' by learning how to *battle*? If the Force informs all things and if the Jedi have tapped into that Force with their mind powers, why wield light-sabers at all? Approach anyone with a light saber dangling from your belt and that sends a pretty clear message in the *opposite* direction.As Yoda tells it, he has been pimping Jedi Knights into the galaxy under the pretense of religious harmony for nearly a millennium. Any wonder the Empire is so FUBAR? The grand encounter between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in *Empire* is arguably the crux of the *Star Wars* saga. It doesn't get more pertinent, more urgent, more compelling. It is not so much the fencing Â we've seen better; it is about coming-of-age, ready or not; it is the eternal struggle between fathers and sons, mentors and menials; it is the passing of the torch; it is facing up to facing down fear; it is the Dark warring with the Light in each of us Â and realizing that sometimesÂ Dark is Better; a thematic juggernaut that spans eons and topples kingdoms.*Star Wars* is crystallized in these moments, featuring one of the greatest revelations in motion picture history, and also probably one of the most misquoted lines since, 'Play it again, Sam.' Vader does *not* say, 'Luke, I am your father,' but rather, in answer to Luke screaming, 'You killed my father!,' Vader thooms, 'No! *I*Â am your father!' It still sends chills up my spine.But let's face it Â we were GLAD it was Vader, weren't we? Better than that killjoy, Kenobi, or that self-righteous prig, Yoda. We all wish Vader were *our* father Â YES, take me to Rule The Galaxy, collecting tithes and tributes and slave girls; teach me the ways of Big, Black, Smooth and Cool like your bad self!There is such magnetic resonance in the figure of Vader beseeching his son, that even though he had already been elevated to the pantheon of Great Screen Villains, yet we are caressed by his sincerity in being a sympathetic ruler and longing to reunite his family Â or is that just the Dark Side drawing us in? The series would never again scale these lofty heights of grand dramatic slam. *The Empire Strikes Back*, brimming with hilarity, humanity and paternity, is the best of the *Star Wars* series.And that's not just our imagination.(Read this article unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/StarWarsEmpireStrikesBack.html)",8,0,1,24 June 2007
Gangs of New York," An Army Of One - Daniel Day-Lewis
","There are three reasons to watch Martin Scorcese's superlative Gangs Of New York:Daniel.Day.Lewis.Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Tony Montana, Gary Oldman as Sid Vicious, Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and (to wax more 'modern') Hugh Jackman as Wolverine: iconic performances, one and all. Day-Lewis joins this pantheon of Actors who made acting choices that so transformed them into these particular icons that one is hard-pressed to see the 'star' beneath the role, even in retrospect. Over the years, in his diversity of roles, Day-Lewis has insidiously placed himself amongst an elite few who have the right to actually term themselves 'actors' in this 'excrementitious' business which has degenerated into a forum for 'movie stars' (people with correct hair and au courant clothes designers).Day-Lewis' role of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting personified the age-old saw that any villain's character is infinitely more interesting than any hero's character. This movie's hero being played by Leo The Fluff did not help any. The only way Fluff could ever be Hard is if he became Tim Roth. I concede that he is a very good actor Â he's been doing it since he was 5, fer cryin' out loud Â and he's honed his craft into that of a nascent Hollywood Legend (yet he has 'miles to go before he sleeps' on the laurels of a lip-smacking role or major award), but his insipid chick-flickable role in 'Titanic' created that taste of sulfur in my mouth (and I'm guessing in the mouths of many others who might have marvelled at his turns in Basketball Diaries and This Boy's Life) to the point where he must almost martyr himself to engender any real 'likeability'. (Next summer: The Passion Of The Fluff.)In a film stocked with excellent actors (Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson, Fluff, Jim Broadbent, Henry Thomas Â and no, Cameron Diaz, is NOT one of those excellent actors, she's no better or worse than any one of a thousand women who could've filled that role), Day-Lewis molds a larger-than-history persona that illustrates the fact that Acting isn't really as easy as we all think it is. We are shown Â by an absolute MASTER of the craft Â how it's REALLY done: the force of will to forge this unique embodiment of power; abrasive, ambitious, ruthless, loyal; the choices of movement, accent, attire; each inflection, each flourish - Grand Gesture Â not a smirk out of place, not a twirl of the mustache unintentional. This movie's plot is almost an afterthought, as Day-Lewis' scene-stealing is so complete that we simply live for and unto each moment he graces us with his being... Set against the cyclorama of political machinations which defined early New York City's cultural eclecticism, an iron-fisted tyrant (Day-Lewis) must deal with crooked politicians (are there any other type?) threatening to usurp his power over a swathe of borough known as the Five Points, as well as deal with Leonardo DiCaprio (playing the son of a former civil leader whom Bill executed personally in a street battle - a cameo'd Liam Neeson), seeking vengeance for his father's death. It was refreshing to learn that this movie's plot did not hinge on the ubiquitous device of Woman as the focal point. Even in movies that purport explosive grandeur, such as that displayed in Gangs, original storyline is so frequently sacrificed to the age-old struggle of acquiring a woman from a) another guy, b) another lifestyle, c) another tax bracket. Jenny (Cameron Diaz) intimates that she is Bill The Butcher's woman, yet after she sleeps with Fluff and we see that Bill is not in the least perturbed (but rather embraces an avuncular pleasure in knowing that his surrogate son has gotten some), Jenny loses all her importance to the tale; we, as jaded viewers, were grimacing and gearing up to see yet another testosterone-induced stag-battle over the meaningless mannequin of Woman Â but it did not occur! Â to the movie's great credit. It lent yet another dimension to the enigma, the legend, the inexplicable conundrum that was Bill The Butcher - that IS Daniel Day-Lewis.Brings the bile to my throat to think that those talentless drogues on Melrose Place share the same earth as this genius; that while Day-Lewis has wrought such a world-shaking role as this, there still exists on this stinking planet Poison Ivy II and Friday The 13th Part VII, and ANY of the twenty incarnations of Police Academy dung heaps. In a world made better by Daniel Day-Lewis, should there be any reason to keep Steve Guttenberg alive?Were it not for Daniel Day-Lewis, Gangs of New York would be merely a 'great' film, scourged from the engine-pit of misbegotten pseudo-history and sand-blasted onto the epic screen - but with Day-Lewis' incendiary performance of Bill Cutting, this film rightfully earns the mantle of 'classic'.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",8,3,4,2 December 2004
Braveheart," Mel gets medieval on our asses...
","'When the Legend becomes fact, print the Legend.' - from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.War is Mel.Reprising his MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME hairdo, donning a slimming skirt, pumping up the man-ceps and dropping an accent that is either Scottish or some form of Indonesian elvish, Mel Gibson brings the thunder as revolutionary Scotsman William Wallace, historical figure made mythical man-toy in BRAVEHEART.Written by an actual descendant of the Scot warrior, Randall Wallace, and directed by Gibson's massive arms, BRAVEHEART takes us to 1300's Scotland, as Wallace, with his mullet on stun, leads Scots and Irish forces to free Scotland from the stranglehold of English King Edward Longshanks (Edward I, played by Patrick McGoohan with delicious contempt).BRAVEHEART is one of the last great epic battle films, if not the last, to use actual people in crowded combat rather than computer blips - the battle scenes are some of the best you will ever see for choreography, editing, kineticism, brutality - yet the movie does not shirk on sterling characters, nuanced acting chops, moral ambiguity, political treachery, heart-aching romance, and a soundtrack by James Horner to match its majestic sweep. BRAVEHEART is truly Mel's masterwork, all legend, extra cheese, thundering hooves, swampy castles, weak-chested nobles and iron-thewed warriors covered in layers of kilt and poo. Mel is not so much worried about recreating history as recreating the way the light slopes off his muddied deltoids.Returning to his village after being raised by his uncle (Brian Cox, looking like a rugged Billy Connolly), Wallace finds his beloved homeland cringing under the iron fist of English garrisons, who claim 'prima nocte,' the 'first night' with new brides married in their jurisdiction.Longshanks considers it 'Scotland, my land.' McGoohan owns the trigger-tempered Longshanks, whose delivery is hilarious in its haughtiness. 'The trouble with Scotland,' he tells his court, 'is that it's full of Scots.' (Thus, prima nocte would breed the Scots out.) Wallace avoids political squabbles, yet the antagonism of the resident English garrison forces his hand to war when they kill his secretly-married bride, Murron (Catherine McCormack).In a berserker rage Wallace decimates the garrison almost singlehandedly in a hand-to-hand battle which presages the lethal beauty to come - ruthless, wide-eyed and vicious, his vengeance palpable, his kinsmen following his lead; impact weapons, mallets, maces, clawed spears, and Wallace kicking the garrison commander against a pole and slitting his throat as emotionlessly as the commander slit Murron's.The English retaliate. It's on! Wallace, who just wanted to raise crops peacefully, finds himself leading Scotland in repelling England from Scottish shores, then taking the battle to English shores by invading York and beheading its prince, to quell Longshanks's ambitions at their source.Wallace warns all the enemy soldiers he spares, 'Tell them that Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free.' The great Brendan Gleeson is Wallace's best friend, Hamish; rugged James Cosmo is Hamish's father and unstoppable battle hound, Campbell; Sean McGinley is Murron's glowering father; Angus Macfadyen is suitably regal and simultaneously limp-principled as nobleman Robert the Bruce, with a crazed recluse father who looks like Gerard Depardieu in leper makeup - Robert will be Wallace's Judas; an eccentric performance by David O'Hara as Stephen the Irish loon; Tommy Flanagan is the wronged husband of a prima nocte wife.Stirling: a baptism by fire, as the amassed Scots want to turn tail, faced with English 'heavy cavalry, and armored horse that shake the very ground.' But Wallace shows that he was not just a master tactician, he was also a charismatic cheesemaker, as he throws down an iconic speech that is not lifted from the Inspirational Movie Speeches Handbook, but which has since been included as a modern classic: 'Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live, at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance - just one chance - to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take - our FREEDOM!' And all while painted blue.We are there, as the English armored horse canter toward the kilted Scottish battle formations; we smell the wet grass underhoof, we sense the pounding thunder as they close in bent on massacre; as tree-spears lie at our feet - a surprise attack in full view - Wallace calls, 'Hold!... hold!... hold!...' ('The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath / As we plunge on into certain death' - The Trooper, Iron Maiden) And just before the equine tsunami breaks upon us in banshee ululation - we raise the tree-spears. Into horse flesh.And all Mel breaks loose.BRAVEHEART is not a historical document, and doing the research will only muddle the truth about William Wallace all the more. Rather, Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson have crafted a stylistic juggernaut tribute to a man who heavily affected Scotland's history. And if we are to believe this film, he also sowed his seed with princess Isabelle, so he affected England's history as well. And it's an incredibly brave performance by Mel, considering he can't do a Scottish accent.Wallace is brought down by betrayal, and his execution cry is - 'FREEDOM!' But the concept of personal freedom was alien to peoples who were inculcated to believe their royalty was emplaced by gods. He might as well have shouted 'DEMOCRACY!' â another concept as alien to the people of the times as democracy is to the American presidents who prop up dictators around the world and pretend like it's the oppressed country's fault that they don't have democracy.As BRAVEHEART's opening narration tells us, 'History is written by those who have hanged heroes.' He doesn't mean US, does he?",9,3,8,10 August 2011
Moon," Space Oddity.
","In 1969, two years before director Duncan Jones was born, David Bowie released the single, 'Space Oddity.' 40 years later, Bowie's son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones releases his own space oddity - the brilliant MOON, an intelligent, thoughtful, unsettling, dialog-driven drama and the first true science fiction movie in a light year.'Commencing countdown, engines on...' This isn't your Armageddon or MISSION TO MARS, or even STAR WARS; MOON embraces the iconography of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, SPACE:1999 and SILENT RUNNING.Sam Rockwell is astronaut Sam Bell, a lunar miner nearing the end of a three-year contract maintaining harvesters on the far side of the Moon, harvesting helium-3, a new energy source which has overjoyed Earth corporations. Sam has two weeks to go. And he is definitely losing his mind.'Want an axe to break the ice. Wanna come down right now...' The Moon is only a couple seconds transmission time from Earth, yet Sam has no direct communication because his transmitter is faulty and the Earthbound corp has not bothered to send someone out to fix it...'Ground Control to Major Tom: your circuit's dead, there's something wrong...' ... so he must contend with delayed messages from his beautiful wife and baby daughter whom he has never met.'Tell my wife I love her very much. She knows...' And he is seeing visions of a girl in a yellow dress sitting at his console...Sam's only companion is GERTY, a HAL-like computer voiced by Kevin Spacey (who has a foreboding voice at the best of times - in a supercomputer that has control over your living conditions, it is downright jumpsuit-browning scary).One day, Sam goes out to check on a harvester and crashes his rover. He wakes in the infirmary, staggers out half-conscious and walks in on GERTY having a real-time conversation with his corporate bosses on Earth. Did he just see what he thought he saw - direct communication with Earth?! GERTY assures him he didn't...'Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare...' Something is bugging Sam. He drives out to check on that harvester again - and finds the crashed rover. Inside - he finds himself. Literally.MOON is Duncan Jones's debut feature, already winning acclaim and awards. It is pure old school, with no lasers or aliens or bombast, yet tension as palpable as piano wire tightening around your chest; a controlled mystery drama with one large moon base set, one man, one computer, one mission; exteriors are cute little model buildings on authentic-looking Moonscapes and tiny six-wheeled rovers rolling along in slomo to simulate one-sixth gravity. All underscored by the eerie music of Clint Mansell (REQUIEM FOR A DREAM).'Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do...' One Sam is fit, healthy, while Sam from the crashed rover is falling apart physically. Both realize that cloning has been done without their consent or knowledge - yet neither knows which is the clone...Without doubt, this is Sam Rockwell's most inspired acting performance of his career. Like Michael Keaton in MULTIPLICITY or, to a lesser extent, Kevin Kline in DAVE, we lose cognizance of the constant camera trickery going on. Actively and passively, our eyes are being fooled by a combination of special effects, creative editing and sensational dual acting.'And the stars look very different today...' But MOON's underlying disturbing message is not the fact that clones exist - it is the fact that corporations will use this device to once again line their pockets and screw people over; how the bottom line overrides any kind of human element or ethics. That makes MOON a biting potent indictment of modern day corporate misconduct and dysfunction.'I heard a rumor from Ground Control - oh no, don't say it's true...'And hidden deep within all Bowie's Scary Monsters, Super Creeps, Thin White Dukes, Aladdin Sanes, Ziggys, Lodgers and Heroes, is the same far out biting social commentary...The Space Oddity doesn't fall far from the Starman.",8,4,13,31 August 2010
True Romance," Delicious Vicious, Frantic Romantic.
","A brazen thug-fest, played like an adventure story for boys.Tony Scott (TOP GUN, DAYS OF THUNDER) directs TRUE ROMANCE, but it's got Quentin Tarantino's stank all over it - delicious dialog juggled with vicious gun play. Though Tarantino is listed only as 'writer,' TRUE ROMANCE seems to be the middle child of what could be construed his breakout trilogy, bookended by RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) and PULP FICTION (1994).Comics/kung fu geek Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) marries naif hooker Alabama (Patricia Arquette) after just one night of molesting her mungus ta-tas, and resolves to rescue her from debauchery and bad people (which is somewhat ironic, considering he uses a big shiny gun to do so.) Cross country to The City of Angels they flee, with $5 million in cocaine that Clarence unwittingly steals from Alabama's pimp after a Very Serious Shootout.So begins a series of vicious vignettes, featuring a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of delicious cameos. Dreadlocked Gary Oldman is Alabama's pimp Drexl, more nigga than wigga ('He musta thought it was White Boy Day!'); diabolical Christopher Walken is unstoppable mob boss, Mr. Coccotti, who slams up against the immovable force of Clarence's working class father (Dennis Hopper) in the most intense genealogical examination of 'the n*gger gene' this side of a Klan rally; James Gandolfini is - what else? - a hit-man, which would inform his own breakout role soon enough in THE SOPRANOS; Brad Pitt, hilarious in a tiny stoner role; Michael Rappaport is Clarence's bad actor buddy who just landed a role on T.J. HOOKER (Clarence: 'You get to meet Captain Kirk!'); Val Kilmer as Clarence's inner Elvis monologue.If ever there was a dialog-driven scene for aspiring young actors to hone your emotive palette, grab the few pages of Hopper and Walken. If you can pull off the galaxy of nuance between those two acting leviathans seemingly jovially discussing telltale signs of lying and eggplants, yet with the undercurrent of lives in the balance, you're ready. Call William Morris.Honorable mentions to Bronson Pinchot (with sweater tied around neck, like he is part of a Country Club who is embarrassed to admit he is a member) as a director's gopher, misrepresenting himself as only those whom Country Clubs repudiate can; and Saul Rubinek as the esteemed Hollywood director so egotistic he believes he can have someone killed if they cut him off on the highway.With the uplifting music of Hans Zimmer sparkling the savage storyline, TRUE ROMANCE is a paean to youth and freedom and impulsiveness and righteous wrongdoing, oozing that insouciant hipness that Tarantino does so effortlessly. And yes, it all leads to that Tarantino trademark of everyone pointing a gun at everyone else.True love is so much more romantic when hookers and drugs and guns are involved.",7,0,2,29 July 2010
Gladiator," Unleashing Helle.
","Truly GLADIATOR is the stuff of great fiction; a story so well-orchestrated and superbly told, there might well have been in Roman history a general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor.But - as they used to say in ancient Rome - 'only in Hollywood...'Russell Crowe is Ancient Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of a fierce and loyal army that has conquered the known world under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (regal, world-weary Richard Harris). Maximus plans to retire to his olive gardens with wife and son, but the sickly Emperor has other ideas, bequeathing Maximus the stewardship of Rome over that of his natural-born son and rightful heir, the fey Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus discovers this slight, he cries a little, promptly kills his father, arrests Maximus, and gets progressively feyer.Commodus then invents the James-Bond-Batman-Death, that is, don't kill your nemesis quickly and efficiently in full view, order your incompetent men to take him somewhere and probably kill him if he doesn't use his dangerous ingenuity and superior combat skills to escape. This also guarantees you are completely in the dark as to whether your enemy is dead, until he appears unexpectedly somewhere and vexes you.This Maximus does, defying Commodus and leaving him terribly vexed.Thereby arriving at Part Three of the slogan. In the interim, Maximus discovered his family was crucified by Commodus, which caused Maximus untold Academy Award-Winning Acting, subsequently collapsing in the desert and taken into slavery. The Gladiator merchant, Proximo (Oliver Reed, gravel-throated, rheumy-eyed - his last performance before going to that great arena in the sky) handpicks the indifferent yet lethal Maximus to join his stable of gladiators (which includes neighborly Numidian, Djimon Hounsou and man-mountain Ralf Moeller). Proximo scores a gig at The Coliseum, for the pleasure of now-Emperor Commodus.As Darth Vader thoomed, 'The circle is now complete.' There were arena skirmishes before this one, but the Coliseum 'Carthage reenactment' is the grandest rock star battle for Proximo's now-renowned gladiator troop, inspired and led by Maximus, as stirring and blood-pounding as BEN-HUR's chariot race. GLADIATOR's raucous, blood-glutted battle scenes are fitting successors to the 'realistic' warfare of BRAVEHEART and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.'Are you not entertained?' His helmet disguising his identity, Maximus rallies 'his' gladiators to defeat the lethal Imperial chariot-riders in the arena, to the surprise of Commodus, who wishes to meet the upstart who would not even salute the throne, let alone die conveniently for the public's pleasure. Maximus reveals himself to Commodus, who is driven to remarkable heights of feyness.Discovering Maximus is alive makes not only Commodus weak in the knees - so too his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who pined for him back when her father the Emperor owned Maximus's taut butt. Her betrayal of Commodus sets in motion the third act, steeped in politics of reclaiming Rome as a republic, and therefore losing some of its verve.Beautifully filmed, in ocher tones and burnt umber (by director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson), GLADIATOR nabbed Russell Crowe a Best Actor Oscar - even though Joaquin Phoenix did all the actual acting! Crowe pulls the Bruce Willis for most of the film, while Phoenix's sway-tilt emotions are a disturbing rainbow of subtlety.Phoenix's performance is absolutely stunning - that of a weak man, filled with disillusionment, contempt, envy, indecision; conflicting emotions constantly dancing across his face, flickers of smiles when we know he wants to cry humiliation, edging tears when we know he would rather lash out like the simple animal he is. It is Acting of a caliber few writers or directors could even describe, let alone trust an actor to convey.'What we do in life echoes in eternity.' Well. maybe, depending on what eternity you're talking about. For all its awe-inspiring action and chest-beating man-sweatiness, GLADIATOR has its faults: writers David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson can't figure what ancient civilization they're writing for. These are ROMANS, boys. So when Maximus pep talks his men at the very first battle '...if you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium - and you are already dead!,' his troops should have replied, 'Excuse sir, but isn't that where GREEKS go?' In his prayers, Maximus appeals to a 'Blessed Father' - Jupiter? Janus? GLADIATOR pulls no punches when depicting the slaughter of countless of god's creations, yet is too gutless to depict polytheism. Especially in the Lead Actor with the Oscar push.When Maximus prays to the effigies of his wife and son and the Numidian asks, 'What do you say to them?' he answers, 'To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business.' Big bonding laugh. Let me get this straight: he's joking about sticking it to his raped and crucified wife in the afterlife? Is that not inappropriate? Are you not entertained? 'It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed.' Phoenix all in white, Gladiator stumbling from a stab wound and seeing his predestination Christian homecoming, Jumilla giving a eulogy that makes our flesh crawl, the Numidian (who had his own religious beliefs) succumbing to the Christian myths (after all, they are the right ones, of course! Not like those other stupid religions, which Christians are still trying to wipe off the face of the Earth) and sotto voce, 'We will see each other again - but not yet!'...Apparently, Gladiator is 'going home.' Believe in a myth hard enough and it will come true.Hail Caesar and all that. Romani Ite Domum.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,2,3,6 March 2009
Contact," Buried within The Message from Vega Â The Message from Sagan.
","'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' needed updating. 'Contact' is that update. Though it may never attain the lofty heights of commercialism that 'Close Encounters' enjoyed, 'Contact' is, in fact, a more intelligent vision of extra-terrestrial communication with our outer-spiral-arm planet.From science maven Carl Sagan's optimistic novel of the same name, the movie is based on the ideology of the Drake Equation (the speculative theory postulating multitudes of Life-harboring planets in this galaxy, given the sheer quantity of possibly habitable worlds), defined in the movie by the almost-too-cute syllogism: 'If we are alone in the Universe, it sure seems like an awful waste of space.' The Drake Equation is weighed against the Fermi Paradox, which argues that if there *are* alien civilizations, why haven't we detected them yet? This movie's plot Â obviously - negates that paradox.Whereas 'Close Encounters'' method of alien contact played on the age-worn industrial-era concept of aliens physically visiting Earth, an infinitely more efficient manner is effected in 'Contact' by means of radio waves. SETI astronomers, headed by Ellie Arroway (perfect-featured Jodie Foster in sensual, leonine mane), stumble upon distinctly intelligent radio signals originating near the star Vega. In decoding The Message, they are astonished to find it is not merely a rudimentary greeting, but rather a technologically-superior detailed schematic for a Machine, to transport US to THEM.Considering the economics of space travel Â not referring to 'money', but expending 'energy' Â The Message defines the most judicious method for establishing contact, whilst discerning whether a civilization is ready and/or worthy to step up to an interstellar level of commerce. The concept of 'aliens' has matured in this film, from simple benign or malignant humanoids (treating Earth as the retarded child of the galaxy), to ambiguous 'intelligences', regarding us as near-equals, in placing the ball in our court.This maturity is due in great part to the inexhaustible efforts of the late Dr. Sagan, whose quest to bestow a sense of cerebral wonder in a generation jaded by laser-wielding aliens and detestably non-scientific 'science fiction' found a culminating point in this movie.With aliens being so apparently existent, there comes the inevitable contention of Religion vs. Science, and though Sagan clarifies his position in the novel, the movie must necessarily leave the issue ambiguous to appeal to its demographic of (real or imagined) 'christians' Â the bulk of earth's popcorn-plucking populace. The film ultimately 'preaches to the converted' on BOTH sides. No Atheist or Christian will be jumping their razor-wire fences on the grounds of this movie.As with all major-studio releases, the screen story tampers with the novel's finer details, slotting it squarely within motion picture dramatic parameters - most notably modifying the overweight evangelist of the book, Palmer Joss, to that of Hollywood man-toy, Mathew McConaughey, to give Ellie that seemingly necessary 'love-interest'. Thankfully, the broad strokes retain enough of Sagan's driving pursuit of knowledge, elevating it above mere whizbang alien-invasion fare.Yet we do not lack for effects Â stunning, thought-provoking effects, rather than 'be-still-my-pants' jaw-droppers. The challenging opening sequence sees a camera panning backwards through space away from earth, beyond the edge of the Milky Way, outracing a jumble of radio static, which gets progressively 'older', the farther out we go (as indicated by familiar tunes, news snippets and cultural signpost sounds - i.e. the farther out in space you get, the farther back in time you hear; in essence, time-traveling backwards - faster than light, no less, if you are outpacing radio waves!). Herein lies the foreshadowing of the whole plot. For those unfamiliar with the physics concept that underlines this sequence, the movie will make no sense.The visualization of The Machine (that The Message instructed to build) was a marvel of utility and 'alien' design, seamlessly integrated into the landscape of Cape Canaveral. Most impressive was the tragic sequence which destroyed the first Machine Â so artfully contrived, with views from the scores of 'media' cameras covering the event - that the viewer never thinks to question where the reality ends and the green-screen babble begins.Though technically not a 'special effect', an astounding camera trick with a running girl in a mirror will have you scratching your head for weeks as to how it was concocted - for directorial *aficionados*, this sequence alone is worth the movie.One can only hope that viewers can delve through the flummery (which must necessarily blossom during the latter stages of the movie, as The Machine traverses worm-holes) to the REAL 'message' from Sagan: that the questioning and scientific mind is infinitely more precious to our species and creates more impetus for launching Mankind to the stars than the stagnating minds of the pseudo-science shamsters, which includes fanatical Christian contingents.One of the best arguments against *religionistas* Â played out in the movie by the ever-psycho Jake Busey - is that no scientist has yet strapped himself with explosives and taken innocent lives in his quest to force an opinionated Physics viewpoint on other people, whom he believes he will 'save' by blowing them upÂ The incomparably-reliable David Morse is Ellie's encouraging father, while William Fichtner poignantly plays a blind astronomer colleague. A stoic Tom Skerritt is simultaneously Ellie's supervisor and adversary, although thankfully is not painted as 'villainous', even though cast as the obvious antagonist; an intelligent rendering, keeping his interests 'scientific' rather than petty. Although he does prevaricate to score his Machine seat, he is noble enough to admit to Ellie, 'I wish we lived in a world which rewarded honesty like yours', to which Ellie replies, 'I thought the world is what we make of it.' Carl Sagan died before production was completed on 'Contact', making it one of his last gifts to a blinkered world. The film's dedication read simply: 'For Carl'. I wept. Without him, the Universe seems like an awful waste of space.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",8,26,42,29 October 2005
Donnie Darko," Darkness is as Darko does...
","And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad / The dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had... -- Mad World, Tears For Fears.The Tears For Fears song, Mad World, closes DONNIE DARKO. As it softly meanders under the closing montage of characters, everything in this movie clacks into place in your head... it is like tension released between your shoulder blades; like the exhalation of breath after holding it in sympathy with Gene Hackman trapped in THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. DONNIE DARKO will quietly enmesh you in its intrigue, spiraling to a morbid climax where nothing makes sense - until everything makes sense. Or not.The jet engine through the bedroom roof is the key. Or is it the giant sinister rabbit? Some might say the death of Donnie's newly minted girlfriend Gretchen (Jena Malone) was the catalyst that caused Donnie to make the fateful decision of restoring balance to the universe... Movie opens with young Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakening on a hillside road, disoriented. Just before he moves out of frame, something catches our eye and disorients US: instead of retaining the worried look on his face, a wry smile crosses it. There is more here than meets the eye. The opening song gives away more of the theme than we realize - INXS's Never Tear Us Apart: 'I was standing / You were there / Two worlds collided / And they could never tear us apart...'The normalcy of Donnie's average American family makes everything that happens to him seem doubly strange. Besides sleepwalking and waking in strange places, he sees visions of a person in a rabbit suit, named Frank, who tells him in a Vader-like voice that he has 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds, before the world will end.The space-time continuum is out of sync and teen outcast Donnie is somehow connected with its repair. We cannot begin to understand how, and neither can he. Set in the tree-lined suburbs of Anywhere USA (maybe California?) during the year 1988, two parallel time lines are inexplicably interwoven, and only Donnie's unwitting power of mentally accessing both can restore balance. DONNIE DARKO could be the most subtle 'superhero' movie ever made - one in which the superhero (Darko) is unaware of the powers he accesses and in which we the audience are also kept from knowing his true powers. Never realizing we are watching a 'super' hero because there's no dead giveaway of wearing his undies on the outside of his pants. The writer's own explanation: that someone from an alternate, tangential universe (Frank) is trying to get through to this universe to rectify the rip in space-time. And Donnie is the willing, though unknowing, receptacle.Unlike BACK TO THE FUTURE (Donnie gives a nod to the 'time machine shaped like a DeLorean'), where events in the present are traced to events in the past, time here is juggled and twisted back on itself in a tip-of-the-tongue madness. Writer-director Richard Kelly constructs a time travel mythology - not scientific in any way - based around this movie's plot; expounded in a mysterious book that Donnie is bequeathed by his science teacher (Noah Wyle, who has the misfortune to resemble vanilla-pussy Breckin Meyer). Thematically touching on alternate universes, time portals, membrane theory, this movie itself is some kind of time capsule, as it captures Patrick Swayze at the tail-end of his dancing career (DIRTY DANCING was a loooong time ago), Katherine Ross from an era before that (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID), Jake Gyllenhaal at the start of his storied career (sowing the seeds of intensity that would bring him many acting awards and an Oscar nod), Seth Rogen as a glorified extra with two lines, long before he was the ribald voice of a generation (in true Rogen fashion, his first line to Jena Malone is 'I like your boobs!'); Drew Barrymore's interest in this film enabled its funding, yet she seems to be in a strange space-time sandwich here (between two Adam Sandler turds and two CHARLIE'S ANGELS debacles). Holmes Osbourne is Donnie's fun father and Mary McDonnell his strangely detached mother. Then there is Jake's sister Maggie, playing Donnie's sister Elizabeth, spectacularly beautiful and young, her smile as radiant as Donnie's head-bowed sneer is ominous, like a supernova in a universe of sputtering candles, simultaneously cherubic and hotter than a devil's pancake. She is the cutest thing I have ever seen. Quite the sensual feat when up against the jailbait-cute Jena Malone (grown to legal age since her pivotal role in CONTACT).DONNIE DARKO was released in the United States just after '9/11,' so was lost amidst the psychological debris of W's inadequacies - at preventing the attack and then at botching its response. A messianic tale of sacrifice too layered to be appreciated in one viewing does not usually play well with dunderhead American audiences at the best of times, let alone the worst of times. Ignorant marketing as a teen comedy didn't help. Luckily, the dweeb brigade rediscovered the film and cultified it.Donnie's cheerful laugh in the final scenes, when he knows his timeline is about to collapse under a jet engine, is as ominous and incongruous as his opening wry smile. But maybe Donnie should not have sacrificed himself. Look at the timeline we ended up in: W's reign of terror after abrogating his vow and constitutional duty of keeping America safe. Might we have been better off if Donnie had let the rabbit live?--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",9,2,7,2 December 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Dispiritying, Disheartenying, Distressying.
","*The Pursuit of Happiness* needs to take a Prozac.Relentlessly depressing, director Gabriele Muccino's first English feature film is Inspired by a True Story - which only inspires nausea with their ubiquity these days - and though its intent is to be a 'feel-good' movie, it goes awry in its execution, paying such sadistic detail to every mishap, misfortune and misstep of its hero that it loses all semblance of entertainment. (And why that annoying 'y'? We find that there is nothing intriguing in the misspelling of 'Happiness,' simply a reference to graffiti on his son's day care center wall.)Will Smith trades his Actionman for an Everyman, playing Chris Gardner, a late-thirty-something in 1981 San Francisco, with a Bitching Wife and Convenient Kid. Gardner is a bone density scanner salesman Â as hard to sell as they sound Â he investing his life savings purchasing them on spec, only to have his prospective clients (hospitals) consider them unnecessary icing; hence, to pay the 3-month-late rent and offer his five-year-old son better opportunities, whilst trying to pay bills with the few-and-far sales of scanners (simultaneously his albatross and his bread), Gardner gambles on a long shot, a six-month non-paying broker's internship which may lead to financial stability Â if he is chosen over hundreds of more qualified applicants. A Rubik's Cube comes to his rescue. True? Who knows Â but it was fun to see that old demon puzzle resurrected. Thandie Newton is Bitching Wife, almost a caricature, providing emotional baggage when necessary and excised when she might start convoluting the plot with realistic action or threatening Will Smith's screen time. Smith's real son, Jaden, is Convenient Kid, with nothing noteworthy to offer (except maybe his *Boondocks* hairdo), who only once acts like a real kid Â when he irrationally screams to be let into a hotel room they've been evicted from; otherwise ambivalently following his father into destitution with nary a whimper for ice cream and dangerous toys. Dan Castellaneta is the intern trainer, not being very Homer Simpson about it.Over the course of Gardner's internship, he loses his wife, his car, his friends, his apartment, his shoe, and at various intervals, his scanners (for which he must pour on the Will Smith Sprint to recover them from thieving hippies Â Smith spends so much time in full stride, it almost becomes *The Pursuit of Bone Density Scanners*); his one constant is his son, for whom he is enduring this hell. When is this guy going to catch a break?Yet we are never allowed to consider that Gardner just might be irresponsible in pursuing a six-month dream which may end in failure through no fault of his own, instead of simply bellying up as a McDonalds cashier. You need to feed your son NOW, Horatio Alger! While pretending solvency to appear well-adjusted Â at one point surrendering his last five bucks to a millionaire boss who forgot his wallet Â Gardner and son spend the night in flophouses, homeless shelters and on the streets, at one point sleeping in a railway public toilet, leg propped against door to stop people entering. Smith's acting takes us to this place, with such a traumatic look of dejection and loss and fear for his son's wellbeing that the insistent knocking on the door becomes scarier than any axe-murderer or twenty-foot bug. Apparently there's a message to this onerous exercise: follow your dreams and don't listen to anybody who says you can't. In which ten billion Disney movies have we heard that before? Trouble is, we'll never hear from the millions who actually go Gardner's route and fail. That's a reality too, more so than Gardner's.*The Pursuit of Happiness* is a badly-made film of an inspiring story just waiting to be made into a formulaic film.Smith's occasional unnecessary voice-over is like some kind of perverse attempt at irony. When he's running, he informs us, 'This part of my life, I call 'running''; when he's riding the bus, he cleverly intones, 'This part of my life is called 'riding the bus.'' It ain't irony if it is what it is. His voice-over laments, 'Maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and never have.' 'When I'd get an A on a test, I'd get this good feeling about all the things I could be Â and I never became any of them.' Welcome to the real world, Chris.We are shown so much misery (Gardner has to sell his blood to pay for a bulb for his scanner, he spends a night in jail for parking tickets, after painting his apartment for free for his landlord, then having to attend his first broker interview in paint-smeared rags Â and on it goes) that by the time the movie tries to perk us up with the mandatory upbeat ending, it comes too late and we don't want to forgive it. Who can blame us? A text screen informs us Gardner became a multi-millionaire. With his gamble paying off, Voice-over Gardner informs us that 'this is called happiness.' So money DOES buy itÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",4,1,6,5 January 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne Again.
","In THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, Matt Damon IS (still) Jason Bourne. The superspy from THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) is STILL on the lam, from the people who STILL want him dead - his ex-employers STILL at the CIA. Even though they've almost forgotten him at the opening of this movie, he lays low in India with his Euro chick, Marie (STILL Franka Potente).But other people STILL want him dead. Reason? It's a sequel - who needs a reason? Before we can say, 'contrived plot,' suspicious Euros plant Bourne's fingerprints at a robbery location to frame him, and then send an assassin (Karl Urban) to track him down in India and cook his goose - at the very least, curry his chicken.Now maybe I'm being too logical here, but if these Euros have gone to all the trouble of hacking Bourne's fingerprints, planting them somewhere to frame him for a crime, then sending someone to assassinate him, wouldn't it seem more sensible to send an Indian operative who could sneak up on Bourne in India, rather than Karl Urban (who might as well be wearing his full Eomer costume from RETURN OF THE KING) who reeks Euro Bond Villain and sticks out from the local curry-mongers like Deepak Chopra at a Klan Rally? Needless to say, as Urban skulks around trying to blend his white face into the brown people, Bourne picks him immediately as an assassin, 'Hey, it's that guy from Middle Earth here in Eastern Earth,' which precipitates the first of many creative, yet tiring, car chases.Why send someone to kill Bourne anyway? A tad redundant, considering the framing is supposed to entice the CIA back onto his tail - which it does. I guess the Euros are just being what American spy agencies cannot dream of being - efficient.While back at Inefficiency Central, the CIA bullpen is now overseen by Joan Allen (playing a battleaxe just a little too tough to be believable), doing the generic barking to peons at monitors, who have all devoted their lives, it would seem, to tracking Jason Bourne. And wondrously failing at their jobs. Brian Cox is her airy superior, who still can't figure why he's in this movie, after making that egregious 'alternate ending' to the last BOURNE movie.The question must arise: Wouldn't the people who planted Bourne's fingerprints and the people who find Bourne's fingerprints both be familiar enough with Bourne to know that he is too smart to leave fingerprints in the first place? Um... it's a sequel. How much logic could we possibly need? Screenplayed by Tony Gilroy (who has a better grasp of author Robert Ludlum's character now, so doesn't need other writers to sully his one-trick pony) and directed by Paul Greengrass (mostly a TV director at this point, directing this like a TV movie), THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is like tripping down a flight of stairs, getting up and tripping again. All the action sequences are cut too hard and close for meaty satisfaction, from the hand-to-hand combat, to nystagma-inducing car chases, which lead to... more car chases. (The only thing the chase sequences do successfully is disguise some sensational drumming on the soundtrack.) There is a cool continuity in keeping the same Moby song as the movie's closer - or did they just forget they were making a sequel that just *seemed* like THE BOURNE IDENTITY? Still.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,0,1,20 March 2009
The Proposal," I Do. Not.
","A vanilla THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA meets an idiotic GREEN CARD.Did Sandra Bullock learn nothing from her 1995 movie WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING? Here she goes again, blatantly lying about her supposed boyfriend to her supposed boyfriend's family, to cover an empty life of lovelessness.Predictable? Check. Funny? Check. Cute little white dog named Kevin? Check. So we know what to expect from this crap going in. So what makes THE PROPOSAL so unbearable? The premise.A hated editor-in-chief, Margaret (Sandra Bullock), blackmails her ambitious assistant, Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) into marrying her so she can remain in America after her Canadian visa expires.You lost me immediately: a person in Margaret's affluent position can afford lawyers to ensure that would never happen. On the common chance the startlingly inefficient Immigration and Naturalization Service does screw up paperwork (which they did for me!), she would - again - have her lawyers pummel them (like I did!), not tramp to the INS building and stand in line, or - now we're entering pure fantasy! - be granted an interview immediately with a - more fantasy - white, English-speaking officer (Denis O'Hare).Taken as ignorant storytelling, we move forward. Andrew in turn blackmails Margaret for an editor's position or he won't help with her scam. We don't bother pointing out the thousand other legal options and loopholes in the plot, because by now it is obvious the characters are too dumb to take our advice anyway.But let's get this straight for American muttonheads who believe that a 'Resident Alien Card' (aka Green Card) process involves exams where you are quizzed like a schoolkid regarding which side of the bed you sleep on: there IS no such quiz! Take it from someone who suffered five years through the process: even if you're faking the marriage, an interview like the one Gerard Depardieu fails in GREEN CARD (1990) only involves parroting facts - the real horror of the Green Card process is the stark raving inefficiency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service itself. As Margaret correctly asserts, the INS only assign investigators to check on 'terrorists, not book editors.' Margaret and Andrew would have been lucky to get a Hispanic lackey who made them wait only four hours before mispronouncing their names calling their case. Instead, they get an officer who threatens to 'check on them' at microbial levels, as if the INS has officers with that amount of time to waste. All they want is to ensure you insert yourself into the American economy, to generate income, to take it from you 'legally' through taxes and other swinish practices.The story takes Margaret out of her comfort zone of severe skirts and pumps so high her backside looks like a baboon in estrus, and plants the couple in Sitka, Alaska, to meet Andrew's parents. Though we know the filmmakers are trying to show Margaret's witch heart melting in this beautiful landscape, they only highlight more failings of the plot - the chemistry between Margaret and Andrew is non-existent and none of Andrew's family notice. His mother (radiant MILF, Mary Steenburgen) and grandmother (87-year-young Betty White) are so buoyant and welcoming, I don't have the heart to tell them they're in a bad romantic comedy.They're portrayed to be such loving, stable people that they 'accept' Margaret no matter her clinical coldness toward their son, who reciprocates with clinical coldness of his own. Either they're not mentioning the couple's detachment because they're sensitive - or they can't see it, in which case, they're mildly retarded.Craig T. Nelson is the only realistic character, as Andrew's unrelenting, unforgiving father - until he has to cave to the unrelenting Romantic Comedy Arc of 'finding his heart.' Oscar Nunez as Ramone is an entertaining diversion as Sitka's resident caterer, store manager, minister and stripper.Malin Ackerman shows off her beauty as Andrew's smalltown ex-girl, but unfortunately, does no stripping.The two funniest scenes involve Andrew caught off-guard, thinking on his feet: when Margaret announces she is marrying him, as her boss breaks the news that she has to leave the country; and when both Margaret and Andrew relate the story of How They Met to a roomful of people, each taking up the story's slack from the other as they realize the other is making them look ridiculous in the story. Of course, the scene that this movie's target audience find the funniest - Margaret and Andrew colliding with each other nude - is contrived, idiotic, brainless and utterly hot for chicks.Written predictably by Pete Chiarelli and directed adequately by former choreographer Anne Fletcher, THE PROPOSAL is one of those films where we know what's going to happen: two people start out by hating each other and end up liking each other. Which is an ironic twist because I went in liking the movie and ended up hating it.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",4,8,13,23 November 2009
Jurassic Park," Dino Mighty
","DINOSAURS! No, not 'unbelievable' and 'incredible' Â on the contrary, Steven Spielberg and his special effects team do such a mighty job at recreating extinct saurians that they are altogether BELIEVABLE and CREDIBLE! Spielberg is the visionary who brought us *Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind* and *Raiders of the Lost Ark* - but *Jurassic Park* was his *Thriller*. If you didn't know his name before, you sure as dino-dropping knew it now.Departing considerably from the Michael Crichton book of the same name, the movie follows paleontologists (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) to a remote island where billionaire entrepreneur, John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough), has cloned dinosaurs running around a proposed theme park. (The cloning process, via dinosaur DNA found in ancient mosquitoes, is ingenious, but specious.) Hammond wants the appraisal of experts and the park's target audience, so also invites a lawyer (Martin Ferrero), a chaotician (Jeff Goldblum, clad in all-black to connote some kind of scientific hipness, we presume), and two of his annoying grandkids.I think we all entered *Jurassic Park* as jubilantly as the actors entered Jurassic Park: 'We're going to see dinosaurs! We're going to see dinosaurs!' The wonder and awe lasts exactly one and a half acts. Then the Running and Screaming starts.Though Crichton's book was an indictment against 'tampering in God's domain,' weaving paleontology, anthropology, evolution, chaos and genetics into a plausible tale of scientific arrogance, the movie is unrepentantly all about the DINOSAURS. And the fun in seeing them alive and kicking.The first sighting of the brachiosaur is immense, literally breath-taking, and when Hammond welcomes his charges with the line, 'Welcome to Jurassic Park!' we are stunned into gape-mouthedness (as the characters are) with a long shot of Brachiosaurs and Parasauralophii herding by a lake, coupled with John Williams' fanfare theme, raising the hairs on the legs and driving a tear from the eye.At this point, the film-makers had won. We were theirs. There could be no more stop-motion or Harryhausen after seeing the grandeur and 'real-ness' of Spielberg's saurians. Working with the most revolutionary special effects (Industrial Light & Magic and Stan Winston's studio), Spielberg showed us Something Very Old as Something Very New.And it was a Roarer. But the film (and the franchise) would never again be so wondrous.For somewhere in the middle of the second act, Spielberg forgets why we love dinosaurs in the first place Â for their uniqueness, their unattainable majesty, their awe-inspiring mystery - and instead of conjuring interest in the very fact that they live, they breathe, they walk like birds, spit like snakes and scream like jet engines, Spielberg gutlessly conforms to Hollywood movie convention, turning them into the film's 'villains,' the element that the 'heroes' must run from. In the end, the dinosaurs could have been anything (wolves, zombies, CGI monsters), it made no difference. (The velociraptor kitchen sequence, where they hunt Hammond's grandkids, is especially wasteful, not only because the two kids at that stage have become so irritating that we're rooting for the dinosaurs, but because Spielberg doesn't make movies where kids get eaten. Ergo: no suspense.) From being the wondrous subjects of the whole excursion, the dinosaurs are demoted to merely providing the third act with Running and Screaming. And the movie degenerates to no better than its Harryhausen stop-motion ancestors. (I always watch this movie to the start of the third act. Then it sours enough to press Stop quite unregretfully and go finish the laundry.) Spielberg ultimately fell into the trap created and abused by his pal, George Lucas Â leaning on his scintillating effects and neglecting his half-baked story. Admittedly, the effects are DINO-MITE! (Somebody slap me.) The tyrannosaur alone is a juggernaut of adrenalin-charged mayhem, and its bellow is a frightful composite of elephants and lions and freight trains on steel wheels at midnight. Utilizing the most up-to-date paleontological data (including theories postulated by Robert Bakker in his iconoclastic tome, *The Dinosaur Heresies*), *Jurassic Park* shows us dinosaurs as 'modern' as science can make them, pertaining to skin coloration, anatomy, physiology and behavior.*Jurassic Park* succeeds on an entertainment level with its technical finesse, its Mesozoic marvels and manufactured excitement, but could have been so much more than a technological monster movie.And I don't suppose it matters to the Great Unwashed that most of the dinosaurs are from the *Cretaceous* PeriodÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",7,1,2,11 April 2007
Valkyrie," Plight of the Valkyries
","When I heard Tom Cruise was to play a World War II Nazi, I laughed my LMAO off. Tough sell for a non-actor. And by non-actor, I mean movie star. And by movie star, I mean he can't act.But then it all comes clear. The role was Colonel von Stauffenberg, who was involved in one of the more famous assassination plots against Hitler - so Cruise was not really being asked to extend his acting bone; he was a disenfranchised Nazi, a veritable 'liberal' in America's eyes. He was a traitor to the Germans, but you know what they say: One man's traitor is another man's Cruise.And, ludicrous as it may sound, Cruise and director Bryan Singer (X-MEN) actually boast of the 'risk' for Cruise in taking such a role. What risk? His character is the Hero, with a hatred for the Germans so extreme, he's practically American. In VALKYRIE, it is 1944 and Chancellor Adolf Hitler, whom many on both sides regard as an 'insane genius,' is not only losing the war that he started, he is committing atrocities and driving Germany's credibility with the rest of the world straight into the toilet. Kinda like George W. Bush - without the 'genius' bit. We meet Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (Mr. Cruise, proudly pretending he is 'taking a risk') as a young rebel, displeased with Hitler's war, his impossible mission, 'to serve Germany - or the Fuehrer - not both.'Then the Allies bomb him. Stauffenberg loses his right hand, half his left hand, and his left eye. If that doesn't make you wanna blow up your Chancellor, well...Stauffenberg is recruited by a cast of 'Chermans,' so upper-crust British they make your butler feel like an illegal Latino: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard... It is why VALKYRIE stumbles conceptually, because it is always in the back of our minds, 'No wonder they're trying to assassinate Hitler - they're British!' And director Singer ensures that the 'good' Bad Guys (i.e. traitors) are all British actors and the 'bad' Bad Guys (i.e. Nazis) are actual German actors.Then there's Tom. Fruiting about the authentic-looking WWII backdrop, in no way trying to inhabit the role of a one-handed, eye-patched, high-ranking German Chief of Staff. Just Being Cruise. The American accent is bad enough. We get the point of the English-speaking roles for our lazy Western ears, but there is more to a role than an accent; Cruise gives it nothing more than Cruise. We do not lose ourselves in this 'German's' conflict - committing the highest crimes known to man since Judas Iscariot. It's Tom Cruise, eat your popcorn.As a political thriller, VALKYRIE succeeds, though. Even with Tom just Being Cruise. Writers Christopher McQuarrie (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) and Nathan Alexander compress events and often just falsify events to keep it popcorn-friendly - this is not a historical document - but they do not lose too much in their streamlining because the story itself is just so entertaining.'Valkyrie' was the code-name for a plan that called for Germany's Home Army (led by Thomas Kretschmann - he was the Euro boat captain in KONG 2005) to hold major German cities in case of a revolt from the millions of foreign laborers. Stauffenberg says, 'I've rewritten Valkyrie' (which is ironic, considering the filmmakers re-wrote the events of Hitler's assassination in VALKYRIE as well) - an idea which comes to Stauffenberg while listening to Wagner's Flight of the Valkyries (somehow Singer squeezed it in.) The plan: to kill Hitler - with a good old-fashioned time-bomb (with no Roger Ebert Red Digital Readout!) - then report that SS radicals were trying to take over the cities, which would allow the conspirators to mobilize the Home Army to arrest all SS officials. This would nullify Hitler's main Gestapo bulldog, Himmler.Stauffenberg plants the bomb in a briefcase near Hitler during a staff meeting. It detonates, seemingly killing everyone in the room. The Home Army started its takeover of major cities, but just as Germany was about to become the United States of Tom Cruise - Hitler was discovered alive and made a public radio announcement to proclaim his survival was divine.The conspirators failed by not controlling the flow of information. This was in a time when mass communications were in the form of telegrams sent to a central communications switchboard, then forwarded on. Though the conspirators had hundreds of high-ranking officers onboard Valkyrie, they failed to recruit the low-ranking message personnel. The telegram of Hitler's death stunned these indoctrinated Nazis, but the following one about his survival made them smell that rotten something in Denmark (on accounta it's so close to Germany...)Just as the conspirators were saying, 'I love it when a plan comes together,' the Home Army is re-claimed by the Nazis. As Stauffenberg's orders go out over the wire to arrest SS officers, orders issue from the Wolf's Lair (Hitler's HQ) to arrest Stauffenberg. The wire operators chose to send on The Fuehrer's orders and ignore Stauffenberg's.Stauffenberg made no effort to hide his tracks. He was discovered and executed within the 24-hour period when Valkyrie was launched on 20 July 1944. He was executed 21 July 1944.Somewhere in Germany, there is a monument to Tom Cruise for his brave sacrifice. Or is it in Britain in the amateur actor's museum?...",Null,2,6,5 February 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Call of the Simpsons.
","SIMPSONS fans will no doubt love it and pet it and call it Krusty. Newcomers will laugh and marvel at this old-fashioned 'cartooning' thing.THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is pretty much a SIMPSONS television episode. No better, no worse. Just longer.Which means it is very good - but we are left pondering the fiscal wisdom of turning this longest running American sitcom ever (first aired Dec 1989) into a feature film that plays like a TV viewing without the pee breaks.Sure, it has Emmys and Peabodys littering its shelf, but will the built-in SIMPSONS audience bother to get off their indented couches to pay for what they could easily view free on any given weeknight? Let's face it, for Homer Simpson to have attained such national treasure status, he must resonate with viewers... i.e. they're probably more like him than they'd care to admit...What Would Homer Do?... D'oh! Though Trey Parker's and Matt Stone's SOUTH PARK has long usurped THE SIMPSONS as the zenith of biting political and sociological satire, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE tries its best to bite back, aiming at a tender societal bone - the environment.Dan Castellaneta (voicing Homer and a host of others) leads the regular voice cast (Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, et al) in a tale about the city of Springfield going 'green,' to the point of going Orwell, the Environmental Protection Agency eventually sealing the town in a giant dome for Homer's polluting transgressions. Brought about by Homer's newly adopted Spider Pig. 'Spider Pig, Spider Pig; does whatever a Spider Pig does...' As he caused the en-doming of Springfield, it falls to Homer to free the town with some inspired accidents and contrived character arcing.Created by Matt Groening, written by - well, everyone - and directed by David Silverman (co-director, MONSTERS, INC., 2001), unlike Trey Parker's and Matt Stone's SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT (which stepped up from its episodic feel and made a hell of a feature film) THE SIMPSONS MOVIE finds Bart, Lisa, Marge Simpson and all the other much-loved denizens of Springfield trapped in episodic hell, business as usual.No better, no worse. Just longer.",5,1,2,5 February 2009
All the President's Men," Fall of the Imperial Presidency.
","Watergate. Conspiracy. Burglary. Perjury. Courtesy of the 37th President of the United States.Over the years, I've called Richard Milhous Nixon a 'hellspawn from Satan's own vagina'Â and I see no reason to stop.ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a powerful recount of specifically one event in Satan's Vagina's presidency that would define not just his wretched life and character, but ultimately the Republican presidential idiom - the Watergate Scandal.Dick Cheney must hate this film. This is the tale of how that imperial presidency he has tried all his life to restore was lopped off at the knees. The story of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN was the catalyst that created the cowardly thug Dick Cheney.The 1972 exposÃ©s from the pages of the Washington Post newspaper (by young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein) are breathed life on the big screen by screenwriter William Goldman and director Alan J. Pakula. Full credit to Pakula for making a dry political felony play like a mystery thriller, as Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) research the story behind the Watergate Hotel break-in by some of the president's men, tracing it up the withered tree of liberty to the Oval Egg itself, indicting ALL the president's men.As Woodward and Bernstein knock on doors, make endless phone calls, meet, trick, cajole people to verify sources and information, we get lost sometimes amongst all the felons, because there are so many; this is real life and it is not a case of one Batman Villain and a coterie of faceless henchmen - each of the unethical, amoral, interconnected criminals contributed equally to the collusion and conspiracy that led to the burglary and illegal wiretapping of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in the Watergate Hotel in 1972. Even when reading the book (of the same name, by Woodward and Bernstein), you find yourself always turning to the Dramatis Personae to discern the players and their involvement - a bit like LORD OF THE RINGS, except in this drama, the evil characters are much more depraved, deformed and malevolent.All overlorded by Satan's Vagina.Thankfully, the filmmakers did not portray the character of Nixon in the film (a shoddy lookalike or caricatured impersonation at best, which would have diluted the film); all we see of Nixon are a few real television appearances on news footage.Set back in the day when telephones were rotary dial, when the irritating clack of typewriters had not yet been replaced by the annoying hum of word processors; back when Robert Redford's feathered hair caused women unsuspecting panty accidents; back in the day when Dick Cheney used to skulk the halls of the Nixon administration as merely a staff member (no kidding!), waiting for the day he could push the imperial presidency further than the state of abuse it had escalated to back then. (He succeeded beyond his wildest craven desires with the Ku Bush Klan 30 years later.) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is not about the investigation of the Nixon administration, nor about the 18 minutes of blank tape, or the forced, shameful resignation of Satan's Vagina; it is not even about the hundreds of other unethical, malevolent deeds the president blast-farted onto American society (illegal Cambodia cover-up of 1970, The HMO Act of 1973) - it is about the two men who exposed the scandal that would lead to that investigation.Everything was on the line: Woodward and Bernstein's reputations, the reputation of the Post newspaper, their jobs, ultimately their lives, the freedom of the press, and the Constitution of the United States.Woodward and Bernstein's best source was the secretive informant known as Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook, eternally in darkness in the parking garage rendezvous point - thank Gordon Willis, the same cinematographer who notoriously 'lighted' the dark, moody GODFATHER films). Which raised the eternal question: which came first, the presidential informant or the whore? Turns out there was no distinction. Linda Lovelace (DEEP THROAT, 1972) could have just as easily abrogated the duties of president and the president was overqualified to be a whore. We would learn over three decades later that Deep Throat was Mark W. Felt (revealed 2005, died 2008), the second highest officer in J. Edgar Hoover's FBI.Woodward and Bernstein worked so intently together on the Watergate scandal that their superiors took to calling them 'Woodstein.'Incredibly realistic acting makes this look like a documentary at times, from every supporting player, to the major stars at the Post: Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and Jason Robards (as editor Ben Bradlee).The irony is astounding: the man who most convinced the world to retaliate against the Nazis - was Hitler himself. Just as the man most responsible for America voting a Democratic president into office in 2008 - was Republican George W. Bush! So too, the man most responsible for losing the American public's faith in high office was - the man who inhabited the highest office in America, Richard Milhous Satan's Vagina Nixon.ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN ends with Nixon being sworn in to his second term, on a television in the foreground, while in the background, Woodward and Bernstein type up the damning information which would bring down the administration and change the course of the blood red river of American politics forever.Well, at least until Dick Cheney got his stinking hands on the presidency.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8,2,4,3 January 2010
The Soloist," Biting The Hand That Exploits You.
","When movies address the supposed nobility of humanity (a fiction created by humans) we've got to look past the uplifting orchestration to the deep background on what is actually being sold.With THE SOLOIST, we don't have to look too deep. It's the story of Los Angeles newspaper columnist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr), finding a story in a homeless Julliard-trained cellist, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx, foregoing smoothness on the outside for smoothness on the inside). Set in 2005 and based loosely on two real life characters, I kept wondering why Lopez insisted on trying to help Nathaniel off the streets and into a shelter, against Nathaniel's recalcitrance and downright ungratefulness at times.Hmm, let's see: Lopez is a newspaper columnist. What could he possibly want? Lopez discovers the homeless, scatter-brained Nathaniel near a Beethoven statue; later hears him playing violin and strikes up an uneasy acquaintance with him. He researches Nathaniel's tall tales of Julliard attendance, tracks down Nathaniel's family and writes about him in his daily column, whereupon a kind old lady bequeaths Nathaniel a cello.Lopez continues to push himself onto Nathaniel and eventually gets him off the streets and into a homeless shelter called LAMP (Los Angeles Men's Project), situated one door down from Hell in Downtown Los Angeles. Skid Row, utter squalor, black people in aimless droves, smoking crack on the streets, fighting, sex, deaths... Questions are raised as to how far Lopez can intrude on Nathaniel's life to ostensibly 'help' him. And we keep wondering: Just what is in it for Lopez?...Downey is on top of his game, as if Foxx, but his cello miming leaves a lot to be desired - for portraying someone who is supposedly a virtuoso at the instrument. He doesn't do enough vibrato. (A violinist once told me, 'Just TRY and stop a string player doing vibrato!') Lopez wangles Nathaniel into attending a performance of the L.A. Philharmonic (with Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting, no less). And Nathaniel's listening experience is portrayed as euphoric explosive mind-colors - but - How dare the filmmakers presume to show us how Nathaniel perceived the music? He was a schizoid personality whom Lopez battled constantly to keep focused. Nathaniel is portrayed as an overlooked genius purely for dramatic purposes. But he is not. He was not denied his time in the spotlight. He was a little crazy to begin with; he had his shot and he shunned it. Just because he happens to play a supposedly 'noble' instrument doesn't mean he can't be as off-kilter as C.C. DeVille, the drug-addled guitarist of Poison, who is a great technician on his instrument, but batshit crazy nonetheless.We discover Nathaniel needs meds to keep those Crazy Fluids in check. But he was never a 'genius.' How can I be so sure? Besides the inane babbling, moody indecision, and ragged unreliability portrayed by Jamie Foxx, we meet Nathaniel Ayers himself in the DVD Special Features.While the real life Lopez and Ayers chat together, Ayers breaks into a Beethoven cello passage. Now, it may be his mental condition that keeps him from the recording studio or joining an orchestra, but it may also be that he's not very good. His technique is definitely that of a string player (he has that vibrato that Foxx lacks) but there are many, many notes that are quite, quite flat. And all the while, Lopez commends him on how grand he sounds! Which leads us to another surmise: that Ayers relishes his small pond (where he is a legend to his kennel-crazy fellows) and doesn't want to risk leaving it for a stab at responsibility, studied rehearsal, and getting lost amongst other mediocre players who don't regard him as King Pompous Ass.So shuck off that whitey guilt that was creeping up yo spine. Nathaniel didn't end up homeless due to extreme bad luck; his own 'inner demons' put him there. (Love dat 'inner demon' euphemism bullshit - means we don't have to diagnose further or identify solutions.) And we discover this film is 'from the book by Steve Lopez.' And all motivation comes clear. After his newspaper columns, Lopez scored a BOOK DEAL! There are people in this world who genuinely seek to help others - news columnists are not those people. Steve Lopez's relationship with Nathaniel was similar to Truman Capote's with Perry Smith when he wrote In Cold Blood - academia curdling against humanity, friendship mixing uneasily with exploitation.So though the filmmakers THINK their movie is focused on humanity's 'nobility,' we realize that with Nathaniel still on the real life streets even after Lopez's publishing deal and this A-List movie - it is really about humanity's IGNOBILITY.Lopez wraps the film: 'His mental condition and his wellbeing are as precarious now as when we first met.' Doesn't matter too much now - Lopez scored a book deal - every writer's dream. And I'm pretty sure Nathaniel isn't getting any residual points on it...Nathaniel Ayers is not a genius in any sense of the word. Still, in Hollywood, you don't have to be a genius to make it - just have a story worth telling.And that's something that Nathanial Ayers has in spades. Steve Lopez says so in his book.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",6,1,2,20 November 2009
Dodgeball," Dodgeball Grabs Its Nuts By The Balls
","Ben Stiller's best roles have been the few that have almost burst his carotid artery through certifiably asinine overacting. (To date, that would only count *Mystery Men*, *Zoolander*, and cameos in *Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy* and *The Cable Guy* - add *Dodgeball* to that short list.) His early 90s comedy series, *The Ben Stiller Show*, though a fine showcase for his frenetic talents, was so underrated and misunderstood that it was actually cancelled first time outa the gate, only to be reinstated on Comedy Central at varying intervals. Unfortunately, in his gradual assimilation into feature film pap, his chunky monkey breadwinner is his Woody Allen Lite nebbish (*Your Friends and Neighbors, Along Came Polly, Meet The Parents, et al*; hell! - he even turned David Starsky into a neb!).*Dodgeball* is Stiller's welcome return to artery-busting form, as the corporate gym owner, White Goodman - entrepreneurial, avaricious, bombastic Bad Guy to Vince Vaughn's somnolent Pete La Fleur, who mismanages his own failing gym across the way. White has designs on merging Pete's fringe-dweller gym with his own commercial monster conglomerate and will go to any sweat-tainted lengths to corporately consume it.In this film fantasy where an independent, successful, sexy woman (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real-life wife, playing Kate the auditor, whom everybody wants to examine 'under the counter'), can fall for a shiftless itinerant like Pete La Fleur, it is no stretch to discover that the only way La Fleur can raise money to save his gym is to enter a Dodgeball tournament with a cadre of his willing (though untrained) gym patrons. Due to the movie taking itself about as seriously as the inflated bulge in White Goodman's jockstrap, we go along for the ride.Hank Azaria and Rip Torn camp it up as young and old versions of legendary Dodgeballer, Patches O'Houlihan, whose methods of training La Fleur's dysfunctional, ubergeek squad would give any man pause for scrotal reflection.The tournament itself action-packs the last half hour of film, and climaxes with Pete and White facing off (- how'd you guess? You must be psychic!). During the game-play, director and writer, Rawson Marshall Thurber cannily transfers the volley of humor, which rested upon the main cast Â who has now taken to the Dodgeball court Â to the broadcast commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (Gary Cole and Jason Bateman, hamming their roles with a vengeance and a copy of the Insensate Drivel Handbook).Any movie artful enough to tweak audiences into investing their alliance in a misfit dodgeball team has more going for it than just hot chicks and scrotum jokes. Who outside of the sixth grade even knew this sport still existed in mankind's repertoire? Anxiety churns my blood, for the internet can so easily resolve this mystery, yet I dare not make the connection, for I fear I will either discover a horror so demeaning that it will debase my already staggering lack of faith in humanity's intelligence quotient, or Â L. Ron Hubbard have mercy! - I may suddenly embrace the urge to squoze my scrote into a purple unitard and take one on the face for the team Â and if that image doesn't get your carotid artery throbbing, it's already burstÂ(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7,1,2,21 November 2005
The Fighter," Trailer Trash Writ Glorious.
","In the first three minutes of THE FIGHTER, we realize that Christian Bale should not have won that Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this film. He should have won for Best ACTOR.Yes, we know the technical definitions of 'main,' 'major,' and 'supporting' characters - but really! Bale's Herculean immersion into his wild-eyed character drove this film, which, without his involvement, would have been merely another lazy story about an underdog clawing his way to the middle echelons of a testosterone-induced inferiority-complex dick measuring competition; to call boxing a 'sport' is to imply it has some intrinsic spiritual worth.BALE is to THE FIGHTER what Kilmer is to TOMBSTONE, what Brando is to STREETCAR, what Day-Lewis is to GANGS OF NEW YORK.Bale is Dicky Eklund, a gregarious, trouble-seeking, ex-boxer from 'Bahston,' who trains and manages his younger brother 'Irish' Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) with the best intentions, yet with no clout to take Micky into the bigger leagues where he belongs. Mother Alice (Melissa Leo) co-manages with big dreams and bigger hair.Dicky's claim to fame is that he once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. (Leonard plays himself alongside Bale and Wahlberg - still looking twenty years younger than his age.) Since this movie is based on real life characters, we see some old footage of the real Eklund swiping at Leonard and Leonard hitting the canvas; contention to this day whether Leonard slipped.But Dicky is a junkie. Though he must have once retained a modicum of discipline to grace the ring with Leonard, when we meet him here, he is so way past gone that when HBO interviews him and follows him around with a camera crew for a documentary on crack addiction, he sincerely thinks they are documenting his boxing comeback.Bale's performance is magnetic, crafting a character through mind and body; gaunt, emaciated, a junkie for all intents and purposes. Oldman, Seymour Hoffman, De Niro. Bale is an actor willing to go so deep into his role that we truly think he lives there; an actor who makes us forget he was someone else in his previous movies - we do not look at this incoherent, twitchy crackhead and immediately think, 'Hey, this guy is John Connor!' - and we really have to woik our imaginations to believe this beanstem could possibly be the Dark Knight! Further, deponent sayeth not; the awards speak for themselves.Wahlberg diametrically opposes Bale's extroversion and brings a studied quietude to a role that demands of him an Eastwood-ian intensity coupled with a Schwarzenegger power behind his shoulders. And his underwear modeling days serve him in good stead - his physicality is explosive. If Bale wasn't here ass-klowning around, then Wahlberg would have been lauded as this movie's driver. He's become a very efficient actor - from annoying New Kid On The Block, to weaning off his baby-fat in FEAR, to the reasonable SHOOTER, to his slap-in-the-face performance in DEPARTED, we've seen him grow into this starring role. Well done, my son! The Gay-For-Wahlberg Express is boarding now...Let's get something straight about the difference between this movie and the people that this movie portrays. The MOVIE is excellent. These PEOPLE (the usual salt-of-the-Earth epithet is 'they're good people') are a bunch of pugilistic rednecks; they're in a profession that glorifies unprovoked battle - people beating up each other for no reason other than the created reason of income; they're in and out of jail, their lives revolve around alcohol, drugs and fighting (not necessarily in the ring). When you see the trailers for this Award-winning film, the soundtrack makes it seem like something epic is being achieved. It is not. It's about two roughnecks who know nothing much about anything else. The actors' PERFORMANCES make this movie compelling.THE FIGHTER follows the tribulations of Wahlberg's Micky before he went pro in the mid-80s, as he tries to literally and metaphysically fight his way out of the security zone of his trailer trash environs.He dates barmaid Charlene (Amy Adams looking voluptuously trailer) and butts heads with his family to accept her - a gaggle of sisters who all look like men and speak like education hasn't been invented yet; he must constantly drag Dicky out of the crack house; he must contend with Dicky's jealousy when an agent offers him paid training in Vegas (to raise the money to train in Boston instead, Dicky puts his crackhead girlfriend out on the street hooking); he must contend with Dicky getting in trouble with the law (during one street fight, a cop breaks Micky's hand); he finds himself at the center of two families - his girl and trainer pit themselves against his trailer siblings and mother.THE FIGHTER boasts boxing scenes as realistic as having your jaw rattled by a roundhouse. We have grown so inured to the fakery of the ROCKY films (and their imitators), where the fighters box without blocking and the punches resound like thunderclaps, that seeing the realistic boxing style of these guys is refreshing. Wahlberg trained for years for this role, and it shows. Where are YOU looking when he takes his shirt off? Reliable character actor Jack McGee is Micky's father; Mickey O'Keefe, a real life policeman and friend of the family who trained Micky, plays himself. Now training Wahlberg, which must have been surreal for him.During the end credits, we meet both real life brothers, Micky and Dicky, and we realize just what amazing jobs Wahlberg and Bale did personifying them. Visually, we immediately recognize who is who, and when they speak, it's over. What the hell! - give a Best Actor award to BOTH those guys!",8,0,1,24 November 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," ...and Justice for none.
","'Just as every cop is a criminal / And all the sinners saints. As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer / 'Cause I'm in need of some restraint...' --Sympathy For The Devil, The Rolling Stones. Handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser, I see a poster for LAW ABIDING CITIZEN and overhear the officer in the driver seat comment to his partner, 'Seen that movie? Awesome.' Of course he'd think it was awesome. We all know that cops are bottom-rungers, trained watchdogs, the lowest cog apprehenders of the lowest cogs. They only know enough about 'The Law' to apprehend without discernment. And they know nothing about 'Justice.' Now I could've tried to dissuade this bacon burger of his ignorant opinion, but a) I was busy exercising my right to remain silent, and b) he would not possess the mental capacity to comprehend me; which might have led to c) a nightstick to the throat.LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is about a vigilante, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), who takes revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child. Clyde is apprehended by the police (see? 'apprehend without discernment') and from his jail cell he terrorizes lazy, despicable attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) to teach him a lesson. Nick let the murderers walk on a plea bargain, instead of taking it to trial and risking losing a case. CITIZEN starts as a very satisfactory, righteous vigilante story and an indictment against the criminal 'justice' system, and turns into a one-dimensional vendetta that involves Clyde blowing stuff up, Hollywood style. The movie's first half is a rollout of counterintuitive surprises: Clyde carving up his wife's murderer and then letting himself be taken in - naked, mind you, ladies! (that's some Sparta-licious booty!); Clyde citing an obscure case number at his hearing and the judge allowing him to walk - then chiding the judge for almost letting a suspected murderer go free and being taken into custody for contempt!; Clyde blackmailing Nick into getting him a Duxiana mattress and a steak dinner in jail. When Clyde kills his cellmate unemotionally and lies back waiting for the warden peacefully, we realize something is going askew - it's a cool scene, but Clyde is starting to look like Hannibal Lecter, rather than a man bent on revenge for his wife. It astounds me how writer Kurt Wimmer and director F. Gary Gray lost the movie's message so inelegantly.To stop Clyde blowing stuff up and teaching him lessons, Nick Rice decides to go vigilante and blow up Clyde, Hollywood style. Which means he learned NOTHING from Clyde. Taking the law into your own hands is EXACTLY what Nick was trying to stop Clyde from doing. Further, Nick had no proof that Clyde was perpetrating all the vengeful acts - you might 'know' a person has committed crimes but before you BLOW THEM UP, shouldn't you take them to trial first, or at least read them their rights? But that cop said this movie was 'awesome.' Getting an idea of the shallow mindset of uniformed flatfoots? It gets tiresome when we can figure the 'winner' of the movie by figuring the biggest paycheck. Butler may have carved his name into the A-List with 300, but Foxx (RAY, DREAMGIRLS, THE SOLOIST) is the money here. Clyde states unequivocally, 'everyone must be held accountable for their actions,' yet Nick is never brought to justice himself when HE goes vigilante without evidence. I've said it before: Vigilantism is as malformed and unjust as The Law that it thumbs its nose at. Two sides of the same confused coin. This movie chooses to ignore any further consequences of vigilantism or the law or justice after the moneyboy gets his way. In the DVD Commentary, the filmmakers say Nick Rice is interested in Justice as a concept - but they've got it wrong. He's interested in The Law as a Job. Clyde laments he is a law abiding citizen, thus the law should deliver him justice. So we take it for granted the title pertains to him. But the unrealized irony in this movie is that detective Nick Rice is playing the LAW ABIDING CITIZEN - the one who suckles at the black teat of The Law for his advancement - and Clyde Shelton is the Justice-seeking citizen.So explain the Justice of why I'm in the back of this police car? Geez, look who I'm asking...",5,16,18,27 July 2010
Up in the Air," Loner Class.
","UP IN THE AIR is that rare chickcentric movie that doesn't make me want to vomit or slap someone. It is a story about love, but it's not a Love Story; it's a movie about romance, but it's not a Romantic Movie; it takes us on a bucking and diving flight across the landscape of human emotions and leaves us... up in the air.Two ships pass in the night. And keep passing.This movie is refreshing as a bottle of Orange Cream-Mama being shaken and opened in your face. A story about an enigmatic connection between two attractive, intelligent, middle-aged protagonists - not teen hipsters flapping platitudes and doing drugs in tight t-shirts. A movie that doesn't dumb itself down, nor dumb us down, which surprises even the best of us nihilists.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, charm working overtime) and Alex Goran (curvy, sensual Vera Farmiga), two Constant Travelers turned on by each others' elitism, meet at an airport bar and strike up a steamy, traveling relationship, never daring to get closer than a few cities apart.Ryan's job is to fire people from theirs, a kind of Termination consultant brought in by corporations too gutless to face their own employees when letting them go. Much like the impermanence of the job market he sluices through like a shark, Ryan's life is uncluttered and itinerant - that's the way he likes it: 'All the things you hate about flying are warm reminders I'm home.' He describes the time he spent in his apartment last year as '43 miserable days.' Alex is a little more mysterious, which will prove to be this movie's trump card.Ryan's boss (Jason Bateman) saddles him with a termination novice, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), whose naivetÃ© about career and love is in stark contrast to Ryan's and Alex's mature, intelligent take on life, sex and other mishaps. Whereas Clooney and Farmiga work beautifully together, underplaying against each other with an easy chemistry that sits on them like favorite sweatshirts, Natalie is an uncomfortable naif in her own skin, representing the flapping teen demographic and spouting the Chick Flick platitudes to prove it. Irony is, she details her mundane life plan as something worth aiming for, and Ryan's brother-in-law to be (Danny McBride, in a poignant, subdued role) details the exact same plan later as if it is a fatalistic dead end.Directed and co-written by Jason Reitman, UP IN THE AIR and his other auteur work, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING (2006), are so much more honest and compelling than that girlie crap that he merely directed, JUNO (2007, written by Diablo Cody). Movie's denouement is a welcome shake to the shoulders, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. Produced by both Reitmans (Jason and father, Ivan), from a novel by Walter Kim, UP IN THE AIR takes the Chick Flick Handbook and tears out the pages on Making Real Men Vomit. Men (and pussy-men alike) can safely watch this whole movie with the person whose purse holds their balls, and not pretend to fall asleep or threaten a brain aneurysm.Effective cameos from J.K. Simmons as a sacked employee, Zach Galifianakis as a vengeance-crazed sacked employee, and Sam Elliott, whose mustache is now completely out of control.",8,0,2,24 June 2011
V for Vendetta," V versus W: No Betta Vendetta
","Conjuring icons and tableaux from humanity's last four millennia (including Guy Fawkes, The Phantom of the Opera, Shakespeare, Huxley's Brave New World, Batman, Nazism, The Man With No Name, and a thousand other quasi-plagiarisms), V FOR VENDETTA is a confluence of electric ideas and wolfen imagery that will burn itself into the cortexes of this politically-tepid generation as Orwell's 1984 was burned into previous generations.It may even make them do what today's society would rather they didn't: think.Whereas 1984, published in 1949, heralded the pessimism of a far-flung future, where civil liberties were nonexistent, where government held tyrannical sway over citizens' very thoughts, manufacturing fear through canards and strong-arming via automaton Thought Police, the horror of VENDETTA's vision is that it reflects not a distant future, but the PRESENT.Sure, it is clothed in a fiction; of a Britain gone Beyond Big Brother, where pseudo-police called Finger Men are given carte blanche to do with suspects as they please, including cold-blooded murder and rape; where the government can manufacture a virus, release it into the public, and then use the cure as election leverage, and where elected officials have stakes in the company that sells the cure - but how is this any different from a President and his cronies profiteering from a manufactured war that costs millions of lives, holding stakes in all the weapons and oil conglomerates involved? Just as superheroes were originally created in reaction to their social climate (Zorro, to fight the tyranny of the Spanish Californian governor; Superman, as escapist vision after the Great Depression; Captain America, to give Hitler a good old American Right Hook every so often - all three of these icons also evoked by this film), VENDETTA's hero, simply known as 'V,' is a superhero for OUR times, fighting for the same ideals as his predecessors, ramped up to 2000s ferocity.Wearing a permanent Guy Fawkes facemask, V (Hugo Weaving) takes his cue from Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot of 1605 (to assassinate King James I by blowing up the Houses of Parliament), motivated by the same premise - to overthrow a corrupt government. Fawkes was foiled on November 5 (hence the rhyme, 'Remember, remember, the fifth of NovemberÃâ¦'). V is also the only surviving guinea pig from the manufacture of the lethal government virus, which necessitated his facemask and Bat-Zorro outfit. Hence his vendetta - against all his captors, now occupying political positions.Departing from the storyline and ideologies of Alan Moore's and David Lloyd's graphic novel from which it was lifted, writers Andy and Larry Wachowski script VENDETTA in a society of 2020, but quite easily evoke a society likely in existence today: there is nary a doubt that this is George W. Bush's dystopian America. To take the edge off the scythe, the British government stands as allegory for the U.S. government, America having been nullified as a world power in a recent war.On the November 5th night we meet V, he rescues Evey (Natalie Portman), just before he blows the Old Bailey courts, to the strains of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, promising in a pirated television broadcast to do the same to the Houses of Parliament next year.Upon V's first appearance as the suavely lethal, black-caped vigilante, loquacious to a fault, my heart actually beat faster - at last!: a character intelligent, articulate and adept at weaponry - who is not the British Bad Guy. At long last, a truly knowledgeable and literate protagonist wins the day, not some disheveled cop or loudmouth devil-brat who teaches his parents how to love again. A Hero whose abode is piled high with books, where art and learning - not a big screen TV or sports memorabilia - are given pride of place; without the snide implication that knowledge equals nerd equals FRASIER.WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH - Orwell, 1984.In the most ironic casting since Moses became the head of the NRA, John Hurt (who played the failed rebel Winston Smith, in the film version of 1984) overlords this totalitarian social order as Supreme Chancellor Sutler, whose every ranting breath from wall-sized TV monitors is channeled into policy through his armed regimes of thoughtless drogues. (How is this any different to a President who can sign a bill against torture and then use torture whenever he feels like it; who can progress a war effort without the legal approval of congress?) A small coterie of officials report to the Chancellor, for weekly doses of intimidation, among them, Finch (Stephen Rea), doing the 'disheveled cop who finds his conscience' routine, and Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) as the cop who doesn't have one.Natalie Portman, who seems to have a proclivity for morally-ambiguous super killers - Leon, Darth Vader, and now V - effectively wipes away the stain of STAR WARS with this performance. I am in love again. Hugo Weaving, eternally hidden behind V's mask, lets his unseen elocution fly daggers, and is doubly commended for the fact that he is so clearly understood even without the benefit of seeing his moving lips.'Behind this mask, there is an Idea. And Ideas are bulletproof.' Watch any episode of REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER and the occasional guest Republican will stand their ground like a braying ass, defending their pedestrian President against incompetence and duplicity against all evidence to the contrary. If there is one unquestioning drogue like that, there are thousands. An Idea being bulletproof unfortunately works both ways.'The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.' This film is a cry out to the intelligentsia of the planet to hold fast - in one way or another, justice is coming in a long black cape...",9,2,4,9 August 2011
The Godfather," The Godfather Of Them All
","It has been over three decades since its birth, yet *The Godfather* reigns as the yardstick by which all other gangster movies are brutally scrutinized.Only twice has its proprietary mien been challenged - with Scorcese's gutshock *Goodfellas* in 1990 and David Chase's superlative *The Sopranos* in 1999. Everything else runs a far, far fourth behind these juggernauts.From Mario Puzo's book of the same name, Francis Ford Coppolla directs the legendary story of an East Coast crime lord, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in the eponymous role), grooming his eldest son, Santino 'Sonny' (James Caan) to take over the Family Business, that being, one arm of the Italian 'Five Families' who run the Eastern seaboard's organized crime. When Sonny is brutally gunned down in an inter-familial dispute, Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who sought a life removed from the Family's 'business,' ultimately discovers his familial and business instincts and steps into the breach to take the reins.Like the movie itself, its characters have weathered the three decades to become icons by which all other movie gangsters are measured; most of the actors in these staggering roles never quite shaking off the specter of their characters Â which will surely haunt them far past their own deaths.These archetypes have become so ingrained in our culture that it is almost impossible to think back to a time when they did not exist; like trying to imagine a world before *Smoke On The Water*, or *Star Wars.* Very simply, if not for *The Godfather* these archetypes would not be archetypes. The movie actually influenced real crime families with its new street vernacular ('Make him an offer he can't refuse') and manner of conducting 'business' (that of regarding any means to achieve an end as honorable Â as long as the good of The Family was invoked).The greatest gift *The Godfather* bequeathed the movie-going public was its unapologetic stance on anti-social behavior. Beyond 'Man with No Name' protocol Â where a lone stranger would operate by his own rules, disregarding anyone else's well-being for his own ends - here was a FAMILY, an organized para-militia of sociopaths who followed principles wildly at odds with 'normal' society's. Yet Puzo, Coppolla and actors boldly offer no excuses as to their characters' existence, motives or actions. After our Gangster 101 schooling with James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and George Raft, here was a blood-driven, wealth-engined world only hinted at in those previous gangster genre movies, now fleshed out almost against our will; here was a world where our societal notions of right and wrong were utterly reversed, yet which made sense in the verisimilitude of its own universe.Searing with grand irony, the first line of dialog in *The Godfather* is, 'I believe in America.' And indeed, these characters are not mindless convenience store hijack artists Â they are businessmen in the truest sense of the word. They are also imbued with a strong sense of loyalty and justice. Though *The Godfather* may seem apologist in its stance towards supposedly heartless criminals, telling the tale from *their* point of view allows us freedom from guilt when we realize that 'crime' is a subjective term. As Don Corleone states, when opting not to murder molesters, but rather land them in hospital like their victim, 'We're not murderers.' No matter they dabbled in gambling, prostitution, money-laundering and murder, they sought only to be self-sufficient, to keep their families well, and to live comfortably in peace - otherwise called The American Dream.In setting the tale in the 1940s, Puzo and Coppolla removed us from everyday reality from the outset; in this insular universe we readily accepted The Family's version of morality. It was no stretch to dovetail the authorities' actions in the film with our suspected perception of them in our reality. Matter of fact, it seemed to vindicate our darkest suspicions that the people whom we place our unmitigated trust in for safety from society's savage shadow dwellers are in cahoots with those very shadow dwellers who are trying to subvert our safety.There are scenes that will be burned forever into your mind's movie wall: the opening tableau of the Godfather presiding at his desk; the head of racehorse Khartoum in Jack Woltz's bed; Michael gunning down the police captain; Carlo Rizzo being bitch-whipped by Sonny; the slaying of Sonny; even seemingly-benign scenes like Moe Greene's meeting with Michael, where he claps his hands together and exclaims, 'You goddam guineas really make me laugh!' Â the subsequent bullet through his eye is another mind-burner; and the grand 'cleansing' Â scenes of the East Coast bosses being killed systematically juxtaposed over Michael renouncing Satan at his god-daughter's baptismÂ Through it all runs the unbreakable thread of Family. The opening wedding scene ends on a poignant note of a father dancing with his daughter. Harking back to the familial theme constantly, Coppolla reaffirms our deepest vicarious desires. We are all immigrants to some extent, the bonds of our heritages displaced, fragmented, growing weaker over every generation of X-Box and internet junkies; there seems nothing that can bind the strands of our familial threads. We find affinity in the blood bonds of *The Godfather*, on some level deeper than the span of oceans and the passage of time.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",10,2,5,5 July 2006
