The Mask," Wacked out special effects (SORTA SPOILERS)
","I don't care much for Jim Carrey, since his acting itself seems like his own personal mask, but I was able to sit all the way through this with out throwing anything at the television.  Overall an average movie with a couple of highs like the dog, and the extravagant dance numbers.  Good for a boring day.",Null,0,0,2 February 2001
Antz," Antz Suckz
","This is a sad attempt at comedy, free advice Woody next time you make a movie like this don't aim it at adults, it doesn't work. Until then take a lesson from Disney and Pixar. Yeesh this movie is as grim as Saving Private Ryan while as cutesy as the teletubbies. Not a good combination, and the graphics ain't exactly up to 1998 standards either. Go see A Bugs Life or Toy Story you'll be alot happier and feel safer letting your kids watch it. This movie has some stuff in it you won't exactly love your kids seeing. 1 out of 5.",Null,1,2,10 August 1999
Snatch," The wacky british
","If it wasn't for a teacher suggesting this, I would of NEVER seen it, but I'm glad I did. The visuals are superb, a true innovative style that could only be indie.  The music was great, and the way Ritchie was able to do music without dialouge was breath taking, and after seeing this I bought the sound track, barely ever hearing of the artists. The best part though was the direction used to bring the two stories together, pure genius.  My brother on the other hand though... fell asleep.",Null,0,0,2 February 2001
The Doors," Stone-o'-vision
","So here we are again with another one of Oliver Stone(d)'s twisted reality films.   After watching this film for it's longer than two hour run, you feel like you've been on some kind of psycho drug, and are coming down with a major hangover.  Headaches and bad view included!  Did I mention, this was not accurate?",4,6,12,14 June 2000
Save the Last Dance," In simple terms, IT SUCKED
","I never really liked MTV, except for Daria, it just always seemed so commercial and phoney and anything for a good time. BUT NOW I REALLY HATE MTV! Guess what kids, MTV is only in it for the money, and they don't care how they get it.  So what they did was mix a sappy unreal story, some dancing, and hot young stories, to make what they knew would be a success. Got to remember, big brother MTV always knows what's right.",Null,1,1,2 February 2001
Schindler's List," Best one of the kind
",Words cannot describe the feeling I have towards this movie.  Having family member ancestry of both sides of the war I thought it was important to watch this movie to get my information straghtened out.  This is the first movie ever to bring me to tears.  Beautifully carved out to a document type feeling.  Note of trivia: Steven Spieldberg went home crying everyday crying during production.  I don't blame him.,10,9,13,30 June 2000
Dumb and Dumber," As the name says
","This is one of the few movies I can actually say I really really hated.  I tried to like it, but it was just so corny and full of dumb jokes that it couldn't be saved.  The acting is even worse, and I can't believe that crap like this has a huge following while smarter and funnier movies go unnoticed.",Null,1,2,2 February 2001
Pulp Fiction," I was grounded for watching this
","AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.  I love this movie, who cares if it's violent? Worlds full of enough politically correct wimps already.  For anyone who needs a laugh and is not offended by EXTREME VULGARITY, knock yourself out. Quick note to Frank fans: you probably are going to want to stay clear of this, you'll thank me later. :)",9,0,0,30 June 2000
Cube," Whoa... I'm impressed.
","If you gave this movie a one, you just don't get it.  Or maybe you've been brainwashed by the bubble gum, and pat on the back from the once beautiful American science fiction genre.  I'm a really big science fiction fan.  I've probably seen everything there is to be offered, so whenever I watch a sci-fi I've never seen, I don't expect much.  This movie had me scared... Big Time. And it's not fear of violence or blood, you will be phsycologically scared.  I think that anyone that is into a pure nonmedia solution to the terrible sci-fi's that are coming out should see this.",10,0,1,11 March 2000
