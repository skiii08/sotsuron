Requiem for a Dream," Amazing movie that changed my life
","I viewed this movie while under the influence of many drugs, at a point in my life sometimes I'd rather not remember. This movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I knew nothing about the movie before watching it. By the end of the movie I had completely broken down, and was crying miserably. I ended up calling up my parents and some buddies and admitting I had a serious drug problem, thanks to this movie. Since then I've gone clean, and my life has been improving more and more. I think it takes a terribly powerful and amazing movie to bring somebody to this point. I recommend this movie to everybody, and think that movies like this would help people to stay off drugs more than all those anti-drug campaigns you get to see all the time.",9,4,7,17 June 2006
