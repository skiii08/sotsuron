Saturday Night Fever," 'You're a clich√©. You're nowhere...on your way to no place'. - Stephanie Mangano
","'Saturday Night Fever' is a late 70's classic coming-of-age film. When I saw this movie, in a packed theater on Staten Island, New York in the winter of 1977 the people around me seemed to miss the point. When Karen Lynn Gorney's character Stephanie tells John Travolta's Tony he's going nowhere the audience booed her & clapped for his response, 'What the 'f' you got? A stairway to the stars?' After the film's release, some people were emulating Tony's friend's negative & sometimes stereotypical behavior. The movie's message was to better yourself, but some people just didn't get this simple premise. Karen Lynn Gorney was excellent as Stephanie Mangano, the business person/Manhattanite wannabe who mesmerized Tony Manero. Although she was about 32 at the time, she was playing a 20 year old (this was common casting practice in the 70's). My favorite scene is the touching moments when Tony tells Stephanie all he knows about the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge symbolizes Tony's desire to get out of Brooklyn. If it had been The Brooklyn Bridge this scene would have made more sense, because the Verrazano Bridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island, not Manhattan (a place we're their lives will supposedly get better). The language is authentic, the clothing, music & dancing are filled with 70's nostalgia. The film is NOT politically correct in any way. Therefore, it's very realistic, 'in-your-face', & represents the time & place in which it was made. If you have an interest in late 70's pop culture this movie is a must see.",10,2,5,10 April 2002
Monster," Aileen Carol Wuornos (2/29/59 - 10/9/02)
","This movie is not for everyone. It's hard to take & depressing. It's the story of a lost, tortured soul who was certainly 'walking wounded'. She was a serial killer & by all accounts only the first killing was justified & the lowlife deserved his fate. The film tells the story of Aileen (Lee) Wuornos without justifying what she did. The viewer actually gets to know her as a human being & I sympathized with her to a degree. It's the humanization of her that made me sympathize with her. Otherwise, she'd just be another nut-job/hooker/murderer who also got what she deserved. There are some insights into her here & there in the film (molested as a child, raped by a family 'friend', beaten by her father who later committed suicide, discarded by her siblings, became a prostitute at 13 to survive, battered by partners & cops, alcoholism etc.) that make you feel that this somewhat powerless & uneducated woman actually became addicted to killing once she started because it was a release of anger & hatred that had built up inside of her for so many years. I also felt sympathy for her because she wanted to 'go straight' & work but she set her sights too high & was knocked down once again. Granted, the attempt to straighten her life out was mostly out of fear of being caught after she killed the first guy in self defense, but she also loved Selby & possibly wanted more 'nomalcy' for them as a couple in that respect as well. I know the movie takes liberties with some facts. For example, the real Selby was not a whiny, naive nineteen year old, but a big bruiser who enjoyed instigating & egging Wuornos on into fights with others. Charlize Theron deserved her Oscar for portraying & transforming herself into this complex woman with so much passion & dedication.",9,2,2,16 January 2005
Notting Hill," 'Notting Swill'
","Just another horrible movie with Julia Roberts playing the same annoying character...again. It's really tired. That stupid laugh, the toothy horse faced grin. The long, ratty hair. Everything about this woman is annoying. This film is regurgitated slop we've all seen a million times before. Hugh Grant does not help this hackneyed situation at all. I don't know what Roberts is going to do now that she's getting too over-the-hill to play the 'All-American Ingenue' character she's beaten into the ground like a dead horse (no pun intended). She has no range or depth to advance into more meaty, mature characters. Early retirement for motherhood would be a welcomed relief for many.",1,10,29,5 December 2004
The Transporter," Plotless With Fast-Paced Cartoonlike Action.
","This movie has no plot, but tons of action. It's so fast-paced it's sometimes difficult to visually digest all that's happening! There's no story, so there's nothing to think about, just alot to watch. Jason Statham is very sexy with a beautiful body. Qi Shu is pretty but her 'acting' leaves a lot to be desired. Ric Young looks like he's wearing a mask, a wig, & fake green teeth.  Some of the supporting actors have accents that are sometimes hard to understand, but it doesn't matter because in this movie dialog is secondary.",Null,0,0,30 October 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," Boring, Distracting, & Cartoonish!
","There were only two people in the movie theater when I saw this film. Myself, & the person I was with. This gave us the opportunity to verbalize our dissatisfaction with the film. Harrison Ford's 'Russian' accent seemed to only prevail when he was very, very angry. Otherwise, it wasn't noticable. The plot mainly consists of confusion & one mishap after another at a quick pace. There isn't one character that makes you care about them or their plight. There's alot of yelling & it's very claustrophobic. When they got nuked I was disgusted by their nuclear green vomit & barbecued skin, but I didn't give a hoot about the characters as people. (I felt bad for the rat though!) The later part of the film is too dragged out with too many endings. The best part (no pun intended) was seeing some young, round buttocks mooning a helicopter. That should tell you all you need to know about this movie!",Null,1,3,12 August 2002
The Birds," Thriller/Romance/Suspense/Drama/(Unsolved)Mystery Introducing 'Tippi' Hedren...
","This is an interesting film about different species of birds attacking a small California town called Bodega Bay. The attacks begin when Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) arrives with two love birds as a gift for a resident of the town. Did those two caged 'love' birds stir the whole mess up in the first place? Will their horror continue because they take the 'love' birds along with them in the end? There are no answers to be had at the film's conclusion & what's next for the characters is left to the viewer's imagination. 'Tippi' Hedren was an attractive female lead for this role. Her appearance was obviously more important than her acting skills. Rod Taylor is beefy, & sexy. Suzanne Pleshette is like a dark haired Susan Hayward. Jessica Tandy (was she ever young??) plays the possessive, widowed mom with fears of abandonment well. (She's so wrapped up in her own angst & weaknesses, in most scenes Melanie, who's a virtual stranger, comforts her daughter when she's horrified.) Although the movie holds up very well (especially the diner scene where everyone is pontificating about bird attacks) some scenes are very hokey, & unintentionably laughable now. Those still close-ups of 'Tippi's' facial expressions before, during, & after the gas station explosion are jaw-droppingly hilarious! I'm not sure this movie should be remade. Unlike the unnecessary 'Psycho' remake, at least 'The Birds' could benefit from modern day special effects. It would be great to see Hitchcock's original ending realized: The Golden Gate Bridge covered with 'The Birds'.",Null,0,0,31 May 2003
