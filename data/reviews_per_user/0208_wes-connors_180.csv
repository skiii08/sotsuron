The Rock," Action at Alcatraz
","Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. 'The Rock' (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task...First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley 'Stan' Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence...Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to 'Charter' customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing...****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe",6,3,3,30 March 2013
The Devil's Advocate," The Sixth Deadly Sin
","'Hotshot attorney Kevin Lomax's 64-0 case record has brought him a tempting offer from an elite New York firm. But the job Lomax accepts isn't what it seems. The Devil is in the details. In this gleeful, modern Gothic fable, Keanu Reeves plays eager Lomax and Al Pacino is the charismatic firm founder who knows there are cases to be won and souls to be lost. From Lomax's court triumphs and skyrocket rise to its double-twist ending, 'The Devil's Advocate' is red-hot entertainment. Lomax's life, wife (Charlize Theron) and soul are on the line. He's landed a job that's Heaven on Earth which can led him straight to Hell,' according to the official synopsis.Director Taylor Hackford's film is beautifully shot, but the story is ham-fisted and cheesy. The first thing that made me wonder: How is it that attorney Reeves, after a string of 64 cases in the courtroom, is dumbfounded by the fact that his opening client MIGHT be guilty? This is not at all plausible. But, the opening events are much more realistic than the entirety of 'Act III' (before the ending reversal); and, it's nicely performed. After building to a jumpy midpoint, 'The Devil's Advocate' becomes unintentionally funny. On the plus side, Charlize Theron (as Mary Ann Lomax) and Connie Nielsen (as Christabella Andreoli) are scrumptiously sexy. Ah, vanity... ***** The Devil's Advocate (10/17/97) Taylor Hackford ~ Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron",5,1,3,29 March 2009
The New World," The Antidote for No Doze
","In 1607 Virginia, handsome Captain Colin Farrell (as John Smith) arrives in 'The New World' of America and discovers nubile Native American beauty Q'orianka Kilcher (as Pocahontas aka Rebecca). The clearly aroused duo fall in love, despite great culture and age differences. Filmmakers do portray 'Pocahontas' as underage; and, sexual relations are 'tastefully' implied rather than explicitly shown. Though, love blooms for the legendary duo, fate plans otherwise; and, handsome Christian Bale takes over.This is a very beautiful film, with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki lushly realizing director Terrence Malick's vision. The Native Americans were most interesting. The English call them 'Naturals' instead of 'Indians', and they receive a more flattering portrayal than in decades past. The scenery is gorgeous, but the story is too dreamy - it all has an hypnotic, sleep-inducing effect. Don't watch 'The New World' after dinner without having a very strong cup of coffee. Refill for the 'Extended Cut'. And, skip the wine.**** The New World (12/25/05) Terrence Malick ~ Q'orianka Kilcher, Colin Farrell, Christian Bale, Christopher Plummer",4,2,3,13 December 2009
Frost_Nixon," Now, the Angels Will Want to Wear Nixon's Italian Shoes
","Now, apart from the wobbly camera shouting, 'Documentary! Realistic!' in a couple of scenes, this is a perfectly executed film, with the director sharply focused on the art of story-telling in a motion picture. Mr. Howard has found incredible focus, and uses his strength as an 'actor's director' to full advantage - the performances of co-stars Frank Langella (Nixon) and Michael Sheen (Frost) are a tribute to themselves and the Howard's keen orchestration. And, there is a great ensemble around the leads, with Sam Rockwell and Kevin Bacon preaching to the 'liberal' and 'conservative' choirs.Probably, the most extraordinary thing about 'Frost/Nixon' can be witnessed in Mr. Langella's characterization.Langella doesn't waste time trying to impersonate Nixon; instead, he finds a character very much like him, who happens to fit both the story being told and our impression of what Nixon could have been like, in this context. It's not Nixon, but an amazing facsimile. Less well known, but closer to the mark is Mr. Sheen's portrayal of a talk show host who could never mask the phoniness with which he proclaimed each guest's latest project as a 'Smashing!' success. Frost would have preferred to compliment the 'simply marvelous' furniture on the deck of the Titanic, which is why Nixon picked him.A full pardon to conspiring writer Peter Morgan. 'The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.' 'Frost/Nixon' comes along when director Howard wielded a lot of power over the small pool of potential great film projects available, and a fine-looking production was assured - nevertheless, you expected the finished product to also maintain a sleek, almost regrettable safeness. And, this film, like it or not, elevates both of its character subjects - Richard M. Nixon and David Frost - along with their mutually beneficial 'mini-series' of interviews to an undeserved legendary status. That it fails factually and may unfortunately blur historical perceptions is beside the point - it's still an excellent film.********* Frost/Nixon (10/15/08) Ron Howard ~ Frank Langella, Michael Sheen, Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon",9,0,0,15 August 2010
Miracle," Gavin O'Connor Skates on Thin Ice with Kurt Russell
","'Kurt Russell gives a brilliant performance as the dynamic and determined coach Herb Brooks, who had an impossible dream - beat the seemingly unbeatable Soviets at their own game. Starting with a handpicked group of 26 undisciplined kids, Brooks coached them to play like they never played before, and turned 20 of them into a team that believed they could achieve the unachievable - and in the process, united a nation with a new feeling of hope,' according to the official studio synopsis.Based on a 1980 Olympic hockey play-off between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, this film makes the game in question political - with the opening collage providing a fine setting - but, it never ties its ends together. For Mr. Russell's character, the motivation is different; he is returning to the Olympics to revise a past snub, and vicariously prove his worth. The hockey players, who seem underutilized, simply want to win. The title suggests Divine intervention.***** Miracle (3/3/04) Gavin O'Connor ~ Kurt Russell, Patricia Clarkson, Noah Emmerich",5,0,6,14 June 2009
Lucky Number Slevin," Unlucky at the Races
","Directed by Paul McGuigan and, 'Set in the New York underworld, where nothing is as it seems,' according to the studio's official description, 'When down-on-his-luck Slevin (Josh Hartnett) stumbles into a running feud between the city's most feared crime bosses (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley), he ignites an all-out war. Tracked by a mysterious assassin (Bruce Willis) and distracted by his flirtatious neighbor (Lucy Liu), Slevin must try to cheat death by turning the tables on the gangsters.' Here is a violent avenging gangsters-type drama, done in the non-linear style.Comparing itself (in promotional materials) to 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Usual Suspects', and 'North by Northwest'; this is a well written and produced film, which seeks to be much more than a copy. And, it almost works. Nicely shot, and creatively pieced together, the main revelation is satisfying; but, the film overextends with additional tricky contrivances. Admirers of Mr. Hartnett's sexy physique will enjoy seeing him spend much time wearing only a towel. Mr. Willis performs most exceptionally.****** Lucky Number Slevin (2/24/06) Paul McGuigan ~ Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman",6,0,0,1 February 2010
Catch Me If You Can," A Flash of Lightning from Leonardo DiCaprio
","'Flash' comic book reader Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) is devastated when he learns loving parents Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye (as Frank and Paula Abagnale) are divorcing. Unable to choose whom he'd rather to live with, Mr. DiCaprio decides to run away, like DC Comics' 'The Flash'. A natural impersonator, DiCaprio assumes a secret identity, and develops amazing check-forging skills. This attracts the attention of FBI agent Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty), who is determined to put DiCaprio behind bars. Incredibly, DiCaprio gets jobs as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. But, Mr. Hanks is hot on his trail 'Catch Me If You Can' finds Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks team in the middle of an incredible string of well-produced films. When seen in context, their success secret may be offering the public a variety of entertainment, alternating the familiar with the unexpected. 'Catch Me If You Can' isn't rollicking, inspirational, or filled with special effects; it's just wildly appealing. Spielberg regulars: cameraman Janusz Kaminski, musician John Williams, editor Michael Kahn, etc are 'state of the art' in film-making. The cast performs exceptionally. Most valuable player Williams is especially noteworthy, helping an incredible opening 'credits' sequence start the film.In hindsight, this may be considered one of DiCaprio's very best performances. Certainly, it's one of the only times when casting a 10-years-too-old actor in a part makes perfect sense, as you'll see upon viewing this film. DiCaprio fits the role like a glove, handling his character's charming to disillusioned development with precision. The character is extremely likable. Spielberg sets the perfect mood by opening the film with a 'To Tell the Truth' game show appearance, and flashback. We know approximately how the film will end; but, like a 'Flash' comic book story, we enjoy the adventure, and feel the danger.Obviously, they were going for a 'PG-13' audience; and, the sex scenes aren't offensive. The one following DiCaprio's viewing of the James Bond film 'Goldfinger' is particularly well done. It involves his encounter with a high-class prostitute. By returning to DiCaprio viewing the film, back in the theater, the entire sequence could be artfully turned into a fantasy. This would support the very idealized way DiCaprio views relationships; they should be like comic book couple, like Barry and Iris Allen. Our hero fantasizes he's 'James Bond', but he's really very 'old-fashioned'. He can't accept his parents' break-up; and, has idealized, failed relationships with women.There is some thoughtfulness as 'Catch Me If You Can' explores the relationships DiCaprio's 'Frank' has with his parents and Mr. Hanks. The film would be stronger if the protagonist's innocent idealism and ideology were more developed. A key moment, for 'Frank', is when he discovers his parents are not the perfect couple he (and we viewers) have been accustomed to seeing. Later, after a period of promiscuity, our hero has his failed relationship. He learns couples are not like idealized; but, this thread of the film lacks a proper conclusion; a scene with mother Baye, or the introduction of a new romantic interest, would help.******** Catch Me If You Can (12/16/02) Steven Spielberg ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken",8,2,3,2 August 2009
Spartacus," I'm Spartacus! He's Spartacus! We're All Spartacus!
","During the early reign of the ancient Roman Empire, heroic slave Kirk Douglas (as Spartacus) rebels by biting a master's ankle. He will be roundly punished. Believing Mr. Douglas' strength and determination make him a good candidate for gladiator duels, Douglas is saved from a starvation sentence by wily slave-trader Peter Ustinov (as Batiatus), who is often employed by Roman dictator Laurence Olivier (as Crassus). Douglas and Mr. Olivier are attracted to beautiful house slave Jean Simmons (as Varinia). Cracking under the pressure whip, Douglas escapes to begin a slave rebellion...In Rome, proudly promiscuous Republican Senator Charles Laughton (as Gracchus) and his handsome young cohort John Gavin (as Julius Caesar) jockey for political gain. Mr. Laughton and Mr. Ustinov are just plain fun to watch. Meanwhile, Ms. Simmons finds her way into Douglas' slave rebellion, as does Olivier's poetic juggler boyfriend Tony Curtis (as Antoninus). This further irks Olivier. It all climaxes in a battle between the forces representing Douglas and Olivier...'Spartacus' plays like the story of Jesus Christ without the supernatural elements, which is quite original for a biblical epic. While Douglas' character seems too good to be true, he carries off the characterization with star power. Olivier is strong, as expected. The restored 'oysters and snails' scene is tame, and tinged with evil. Were they subtle - immoral? Also, Douglas' reaction to Ms. Simmons' delicate condition makes you wonder if he was expecting an immaculate conception. Or, maybe he was counting months. But Douglas, director Stanley Kubrick and Dalton Trumbo have a spectacular sweep.******** Spartacus (9/22/60) Stanley Kubrick ~ Kirk Douglas, Laurence Oliver, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton",8,0,1,17 November 2011
Stop-Loss," Kimberly Peirce and I Look Out Tonight from Desolation Row
","After serving a particularly brutal tour in Iraq, SSgt. Ryan Phillippe (as Brandon King) returns to his Texas town. An honorary parade welcomes Mr. Phillippe. Bathed in red, white, and blue, Phillippe collects both a Bronze Star and Purple Heart. After the big parade, Phillippe celebrates civilian life with two also-returning Army buddies, model Channing Tatum (as Steve Shriver) and actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Tommy Burgess). Coming home proves difficult for Mr. Tatum and Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who drink excessively and abuse their mates; they are likely experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.Phillippe falls into his leadership position, and helps his pals adjust. Then, just before his official discharge, Phillippe is ordered back to Iraq, thanks to a (then) largely unknown Army contract clause known as 'Stop-Loss'. Assisted by soldier Tatum's beautiful fiancée, Abbie Cornish (as Michelle), Phillippe takes off for Washington, DC, to ask for a politician's help. Of course, there is no possibility of reversal - Phillippe must either be jailed as AWOL, or return to active duty.Director Kimberly Peirce, who last scored with 'Boys Don't Cry' (1999), really should be working more often. 'Stop-Loss' is an excellent film, with extraordinary photography (Chris Menges), lighting, locations, and performances. The documentary-style 'hand-held camera' technique is overused; but, there is enough stillness when dramatically required. The politics of 'Stop-Loss' is told from the soldier protagonist's point-of-view; whether you agree or not, it is a feeling widely held, and deserved to be told.Although the film is ostensibly about Iraq, and includes a convincing sequence in the war-torn country, the real surprise is how the filmmakers' portray the American landscape. You see rural and urban gunplay, highways and byways, dark alleys, cheap diners, and seedy motels. The early patriotic parade and a later funeral are beautifully shot, with the United States flag extraordinarily photographed. 'Stop-Loss' is really 'Desolation Row' - it is not about Iraq; rather, it is about the United States of America, during a bleak, hopeless period.********* Stop-Loss (3/13/08) Kimberly Peirce ~ Ryan Phillippe, Abbie Cornish, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt",9,1,2,1 March 2009
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," When Bicycles and Aliens Rode the Imagination
","Stinging from the separation of his parents, lonely ten-year-old Henry Thomas (as Elliott) finds friendship with a lost alien. Named 'E.T.' (for 'Extra Terrestrial'), the creature also meets big brother Robert MacNaughton (as Mike) and little sister Drew Barrymore (as Gertie). The children keep 'E.T.' hidden from adults, but outside forces soon pose a threat... This classic film was re-released in an altered state, so it took me some years time to acquire an original version. I have a lot to see, I know... The Boy with Something Extra... The original wasn't perfect - right away, you wonder about the disappearing cigarette (?) smoke at the kids' home, and how they could specify pizza toppings when the pie was almost there. But, this is really not a film to wonder about when Dee Wallace (as Mother Mary) actually drinks 'Coors' beer. Maybe the stuff was just sitting in the refrigerator since Dad ran off with 'Sally' to Mexico... And, there is an unfortunate lack of easy scientific explanations for what goes on, which leads to religious allegory... Yet... 'E.T.' is a fantasy story for dreamers; an imaginative, animated-like acceptance of story continuity is acceptable.In a cartoon, never cry over spilled milk.Interesting and surprising to see director Steven Spielberg's main changes for the 2002 release - which one assumes Mr. Spielberg means to be taken as the official, authorized version - involve the removal of guns, and the insertion of a bath for 'Elliott' and the alien. At one point, young Thomas is directed to bathe himself, but 'E.T.' appeared to be self-cleaning. And, there is only one truly threatening gun, which added tension to the chase. Still, in any version, 'E.T.' is an excellent childhood dream.******** E.T. (5/26/82) Steven Spielberg ~ Henry Thomas, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore, Dee Wallace",8,0,2,30 May 2011
Minority Report," Tomorrow Never Knows
","In the year 2054, Washington D.C. is murder free zone. This is because a futuristic 'Precrime' program has obtained three precognitive humans (called 'pre-cogs') who have a talent for predicting murder. The three individuals perpetually dream about future crimes, in a secured area nicknamed 'The Temple'; there, they float in a tank of water. The US government falsely claims the three live a luxurious lifestyle - working out in a weight room, for example - but, the pre-cogs are, essentially, imprisoned for the good of society. According to Precrime, the pre-cogs 'see the future' and are 'never wrong'. The Washington program has prevented all murders for the past six years, and is about to be implemented nationally. As the film opens, top Precrime gun Tom Cruise (as John Anderton) goes through some visual evidence downloaded from the pre-cogs' minds, and arrests an individual for the 'future murder' of his wife and lover. Mr. Cruise has a back-story. Years earlier, Cruise's young son was abducted, indirectly destroying his marriage. Cruise also takes illegal drugs, which does not effect his work or appearance adversely.Distinguished Director of Precrime Max von Sydow (as Lamar Burgess) is wary of arriving agent Colin Farrell (as Danny Witwer). He should be, Mr. Farrell is there to investigate the Precrime program. Farrell fears the system may be flawed. Due to a startling encounter with pre-cog Samantha Morton (as Agatha), Cruise also becomes suspicious. Then, the pre-cogs identify an unexpected murderer, right in the heart of Precrime! Orwellian 'thought police' (aka thinkpol) are never a good utopian sign. There are plenty of plot holes and/or contrivances in 'Minority Report'. For example, how is it that these geniuses can't anticipate or detect an eye transplant? And, a certain pregnant woman made me laugh out LOUD. Still, this is excellent, exciting entertainment from Mr. Spielberg and company. Turn off your mind, relax, and float with Steven.******** Minority Report (6/17/02) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton",8,1,2,23 December 2008

Then, by chance, he meets a widow (Kate Winslet) and her four adventurous boys. Together they form a friendship that ignites the imagination needed to produce Barrie's greatest work! An enchanting big-screen treat with an acclaimed cast of stars, 'Finding Neverland' has been hailed as one of the year's best motion pictures!' according to the film's official synopsis.This lavishly-produced biography of the famed 'Peter Pan' author is noted to have been 'Inspired by True Events' during the opening - but, it plays like an overly sentimentalized Hollywood fairy tale. Director Marc Forster, with cinematographer Roberto Schaefer, once again shows (as in 'Monster's Ball') the wherewithal to deliver a perfect ten; indeed, this is a visually stunning film. Mr. Depp and a marvelous cast and crew help, but this story just doesn't rise to the occasion.

Lifeboat," Waves of Wrath
","In the Atlantic Ocean, during World War II, a German U-boat sinks a ship of peace-loving American and British citizens. Eight survivors find themselves afloat on a tiny lifeboat. First on board is world-weary columnist Tallulah Bankhead (as Constance 'Connie' Porter). She is dressed in in fur and diamonds, darling, but we later hear how Ms. Bankhead clawed her way to the top. Next up is heroically handsome leading man John Hodiak (as John Kovac). A wise seaman, Mr. Hodiak started roughly, in a Chicago slaughterhouse. These two represent debating democracy; we hope they will eventually come together. They, and the other allied survivors, are joined by a ninth man. Welcome aboard, suspicious-looking Nazi sailor Walter Slezak (as Willi). It turns out the Nazi U-boat was also destroyed, and Mr. Slezak may have been responsible...This World War II propaganda film warns us not to trust Germans or show any weakness in dealing with them. The advice wasn't bad during the war years, but hindsight reveals most wartime films as flippant and one-dimensional. Not so on this 'Lifeboat'...Taken from an original story by John Steinbeck (which explains why the players sometimes speak like they are characters from a John Steinbeck novel), this drama holds up extraordinarily well. Despite the presence of international passengers, the cast is meant to represent the collective American immigrant experience. Note that Germany receives dual representation, when you consider wounded William Bendix (as Gus Smith). Also interesting is the way Canada Lee (as Joe 'Charcoal' Spencer) is given the right to vote; moreover, he demonstrates how religious beliefs helped achieve freedom from slavery. The debating travelers are quite engaging. It certainly helps that they are marvelously directed by Alfred Hitchcock. He holds your interest and gets his 'cameo' appearance in, although the entire motion picture is set on a small lifeboat.********* Lifeboat (1/11/44) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Tallulah Bankhead, John Hodiak, William Bendix, Walter Slezak",9,1,1,21 February 2014

Likening the city to the brown hole you'd find in an outhouse, Mr. Farrell is very unhappy. Meeting potential bedmate Clémence Poésy (as Chloë) cheers him up a little. The comparatively unattractive, and hinted at being gay, Mr. Gleeson is a bit more cheerful, although he gets no sexual playmate.

To Be or Not to Be," Fascism Is a Farce
","It's August 1939 in Warsaw, Poland. A theatre group led by popular stage actress Carole Lombard (as Maria Tura) and her hammy husband Jack Benny (as Joseph Tura) rehearse their funny Nazi play 'Gestapo' – eventually, they're ordered to cancel the comedy due to the risk of offending Adolph Hitler, the German dictator then invading countries and disposing of their Jewish citizens in concentration camps. However, they are allowed to continue performing Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. During the performance, Ms. Lombard agrees to meet handsome young fan Robert Stack (as Stanislav Sobinski), when Mr. Benny begins his soliloquy 'To Be or Not to Be' A bomber for the RAF, Mr. Stack fancies himself in love with Lombard. She enjoys the attention, but warns Stack she is a married woman. When Hitler invades Poland, Stack returns to Britain. There, he discovers a plot to exterminate the Warsaw resistance. Stack parachutes to Poland and involves Lombard, Benny and their theatre company in an effort stop the Nazis...Deftly directed by Ernst Lubitsch, 'To Be or Not to Be' was unusual in that it treated the Nazis in a farcical manner. Funny Nazis during World War II did not amuse everyone. Echoing this film's repeated 'Heil Hitler!' salute, the popular TV series 'Hogan's Heroes' was criticized for finding humor in the subject – three decades later. Also a downer, Lombard tragically died in a plane crash before this, her last film, was released. Her performance is marvelous. Standout co-star Benny and everyone involved can count 'To Be or Not to Be' as a career peak. In 1983, the film received a high profile re-male by Mel Brooks' company. While not superior to this version, Mr. Brooks' film was quite enjoyable. It did correct a minor flaw in this version – plot transitions aren't always smooth. For example, Stack appears in Lombard's bed after a long run around Warsaw; without a clue about what is happening, we see her take over his mission. By all means, see both versions – but start with this one. Laughter is still the best medicine.********* To Be or Not to Be (2/15/42) Ernst Lubitsch ~ Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack, Sig Ruman",9,1,3,5 August 2014

","Two detectives, retiring veteran Morgan Freeman (as William Somerset) and hotshot rookie Brad Pitt (as David Mills), team up to trail a serial killer chalking up victims as an homage to the 'Seven Deadly Sins' - 'Gluttony', 'Greed', 'Sloth', 'Lust', 'Pride', 'Envy', and 'Wrath'. Don't read anything more about this film; I didn't, and still had it figured out during the final road trip. That it's fairly predictable, and presents two 'stock' characters, doesn't mean 'Seven' ('SE7EN' if you use all caps) is a bad trip.In fact, it's an excellent film, with a stylish look created by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji, from writer Andrew Kevin Walker's intriguing story. Strangely, only film editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an 'Academy Award'. And, there were no acting 'Oscars'. Hopefully, Mr. Freeman just missed getting nominated for 'Best Actor'; he certainly deserved to be, for his sharply focused take on the character type also happens to precisely reflect the mood of the piece.******** Seven (9/22/95) David Fincher ~ Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow",8,1,2,28 September 2009
I'm Not There," (I Don't Want to) Chain You Down
","Unless you know something about the subject of this biography, you're bound to be confused by 'I'm Not There'. It is 'inspired by the music & many lives of Bob Dylan.' For the unenlightened, Mr. Dylan was famous, long ago ('for playing electric violins on desolation row'). The film, by writer/director Todd Haynes is excellent, but inaccessible. And, strangely, if you know anything about the subject, you're going to learn approximately nothing knew. To help navigate, there were four main Dylans FIRST and famed-mostly, Dylan was a 'Rock Star'. This period is played out by Cate Blanchett as 'Jude Quinn'. This character sports a fictitious name, but like much of the movie, comes (not from McCartney's 'Jude' but) obviously from Dylan's oeuvre - the Christian 'Jude' and 'Quinn the Eskimo'. This Dylan has the clearest Beginning and End points of any. He was 'born' when startling his folk audience by 'going electric' (guitar) and 'dies' in a motorcycle accident at the peak of his fame.SECOND most famous, and highly influential, Dylan was the 'Folk Singer' replaced by the above. Here, it's Christian Bale as 'Jack Rollins'. This Dylan was quite popular on his own, but was much 'covered' by other folk artists and rock bands. During this time, Dylan was more like a very big cult, and his songs were more widely heard when other people made hit records from them. The songs were more Political (protest) during this time, getting vague later (with exceptions, like 'Hurricane').THIRD time around for Dylan was his 'Cowboy' persona, essayed herein by Richard Gere and named 'Billy the Kid' after the outlaw anti-hero Dylan play-acted. This was the Dylan emerging after the motorcycle accident. Dylan left a bunch of unreleased tracks (known as 'The Basement Tapes') and 'reinvented' himself as a more countrified mellow rocker (listen to 'Lay Lady Lay'). Here, the 'stages' of Dylan's art become more blurred as he no longer commanded the attention he did earlier.FOURTH biggest change, after a long run without defining boundaries, was the 'Born Again' or 'Christian' Dylan. This startled some people, but (as the film points out) it shouldn't have been unexpected. In fact, the 'Fame'/'Drugs'/'Jesus' continuum is very common among music stars, as anyone watching MTV's 1990s biographies could plainly see. For this film, Mr. Bale (uniquely) plays two Dylan incarnations, revising his earlier 'Folk Singer' character 'Jack Rollins' to become 'Pastor John'. BUT, that's not all. There are three less public parts of the quadraphonic Dylan covered by Mr. Haynes FIRST is Dylan's mysterious boyhood masquerade as 'Woody Guthrie' played by Marcus Carl Franklin. He is the kid on the train, sporting the Fascist-Killing-Guitar-in-the-West. Of course, Woody Guthrie was a real person, and he had a tremendous influence on Dylan. While cute and well done, this section is not revelatory, which could be why the film project had 'the real' Bob Dylan's blessing. The real Dylan, who appears briefly near the end, did not appreciate biographers peeking into his personal history.SECOND is Dylan 'The Poet' named 'Arthur Rimbaud' and played by Ben Whishaw. Like the above, but more of a conglomerate, the character is a real French poet named Arthur Rimbaud who influenced Dylan (and many other rock stars). The Dylans are presented in sort of an overlapping chronological order - which may not make sense to the uninitiated - but this one is used more like a muse for the others, accentuating Dylan's reputation as a true 'Tarantula' of a Poet, even without the music.THIRD and perhaps most esoteric is Dylan 'The Actor' played by Heath Ledger as 'Robbie Clark'. Dylan did do some movies. Mortals do not forgive. Even an epic focusing in his relationship with a certain sad-eyed of the lowlands. Rather than show Dylan acting in a movie, this 'Actor' section perversely shows the more camera-shy Dylan. It seems highly fictitious, but you've got to appreciate 'Dylan' telling what looks like 'Patti Smith', 'chicks can never be poets.' (!) And, 'I Want You' is a terrific vignette. In sum, 'I'm Not There' is an excellent film for obvious believers, with minus zero insight into its subject. Bobby Zimmerman could hardly disapprove. By the way, the fact that the vinyl 'Stuck Inside of Mobile with the' was amusingly continued in the 'Blonde on Blonde' gate-fold jacket as 'Memphis Blues Again' is no excuse to edit the song. And, changing the lyric, 'Here is your 'throat' back, thanks for the loan...' to 'Here is your 'mouth' back, thanks for the loan...' really sucks. Moreover, it's sacrilege.******* I'm Not There (9/3/07) Todd Haynes ~ Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Richard Gere",7,10,14,21 August 2010

Fight Club," Do Not Go Gently Into This Good Fight
","According to the official studio synopsis, David Fincher's film is described: 'A ticking-time-bomb insomniac (Edward Norton) and a slippery soap salesman (Brad Pitt) channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground 'fight clubs' forming in every town - until a sensuous and mysterious woman (Helena Bonham Carter) comes between the two men and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.' Meatloaf again. As you'll discover, the film's official synopsis isn't even remotely correct; but, it's a good way to 'sell' 'Fight Club'. This film is violent and *pornographic* - this is a WARNING - but, except for Jared Leto's silly putty face make-up, the cast cleans up well. The beatings are brutal, but help make the film's point, and are a part of the protagonist's madness. 'Fight Club' is a comedy about the lead character's rejection of society's domestication of his life. Or, it could be about something else...To Be a Man.The film received an 'Academy Award' nomination for the 'Sound Effects' by Richard Hymns and Ren Klyce (beaten by the first 'Matrix' and the latest 'Star Wars'). 'Fight Club' is excellent in many ways, but isn't (and shouldn't be) as polished a 'production' as 1999's big winner, 'American Beauty' - a film which opened simultaneously, and presented critics with more palpable male angst. 'Supporting Actress' Carter deserved some consideration for her memorable 'Marla'; she even sings gets in a few lines from the '(Theme From) Valley of the Dolls'.********** Fight Club (9/10/99) David Fincher ~ Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf",10,0,6,30 May 2009
Monster," Charlize Theron's Highway to Heaven
","Seeking shelter from the rain, wizening highway prostitute Charlize Theron (as Aileen Wuornos) ducks into a Lesbian bar, to dry out and suck up a beer. There, she meets doe-eyed innocent Christina Ricci (as Selby Wall), who helps usher Ms. Theron out of the closet. We learn Theron was raped at an early age, and has been treated like dirt by many men. An extremely selfish young woman, Ms. Ricci, expects Theron to satisfy her in bed, and support her with money made from prostitution. Theron is poor, misunderstood, and abused; she wants to go straight - but, sadly, a bad trick turns her into a serial killer'Monster' was based on a true story. The monster is a Ferris wheel, as explained in the 'Life is funny, it's hard...' narration, recited after a murder. Theron won a mother lode of 'Best Actress' awards; and, other than sometimes seeming self-conscious about having something foreign in her mouth, she is good in the role. Incredibly, Theron and writer/director Patty Jenkins turn convicted murderer Aileen 'Lee' Wuornos into a staggering, swaggering Lesbian fantasy figure. Theron's rendition of a familiar two word vulgarism (aka 'F.U.') to a secretary named 'Leslie', may be one of funniest uses of that phrase in film.***** Monster (11/16/03) Patty Jenkins ~ Charlize Theron, Christina Ricci, Annie Corley, Bruce Dern",5,1,3,4 October 2009
The Rookie," John Lee Hancock Gets a Pop Up Inside the Park with Dennis Quaid
","'Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), father, teacher, and high school coach, thought his dream was over. He'd had his shot playing baseball, blew out his shoulder, and retired without ever making it to the big leagues. Then, in 1999, Coach Morris made a fateful bet with his perpetually losing team. If they won the district championship, Morris - who threw a 98 mph fastball - would try out for the majors. The team went from worst to first, and Jim, living up to his end of the bargain, threw caution to the wind and was on the road to becoming the oldest rookie in the major leagues' according to the official studio synopsis.This 'feel good / family' movie is nicely played, but blandly fictionalized. As the thirtysomething man receiving a second chance at major league baseball stardom, Mr. Quaid is very believable. His character seems unnaturally distant from family members, which makes you yearn for more physical and emotional contact - perhaps, this is intentional. Quaid is closer to his likewise too old high school students: Jay Hernandez (as Joaquin 'Wack' Campos), Rick Gonzalez (as Rudy Bonilla), Chad Lindberg (as Joe David West), and Angelo Spizzirri (as Joel De La Garza). Along with rookie pal Russell Richardson (as Brooks), the younger baseball players are excellent, and give the Quaid and the film heart.That Mr. Spizzirri is among the standout young performers - he is immediately impressive, as Coach Quaid's high school catcher kid - makes the sadness of his untimely death linger. Curvaceous Rachel Griffiths (as Lorri Morris), appropriately distant Brian Cox (as Jim Morris Sr.), and 'Two and a Half Men' star Angus T. Jones (as Hunter Morris) are the family who could have stood some deeper characterization. The song played over the end credits, 'Some Dreams' by Steve Earle, fits the film like a glove: 'Some dreams don't ever come true aw, but some dreams do.' ***** The Rookie (3/26/02) John Lee Hancock ~ Dennis Quaid, Rachel Griffiths, Angelo Spizzirri",6,1,1,14 June 2009
The Birth of a Nation," The Birth of a Clan
","As the film itself states, 'This is a depiction of the events of the civil war and of the formation of the Ku Klux Klan from the point of view of the American South.' Let that be a warning! Still, expert motion picture making from D.W. Griffith, G.W. Bitzer, and company. This film should receive a perfect '10' -- but the aggravating and overt racist theme is sometimes worse than the actual war. The 'Negro race' is, if you think about it, blamed for the Civil War -- beginning with the unbalanced opening: 'The bringing of the African to America planted the first seed of disunion.' The 'Civil War' depicted in 'Birth of a Nation' isn't over until the end of Part 2; when Confederates band together as the Ku Klux Klan, and defeat the 'Negroes'. In this film, the KKK wins. Part 1, by the way, is somewhat more tolerable -- but, by the end of Part 2, the film's message becomes obvious. Note that Jesus Christ makes a God-blessed-this-film appearance.Otherwise, Lillian Gish (as Elsie Stoneman) and Henry B. Walthall (as Ben Cameron) are extraordinary in the lead roles; she represents the North, and he represents the South. The Stomeman and Cameron families' friendship and conflicts, due to the war, would have been a good, singular film focus. Of course, Mr. Walthall's character is a racist hero, but he performs the role exceptionally well. Ms. Gish is at her silent best; don't miss the scene where, after a date with Walthall, she caresses her bedpost! Second leads Elmer Clifton (as Phil Stoneman) and 'daughter of the south ' Miriam Cooper (as Margaret Cameron) hold their own against the powerful Gish and Walthall. Ms. Cooper has eyes which seem slightly askew in some shots, giving her an eerie quality. Josephine Crowell (as Mrs. Cameron) shines, among the more mature performers. Mae Marsh and Violet Wilkey (both as Flora Cameron) are quite memorable, also.In a supporting role, Robert Harron (as Tod Stoneman) is at Gish-level acting; don't miss the scene with Harron embracing George Beranger (as Wade Cameron) when the 'chums' expire on the battleground. Harron makes the scene especially touching. Note that Harron appears later on, in an unexpected role. Joseph Henabery is another appearing in different roles; he is most memorable as Abraham Lincoln; the assassination sequence is another film highlight, with Raoul Walsh (as John Wilkes Booth). Harron and Ms. Marsh would be even more dazzling in Griffith's next, 'Intolerance' (1916). Another great scene occurs when Walthall walks unsteadily out of the hospital with Gish, while guard William Freeman gives Gish a last longing sigh. And, it's easy to see why Wallace Reid (as a blacksmith)'s search for Walter Long (as Gus), in 'Joe's ginmill', was a star-making brawl. ********* The Birth of a Nation (2/8/15) D.W.

Memento," The Nolan Brothers' Memory Play's Tricks
","Model-perfect Guy Pearce (as Leonard 'Lenny' Shelby) has a problem with his short-term memory. No, it isn't marijuana - he and his wife were attacked by intruders, leaving Pearce brain-damaged. At least, that's what Mr. Pearce believes. According to his reality, his wife was raped and beaten to death. Pearce survived, but with no short term memory. According to the film's official synopsis, it's 'a rare brain disorder - the inability to form any new memories. 'Lenny' can remember in detail everything that happened before his injury, but anyone he has met or anything he has done since that fateful night, simply vanishes.'Certainly, this rare brain disorder ('anterial-grade memory loss') was picked because there is no danger of an advocate group of sufferers forming to proclaim this film does not accurately represent their plight. Told backwards and in flashbacks, this is a film to try your 'willing suspension of disbelief.' It's also one people whisper they really didn't think was 'all that,' but don't want to be thought out of the loop. If you examine it under a microscope, 'Memento' fades, which is why it works better in pieces. The pieces are fine, by director Christopher Nolan, brother John, Pearce, editor Dody Dorn, and cinematographer Wally Pfister.DON'T READ ON UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE REACHED YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.The film's epiphany occurs near the ending of the running time, when Pearce's 'Lenny' realizes he's being used by Joe Pantoliano (who should have received some 'Best Supporting Actor' notices as John Edward 'Teddy' Gammell), a corrupt police officer. Pearce writes 'DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES' on the photograph and takes down the license plate number, to program himself to kill 'Teddy' as his wife's attacker (rapist). But, at that moment, Pearce knows this isn't true - he gave his own wife (who survived) too many insulin shots. Stephen Tobolowsky (as 'Sammy' Jankis) is the real insurance investigator.

Shakespeare in Love," With Artistic License to Kill
","Suffering from 'writer's block', Elizabethan playwright Joseph Fiennes (as William 'Will' Shakespeare) is having trouble completing 'Romeo and Ethel', his new comedy. But, all's well that ends well after Mr. Fiennes meets beautiful new lover Gwyneth Paltrow (as Viola de Lesseps) - because, after a star-crossed romance, Shakespeare's tragic 'Romeo and Juliet' is born.'Shakespeare in Love' is a first class production, benefiting immensely from the cleverness of writers Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, along with sharp direction from John Madden. True, somebody should have noticed Daniel Brocklebank (as 'Juliet') and Ms. Paltrow (as 'Romeo') needed to switch roles - but, most of what you see is plausible (it is, after all, a comedy).You don't have to have had courses in Shakespeare to enjoy the film and 'get' some of the parallels drawn by the writers. There are scores of theatrical and Shakespearian references, though. And, the literarily inclined can revel in the appearance of John Webster (Joe Roberts) as a street punk and Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett) giving Shakespeare the plot for 'Romeo and Juliet'.********* Shakespeare in Love (12/3/98) John Madden ~ Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Judi Dench",9,2,4,28 September 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Dead Again
","Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' gets off to a shaky start by not improving upon the original 'Night of the Living Dead' image of the innocent neighbor girl turned brain-eating zombie (1968's cellar dwelling Kyra Schon was the original). But, by the time nurse heroine Sarah Polley (as Ana) hits the road, all is forgiven. This film lives up to its DVD sleeve description: 'When a mysterious virus turns people into mindless, flesh-eating zombies, a handful of survivors wage a desperate, last-stand battle to stay alive and human! Exploding with terrifying surprises and nerve-shredding fun, 'Dawn of the Dead' is an edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride.' This one doesn't make the same subtle points as the earlier 'Dead' films (real or imagined), it's predictable, and it tailspins in a dumb ending. Still, its strengths are considerable; the debut direction, dynamic relationships, superior gore effects, and excellent characterizations are... to die for.******* Dawn of the Dead (3/10/04) Zack Snyder ~ Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber",7,0,1,22 July 2009

Mr. Pacino admires McConaughey's muscular frame, and builds him into his right hand man.

Jeremy Piven (as Jerry) is good, in a woefully underwritten role. The weirdest scene has wealthy Armand Assante (as Novian) straddling and urinating on McConaughey; you would think he would aim at Matthew's face, but maybe he was saving something for a possible second encounter?

Lords of Dogtown," Cement Surfing
","Director Catherine Hardwicke, who helped a few teenagers discover the versatility of the tongue in 'Thirteen' (2003), takes an impressive cast and crew back to the year 1975. The 'Disco' storm was crashing airwaves, but not at Venice Beach, California. There, the pre-punk 'Lords of Dogtown' ramped up skateboarding 'to the extreme' and made it a sport.Opening with the familiar phrase, 'Inspired by a true story,' this is a fictionalized film version of the superior documentary 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' (2001) - which anyone interested in skateboarding as sport should see. Hardwicke's young 'Lords' are Emile Hirsch (as Jay Adams), Victor Rasuk (as Tony Alva), and John Robinson (as Stacy Peralta). They are introduced in an excellent opening sequence, but the story doesn't get off the ground until about halfway through. We get a lot of documentary-styled scenes - which don't really do anything to improve upon 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' - before getting to know the three leading men. It might be interesting to see Mr. Peralta's original story idea, because much of this story seems whitewashed.Crack a board, bro The real drama herein arguably centers on Mr. Hirsch's character. The three actors are fine, but Hirsch is given the best material. As his sexy, sand-blasted mother, Rebecca De Mornay (as Philaine) helps. And, Hirsch gets to sing the 'Slinky' theme song. Watch for a truly magical moment when, after losing a contest, Hirsch sails off the pier; photographed beautifully by Elliot Davis, it combines the thrills you experience surfing and skateboarding. Also on hand, in an stumbling and underwritten role, is wasted surfer Heath Ledger (as Skip Engblom). Better utilized is the role played by fellow traveler Michael Angarano (as Sid). He helps give the film an unexpected, uplifting ending by taking the three estranged 'Lords' back to their roots.****** Lords of Dogtown (6/3/05) Catherine Hardwicke ~ Emile Hirsch, Victor Rasuk, John Robinson, Heath Ledger",6,6,9,12 June 2010

Old hand Geoffrey Rush is only a tease, unfortunately - but, tentacle-bearded Bill Nighy (as Davy Jones) is an entertaining computer-generated villain.In short, the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise film series goes overboard with blockbuster sensibilities herein, leaving a good measure of charm and originality dead in the water.

What Will doesn't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead,' according to the DVD sleeve description.This first 'PG-13'-rated Disney film unexpectedly became the first of a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' feature franchise based on one of the company's amusement park rides. It's Disney off the Jerry Bruckheimer production line (so, plan accordingly), and is eye-pleasingly well-produced. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, is quite a nice modernization of the classic 'pirate' story.The film's greatest strength is Mr. Depp's slosh-buckling, swish-buckling, swaggering, and staggering 'Jack Sparrow'.Depp's characterization cuts through the screen with uncommon, original charm. This part made critics strut up and take notice, with Depp being rewarded with several 'Best Actor' awards and nominations. This was also the film which vaulted Depp into the Quigley 'Box Office' Top 10 stars list (#6, with a bullet). Actually, it conformed something already a reality among moviegoers - Depp in the cast made a film worth considering, and Depp as the star made a film worth shelling out the bucks to see.******** The Curse of the Black Pearl (6/28/03) Jerry Bruckheimer : Gore Verbinski ~ Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush",8,1,5,16 November 2009

It's really a low point in the line of 'SCTV' and 'SNL' influenced and/or inspired films begun in the 1970s. Probably, the reason is that filmmakers did nothing out of the ordinary with an overused storyline. Many 'Second City' segments are funnier - compare, for example, the SCTV 'English for Beginners' skit with Mr. Ramis' opening scene.

Mr. Gosling and Ms. McAdams never seemed (to me) like they would age into characters like those essayed by Mr. Garner and Ms. Rowlands. Many times, the younger lovers appear to be modeling, rather than playing, their roles. The older couple is more enjoyable. Garner's performance, and narration, is particularly strong. James Marsden (as Lon Hammond) and Joan Allen (as Anne Hamilton) have interesting, underdeveloped roles. (Ms. Allen may been channeling Ellen Burstyn's 'Lois Farrow').The 'teenage', and later, undressing scenes are very funny. And, some of the characters' implausible actions (the 365 letters, for example) could be explained as embellishments and/or enhancements made by Rowlands' character, in her 'The Story of Our Lives' account. It is interesting that the lead characters write, at different times, a prolific amount of material to be read at a later time.

Spider-Man 2," Tobey Maguire's Back, Spinning Another Web
","The 'Spider-Man 2' movie is just a shade better than the first - which, in series films, is a cause for tremendous celebration. Happily, producers were able to pay director Sam Raimi and his main cast however many millions of dollars they needed... Also, the first film's 'special effects' (however well done) seemed too startlingly change from live action to animation. This is still fairly obvious, but done much more smoothly; and, the 'Dr. Octopus' villain costume is a cinematic success. Like they say, '(special effects director John) Frazier is especially effective (along with over a hundred helpers).' Allowing for a comic book aficionado to be a little too critical, it does seem like an extraordinary amount of time is spent on illustrating the 'downtrodden' life of 'Peter Parker' (which is the main plot, I know, but it's a very large chunk of the movie). And, although Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker) is wonderful in the role, he and Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane Watson) aren't going to be able to convincingly play 'Peter' and 'M.J.' as 'teenagers in love' much longer. It will be interesting to see how producers continue this relationship, which seems to be, herein, necessary for 'Spider-Man' to remain fully powerful.Alfred Molina (as Otto Octavius) rises to the challenge of playing the 'visual effects'-enhanced villain role. Handsome 'best friend' James Franco (as Harry Osborn) returns, to hint at becoming the new 'Green Goblin'; as in the first film, the actor doesn't seem to be used to his potential (although, it looks like he will get a chance to put on a costume in the next film).

Alexander," Greece Is the Word
","Could one of the great figures in history (Alexander the Great), a great director (Oliver Stone), and a great deal of money amount to something significantly less than great? Yes, and this film is proof. Courageous Colin Farrell (as Alexander) wears different lengths of blonde wigs, in the title role. Alluring Angelina Jolie (as Olympias) is a couple of decades too young to play the mother role throughout, but she does. Veiled Val Kilmer (as Philip) is unconvincingly half-hidden, under an eye scar. Alexander digs men and women with heavier eye make-up.Unfortunately, the performers do not come across as well as you have a right to expect, under Stone's direction; in particular, the title character lacks Alexander's certain je ne sais quoi. Anthony Hopkins (as Old Ptolemy) performs double duty, as a semi-omniscient narrator (which works better in the original, theatrical version). Films with too many 'narrative' interruptions are not, in general, successfully telling their stories visually.However, Mr. Stone more than earns an 'E' for effort; his 'Alexander' definitely evidences the many individual strengths of its cast and crew. The main battle scene is very well done; Stone successfully employs his great poetic violence, with an increasingly blood-red drenched infrared lens, marauding elephants, and slow motion. After this excitement, the remainder of the film moves along briskly, and effectively. Alexander's main relationship, with Jared Leto (as Hephaistion), is not fleshed out; he beds both genders, but is only allowed to hiss like a lion, on-screen, with wifely Rosario Dawson (as Roxane).Who knew either Stone, or the Greeks could be so prudish? ****** Alexander (2004) Oliver Stone ~ Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer Good grief!

","Chain-smoking 'Hellblazer' John Constantine goes from DC Comics' 'Vertigo' (aimed at 'adult' readers) to the movies for actor Keanu Reeves. They called it/him 'Constantine' and hoped Mr. Reeves would help the film survive the ill-advised title change. The resulting story is nicely directed, imaginatively edited, and stylishly photographed - by Francis Lawrence, Wayne Wahrman, and Philippe Rousselot - but, the dynamic trio aren't able deliver the original, much more intriguing Liverpudlian. The plot starts out fine, but becomes somewhat overloaded and confusing during the running time.The film was based (very loosely!) on Garth Ennis' first 'Hellblazer' story - entitled 'Dangerous Habits' and running through issues #41-46 (May-October, 1991) of the comic. It should be available as a separate 'graphic novel' in your local disappearing comic shop - or online, if the store is already gone. The story dealt with Constantine's deadly lung cancer diagnosis. With some changes, best pal Chas Chandler/Kramer (Shia LaBeouf) is included, but you have to wait until after the credits for his full story. Rachel Weisz is almost a female co-star, playing twins (Constantine's twin is not mentioned).****** Constantine (2/8/05) Francis Lawrence ~ Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton",6,1,2,20 December 2009
The Natural," Score One for Robert Redford
","Incredibly natural baseball player Robert Redford (as Roy Hobbs) grows up to be a 1920s teenager on the verge of playing in the big leagues. Then, he is derailed Sixteen years later, Mr. Redford attempts to re-enter his field of dreams. As a middle-aged rookie, Redford is immediately benched - but, you should never write Redford off 'The Natural' is an excellent fantasy - one you can believe within the confines of its running time. As both a baseball player and a movie star, Redford rises to the occasion. For the film, he gets extraordinary production values - skillfully led by director Barry Levinson and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel. For the character, Redford gets magical powers from a lightning strike - courtesy of writer Bernard Malamud and mythology.******* The Natural (5/11/84) Barry Levinson ~ Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger",7,5,6,30 July 2013
Troy," Brad Pitt's Achilles' Heel
","'Brad Pitt picks up a sword and brings a muscular, brooding presence to the role of Greek warrior Achilles in this spectacular retelling of 'The Iliad'. Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger play the legendary lovers who plunge the world into war, Eric Bana portrays the prince who dares to confront Achilles, and Peter O'Toole rules Troy as King Priam. Director Wolfgang Petersen recreates a long-ago world of mighty warships, clashing armies, the massive fortress city, and the towering Trojan Horse.' Director Peterson does a good job keeping this long, big-budgeted epic rolling; especially, he is good with the chest-piercing battle scenes. The film's thesis; a more plausible, historically, version of the mythological 'Iliad', is a good one - if only the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt hadn't burned, we'd know so much more about the era Although the film is beautifully produced, the computer generated 'look' is, at times, distracting; don't look too carefully, for example, at those mighty warships.During the picture, Brad Pitt was experiencing a second wave of mega-box office popularity; and, while his on screen presence undoubtedly thrilled millions, he is not entirely successful in the 'Achilles' role. The camera treats Mr. Pitt as a drugstore paperback novel cover boy - with biceps and blond mane prominently displayed. He is obviously trying to essay the role, but Pitt most often looks to be simply posed. Consequently, the usually ultra-sexy Pitt appears almost sexless. Rose Byrne's 'Briseis' helps, though The more sexy story involves Orlando Bloom's 'Paris' irritating big brother Eric Bana's 'Hector' by taking Diane Kruger's 'Helen' as his lover. Of the four 'hot' young leads (if you count Pitt, Bloom, Kruger, and Bana), Mr. Bana comes off the best, with Ms. Kruger edging out Mr. Bloom as the prettiest. Peter O'Toole and a strong supporting cast look as good, if not better, than the stars. Worth checking out, for the spectacle (great art direction/set direction & costume design) - and for Eric Bana's acting one-upmanship.******* Troy (2004) Wolfgang Petersen ~ Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana",7,1,2,30 March 2009
Dead Poets Society," Leaves of Class
","In 1959 Delaware (as Vermont), charismatic poetry teacher Robin Williams (as John Keating) arrives to begin work at the 'Welton Academy' preparatory school for boys. An alumni of the school, Mr. Williams teaches poetry with uncommon zeal. To gain attention, he demands students tear out the pages of books written by essayists with whom he does not agree. To get participation, he invites students to stand on the teacher's desk. Williams does impersonations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. His motto is 'Seize the Day,' a directive made popular by novelist Saul Bellow. Yes, this class is fun...Williams teaches the 'dangers of conforming,' and encourages students to think for themselves. When they learn Williams belonged to a clandestine club called the 'Dead Poets Society' when he was a 'Welton' student, the class decides to revive the group. They meet in a cave to read poetry by the masters - but, mainly, they just goof around. Playing the saxophone and sharing 'Playboy'-type centerfolds accompany Walt Whitman. Because Williams'' influence extends perilously beyond the classroom, his 'unorthodox teaching methods' get the popular teacher in trouble with school administrators...This above average production won good notices and award consideration for director Peter Weir and star Robin Williams. Originally, the teacher held back a secret; 'Oscar'-winning writer Tom Schulman was persuaded to drop the idea, so we and the character are left with a gap. Williams' 'Keating' is put on the sidelines in favor of the students. Nothing against the actors, who perform exceptionally, but they do look more like handsome young college-aged models than typical high-school aged boys. There is some physical diversity in the extended supporting cast, though. A few of the boys wear glasses...The main stars are sensitive writer Ethan Hawke (as Todd Anderson) and his roommate, aspiring actor Robert Sean Leonard (as Neil Perry). The next tier includes prankster Gale Hansen (as Charlie Dalton) and lovelorn Josh Charles (as Knox Overstreet). Although these players are almost interchangeable, the actors create distinguishable characters. Best of the remaining parts goes to Dylan Kussman (as Richard Cameron), who perversely turns out to be the group's real non-conformist. The film is too self-consciously calculating and manipulative to be fully masterful, but it sure looks nice.******** Dead Poets Society (6/2/89) Peter Weir ~ Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Gale Hansen",8,2,2,29 July 2013
Brokeback Mountain," Gone Fishing
","Seeking summer employment, Wyoming ranch hand Heath Ledger (as Ennis Del Mar) and Texas rodeo cowboy Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack Twist) get a job minding Randy Quaid's sheep up on 'Brokeback Mountain' - and the rest, like they say, is history The official synopsis accurately describes this film as 'a sweeping epic that explores the lives of two young men...who meet in the summer of 1963 and unexpectedly forge a lifelong connection. The complications, joys, and heartbreak they experience provide a testament to the endurance and power of love.' The film is about individual relationships, and features a level and range of human sexual relationships not acceptable in 'mainstream' movies at the time of its release.The story, by Annie Proulx with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana lives up to its reputation as flawless. The western landscape is spectacular, with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto's camera coming alive under Ang Lee's direction. Mr. Lee's direction, and Gustavo Santaolalla's musical score, keep the photography and performances in tune. Lee makes the camera an important character adjunct - note how the camera flirts with Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal, when they first arrive on the scene; Gyllenhaal poses by his truck, and glimpses at Ledger while he shaves. Bisexual and lonely, Gyllenhaal knows what he wants, but Ledger is an emotional wreck. From there, we witness their falling in (isolated) love, on 'Brokeback Mountain'. These are (or, were, at the time) the film's most iconic scenes; but, the film gets better and better, as Ledger and Gyllenhaal lead necessarily separate lives, but strengthen their emotional love.Their final scenes together, and Ledger visiting Gyllenhaal's parents, are truly amazing cinematic achievements; making 'Brokeback Mountain' not only the 'Best Picture' of the year, but also an 'all-time' great film. Ledger's trip to Gyllenhaal's boyhood bedroom matches the emotional depths present in 'silent' movie scenes; Lee knows not only when to use dialogue, but also when it's superfluous. Ledger and Gyllenhaal easily earn their many 'Best Actor' and 'Best Supporting Actor' honors; the latter's regulation as a 'Supporting Actor' is probably due to having less screen time - but, if Ledger's performance had been ordinary, 'Oscar' (and some others) could have nominated Gyllenhaal for the lead actor award.The cast is uniformly perfect, right down to the smallest role. Probably, the 'Best Supporting Actress' would have to be Michelle Williams (as Alma Beers), again, due to screen time. But, Anne Hathaway (as Lureen Newsome) is excellent, as well; and, Linda Cardellini (as Cassie Cartwright) turns her sexy secondary role into screen gold (she's the one who tells Ledger, 'Girls don't fall in love with fun'). Characters on screen for only moments resonate - witness Roberta Maxwell's understanding looks and Peter McRobbie icy stares (they play Gyllenhaal's parents). 'Brokeback Mountain' is a production where story and execution merge perfectly. Lee, his cast, and crew are at peak levels of artistic achievement. And, the positive effect this film had upon society is both arguable and incalculable. Make sure you see it.********** Brokeback Mountain (9/2/05) Ang Lee ~ Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway",10,9,11,23 May 2009
Insomnia," Rage Against the Dying of the Light
","'Invited to 'Nightmute', Alaska, to head a murder case, veteran LAPD detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) finds his investigation interrupted by an ever-shining midnight sun that wreaks sleep-depriving havoc on him - and by personal guilt over a second crime that may be real or a figment of his increasingly unstable consciousness,' according to the DVD sleeve description.Director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job crafting a North American version of the original 1997 Norwegian crime drama, helped immensely by Hillary Seitz' intricate, intelligent adaptation.Also extraordinary are Mr. Pacino, cinematographer Wally Pfister, and editor Dody Dorn. Hilary Swank and Robin Williams effectively tone down their established personas. The smaller roles are beautifully realized - Paul Dooley, Larry Holden, Katharine Isabelle, Jonathan Jackson, Nicky Katt, and Maura Tierney deserve an 'ensemble cast' award - and, Martin Donovan's 'Hap' is particularly haunting.This film could have easily been nominated for six 'Academy Awards' - but, probably, voters were sleepless in Chicago. Nevertheless, 'Insomnia' shows Mr. Nolan, coming off 'Memento' (2000), moving into the circle of upper echelon directors. Mr. Pfister knows how to hand-hold cameras, and Ms. Dorn's editing skills are sharp - hopefully, this team will receive some more film projects.********* Insomnia (5/3/02) Christopher Nolan ~ Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan",9,5,8,28 December 2009

The Day After Tomorrow," Giving Global Warming the Cold Shoulder
","Global Warming is accelerated to incredible levels, propelling the planet Earth into another Ica Age. Most frequently, the cameras find climatologist Dennis Quaid (as Jack Hall) and estranged son Jake Gyllenhaal (as Sam Hall). Both men are strong, and smart. Mr. Quaid is one of the few who knows the seriousness of the matter. Mr. Gyllenhaal is smarter than his calculus teacher; he does appear like he's been 'kept back' a few years in high school, but this is probably because teachers are jealous of Gyllenhaal's intelligence. Quaid has not won any 'Father of the Year' awards; but, he really loves his son. Can Quaid save Gyllenhaal from the Global Warming monster? Indulgent cliché-ridden idiocy! Some money was obviously spent on 'The Day After Tomorrow', which means there are exciting, well-produced scenes. Roland Emmerich is an obviously very skillful filmmaker; but, his story premises favor mindless blockbusters over enduring classics. The story renders its serious subject unintentionally (?) nonsensical; although, it is, admittedly, only a movie. Emmy Rossum (as Laura Chapman) and Sela Ward (as Lucy Hall) are the lovely love interests. Capable Ian Holm (as Terry Rapson) doesn't have much to do. Everyone watches FOX 'News' channels.

A Bridge Too Far," A Film Too Long
","We begin with what looks like archival World War II footage. After D-Day, the Allies have turned the tide. Now, they expect to defeat the Germans. In September of 1944, with the war's end presumably in sight, American and British forces embark on a mission they hope will win the war by December 1944, so everyone can be home for Christmas. Being home for Christmas is a righteous goal. The mission involves Allied troops going into Dutch territory held by the Germans and gaining control of strategic bridges. History, the title, and tone of this production leaves little doubt about the mission's outcome...Knowing how it ends doesn't always mean a story can't engage. Some stories are so engaging, you can watch them over and over again. We know Superman and Batman will return, but seeing their lives put in danger can still excite. Good story-telling qualities always help. Joseph E. Levine and his director Richard Attenborough are trying to make 'A Bridge Too Far' work, but the film is quite exhausting. There is simply not enough story for the length. Back in the 1970s, Mr. Attenborough could not say, 'Save it for the director's cut.' So, we have excess in effective acting and explosive production scenes...The basic story, of a failed mission, isn't even properly presented. One gets the feeling the Allies should only try to blow-up the bridges. Simply infiltrating German-held territory is a good way to get killed. With great gusto, Edward Fox outlines an impossible mission. Later, poor Dirk Bogarde nonchalantly explains it away. We're not sure if it was a suicide mission. The original 'I'll be Home for Christmas' goal is forgotten. The subplots involve an all-star cast, but their characters have little substance. The better performances are given by lesser names, who blend into their undeveloped roles more successfully...Arguably, the leading man is Sean Connery (as Robert Urquhart). He seems to be around most often and appears in command. Like several of the big names in the cast, he is always the Actor in his Role. Even more obvious are Ryan O'Neal and Robert Redford, implicitly and explicitly giving 'Hail Mary' passes. Elliott Gould finds his character swinging on a cigar. Gene Hackman ventures into a Polish accent. James Caan shows muscle. The non-Americans are better, with Laurence Olivier blending best into his civilian character. Olivier perfected his movie camera acting in the late 1930s and never looked back...As yet unmentioned are Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins and Maximilian Schell. All are dependable performers and succeed by not sticking out like money-making box-office movie stars. Always good, Liv Ullmann appears later in the running time. There is a distinct line of Swedish acting excellence, running from Greta Garbo through Ingrid Bergman and Ms. Ullmann. They rarely, if ever, give bad performances. Geoffrey Unsworth photography is fine, as expected, but John Addison's music really needed a better story. The production costs are obviously high. But the causalities are even higher.***** A Bridge Too Far (6/15/77) Richard Attenborough ~ Sean Connery, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier",5,2,8,4 June 2016
Zodiac," Unenlightened Shadows Cast
","'Based on the true story of the notorious serial killer and the intense manhunt he inspired, 'Zodiac' is a superbly crafted thriller from the director of 'Se7en' and 'Panic Room'. Featuring an outstanding ensemble cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Chloe Sevigny, 'Zodiac' is a searing and singularly haunting examination of twin obsessions: one man's desire to kill and another's quest for the truth,' according to the film's description. Highlight 'superbly crafted' and 'outstanding ensemble.' Screenwriter James Vanderbilt does a great job scripting the original material from the true account books authored by 'San Francisco Chronicle' cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who turned himself into a long-suffering chief investigator in the unsolved 'Zodiac' case. Possibly, the film's one main weakness is that it hesitates in offering a satisfactory conclusion; the thesis points in one direction, with strong circumstantial evidence (many cases have nothing but), and re-opens the case with wordy end notes.The performances are uniformly excellent, with Mr. Gyllenhaal always clearly in the lead, playing the fresh-faced political cartoonist fascinated by the dark killer; it is his character's story, after all. The main supporting actors are police investigator Mark Ruffalo (as Dave Toschi) and newspaperman Robert Downey Jr. (as Paul Avery). These three men approach the 'Zodiac' killer from different angles, and could be counted among his secondary victims; they lose (unequal) parts of their lives while questing the beast.Most valuable player is clearly versatile director David Fincher, who knows the precise style with which to deliver the otherwise unappealing narrative; with a perfect cast and crew, Mr. Fincher steadily builds interest. This is one of 2007's best productions, and Fincher most deserved some 'Best Director' notice; in hindsight, his work will marked up. Also outstanding are photographer Harris Savides and composer David Shire, with Three Dog Night's 'Easy to Be Hard' leading a series of timely music cues.********* Zodiac (3/2/07) David Fincher ~ Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., John Carroll Lynch",9,1,1,21 February 2010
The Terminator," Run For Your Life
","Director James Cameron sends Michael Biehn (as Kyle Reese) from a post-nuclear war future to destroy cyborg Arnold Schwarzenegger (as 'The Terminator') before he kills Linda Hamilton (as Sarah Connor). Why? Surviving historical records of the future show one 'Sarah Connor' will bear a son who will grow up and help defeat a new 'race' of Earth controlling Machines. Any questions? Director Cameron's 'The Terminator' perfectly captures the look, and feel, of Los Angeles in the mid-1980s. Cameron's ability to thrillingly direct is the film's greatest strength; he mesmerizes. Mr. Biehn and Ms. Hamilton are a great hero team. Mr. Schwarzenegger is much more of a special effect than an actor, which means he is perfect in this movie. You're always going to have 'flaws' in this type of film; though, note, the 'time paradox' problem is explained by a quick reference to possible future realities (plural). Of more concern, story-wise, is the weakness in The Terminator's arm, early on; it doesn't quite fit the growing depiction of indestructibility.

Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton Gets Heads Up
","Like it says on the DVD sleeve, 'Master storyteller Tim Burton weaves an eerie, enchanting version of this classic tale of horror. Jonny Depp is 'Ichabod Crane', an eccentric investigator determined to stop the murderous 'Headless Horseman'. Christina Ricci is 'Katrina Van Tassel', the beautiful and mysterious girl with secret ties to the supernatural terror.' Director Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' gallops very far away from the classic short story read in high school (at least the one I attended); though, the plot enhancements make it a better feature-length film. This version of 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' should be taken as a completely different story. Herein, Mr. Depp plays Washington Irving's ugly Connecticut schoolmaster as an attractive, faint-hearted New York constable. He is sent to solve a series of mysterious decapitation murders in small-town 'Sleepy Hollow'. Squeamish and scientific, Depp is convinced the supernatural forces are not a factor in the crimes, but events continuously challenge his scientific belief system. Interestingly, Depp is given an appealing sidekick, Marc Pickering as 'Young Masbeth'. The film has the sense of humor welcome in horror, but often goes overbroad with one-liners and blood-splattering 'camp'. Yet, the fantastical 'Sleepy Hollow' world created by Burton, Emmanuel Lubezki, Rick Heinrichs, Peter Young, and the production crew can't be overlooked.

And, not with a mysterious someone stalking Danny and crew. It's time to pull off another stunner of a plan - or plans' according to the sleeve's synopsis.The first problem with 'Ocean's Twelve' is that the main plot involves the original team's effort to RETURN the money from the first film, or DIE. 'Ocean's Eleven' involved viewers is rooting for the superstar team to GET the money; and, none of them were killed. This film stabs the earlier one in the back. Perhaps, George Clooney (as Ocean) and his all-star team weren't so smart, after all. Probably, they should they have killed Andy Garcia's 'Benedict'. NOW, they have to steal more money, to pay their 'debt'. That's no fun.The 'In Jokes' are smarmy. On the plus side, the locations and music (David Holmes) are exemplary. The 'laser field dance' in the great hall moves along stylishly. Attractive Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel are strong shove-ins to the cast - but, really, Steven Soderbergh should have considered the 'Ocean's Ten', 'Ocean's Nine', 'Ocean's Eight', 'Ocean's Seven' progression, ending with a George Clooney monologue on aging gracefully.***** Ocean's Twelve (2001) Steven Soderbergh ~ George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon",5,1,3,27 December 2008
Crash," Los Angeles Smacked Upside the Face
","Paul Haggis' 'Crash' is an insulting picture. It seeks to say something meaningful about racism run rampant in Los Angeles. Did somebody put something in the water? Something that only a Los Angeles snowfall could wipe away? Nearly every character in the film is motivated by ignorant, bigoted instincts. Things get started with a car crash and a carjacking - with people of different ethnic groups colliding get it? The first real grabber occurs when two carjackers (Ludacris & Larenz Tate) draw guns and jack a car - not very shocking, but these two don't impress you as carjackers which could be part of the point, or not...A more shocking scene has two policeman (Matt Dillon & Ryan Phillippe) pulling over a couple for lollipopping in their automobile. The wife (Thandie Newton) who 'went down' is roughly 'felt up' by the abusive cop (Dillon), while her husband (Terrence Howard) is forced to watch on, apologetically. Later, the abusive cop is offered 'salvation', in a laughably conceived scene. Elsewhere, a snooty (Sandra Bullock) socialite finds friendship and redemption in the arms of her housekeeper. A small businessman (Shaun Toub) man feels supernatural forces 'saved' him from shooting a little girl dead. One of the carjackers becomes a martyr...The only character with a story worth telling is the locksmith (Michael Peña) seeking a better life for his family; although, you can make out three or four good stories buried in the mix. The film has no focal character (it should have been the role played by Don Cheadle). It is obvious and lacking humor. And, its overdriven theme is outmoded and unfair. 'Crash' drives a stake through its own heart by failing to realize its story is primarily about social and cultural class, rather than the loathsome thing hoisted up on the screen. So, why a relatively high ranking? The production, direction (Haggis), photography (J. Michael Muro), and performances are often excellent.******* Crash (9/10/04) Paul Haggis ~ Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard",7,5,8,22 March 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The Sky Is Falling! The Sky Is Falling!
","'Dr. Strangelove' is still funny after all these years. Mainly, this is due to Stanley Kubrick's direction, and the triad of hilarious characterizations from Peter Sellers, who plays stiff-lipped British 'Captain Lionel Mandrake', deadpan American 'President Merkin Muffley', and spastic German scientist 'Dr. Strangelove'. Sellers is at his best portraying the relatively low-key President, trying to calm down his hysterical Russian counterpart on the telephone. 'Listen, Dmitri,' apologies Sellers, after the US launches a nuclear attack on the USSR, 'I'm sorry too, Dmitri...' Slim Pickens riding 'The Bomb' into oblivion is an iconic image; it's the satirical apex of 'Cold War' masculinity. This will undoubtedly sound blasphemous, but Mr. Kubrick should have given the non-war room segments (specifically, the office and cockpit scenes) a sharper edit.

Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, and Billy Idol also star.' Probably, it would be more accurate to describe Mr. Idol's appearance as a cameo. And, Ms. Ryan and the others are merely featured players; this is an imaginary biography of Jim Morrison, tripping in the limelight.Five to One It's not even close to opening 'The Doors' - but, the film does include an appropriately mesmerizing simulation by Val Kilmer (as Jim Morrison). Mr. Kilmer is so good he almost makes up for the surprising lack of substance (but not substance abuse) and reality. Director Oliver Stone, who did so well with previous 1960s-based films, is unable to present an honest picture of Mr. Morrison. Certainly, it hurts that Morrison isn't around to offer advice - but, 'Other Voices' (the other members of the band) are extended thanks at the end of the film, indicating they approved of and/or contributed to the contents of this biography.People Are Strange Unfortunately, the film skips over Morrison, Ray Manzarek (Mr. MacLachlan), John Densmore (Mr. Dillon), and Robby Krieger (Mr. Whaley) as musicians. The legendary melding of Morrison's moody poetics with Mr. Manzarek's rock sensibilities (the 'Moonlight Drive' at Venice Beach ) is covered, but the creation of actual music that mattered is scuttled to focus almost singularly on Morrison's alcoholic acid trip. Morrison was cruel, kind, and often very drunk - but, he and the other Doors were much more worthy than wasted. This film is technically sound, and Kilmer's performance is excellent.

The Best Years of Our Lives," Nothing But the Best
","This is a great film from director William Wyler, cast and crew. I agree with so many of the prior comments.The film's appeal - represented early on by veteran Harold Russell - is that this is going to be a *realistic* depiction of post-war comings home. Mr. Russell, Mr. March, and Mr. Andrews make a great team, and each give great performances. Russell is an amputee, March has an alcohol problem, and Andrews shows some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The film shows them adjusting, or not adjusting, to civilian life.Myrna Loy is wonderful to watch especially, her eyes. The background/foreground action is nice. I noticed that March and the others do not look like they've missed all that much shaving, despite the script. In fact, March's moustache looks very neatly trimmed.My only criticism is, after starting as a 'realistic' drama, the film ends with a glossy 'happy ending'. The servicemen's differing problems are all too conveniently... gone. The movie becomes less a realistic drama and more a Fantasy Hollywood Movie. It becomes way, way too sentimental.It's, still, incredibly well-presented sentimentality.I think its closeness to the actual war being represented both adds and detracts from the film. I'm sure audiences benefited from this movie greatly during release - but, it was too soon for an honest reflection.Instead of it's goal, I think the film becomes an essential *American* time capsule. It shows the mood of the country in a way, today, the filmmakers were perhaps not expecting - and, it's sentimentally perfect Hollywood ending is no less valuable than gritty real life dramas. ********* The Best Years of Our Lives (11/21/46) William Wyler ~ Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy, Harold Russell",9,1,3,8 August 2007
Closer," Dan & Anna & Larry & Alice
","In London, pretty stripper Natalie Portman (as Alice Ayres) is struck by a car. Injured, but not fatally, she opens her eyes to see an handsome stranger - he's business-suited obituary writer Jude Law (as Dan Woolf). The attractive twosome begin satisfying sexual urges. Ms. Portman helps inspire Mr. Law's sexy novel. Then, beautiful photographer Julia Roberts (as Anna Cameron) takes Law's picture for his book jacket. Soon, Ms. Roberts and Law are fighting off (temporarily) sexual urges. Next, during a moment alone, Law engages in a laptop sex chat with attractive dermatologist Clive Owen (as Larry Gray). Posing as 'Anna', Law arranges a sex date for Mr. Owen and Roberts. Eventually, Owen hooks up with Portman.A Mike Nichols-directed film version of Patrick Marber's sex play sure sounds promising. But, with the possible exception of the brief, and more modernly sensible Portman/Owens coupling, the relationships don't really work. The characters have very little understanding regarding love and sexual gratification, despite having a great deal of the latter. It's nearly impossible to care about what they feel. 'Closer' is certainly well-performed, however. Owen wins the acting honors, by a hair; demonstrating great versatility, he starred in the original play, but in Law's role, as 'Dan'.******* Closer (2004) Mike Nichols ~ Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen",7,1,2,23 December 2008
Capote," In the Belly of the Beast
","In a nutshell, 'Famed author Truman Capote befriends two murderers while researching his celebrated book 'In Cold Blood' - and finds himself changed to the core.' Having relatives who knew Mr. Capote makes me want to disagree, slightly, with this film's closing theme. The film portends Capote 'never finished another book' due to an emotional attachment formed with killer Perry Smith. But the real reason for Capote's writer's block was that he was never again really sober long enough to call upon Clio, or any of the other muses which fueled his creativity.My grandmother told me some amusing stories about Capote, including how he'd order: 'Vodka on the rocks,' and, after a pause Jack Benny would appreciate, add, 'hold the rocks.' This was in a Sag Harbor, NY bar; Capote 'held court' in many watering holes around the world, and was always the life of the party. Grandmother enjoyed this film, but not more than either 'In Cold Blood' or the real Truman Capote (when he wasn't being too sardonic).Capote might have appreciated this film (while trashing it in public), as it could be described as the dramatization (by Dan Futterman) of a speculative biography (by Gerald Clarke) about a nonfiction novel (by Capote). Secondary sources rule. And, for a 2005 film, there is a surprising lack of intimacy shown. Capote and companion Bruce Greenwood (as Jack Dunphy) are like brothers, his much-heralded 'love' for Smith is debatable, and only once does Capote try to hook up (don't blink) with a potential sex partner.The production is first rate, with director Bennett Miller guiding an excellent cast. Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal doesn't inhale, but it's the best Truman Capote since 'Murder by Death' (1976); and, it provided Mr. Hoffman with a mother-lode of 'Best Actor' awards. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' writer Catherine Keener (as Nelle Harper Lee) and aspirin-chewing Clifton Collins Jr. (as Perry Smith) are among the many notable 'Best Supporting' players.******* Capote (9/2/05) Bennett Miller ~ Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr.",7,1,1,30 May 2009
Lost in Translation," The King of Karaoke
","In the twilight of his career as a movie star, exhausted Bill Murray (as Bob Harris) takes flight to Tokyo, to take an assignment as pitchman for a Japanese whiskey. Apparently, Mr. Murray is emotionally estranged from his American family. He shoots his ad spots, then goes out for a drink. At the bar, he attracts the attention of beautiful Scarlett Johansson (as Charlotte). Recently graduated from Yale, with a major in philosophy, Ms. Johansson seems to be having an early-life crisis to parallel Murray's mid-life crisis. Johansson is, apparently, being taken for granted by photographer husband Giovanni Ribisi (as John).Writer/director Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' is, like the lead characters, a bit of a bore. She does, however, score with an interesting and unconventional 'relationship' between the characters played by dead-panned Murray and sexy pantie-clad Johansson. Yet, like one of Murray's amusing ad directors notes, there is a certain lack of tension. And, why would two Americans in Tokyo spend so much time in karaoke bars when the city has infinitely more to offer - you can get that stuff here. There was a parade of awards and nominations for Ms. Coppola, Murray, and Johansson, with Sofia's screenplay leading the charge.***** Lost in Translation (8/29/03) Sofia Coppola ~ Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Giovanni Ribisi, Anna Faris",5,2,4,21 June 2010
Barry Lyndon," Watch the Paint Dry
","Out of shiny fresh apples, esteemed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick takes a metaphorical lemon and paints it red. He uses only the finest and most exquisite paints available and calls his lemon 'Barry Lyndon'. As you would expect, Mr. Kubrick makes the Lyndon lemon look extraordinarily beautiful. Still, when you look at it for over three hours, you realize it's only an ordinary lemon. Cutting through the outer beauty, you find the lemon sour, overripe and choked with unyielding seeds. A few seeds are well-cast, though. Leon Vitali (as Lord Bullingdon) is one. You will have to wait, but Mr. Vitali does appear before Godot. There are scenes that reach perfection, like those with Lyndon's mother Marie Kean and the Reverend Murray Melvin. And the paint sparkles throughout.***** Barry Lyndon (12/18/1975) Stanley Kubrick ~ Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Leon Vitali, Murray Melvin",5,4,9,5 July 2016
Full Metal Jacket," That Giant Sucking Sound
","The unifying theme of Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is that Vietnam put American in the toilet; each of the film's three parts, or 'Acts', has characters in what is repeatedly described as 'a world of s--t.' The men are successful trained to kill - but, they do not know when to kill, who to kill, or why anyone should die. Narrator protagonist Matthew Modine (as James 'Joker' Davis) not only wears a 'Peace' button on his uniform, but also has written 'Born To Kill' on his helmet (to illustrate the duality of man). The reason for the war is explained, 'We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out.' Probably, the film's strongest 'story' is told in the first 'Act'; it features drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (as Hartman) belittling overweight Vincent D'Onofrio (as Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence). This story literally ends in the latrine, where a successfully trained killer demonstrates his ability. Some of the material in the rest of the film becomes very weak, in comparison; especially disappointing are some mid-movie scenes 'staged' for the camera of 'Stars and Stripes' photographer 'Rafterman' (Kevyn Major Howard) - the characters all say silly things for the camera. Still, some near-poetic moments of humor and brutality remain to be seen.******* Full Metal Jacket (6/17/87) Stanley Kubrick ~ Matthew Modine, R.

Passing by 'Cross Roads' Mr. Fonda hitches a ride in a truck labeled 'No Riders Allowed' and descends to meet fallen preacher John Carradine (as Jim Casy). When Mr. Casy reveals, 'I lost the spirit,' Fonda gives him some liquor. From ghostly frightening resident John Qualen (as Muley), Fonda learns his Oklahoma dust-bowl family has been forced out of their home. Poor being no sin, Fonda goes to join their trek to California, the Promised Land, on Highway 66...In a word, this is superb...The biggest prizes included a 'Pulitzer' for writer John Steinbeck, 'Best Picture' honors from the 'New York Film Critics' and 'National Board of Review' for Fox producer Darryl F. Zanuck and 'Academy Award' winning 'Best Director' John Ford. For going through her box of mementos, and explaining how 'a man lives in jerks,' matriarchal Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad) won a 'Supporting' award. Fonda should have won the year's 'Best Actor' Oscar. This sweet combination made 'The Grapes of Wrath' Mr. Ford's most lyrical masterpiece; incredibly, it reaches a level of poetic screen art unseen since the end of silent movies.********** The Grapes of Wrath (1/24/40) John Ford ~ Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, Russell Simpson",10,0,2,9 April 2010
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Going to the Extreme Close-Up
","Here is a film which is easier to understand if you bring some prior knowledge to the viewing; most obviously, it helps if you know who 'Jeanne d'Arc' (aka 'Joan of Arc') was, because the film really only shows the last part of her story. It's like watching a stretched out final act of a movie; probably, the intended audience knew about the events preceding the drama. For film viewers not interested in doing homework, but possessing some familiarity with Christianity, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what is happening. Think of it as a 'second coming' Jesus Christ story, 'updated' to a woman in France.The film picks up with Maria Falconetti (as Jeanne d'Arc) on trial for her crimes. Ms. Falconetti is teased and tortured. She is not able to read, and provides little information to the wicked judges. She says she is nineteen years old, 'Je pense,' elle dit, but looks older. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer films Falconetti almost entirely in close-up. She widens her eyes, and emotes fiercely. It almost looks like a close-up screen test. Falconetti suffers well, responding to the director's commands. But it's hard to tell what she is emoting about; at times, she could be sitting on her toilet. Since she brushes a fly away from her face once or twice; it is likely true this film was made from originally rejected footage, after the original Dreyer edit was 'accidentally destroyed'.That this film is a compilation of outtakes explains (in part?) its flaws in style and storytelling. Although no substitute for the supposedly superior original, this 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' is worth a look. The director, star, and photographer Rudolph Maté demonstrate some courage and creativity in film-making.******* La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc (4/21/28) Carl Theodor Dreyer ~ Maria Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, André Berley",7,2,7,3 August 2008
The Aviator," Straighten Up and Fly Right
","At last! The mystery of Howard Hughes is revealed! by Martin Scorsese (director), John Logan (scripter), and Leonardo DiCaprio (star), in 'The Aviator'. Their biography begins with young Howard (Jacob Davich) being erotically bathed by his mother. Mind you, this is long after the teenage Hughes should be washing himself. So, he's practices spelling 'q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e' while mother (Amy Sloan) bends down to well, it's 'suggested' incest (there is nothing overtly sexy in the PG-13-rated film). Presumably, this is why Hughes lost his marbles; read, this is his 'Rosebud' moment.'The Aviator' would have been better off following Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' model more closely - about, but not quite so, a familiar figure. Then, the film could be described as 'thinly disguised' instead of wildly speculative and outrageously fabricated. Herein, the 'love' of Hughes' life is revealed to be a sexually aggressive and fidgety Cate Blanchett (as Katharine Hepburn). This bizarre characterization won Ms. Blanchett a 'Best Supporting Actress' Oscar. At times, her awful 'Kate' seems like Faye Dunaway's 'Joan Crawford'.Hughes' compulsions for aviating and Hollywood are followed through the 1940s. The good news is that this is a beautiful-looking, Scorsese-directed production. There is outstanding work from the acclaimed director and his collaborators; including cinematographer Robert Richardson, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and musician Howard Shore. DiCaprio does a marvelous job with the role; he grows into the role so well, that the later scenes - especially those with Alan Alda (as Senator Brewster) - make it seem like the hours flew by.******** The Aviator (12/14/04) Martin Scorsese ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda",8,1,5,22 November 2009

If Sauron reclaims the Ring, Middle-earth is doomed,' according to the DVD sleeve description, 'Winner of four 'Academy Awards', this epic tale of good versus evil, friendship and sacrifice will transport you to a world beyond imagination.' Reading the original J.R.R. Tolkien novels was an intellectual rite of passage; whilst young, you read and enjoyed 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy willingly - prepping with 'The Hobbit', of course. 'It's a job that's never started that takes the longest to finish,' someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson's 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it's made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness.'The Bridge of Khazad-DÃ»m' (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable 'Lord of the Rings' reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable.

","Love is a many-splendored thing for dimpled stud John Travolta (as Danny) and pretty blonde Olivia Newton-John (as Sandy). They frolic on the beach for a summer. We later learn it was 'all talk and no action.' When school starts, we also learn how little they spoke, as Mr. Travolta is surprised to discover Ms. Newton-John is an Australian exchange student attending swingin' Rydell High School. The way these character look, act and speak suggests Rydell is a 'special' school for those who are having trouble graduating. Best pals Stockard Channing (as Rizzo) and Jeff Conaway (as Kenickie) are a little brainier.'Grease' is a moronic adaptation of a stage hit set in the 1950s, made to sound like the 1970s.Considering the personnel involved in this picture, old-timers offer ironic 'rules' for the enclosed 'dance contest.' Eve Arden warns, 'Anyone doing tasteless or vulgar movements will be disqualified.' More importantly, Sid Caesar notes, 'All couples must be boy/girl.' So, art doesn't always imitate life. There are a lot of familiar faces; see who you recognize, and why. If you get bored, don't stop until you find the great 'video' located near the end of the film - the 'You're the One That I Want' duet performed by Newton-John and Travolta, driven by a pulsating bass line, is a terrifically sexy pop fire-starter from 1978.**** Grease (6/13/78) Randal Kleiser ~ John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing, Jeff Conaway",4,4,9,7 January 2011

The Color of Money," Paul Newman Racks One Up
","Older, wiser ex-pool hustler Paul Newman (as 'Fast' Eddie Felson) spots younger, dumber pool playing fanatic Tom Cruise (as Vincet Lauria). Mr. Newman sees in Mr. Cruise the same ability he once possessed. Newman thinks, however, Cruise is a 'flake'. He decides to teach Cruise the tricks of the pool-hustling trade, make lots of money, and bring him to the BIG pool playing tournament in Atlantic City. BUT, the ex-champ and protégée have problems, and split up. Newman gets a new pair of eyeglasses, and decides to re-enter the game. Who do you think he meets during the ending tournament? Most obvious strength is Newman's excellent portrayal; the entire film rests on his characterization, and his expertly delivers the goods. Newman either inspires, or allows everyone else to shine on their own; at least, that's what comes across on screen. Newman is a marvelous actor. Cruise wisely plays his part not as a younger version of Paul Newman, but as a unique, naive character, with similar pool table expertise. May Elizabeth Mastrantonio (as Carmen) has a choice role as Cruise's accompanying girlfriend. Watch for a great scene wherein Newman shows he understands women as well as he does pool.The movie doesn't seem very realistic, after the three get going. The barrooms and pool halls are surprisingly smoke-free. Perhaps, director Martin Scorsese was portending a 'smoking ban'. The soundtrack music is too good, in most instances; sadly, there are no cheap jukeboxes playing awful oldies. Warren Zevon's 'Werewolves of London' is an exception; it is a good song, and is used very well in the film. No balls jump off the table (or anywhere); it's a tight, professional picture.

American Psycho," Simply Irresistible
","Impossibly vain and hot-bodied Christian Bale (as Patrick Bateman) enjoys looking good, eating in fine Manhattan-area restaurants, and blondes coming in pairs. His yuppie world is shattered when cute colleague Jared Leto (as Paul Allen) shows off a better business card, and an ability to score Friday evening reservations at 'Dorsia'. So, meanwhile, or coincidently, Mr. Bale's homicidal tendencies veer out of control. Previously, Bale killed a random night-time pick-up; now a rampant blood-lusting 'American Psycho', Bale begins to kill almost anything that moves This bizarre satire on 1980s serial killers, musical tastes, and Reaganomics was based on a more gruesome (than even this 'Unrated Cut' film) novel by Bret Easton Ellis. The level of gore aside, director Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' is very different, in tone; and, that's entirely acceptable. It's stranger on film to see Bale getting away with so much mayhem - and his aim with a chainsaw is to die for - but, the film's flaw, in my opinion, is that the story 'twist' (the questionable reality concerning Bateman's crimes) is not possible according to what you see on screen.Mainly, this is due to very strong performances by a couple of women in the cast. It's impossible, for example, to consider pining secretary Chloe Sevigny (as Jean) operating in the protagonist's psyche solely - this is painfully obvious when she sits at his desk, and looks through his doodles. The 'point-of-view' is clearly off the mark. Prostitute Sara Seymour (as 'Christie') is another registering such a strong characterization. These lovely, vulnerable performances are too hip for the room. Others in the cast operate in the killer's world. Bale's lead is excellent.******* American Psycho (1/21/00) Mary Harron ~ Christian Bale, Chloe Sevigny, Sara Seymour, Guinevere Turner",7,0,1,3 January 2010
North by Northwest," Hitchcock Plays Tag
","After 'Vertigo', director Alfred Hitchcock turns up the comedy, and tones down the subtlety, for this one. 'North by Northwest' is also the summation of a favorite, most-used Hitchcock plot: an ordinary man is mistakenly identified, falsely accused, and pursued by mysterious forces. The famous 'crop-dusting sequence' is the peak of this story-theme, with wronged man Cary Grant (as Roger O Thornhill) helplessly attacked by an airplane in broad daylight as he waits at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere to meet a man who doesn't exist.The only logical way to follow-up this line of suspense was with 'The Birds'; therein, the attacker becomes the inhuman, thus more horrific, species of flying fowl. We innately know that, if birds were as big as crop-dusting airplanes, they would eat us. So, Mr. Grant is perhaps safer with a single plane than he would be against a flock of seagulls. The missing link in Hitchcock's chronological quartet is 'Psycho', which followed 'North by Northwest', and climaxes the director's psychologically-based terror themes. And, at long last, sex is used like a fly-swatter.The marvelously funny script, by Ernest Lehman, received most of the attention, when it was time to give out 1959 movie awards. Hitchcock's direction, Bernard Herrmann's musical score and George Tomasini's editing couldn't be beat - but, they were. A trio of supporting players might have be noticed: Eva Marie Saint (as Eve Kendall), Martin Landau (as Leonard), and James Mason (as Phillip Vandamm) seethe with forbidden sex. Listen up for Mr. Landau's scene-stealing 'Call it my woman's intuition' line; and, watch for Ms. Saint to seductively mouth 'I never make love on an empty stomach.'

There are strong supporting performances from Tom Courtenay (as Pasha Strelnikov), Rod Steiger (as Viktor Komarovsky), and Geraldine Chaplin (as Tonya Gromeko). Director David Lean's 'Doctor Zhivago' is long and confusing - it begins with scenes which, hours later, are revealed to be from both the future and the past; then, the story becomes linear.

Everyone who's anyone has a personal robot. Not to worry, our mechanical friends follow robot rules; they are programmed to be helpful only, follow orders, and would never harm a human being. One person in this scenario is 'robo-phobic' - perfectly proportioned policeman Will Smith (as Del 'Spoon' Spooner). Mr. Smith does not trust society's robot helpers...Smith is suspicious when his robot designer pal (huh?) James Cromwell (as Alfred Lansing) is found splattered on the sidewalk outside of his skyscraper office. The incident is reported to be a suicide, but Smith suspects one of Mr. Cromwell's personal robots, blue-eyed Alan Tudyk (as Sonny), is responsible. Smith goes against robotics psychiatrist Bridget Moynahan (as Susan Calvin), corporate robot provider Bruce Greenwood (as Lawrence Robertson), and police chief Chi McBride (as John Bergin), among others...Smith is pumped to perfection, spits blood, and possesses incredible super-strength. Ironically, there is no sex in 'I, Robot' with Smith only mentioning he wouldn't bed Mr. Greenwood for all the money in the world. A hat is tipped to Harold Lloyd, apparently resurgent in popularity, and cussing streetwise Shia LaBeouf (as Farber) tips his hat to the younger generation...Science fiction robot writers Otto Binder and Isaac Asimov, the later acknowledged herein, effectively used the subtexts prejudice and fear of technology in their thought-provoking stories. Both themes are present in this update; arguably and unfortunately, they are perversely celebrated. Also note the traumatic event from super-human Smith's past does not support his instincts at all; rather, it supports the robot acts without emotion.

","Abby Mann re-documents his stunning 1959 'Playhouse 90' teleplay for director Stanley Kramer, with Maximilian Schell towering over a magnificent ensemble cast. The focus isn't on Nazi atrocities (though they are here, in horrific images). But, this being a trial drama, 'Judgment at Nuremberg' attempts to answer questions about humanity, beginning with HOW? 'How could this have happened?' And, while only four mid-level Nazis receive justice, the film makes you wonder Where does punishment for the Holocaust end? And, if you do not stop, don't you become the enemy? That wanders, of course, into subjective interpretation; and, there are certainly others. This only makes an already strong piece of work more relevant. Criticisms about it being fictionalized and too long are curiously incongruent. Fewer people would sit through the real trials. The actors seem to employ demons (two, nakedly) to give electrifying, all-time greatest performances. The film is repellent and manipulative, but necessarily so.

Taking advice from handler Zeppo Marx (as Bob Roland), 'Firefly' leads the four Marx Brothers to an all-out war.When 'Duck Soup' failed to stir up the box office to the levels expected, Paramount and the Marx Brothers parted company. But, there were other reasons for this relative failure. Today, 'Duck Soup' is unmistakably Marxist, but at the time, it then bent the structure from what audiences expected. This was neither the staged antics of 'Animal Crackers' nor its cinematic relative 'Horse Feathers' (1932). The scaffolding of Marx Brothers, which could be seen coming, was now fairly obvious: Groucho was most important, Harpo and Chico were next, with the underrated and underutilized Zeppo downgraded to insignificant.Why not a duck? Perhaps, the biggest reason 'Duck Soup' lost viewers may have been its satirical stance on war. At the time of release, its particular anti-war satire was a touch subversive, and not well-received. Over the years, however, this film became most critics' favorite. See it, but don't think you've seen all there is to see of The Marx Brothers herein. 'Duck Soup' was brilliantly conceived with help from director Leo McCarey with writers Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It was (arguably) their third film peak, and the end of an era. After some time without a contract, an abbreviated and revised act returned to form at MGM.********** Duck Soup (11/17/33) Leo McCarey ~ Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx",10,1,3,3 January 2011
The Patriot," The Last Refuge of a Scoundrel
","In 1776, South Carolina widower Mel Gibson (as Benjamin Martin) is reluctant to join in the War of Independence from England, preferring to settle differences through talks with King George. 'I will not fight,' Mr. Gibson declares. This disappoints several of Gibson's seven good-looking children, especially headstrong Heath Ledger (as Gabriel), who signs up to fight against his father's wishes. Next eldest Gregory Smith (as Thomas) must wait until he's seventeen. But, when the British attack Gibson's plantation, even youngsters Trevor Morgan (as Nathan) and Bryan Chafin (as Samuel) show how to 'Aim small, miss small.' Gibson organizes a Christian militia, and helps win the Revolution for the United States of America.Let's accept the British are evil, and the French are tolerated. Gibson's 'Negros' are freed slaves, but content to stay on with Gibson's nice family. The violence includes Gibson coating himself in the blood of a hacked-up victim. Fine. Realistic. Gibson's character realizes that pacifism is not a workable ideology, and wins the debate. Move along. The woman Mr. Ledger falls in love with, Lisa Brenner (as Anne Howard), gives a patriotic speech in church, and he is smitten. They 'write' and exchange toothy smiles to suggest lovemaking. People observe the 'no smoking' sign, wash their mouths out with soap, and blow someone's head off. 'The Patriot' is a cardboard story, a cartoon-like tale... with beautiful cinematography.***** The Patriot (6/27/00) Roland Emmerich ~ Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Jason Isaacs, Joely Richardson",5,18,36,25 April 2010
Van Helsing," Fangs You Vociferously
","The infamous blood-sucker from Transylvania (Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula) has sent up Frankenstein's laboratory in his castle, where he hopes to use the maestro's life-giving expertise to animate his vampire offspring. Since these babies are birthed by Dracula's three vampire brides, they are understandably born dead. For several reasons, this makes God unhappy. The Almighty arranges for vigilante vampire hunter Hugh Jackman (as Gabriel Van Helsing) to stop the supernatural meddling. Helping Mr. Jackson are Dracula's descendants, beautiful Kate Beckinsale (as Anna Valerious) and werewolf brother Will Kemp (as Velkan).Stephen Sommers' story isn't bad, but the execution drowns it to death. We begin with a black-and-white sequence, which looks more like they turned off the color than attempted to do a creative homage. As the star, Mr. Jackson wears the film's worst hairpiece, hat, and costume - he should have had a talk with somebody. Others are much, much better, with Ms. Beckinsale looking sexy throughout. The fine visual effects (supervised by Ben Snow and Scott Squires) and animation (Daniel Jeannette) are not flattered by a bombastic and overindulgent pace.

Spider-Man," Along Came a Spider
","Not as good as the best 'Superman' and 'Batman' movies, but better than the worst. 'Spider-Man' has one of the best origin stories in comics; and, much of it hits the big screen intact. What makes the story of downtrodden young Peter Parker's transformation into the extraordinary 'Spider-Man' so memorable it's the fateful decision he makes NOT to use his new powers to stop a criminal, early in his career. Later, he learns 'with great power comes great responsibility.' The impact of this powerful lesson in heroism is a little diluted by the addition of the 'Green Goblin', and other alterations, into the preliminaries. It's still a powerful story.The film's main weakness is it's descent into near cartoon state for much of the 'Spider-Man' and 'Green Goblin' action. After Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker aka Spider-Man) and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin) successfully bring their characters to life, they are 're-animated'; however exciting, the special effects dehumanize the characters. The 'Green Goblin' story is not as effectively told as in the comics; but, the arch enemy father (Mr. Dafoe) and best friend son James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are well cast.Director Sam Raimi works some marvels. Nice to hear Spider-Man say the magic word, 'Shazam!' and hear Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May) tell him, 'You're not Superman, you know.' Nice to see Cliff Robertson (as Uncle Ben). And, leading woman Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane 'M.J.' Watson) is very sexy wet.******* Spider-Man (2002) Sam Raimi ~ Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst",7,0,0,6 December 2008
Jarhead," Every War Is Different, Every War Is the Same
","Excellently described, on the DVD sleeve: ''Jarhead' (the self-imposed moniker of the Marines) follows Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal) from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, where he sports a sniper rifle through Middle East deserts that provide no cover from the heat or Iraqi soldiers. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully grasp.' Sam Mendes' 'Jarhead' very effectively captures the Humor, Fear, and Waiting of War - in this case, George H. Bush's 1991 'Desert Storm' to retrieve Kuwait from Iraq. Certainly, it helped to have adapted the story from participating Marine Anthony Swofford, who was 'young and stupid' enough to have 'got lost on his way to college,' and volunteered. Of course, neither 'Swoff' nor his brothers are really 'stupid'. The Marines may not possess knowledge about every subject under the desert sun, but they are human; and, they are treated with dignity and respect in this film.Mr. Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard (as Troy), Lucas Black (as Kruger), Brian Geraghty (as Fergus), Jacob Vargas (as Cortez), Laz Alonso (as Escobar), Evan Jones (as Fowler), and Iván Fenyö (as Pinko) are a terrific Unit. Jamie Foxx (as Sykes) is a perfect Lifer. Keep an eye on Mr. Sarsgaard 'Troy' characterization, for a 'Best Supporting Actor' caliber performance. Mr. Jones' 'Fowler' is also letter-perfect. And, Roger Deakins' photography is spectacular.One mistake the film makes is NOT developing some characters fully. Mr. Geraghty's 'Fergus' and Mr. Fenyö's 'Pinko' absolutely need more minutes on screen, considering their roles; and, the direction is good enough to warrant a longer running time. A 'Director's Cut', or reading of the book, is necessary. The film doesn't just leave you wanting more, it needs more.Semper Fi, Mr. Swofford!******** Jarhead (11/4/05) Sam Mendes ~ Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Fox, Evan Jones",8,1,1,4 January 2009

","This one's exactly as the DVD sleeve description says, dedicated assassin 'Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a cool, calculating contract killer at the top of his game. Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cabbie with big dreams and little to show for it. Now, Max has to transport Vincent on his next job - one night, five stops, five hits and a getaway. And after this fateful night, neither man will ever be the same again. Tonight everything is changing' You quickly get used to the change in hair dye.The fact that some awards givers, including members of the 'Golden Globes' and 'Academy Awards' organizations, considered Mr. Foxx as the year's 'Best Supporting Actor' really calls their legitimacy and reputation into question. You've got to wonder if these people are even watching the movies. Foxx an above-the-title STAR of the film; for anyone napping during the running time, it's confirmed during the end credits. By the way, how could you nap during this film? DreamWorks produces writer Stuart Beattie's plot in delirious style. 'Collateral' is a visual treat, thanks to director Michael Mann plus cinematographers Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron. The James Newton Howard music is perfect. These filmmakers make Los Angeles a sprawling, empty vessel in which to pour Mr. Beattie's moody psychological character clash.

The Machinist," Lighter Guilt
","During the opening minutes, emaciated factory worker Christian Bale (as Trevor Reznik) apparently disposes of a lifeless body. In his apartment, Mr. Bale washes up with bleach. We assume Bale had something to do with a foul deed, but there is no forthcoming investigation. Later, this opening act is revealed to be a flashback. Bale enjoys eating chicken and pie, but seems to also be on a weight-loss binge. He claims to have been awake for a year – perhaps this has caused his weight loss. At work, Bale becomes involved in a gruesome machine accident. He appears to have been distracted by newly hired machinist John Sharian (as Ivan), but none of Bale's co-workers have seen the heavyset man. For someone apparently near death from lack of sleep and food, Bale appears remarkably functional. He dates golden-hearted prostitute Jennifer Jason Leigh (as Stevie) and attractive airport waitress Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (as Marie)...With fine work from writer Scott Kosar and director Brad Anderson, 'The Machinist' is intellectually engaging. A mostly Spanish crew assists Bale and Mr. Anderson skillfully. It's possible you may figure out much of what is going on; still, it is interesting to find the many patterns in story-telling, both real and imagined. There is a clear thesis and ending for those who appreciate clarity, but food for thought if you want to consider other possibilities. The obviously influential writer Dostoyevsky would approve. Unfortunately, the first and most obvious talking point is likely to be Bale's shockingly low weight – he overplays the physicality of the role needlessly; his acting ability is certainly worth 10-20 pounds. Other notable strengths include stellar photography by Xavi Gimenez, moody music by Roque Banos, and the always foreboding Michael Ironside (as Miller). Remarkably, Mr. Ironside has not been told to stay away from sharp objects.******** The Machinist (1/18/04) Brad Anderson ~ Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh, John Sharian, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon",8,0,0,21 February 2014

","After giving his rude, overweight aunt her just deserts, teenager Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is off for another year at 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry' with fellow magic-makers Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger). You can be sure the trio won't be bored. First out of the gate is dastardly Gary Oldman (as Sirius Black), who was somehow involved in the murder of Mr. Radcliffe's parents. 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' referred to in the title, Mr. Oldman looks out for blood. This puts everyone at 'Hogwarts' in grave danger...A change in direction, literally, to director Alfonso Cuaron, helps gives this third 'Harry Potter' film a moodier, darker style; and, it is the perfect accompaniment to the three leading players' rapidly approaching adulthood. Up until about the time the students unconvincingly mouth animal noises, everything runs smoothly. But, even when it's silly, or wanders away from the original text, the story is marvelous. The players are more endearing than ever, even Tom Felton (as Draco Malfoy).

","Beautiful teenager Ryan Phillippe (as Shane O'Shea) is tired of cruising New Jersey with his plain boyfriends, and aches to go to Manhattan's famous 'Studio 54' disco. There, he hopes to meet his idol, soap opera star Neve Campbell (as Julie Black). Taking off his shirt for '54' manager Mike Myers (as Steve Rubell) helps Mr. Phillippe gain admittance to the club. Working in his gym shorts gets Phillippe invited to hobnob with celebrities like Princess Grace and Andy Warhol. Eventually, Phillippe gains celebrity status. He models for magazines and gets 'the clap'. Will the world of sex, drugs, and disco get Phillippe down? Probably, you won't care, because there is so little depth to this film. Phillippe is very attractive, but the character is limp. Ms. Campbell is seen little, and adds the same. The second tier coupling of busboy Breckin Meyer (as Greg) and singer Salma Hayek (as Anita) adds some sexual energy. Mr. Myers is wasted. You may get a kick out of drug-snorting grandma Ellen Albertini Dow (as 'Dottie' aka 'Mona'). And, Heather Matarazzo (as Grace) does well as Phillippe's sister. Reportedly censored, Mark Christopher's '54' holds back far too much.

Saw III," Disjointed Jigsaw
","If it's been awhile, you need to review the events of 'Saw II' (2005) before starting on this one. This will help explain the prologue, which is really only a tidying up of a teased sequel starring Donnie Wahlberg (as Eric Matthews) that does not really happen here. Next, 'Jigsaw has disappeared.

We begin with a series of violent torture sequences that seem to have no connection. The do become connected, but after you care. As usual for the series, the gore is (or should be considered) X-rated. The story would have worked better if one suspenseful story strand had framed the film and provided a foundation, with the rest providing pieces to the overall puzzle.

Pearl Harbor," I Think World War II Just Started
","Michael Bay's 'Pearl Harbor' is terrific, explosive, exciting, and technically well-made. John Schwartzman's photography, and the film's effects, are outstanding; and, many of the supporting performances would have been exceptional, in a better story. Unfortunately, this film is far too long, and focuses on a the lamest possible retelling of the eternal 'love triangle' during a war setting.The film's length is not justifiable. First of all, the Japanese segments are pointless; since there is no attempt to portray them accurately, or with substance, they should have remained in the shadows. Secondly, the underused supporting cast's stories are even not worthy of inclusion. For example, Cuba Gooding Jr. appears to receive a medal, due to his race, apparently. And, Jon Voight appears to do his Franklin D. Roosevelt impression. But, Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler appear as themselves. So, wasn't the real Roosevelt good enough?Ben Affleck (as Rafe McCawley), Josh Hartnett (as Danny Walker), and Kate Beckinsale (as Evelyn Johnson) make up the starring threesome; and, they are earnest and attractive, playing out the storyline like they were acting in an old movie. Still, there really isn't anything to this trio; compare them, for starters, with the extraordinary characterizations in the silent 'Wings' (1927). Then, see 'From Here to Eternity' (1953). Either of those film's stories would have been preferable to this non-smoking 'Pearl Harbor'.

No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly.

They will have to save the world from whatever the aliens have up their sleeves, or whatever they're wearing on this visit...Our heroes are: youthful President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), computer technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), drunken crop-duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) and cocky pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith). All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing.

The Butterfly Effect," Come Back When You Grow Up
","This review recommends you watch the 'directors' cut' before sampling the 'theatrical version' of 'The Butterfly Effect'. Also, it will also enhance the film's effect if you refrain from reading the comments, good and bad, until after viewing; I was more intrigued by the storyline because I wasn't completely sure where the psychology and physics were going to wind up. The writer/director team of Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber kept me guessing as I did not read any comments, or even the DVD sleeve's synopsis. Bress and Gruber weave an extremely intricate, thought out, well paced, and imaginative drama.The protagonist is unstuck young 'Evan Treborn' (played by Ashton Kutcher, John Patrick Amedori, and Logan Lerman). The film traces the lives of Evan and three childhood friends: 'Kayleigh' (Amy Smart, Irene Gorovaia, and Sarah Widdows), 'Tommy' (William Lee Scott, Jesse James, and Cameron Bright), and 'Lenny' (Elden Henson, Kevin Schmidt, and Jake Kaese). Kayleigh and Tommy's abusive father (Eric Stoltz), and Evan's loving mother (Melora Walters) are the main parental figures. To say the cast exceeds expectations would be an understatement. The overall effect left by the interrelating performances is remarkable, and rarely achieves at the level evident. This is also a technically beautiful film.Be prepared. The character 'George Miller' is a pedophile, who has obviously abused his children (off screen). 'Mr. Miller' invites young Evan and his daughter to get undressed for his camera; it is a non-erotic, tastefully filmed scene. But, the violence, especially between the young children, is disturbing to the extreme; certainly, it shows the most devastating effects of child abuse. In the case of 'The Butterfly Effect', artistic license trumps irreparable damages. 'I'll come back for you' indeed. ******** The Butterfly Effect (2004) Eric Bress, J.

Clifton Collins Jr. (as Miter) should have been considered for a 'Supporting Actor' award, but, really, everyone is good. The film's main problem is the shaky, hand-held camera, which is sometimes so bad it may make you dizzy. This is intentional, and a favorite way to make films more 'realistic' (like a documentary). As for the story, the 'Vietnam angst' doesn't get any better than watching Michael Vincent's face as he gets his haircut in 'Tribes' (1970) - but 'Tigerland' has more sex, swearing, and skivvies.

Saving Private Ryan," Steven Spielberg salutes the Veterans of World War II
","'Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage,' according to the film's official synopsis.Once again, the Steven Spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain, and deliver a terrific motion picture. This time, it's a heart-tugging pro-war (significantly, pro-World War II) epic of astonishing power. Initially, 'Saving Private Ryan' impresses with its violent depiction of the Allies' D-Day landing, on the shores of German-occupied France. With waves of blood, Mr. Spielberg shows the human cost of defeating Fascism - by what TV anchorman Tom Brokaw called 'The Greatest Generation'; although, honestly, every generation has its greatest, this is a fitting term.Captain Hanks and his squad - Edward Burns (as Reiben), Jeremy Davies (as Upham), Vin Diesel (as Caparzo), Adam Goldberg (as Mellish), Barry Pepper (as Jackson), Giovanni Ribisi (as Wade), and Tom Sizemore (as Horvath) - are among the few to survive the invasion; and, are ordered to save Mr. Damon's 'Ryan' (for the reasons given above). During quieter times, the personalities of the men emerge, with Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat creatively painting human portraits. The silhouette of the 'war mother' dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the film's most simple, and effective, portraits; it supports the film's prime directive.Hanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem. Spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them; and, their strongly-directed, natural performances help make it work. The film's main message is delivered by schoolteacher Hanks' 'Miller' in his final words to student Damon's 'Ryan'; listen for them. And, don't miss the secondary message, told by Mr. Davies' multilingual 'Upham' character; especially, watch how he pleads with Hanks to set a German hostage free, and note the consequences of their action.It's tough to rank performances in an 'ensemble acting' film (they're all stellar), but, for literary greatness, you've got to add Mr. Ribisi's doctor 'Wade' to most memorable list. He tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room; note, eventually, Ribisi goes home to 'Mama'. Also interesting is how Mr. Sizemore's 'Horvath' serves as the 'voice' of Spielberg/Rodat, exalting and purifying Hanks' character. He says both the film's title and tag-line ('Except this time, the mission is a man').Spielberg's use of 'flashback' is one of the best you'll ever see; and, he definitively defines the term 'gut-wrenching decision.' ********** Saving Private Ryan (7/24/98) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Hanks, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi",10,6,11,13 July 2009

Based on the inspiring true story of three men - a jockey, a trainer and a businessman - and the undersized racehorse who took the entire nation on the ride of a lifetime. This breathtaking film achievement is,' according to the DVD sleeve, a film you must see. Well, you probably could live and breathe without seeing 'Seabiscuit', but everything they said about the film is true.The film was nominated for seven 'Academy Awards', but won none; it was a very competitive year. Director Gary Ross' adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's classic story, John Schwartzman's cinematography, and the film's sound are especially noteworthy. The cast is universally impressive, with Mr. Maguire, Mr. Bridges, and Mr. Cooper deserving a triple crown. The 'look' of the film - costumes and sets - is perfect; but, as is often the case, everything is so well taken care of, it tends to have an opposite, inauthentic effect. So, don't look for any stained hats, or cigarette-burned lampshades.The story beautifully captures the 'American Dream', from the obvious symbolism connecting 'Seabiscuit' to the rebirth of the United States under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to the thinnest of subtleties discernible in the characters' relationships. Mr. Ross knows when to fill in the blanks, and when to let you read between the lines. Prepare to be clichéd and sidetracked. It's all there. A son who is aimed for the moon dies in an automobile wreck, and is reborn on a horse. The struggle was real. The lame horse, crippled jockey, paraplegic president, and back-broken country came together, and beat the odds.******** Seabiscuit (7/22/03) Gary Ross ~ Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Gary Stevens",8,1,3,18 October 2009
28 Days Later...," Men Are Beasts
","In the prologue, a team of animal rights protesters enter a laboratory to free some caged chimpanzees, which seem to be the subject of unfortunate experiments. At first, the cute creatures are caged animals yearning to be free. But we quickly see the chimps are diseased with 'Rage!' They bite the hand that frees them. Apocalypse ensues '28 Days Later' our protagonist Cillian Murphy (as Jim) awakes completely naked in a hospital bed. Maybe Mr. Murphy was getting ready for a bath. He gets dressed and director Danny Boyle's cameras follow him through a ravaged and deserted London. Murphy first meets a crazy priest. But his more important encounter is with super-bad Naomie Harris (as Selena). She's very cool...The home video sleeve exclaims, 'Hailed as the most frightening film since 'The Exorcist', acclaimed director Danny Boyle's groundbreaking (changed to 'visionary' for re-releases) take on zombie horror 'isn't just scary...it's absolutely terrifying' (Access Hollywood).' This is a good movie, but it's certainly not up to the lofty reviews being referenced. In fact, this has all been done before, and several times better. Perhaps most noteworthy is the comparison of cannibalistic zombies with a group of men found to be infected with lust for women, during a long period without female companionship. Probably, the film is drawing parallels. There could also be some political observation being made in the opening trigger, or not ****** 28 Days Later...

As each warrior battles for justice, they come face to face with their worst enemy - and the inescapable enduring power of love.'Set against 19th-century China's breathtaking landscape, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is the action-packed box office smash from acclaimed director Ang Lee, featuring stunning martial arts choreography by Yuen Wo Ping,' according to the DVD sleeve description. Others at their peak are cinematographer Peter Pau and composer Tan Dun. The 'Crouching Tiger' team received dozens of awards for their work.The main distraction is the lack of any explanation for why some of the characters are able to glide into flight. Everything else can be pardoned by the sheer beauty of what Mr. Lee and his team have accomplished.

Peaceful Warrior," Up on the Roof with Victor Salva
","Handsome gymnast Scott Mechlowicz (as Dan Millman) is called 'The Lord of the Rings' and seems destined for Olympic gold. Naturally (this being an inspirational story), he is sideswiped by a tragic accident. Although Mr. Mechlowicz is told he'll be lucky to walk again, he eventually wants to resume his athletic career, at UC Berkeley. A sagely supernatural older man, Nick Nolte (as Socrates), helps guide young Mechlowicz to greater understanding, and pretty Amy Smart (as Joy) provides some feminine balance. Paul Wesley (as Trevor) and Ashton Holmes (as Tommy) fill in the jock buddy roles.'Inspired by true events,' from the real Millman's autobiographical 'Way of the Peaceful Warrior' (1980), this film version isn't fully convincing. Not to fault Mr. Nolte's performance, but his pontifications become more irritating than inspirational. And, we're never really clued in about where the otherworldly character comes from (certainly not a Texaco service station) - perhaps, 'Soc' and 'Joy' come from somewhere between Millman's id and ego. Yet, Mechlowicz contributes a strong lead, and the Victor Salva direction is a strength; a high point occurs when Mr. Salva puts Mechlowicz out on a ledge.******* Peaceful Warrior (6/2/06) Victor Salva ~ Scott Mechlowicz, Nick Nolte, Amy Smart, Tim DeKay",7,0,1,1 February 2010

Obsessed by the countless similarities between the degenerate main character and himself, Walter plunges headlong into the same dark, seductive world. When the book's main character commits an unspeakable act, Walter is terrified that he's destined to follow the same twisted path,' according to the film's official synopsis.'Pink has four letters,' the suicide blonde tells Mr. Carrey. 'I don't get it,' he responds. Me neither. Not a bad idea, but not at all convincing. Please don't make 'The Number 24'. Now, if you take the letter 'C' in Collins (Lynn, who plays the blonde), and add it to the letter 'T' in the main character Laura Tollins' last name, you get 23!

Velvet Goldmine," The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys
","'Velvet Goldmine' wisely makes itself difficult to pin down; to escape criticism, it self-inoculates. It's good to defy description, but let's try. The film is a depiction of the 1970s rock fad alternately known as 'glam' or 'glitter' rock. The New York Dolls (herein, quaintly represented by 'Personality Crisis') were early proponents, but the Queen of the movement became David Bowie. This film's main player is Jonathan Rhys Meyers (as Brian Slade). He impersonates the Bowie-type role well, but the character is elusive and difficult to understand. And, what we have here is a conglomerate...'Velvet Goldmine' is a Bowie tune. In a way, he did turn Lou Reed's 'Velvet Underground' into a Goldmine. The plot structure follows Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' (1941). Former glam-fan and present day reporter Christian Bale (as Arthur Stuart) assumes the storytelling role. He searches for Mr. Meyers, who vanished when disappointed fans learned his death was faked. Think about that for a moment and you'd vanish, too. Meyers is washed-up and somewhat slightly dazed. In the flashback scenes, Mr. Bale looks more amusing than authentic. Toni Collette (as Mandy) does well...The other major player is Ewan McGregor (as Curt Wild). He's mostly Iggy Pop, but Mr. McGregor looks more like Kurt Cobain. This is probably a good thing, considering. McGregor does look better after taking off all his clothes, and he doesn't excrete anything on the audience. So much for realism. All of this is the brainchild of writer-director Todd Haynes, who nicely acknowledges glam grand-daddy Little Richard. Oscar Wilde also receives special attention. Everything in 'Velvet Goldmine' looks nice but adds nothing bigger than the fact that Mr. Haynes is an excellent filmmaker.******* Velvet Goldmine (5/21/98) Todd Haynes ~ Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale, Toni Collette",7,0,1,7 August 2013

","'The Fellowship has broken, but the quest to destroy the 'One Ring' continues. Frodo and Sam must entrust their lives to Gollum if they are to find their way to Mordor. As Saruman's army approaches, the surviving members of The Fellowship, along with people and creatures from Middle-earth, prepare for battle. 'The War of the Ring' has begun,' according to the DVD sleeve description, the film was 'Nominated for six 'Academy Awards' including 'Best Picture'.' 'The Two Towers' begins with a reprise of one of the first film's worthiest recreations of Tolkien text, beloved Gandalf falling to his apparent death; then, the film outdoes its predecessor again, and again, and again. The scene-stealing creature 'Gollum' (superbly voiced by Andy Serkis) is an especially well-realized highlight. It was this chapter being so successfully received that insured 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy could be considered a classic.This installment is as well-produced as 'The Fellowship of the Ring' (the three films were shot together); but, with story, pacing, and characterizations much more suited to epic cinema. Peter Jackson's direction is most outstanding, the use of Howard Shore's music is much improved, and Michael Horton is a welcome addition to the editing team. Even the alterations of J.R.R.

School of Rock," The Kids Are Alright
","Thrown out of the heavy-metal group he formed, chubby guitarist Jack Black (as Dewey Finn) finds his dreams of rock stardom further shattered when former band-mate Mike White (as Ned Schneebly) and shrewish live-in Sarah Silverman (as Patty DiMarco) threaten to throw him out for lacking rent money. Unsuccessful in rock, Mr. Black gets a job as a long-term sub for a classroom of ten-year-olds. With no teaching experience, Black teaches the kids the history of classic rock. For a class project, they form a group called 'School of Rock' and take a field trip to the 'battle of the bands' contest Black wanted to enter...Aimed at a pre-teen audience and led by a star you might not trust to be kid-friendly, 'The School of Rock' is a nice surprise. The language and sexual situations are post-TV's 'Bart Simpson', which is tame for movies. For parents keeping track, the expletives range from 'hell' to 'ass' with only a hint of stronger stuff. Script by Mr. White is fun, with his and the other adults guided very well by director Richard Linklater. The students are surely professional musicians, but they all ring true as inexperienced actors; the combination works beautifully. There is little evidence of mugging, method or sickening sweetness...The main focus is on Black's young front-men; possibly punk Kevin Clark (as Freddy Jones) takes the drums like AC/DC, lead guitarist Joey Gaydos (as Zack Mooneyham) picks up Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water' easily, and shy keyboardist Robert Tsai (as Lawrence) grasps The Doors' 'Touch Me' quickly. Female bass player Rebecca Brown (as Katie) has less to do. Most obvious stereotype is overweight Maryam Hassan (as Tomika), who naturally belts out Aretha Franklin's 'Chain of Fools' on cue. Least obvious may be presumably gay 'stylist' Brian Falduto (as Billy). As in class plays, many students must play trees...Though not taking center stage, tightly-wound principal Joan Cusack (as Rosalie 'Ros' Mullins) and budding band manager Miranda Cosgrove (as Summer Hathaway) contribute great support. White offers keen 'between the lines' observations about the importance of a toned chest in the post-MTV generation; nothing revelatory, but it's presented in a very appealing package. The ending would have been better if Black had declined taking the microphone, and allowed one of the kids to take the lead. He should also consider substitute teaching when the acting gigs dry up. Children of all ages should appreciate the soundtrack.******* The School of Rock (9/9/03) Richard Linklater ~ Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Mike White, Miranda Cosgrove",7,0,3,9 September 2012

","This is a color-drenched, frantically directed, near-operatic song and dance fest laced with special effects. The plot is thoroughly trounced in the trappings, but it involves handsome songwriter Ewan McGregor (as Christian) falling in love with leggy Nicole Kidman (as Satine), a 'Cabaret' singer with a 'Camille' complex. Yes, Ms. Kidman mixes up Liza Minnelli with Greta Garbo. It's set in Paris at the turn of the century (1899/1900), but the soundtrack finds most of its songs in the second half of the 1900s.The justification for the inclusion of 'future' songs may be found in the lyric 'songs they have sung for a thousand years' from 'The Sound of Music'. 'Nature Boy' is the most important tune, making Mr. McGregor's 'enchanted' character believable. The Beatles' publishing companies were only mildly forthcoming, but Madonna was generous. Elton John's 'Your Song' is also featured prominently. And, McGregor sings it well. The extravagant DVD package smells nice. But, the film's taste is strictly acquired.***** Moulin Rouge!

In exchange for extra time, Bill agrees to serve as Joe's earthly guide. But, will he regret his choice when Joe unexpectedly falls in love with Bill's beautiful daughter Susan (Claire Forlani)?' The picturesque Pitt (and Mr. Hopkins) will please most aficionados; but, the movie is overindulgent. Jake Weber (as Drew), Marcia Gay Harden (as Allison), and Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince) give the production fireworks some much-needed balance, with fine second tier performances; possibly, Mr. Weber offers the film's best characterization. The scenes with Pitt confabbing with a Jamaican woman in the hospital should have been sent to deleted scenes heaven; the actress, Lois Kelly-Miller, could have played a doctor who recognized Pitt as an accident victim.****** Meet Joe Black (11/2/98) Martin Brest ~ Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani",6,1,3,30 May 2009

Patton," Great Scott!
","In his unforgettable opening statement, George C. Scott (as George S. Patton) stands in front of a giant US flag and asserts all 'real Americans' love war and the sting of battle. Americans not only want to 'shoot the enemy,' he declares, we also want to 'cut out their living guts' and use those guts to grease our tanks. According to Patton (via writer Francis Ford Coppola), the United States never lost a war and never will. They thought that in 1970. And, they were wrong. Although this film takes place during World War II, it feels like 1970. They include some newsreels, but there are too few 1940s pop culture references and everyone except Mr. Scott looks costumed...No matter what the setting of a film is intended to be, it will first tend to reflect the time in which it was made. Most films fail to convincingly transport their audiences. Styles and sounds popular in different eras often take viewers to the wrong place and time. This is the case with 'Patton'. The General's opening speech could be taken as a plea to remain steadfast and support US President Richard Nixon's war escalations in Southeast Asia. The US reluctantly took this advice, but lost the war. That being said, 'Patton' is a spectacular-looking production, and the riveting team of actor George C. Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner surpasses the misguided and protracted spectacle.******* Patton (2/4/70) Franklin J. Schaffner ~ George C. Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Bates, Edward Binns",7,1,1,4 March 2015

They, and a witness (who'll appear later) age gracefully for 28 years; then, the film's main incident occurs - protesters, supported by sniper fire, attack the in United States embassy in Yemen. With Mr. Jackson in command, the crowd of rioters is slaughtered. To avoid a bloody political mess, National Security Adviser Bruce Greenwood (as Bill Sokal) decides to scapegoat Jackson.Mr. Jones, who has become an ineffective military attorney, is asked to represent Jackson. Jones has also gone through a 'messy divorce' and has a 'drinking problem,' but Jackson feels he needs a 'warrior' in court. Jones goes up against prosecutor Guy Pearce (as Mark Biggs). Before the trial, Jackson also takes to drinking Anytime you have Jones and Jackson, directed by William Friedkin, you're starting off with something substantial. By the way, Mr. Greenwood hasn't been regarded as well, but should be; and, Mr. Pearce looks to be in their league.Although 'Rules of Engagement' is basically a good Jim Webb story, much of it is disappointing on film; put simply, it doesn't add up. The central incident starts off suggesting the protesters are rock-throwers; but, later, they are armed to the teeth. The drunken brawl between Jackson and Jones is downright dumb. The ending exchange between Jackson and Baoan Coleman (as Binh Le Cao) is a great moment; but, it isn't what the film was about.****** Rules of Engagement (3/31/00) William Friedkin ~ Samuel L.

Hutton may have been trying for satirical comedy with this one, but 'Kelly's Heroes' fails to thrive in its World War II setting. They should have set the story in (then) present-day Vietnam; the situation, that of a heist, hints at imperialism and flirts with anti-war sentiments. The most obviously inappropriate character is pseudo-hippie Donald Sutherland (as Oddball), but Don Rickles and others area also misplaced. The action consists of character actors shouting their lines amid explosions, to which Eastwood plays straight man. A sequence involving land mines, including a gun battle, is very skillfully done; momentarily, the film is lifted. It does get back to basics, those being loud character actors and fiery explosions.

Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood as 'Frankie' Goes to Hollywood with Swank and Rope Burns
","''I don't train girls,' trainer Frankie Dunn growls. But something's different about the spirited boxing hopeful who shows up daily at Dunn's gym. All she wants is a fighting chance. Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs, produces and composes music for this acclaimed, multi-award-winning tale of heart, hope and family. Hilary Swank plays resilient Maggie, determined not to abandon her one dream. And Morgan Freeman is Scrap, gym caretaker and counterpoint to Dunn's crustiness. Grab your dreams and come out swinging. 'Million Dollar Baby' is an absolute knockout.' Clint Eastwood Hits the Nail on the Head. I expected this film to be a 'feminist' version of the traditional male-dominated 'boxing movie'. It opens with a realistic depiction of the kind of physical damage boxing causes - so, I thought, are they going to show Q-Tips being shoved into the bloody, slit open face of movie star Hillary Swank? I thought not Although Ms. Swank does not suffer a wound like the one in the introduction, 'Million Dollar Baby' does not skirt this issue. The film is as realistic as they come. Swank is amazing, absolutely earning her many 'Best Actress' honors.'She grew up knowing one thing, she was trash.' Auteur Eastwood is even more incredible - as producer, director, star, and composer. He uses his years of film-making experience wisely, and does not let one role interfere with another. The goal of a superior film is achieved, with generosity rather than egotism in evidence. 'Million Dollar Baby' is, also, the crowning achievement of the 'Eastwood style'. The lighting is exquisite. The film is quiet when it should be quiet, and noisy when it should be NOISY. The harder-to-manage 'quietness' is expertly handled. The film is beautiful without being loud - it's starkly beautiful.Eastwood allows his audience to become a part of this movie.Morgan Freeman gives one of filmdom's all-time 'Best Supporting Actor' performances. His character's narration gives the film poetry. Narration is one of the easiest techniques to administer, but one of the hardest to muster convincingly; Mr. Freeman's is most convincing. And, Freeman's more subtle counterpoint story - his relationship with slow-witted Jay Baruchel (as Danger 'Flip' Barch) - gives the film hope. Mr. Baruchel might have won a 'Best Supporting the Best Supporting Actor' award (as of this writing, not introduced).'Boxing is about respect - getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy.' 'Million Dollar Baby' is about loving, non-sexual and non-familial relationships (count the number of sexually involved 'couples' in this film), and how very important these relationships are to our lives, and dreams. 'Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye,' Eastwood echoes Lloyd Price, 'Just because you left and said goodbye, do you think that I will sit and cry? Even if my heart should tell me so, darling I would rather let you go...' ********** Million Dollar Baby (2004) Clint Eastwood ~ Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Jay Baruchel",10,3,5,19 January 2009

When his personal and professional lives collide, Pistone jeopardizes his marriage, his job, his life, and, ultimately, the gangster mentor he has come to respect and admire,' according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. The film is 'based on a true story,' and begins its action in November 1978.The old 'lawman infiltrating the gangsters' storyline is really nothing new; but, Mike Newell's direction, and the great characterizations, are so good, you should become engrossed. Mr. Newell and writer Paul Attanasio focus on the relationship between young, upwardly mobile agent Depp and middle-aged Mafia middleman Pacino. Though there is, at least, one stomach churning (and vomit inducing) scene, 'Donnie Brasco' is mostly a character study.Depp is excellent as the young man who both poses as, and becomes 'Donnie Brasco'; you can see the 'Joe' character succumb to, and struggle against, possession by the 'Donnie' disguise. Pacino is also excellent; he struggles with his age, receding position in the 'family', and realization he may have made the mistake of his life (in trusting Depp).The relationship between Depp and Pacino is, perhaps, a little too vague. In my opinion, Depp sees Pacino's 'Lefty' as a life he may have had, if luck and life had been different; and, Pacino sees Depp's 'Donnie' as the failed promise of his lost youth. Depp and Pacino are award-worthy; and, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are supporting standouts. Ms. Heche's role, as Depp's increasingly neglected wife, is especially important.

Eminem wants to be a Big Rap Star. He lives with trailer park trashy mother Kim Basinger (as Stephanie) and lil' blonde sista Chloe Greenfield (as Lily). Ms. Basinger gets to say the line, 'Greg won't go down on me.' Word way up...Curiously, Eminem does not sport his familiar (at the time) short, bleached do; instead, he wears a knit hat over more natural brown locks. Eminem doesn't contribute any rent money, but he works hard. He is careful to avoid drugs, unlike boozy mother Basinger. Who knew Detroit's '8 Mile' was so drug free? The soundtrack highlights are 'Lose Yourself' and a fun rap-up of Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Sweet Home Alabama', which comes off better here than on 'youtube'. Still, Eminem's pre-Hollywood studio work is much more highly recommended than this semi-autobiographical movie sanitization.*** 8 Mile (2002) Curtis Hanson ~ Eminem, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy",3,2,5,9 November 2008
Saw II," The Rebirth of Sick
","Twisted serial killer Tobin Bell (as John 'Jigsaw' Kramer) is back, from the first 'Saw' (1904), and he's out for more blood. Last time, as you recall, Mr. Bell trapped two men in a bathroom, with leg-irons and 'Saw'. This time, he's locked a bunch of people in a dirty house. To make it WORSE than the first movie, the house seems to have NO bathroom at all. What happens if you have to go? There is a way for the characters to get to the bathroom from the original film (but I'd rather go in my pants). Anyway, 'Jigsaw' is also releasing a deadly gas in the sealed-up house; it makes the trapped cast cough up blood, and wear dark eye makeup...'Saw II' is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman with continuity assist from co-writer Leigh Whannell. It is a great thriller - and, more importantly as this is obviously now a film series - an excellent sequel. They do just about everything you need to do to build a successful franchise. The neatly constructed plot weaves Shawnee Smith (as Amanda) from the first film with corrupt cop Donnie Wahlberg (as Eric Matthews); his estranged son, curly-haired Erik Knudsen (as Daniel), is among the unsavory types trapped in Jigsaw's puzzle. The cast is wholly entertaining. And, the DVD comes with a cool bonus, the 'Saw: Rebirth' comic book.******** Saw II (10/28/05) Darren Lynn Bousman ~ Donnie Wahlberg, Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Erik Knudsen",8,1,2,2 May 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," Road Kill with Clooney and Tarantino
","Texas thief George Clooney (as Seth Gecko) teams up with kinky, demented brother Quentin Tarantino (as Richard Gecko) for a serial killing blood-fest; then, the two high-tail it to Mexico. They are driven there by ex-minister hostage Harvey Keitel (as Jacob Fuller) and his underage children, Juliette Lewis (as Kate) and Ernest Liu (as Scott). Hard-drinking Mr. Clooney thinks Mr. Keitel and Mr. Liu are 'fags' because Liu is Asian. Horny Mr. Tarantino imagines Ms. Lewis wants him to eat her. Eventually, the bonded quintet wind up in an orgy at the 'Titty Twister', a vampire-infested Mexican nightclub conveniently 'Open Dusk Till Dawn'...This film makes a very uncomfortable change in direction; it should have either stuck to the serial-killing brothers, or introduced the 'undead' theme earlier. It doesn't always hit the mark, but director Robert Rodriguez and writer/co-star Tarantino inject some humor into the story. The way TV newscaster Kelly Preston reports the serial brothers' body count is fine satire. And, Clooney is like Cary Grant on acid. Probably, the film's peak is a very effective opening, with John Hawkes and Michael Parks excellent as the 'World of Liquor' store clerk and his Texas ranger customer. Too bad they couldn't keep it up longer.***** From Dusk Till Dawn (1/19/96) Robert Rodriguez ~ George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis",5,1,2,16 August 2009
Jerry Maguire," Sucker Punched
","After he inexplicably describes himself (in opening narration) as one of 'thirty-three out-of-shape agents,' toothy 'sports agent' Tom Cruise (as Jerry Maguire) is fired from his job at 'Sports Management International' (SMI), due to some unlucky breaks. And, possibly because he distributed some subversive literature about life's simple pleasures. Leaving the company of superior Jay Mohr (as Bob Sugar), Mr. Cruise invites SMI employees to follow him, and form a new group.Alas, only pretty blonde Renee Zellweger (as Dorothy Boyd) accepts Cruise's offer; she has been admiring his handsomeness from afar. Unfortunately, Cruise persuades only one of his clients to join his new team - but, when it's football player Cuba Gooding Jr. (as Rod Tidwell), one is obviously enough. Mr. Gooding Jr. also serves as Cruise's best friend and advice dispenser. And, Ms. Zellweger comes with one of those cute and cuddly kids, enhanced by a prop dreamy pair of over-sized glasses.With all these ingredients, how can Cruise lose? Well, how? Cameron Crowe's 'Jerry Maguire' is a well-produced attraction. It increased Cruise's box office and critical success; and, it significantly advanced the careers of Gooding Jr. and Zellweger, who were heralded by many as 'Supporting Actor' and 'Newcomer' of the year. The film is full of catchphrases. Gooding Jr. teaches Cruise how to shout, 'Show me the money!' Zellweger tells Cruise, 'You had me at hello,' and the man says, 'You complete me.' The film celebrates concussions - as long as you don't die from one.***** Jerry Maguire (12/6/96) Cameron Crowe ~ Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., Renee Zellweger, Jonathan Lipnicki",5,2,5,18 January 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," High on Twinkle
","'What wonders await you in Willy Wonka's factory?' asks the film's synopsis, 'You'll find a lot that's funny, a little that's mysterious and an adventure as sweet as a satisfying as a Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight bar. This dazzling film adapted from Roald Dahl's classic children's novel, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore, is your Golden Ticket to a world so inventive, so imaginative, you won't want to miss a delicious moment!' In the film, Mr. Depp (as Willy Wonka) explains it in one sentence: 'I invited five children to the factory,' through the Golden Ticket contest covered early in the running time, 'and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner.' You'll see four VERY rotten children, and super-sweet young Highmore (as Charlie Bucket). They are accompanied by four dysfunctional parents, and Highmore's wise old grandpa David Kelly (as Joe). So, you know who the winner will be, but not the prize.There was, of course, another film made from this material, 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' (1971), starring Gene Wilder. It's really a shame nobody thought about doing a version with Paul Reubens in the title role, but that's beside the point. Both the 1971 version and this one are excellent in their own way. Mr. Burton and his frequent co-star add some background (childhood) information about Wonka that isn't in the original work. The effort to add something distinct is appreciated.The earlier film's sly winking at the contemporary drug counterculture is retained. Depp introduces himself with, 'Good Morning Starshine, the Earth says hello,' which quotes one of the hit songs from 'Hair' (the play celebrating sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll). When Depp walks into a glass door, he says, 'I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.' He wears a Mad Hat, and parodies the facial expressions of Greta Garbo and several old-time movie queens. You twinkle above us, we twinkle below...By the way, the scene where Depp goes through decades of cultural slang, when explaining a hair tonic to his befuddled factory guests, offers a great visual explanation, after all these years, for 'Cousin Itt'. Deep Roy and the effects are outstanding. It's very entertaining.******** Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (7/10/05) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore, David Kelly, Deep Roy",8,1,3,2 August 2010
Black Hawk Down," Goodnight, Irene
","'From acclaimed director Ridley Scott and renowned producer Jerry Bruckheimer comes a gripping true story about bravery, camaraderie, and the complex reality of war. 'Black Hawk Down' stars an exceptional cast including Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Ewen Bremner, and Sam Shepard.,' according to the DVD sleeve. All true, except for the bit about the 'complex reality of war.' There were certainly complexities about this war, but they aren't evident in the film. We get some basic truths about war, mainly that War is Hell and American soldiers are brave - neither are news.The title 'Black Hawk Down' is at lest 50% of the film's total storyline. The DVD synopsis elaborates, 'In 1993, an elite group of American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are sent to Somalia on a critical mission to capture a violent warlord whose corrupt regime has lead to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of Somalis. When the mission goes terribly wrong, the men find themselves outnumbered and literally fighting for their lives.' Humanitarian missions don't end like this; obviously, much of the story is missing.Be prepared for graphic war violence (accent on dismemberment). Mr. Hartnett (as Matt Eversmann) winds up being the valiant leading player. Hiding behind an accent, coffee-making Mr. McGregor (as John Grimes) is called to action. However, Mr. Bana (as Norm 'Hoot' Hooten) emerges as second in command. Proverbial 'young upshot' Orlando Bloom (as Todd Blackburn) starts out like he's going to be a focus, but drops quickly off screen. Charlie Hofheimer (as Jamie Smith) walks off with the best of the lower-billed roles.****** Black Hawk Down (12/18/01) Ridley Scott ~ Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, Charlie Hofheimer",6,0,2,28 September 2009

","Forty-year-old superstar pitcher Kevin Costner (as Billy Chapel) receives a personal and professional double shock. He learns his Detroit Tigers team has been sold. Even worse, the new owners want to trade him. As if that wasn't enough, Mr. Costner's girlfriend, pretty Kelly Preston (as Jane Aubrey), announces she is leaving him for a job in London. Costner must deal with these life changing events while pitching against the New York Yankees in a World Series playoff game. Preoccupied with both these facts and an ailing shoulder, Costner doesn't realize he's playing the game of his life...Costner and director Sam Raimi do very well with the sports-related segments, as excitement builds during the proverbial big game. The other part of the film has to do with Costner's romance with Ms. Preston. It gets off to a good start, with them meeting over her stalled car, but it gets sappy quickly. We expect the flashbacks to cover Costner's life, yet the focus is on his relatively recent love story; we're left wondering what he was doing the rest of his life. There are good performances in support from catcher pal John C. Reilly (as Gus Sinski) and daughter figure Jena Malone (as Heather).****** For Love of the Game (9/15/99) Sam Raimi ~ Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly, Jena Malone",6,0,1,11 April 2013
Big Fish," I Never Swam for My Father
","'Throughout his life Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) has always been a man of big appetites, enormous passions, and tall tales. In his later years, portrayed by five-time 'Best Actor Oscar' nominee Albert Finney, he remains a huge mystery to his son, William (Billy Crudup). Now, to get to know the real man, Will begins piecing together a true picture of his father from flashbacks of his amazing adventures in this marvel of a movie,' according to the DVD sleeve description. As you might expect, the presence of Tim Burton and many of his regular crew mean your production values on 'Big Fish' are going to be good.Now, this is supposed to be the story of a son estranged from his father due to the latter filling his son's head with nothing but lies. The father's stories, told in flashbacks, turn out to be vivid exaggerations, like the 'fish tale' opening. Well, the 'stories' aren't revelatory. And, it all leads to the expected heart-tugging conclusion. More is told when Mr. Crudup tells his wife something interesting but relatively unexplored, 'When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was there.' So, our storyteller was a nice guy and a loving husband, but only spent a little time with his son - or, was it a lot of time telling tales? And why? The disconnections are strange.We begin with a crystal ball-eyed witch showing our young lad and his friends how they are going to die. One of the other kids dies masturbating to 'Playboy' on his toilet; either this story was a father's warning, or it proved sexual urges trump the will to live. We don't see our hero's death, but he does. As he's seen his own death, 'Ed' is able to lead an exciting life, encountering a string of circus-like people. The key relationship, that of father and son, gets lost in the past. Only during the final act, do we get to the heart of the story - then, Crudup and Mr. Finney, updating his 'Billy Liar' (1960) stage role, begin to sell it.****** Big Fish (12/10/03) Tim Burton ~ Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange",6,0,0,13 August 2010
The Insider," Just Say No Smoking
","This starts out like it's going to be a thriller about 'Islamic Fundamentalists,' with blindfolded journalists being brought to interview Arabic-speaking Sheiks in turbans But no... Michael Mann's long 'The Insider' is really about tobacco company 'whistle-blower' Russell Crowe (as Jeffery Wigand), who brings the real dirt about the drug-peddling tobacco industry to the attention of '60 Minutes' producer Al Pacino (as Lowell Bergman). Christopher Plummer is an entertaining Mike Wallace. Looking older and fatter, Mr. Crowe has 'great actor' written all over him. There is a marvelous scene with wicked cigarette C.E.O. Michael Gambon. Diane Venora does well in an underdeveloped role as Crowe's selfish wife. Interesting to see one of Crowe's daughters portrayed as asthmatic; it might have been more dramatic if, for contrast, Mr. Pacino's sons were seen buying a pack of cigarettes. The film is nicely produced, except for some unsteady camera-work during dramatic peaks.****** The Insider (10/28/99) Michael Mann ~ Russell Crowe, Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer, Michael Gambon",6,4,6,12 September 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Who Framed Harry Potter?
","Although he was clearly acting in self-defense, neatly hair-trimmed Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is expelled from 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry' - but, he is readmitted after a trial. All along, Mr. Radcliffe insists the evil Lord Voldemort has returned from the abyss, but 'the powers that be' don't believe him. It's looks like it's getting increasingly difficult giving each of the growing 'Potter' supporting characters screen time, but it's still sad to see one of them die (as advertised).Smartly dressed Imelda Staunton (as Dolores Umbridge) has the plum 'new teacher' role. Those hoping to witness Radcliffe kiss either Rupert Grint or Emma Watson shouldn't be too surprised when he smooches Katie Leung (as Cho Chang). None of Harry's younger cast has much to add, anymore. The 'Harry Potter' storyline had peaked with the excellent 'Goblet of Fire' (2005), and 'Order of the Phoenix' comes across as purely calculated.

2001: A Space Odyssey," HAL Opens the Doors
","Since so much will be written about this film, let's be brief. I have seen '2001: A Space Odyssey' all the way through, twice. There are some parts I've watched separately, but I saw none of the film until AFTER 2001. So, obviously, it has a timeless quality. I consider Stanley Kubrick's work on this film to be art, which really doesn't 'age'. I believe there is also a point where 'flaws' become irrelevant, and '2001: A Space Odyssey' reaches that point.It's probably been said (I will look at the other comments this evening), but the portrayals of Keir Dullea (as Dave) and Douglas Rain (as Hal) are absolutely spellbinding. I do consider Mr. Rain's portrayal of 'HAL' an acting performance; consider, also, how much Mr. Dullea accomplishes without speaking. The Dullea/Rain struggle is probably my favorite part of the film, presently. This one is indispensable. ********** 2001: A Space Odyssey (4/2/68) Stanley Kubrick ~ Keir Dullea, Douglas Rain, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester",10,2,8,30 September 2007

","In 1927 Hollywood, dashing silent film superstar Jean Dujardin (as George Valentin) celebrates his latest premiere amid crowds of fans at the theater. After a chance meeting, Mr. Dujardin gives pretty, star-struck actress Berenice Bejo (as Peppy Miller) her first big break. Dujardin even provides Ms. Bejo with her trademark 'beauty spot' by taking a make-up pencil to mark her otherwise perfect face with a distinctive mole. Neither know it, but 'talkies' are poised to take over Hollywood and stamp out the 'silents'. Dujardin's fame and fortune will crash with the stock market while Bejo becomes the next big thing...Michel Hazanavicius' ode to silent films won a lot of awards, deservedly. This film successfully takes us back to that time when movies began to talk. Much has been said about how certain actors had the wrong look or 'accent' for the new medium; here, we have something much closer to the truth. Moviegoers accepted Greta Garbo and Maurice Chevalier with their accents. Stars like Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were unsuccessful because they were perceived as too old and/or could not develop their acting skills...Dujardin as 'The Artist' looks very much like Mr. Fairbanks. He also mirrors the popular star's manners. Although this story is supposed to take place behind the scenes, we mostly remain in a silent film mode. In total, it is a visual beauty that presents as a nightmare. This is evident in the opening, when 'The Artist' refuses to talk; his refusal is so adamant, it carries on after the scene ends. Later, Dujardin suffers a nightmare with sound. The sound effects and music, by Ludovic Bource, are brilliant. In the late 1920s, an art form froze in time. That era's synchronized sound effects and film beauty are here, again...Still, you know it isn't real...They give you 'Vertigo' (1958) and a happy dance, which just seems wrong... Then, you remember this only the stuff that dreams are made of...********** The Artist (5/15/11) Michel Hazanavicius ~ Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, James Cromwell, John Goodman",10,1,6,15 March 2015

Seemingly stricken with amnesia, he finds he has a companion in doctor Cary Elwes (as Lawrence Gordon), who is also chained inside, closer to the toilet. Neither of the men need to use the facilities, but Mr. Elwes probably 'goes' during the running time. The bathroom is not only filthy, but also has a fat, lifeless body situated center stage. At first, it seems like the body may be decapitated, but it's more like a smashed-up head.The men are given a 'Saw' to escape with - it won't cut through their steel leg irons, but it will cut through their ankles. They are given until 6:00 to accomplish their mission, which is different for each man (as you'll see). Basically (the way I took it), the man who saws off the first leg wins. The plot unfolds in flashbacks. You get a related kidnapping, a series of gruesome murders, and investigator Danny Glover (as David Tapp).

Japanese Emperor Shichinosuke Nakamura (as Meiji) wants Captain Cruise, who is famous for offing American Indians, to train his army. Cruise accepts the financially lucrative assignment. In Japan, Cruise teaches the natives how to fight; but, the Japanese are slow learners.Still, the men are ordered into battle.Cruise proves his Japanese soldiers are not ready for prime time by ordering one to use himself (Cruise) as target practice. Indeed, the soldier can't shoot straight, and misses killing Cruise. The men are ordered to fight anyway; and, they are wiped out by samurai leader Ken Watanabe (as Katsumoto). Cruise is the last man standing; and, although the situation is hopeless, he continues fighting. Mr. Watanabe admires Cruise's epic efforts, and spares him. Then, Watanabe's drop-dead gorgeous sister Koyuki (as Taka) nurses Cruise back to health.So do you think Cruise will bond with his honorable Japanese captors?Although the storyline is very predictable, and sometimes silly; 'The Last Samurai' is a very well-produced film. There are scads of exciting, well-crafted battle scenes; be prepared to see many humans sliced, diced, and otherwise punctured. Director Edward Zwick, photographer John Toll, and their crew always make it look extremely beautiful. Watanabe's characterization lifts the film's performance caliber considerably.

","'Harry Potter learns, on his 11th birthday, that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards, and possesses magical powers of his own. (Sent to) 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry', Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime, discovering a world of magic and fantasy, where he is destined to live,' according to the film's official synopsis. This was the first of the films bringing J.K. Rowling's beloved 'Harry Potter' characters to motion picture life; and, it must be considered a rousing success.Importantly, Ms. Rowling insisted on retaining much creative control, so a higher than usual amount of integrity to the material is maintained. This doesn't benefit the film in every respect; but, it certainly was, in hindsight, the only sure-fire way to introduce these adventures to cinema. One change, done for the book, was that the title would be altered from 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' for U.S. consumption; it goes against the grain, and works perfectly. 'Sorcerer's Stone' is shorter, provides alliteration, and better illustrates the conflict present in the story.Initially, it wasn't obvious that the young trio playing 'Harry', 'Ron', and 'Hermione' had the acting ability to go along with looking right for the leading roles; fortunately, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson would turn out to be just perfect. Richard Harris (as Albus Dumbledore) and Maggie Smith (as Minerva McGonagall) herald a stellar parade of Brits playing throughout the 'Potter' films, with Robbie Coltrane (as Rubeus Hagrid) going to the head of this, the first class.******** Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (11/4/01) Chris Columbus ~ Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane",8,0,1,1 February 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," What's Life Without a Few Dragons?
","This is the first 'Harry Potter' film that is going to be significantly more powerful if you're familiar with the earlier movies. It's an exciting, beautifully produced film, of course, with wondrous visuals and an intelligent storyline. But, the relationships between Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) are richer when you consider their ongoing film friendships. And, most importantly, the appearance of the film's major villain is a climatic moment that elevates the entire series; it gives this entry the sweeping epic quality so longed for, and so rarely found.Mike Newell takes over as director, from Alfonso Cuaron; it would have been nice to see Mr. Cuaron direct 'Goblet of Fire' due to the storyline becoming more obviously romantic, but Mr. Newell's handling of the adventure is not merely adequate, it's exhilarating. One of the best things about the 'Potter' films was the age appropriate casting. Yet, due to production scheduling, the young actors have gotten older than their roles; Radcliffe is supposed to be a young-looking fourteen. It's also apparent, by now, that however much they trim from Ms. Rowling's novels, these films are going to remain dense.From the novel, enough was left out to make this film an alternate reality, which should always have been the filmmakers' objective.Sagely Maggie Smith (as Minerva McGonagall) has a few things to say, this time around (but not as much as in the first two films), and Michael Gambon (as Albus Dumbledore) really grows into the role originated by Richard Harris. Newcomers making the most out of their parts are eyeful Brendan Gleeson (as Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody) and handsome Robert Pattinson (as Cedric Diggory). Note, making a good impression in a 'Harry Potter' movie isn't as easy at it would seem, because everyone is up to the task; you really have to get one of the better roles. Now, could those hedges trim my hair, too? ********* Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (11/6/05) Mike Newell ~ Daniel Radcliffe, Brendan Gleeson, Rupert Grint, Robert Pattinson",9,0,1,1 February 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Overloaded!
","'The Matrix' (1999) is still a great stand-alone film. That first film is THE ONE to see. 'The Matrix Reloaded', the first of the inevitable sequels, sucks all the awesome special effects it can muster, and coats the screen with them. The underdeveloped storyline, which helped make the original more mysterious and imaginative, is filled in enough babble to expose it as significantly less than satisfactory. The creative balance of action, effects, and imagination is lost. The three main actors (Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss) are upstaged by 'exciting new allies'. So, what's left? - Although overwrought and onerous, the visual effects are STILL exciting, and the 'Matrix Universe' isn't damaged beyond repair.

Mystic River," When Bad Things Happen to Bad People
","Director Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River' is a well-performed, but ugly and disturbing film. When it opens, the characters who grow up to be Sean Penn (as Jimmy Markum), Tim Robbins (as Dave Boyle), and Kevin Bacon (as Sean Devine) are pre-teenage boys. Young 'Dave' is abducted, after the three play hockey on a Massachusetts street. First of all, the actors playing young 'Jimmy' (Jason Kelly) and 'Sean' (Connor Paolo) seem to be reversed; possibly, this is because Mr. Bacon's character's name is also Mr. Penn's first name? Secondly, the confusing abduction is of a sexual nature; later, when the story temporarily becomes an intriguing drama, this is clarified. By the third act, the film has fallen apart.****** Mystic River (2003) Clint Eastwood ~ Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon",6,0,2,4 October 2008
Enemy at the Gates," All Quite on the Russian Front
","It's 1942, and the Russians are brutalized by the Nazi Army at Stalingrad. Still, the Russian resisters proclaim, 'Never will the enemy put his foot on the soil of Stalingrad!' Sharp-shooting soldier Jude Law (as Vassili Zaitsev) meets, and bonds with, commissar comrade Joseph Fiennes (as Danilov). Mr. Fiennes, who survives massacre by playing possum, is very impressed with Mr. Law's sniper fire. Law had been firing between the eyes since his days as a shepherd boy. After losing several Germans to Law's bullets, the Nazis send their own Major sharpshooter, Ed Harris (as König), out to bag Law. Meanwhile, Law and Fiennes form the obligatory 'love triangle' with fetching Rachel Weisz (as Tania).Jean-Jacques Annaud directs big production values well enough, and the story's setting is a refreshing change from the usual western-fronted World War II epics. But, the whole thing collapses under its unnecessary, and startlingly ordinary 'love triangle'. Law and Ms. Weisz are the main lovey-dovey duo. Their love-making scene may remind you about... well, not waking up the roommate. Duplicitous chocolate-loving young Gabriel Thomson (as Sasha) and Mr. Harris portray somewhat more interesting supporting characters.****** Enemy at the Gates (2001) ~ Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz",6,1,3,26 October 2008
A Beautiful Mind," You Do the Math
","By the time Russell Crowe (as John Nash) married Jennifer Connelly (as Alicia), I had serious concerns about 'A Beautiful Mind'. My first question revolved around Mr. Crowe's Princeton roommate, Paul Bettany (as Charles). I could not understand why Mr. Bettany did not pal around with the college bar crowd. Crowe was there, with a group of other students, but no mixing with Bettany. Why? Obviously, Bettany loved to imbibe; so, he should have been the life of the party, I thought. With that question nagging me, I continued to have questions. Like was up with the two men at the later party? I wonderedÂ… Then, the final straw - Crowe uses his secret 'code' to open a security gate; and, the gate swings open without closing behind him. This was not a very secure gate. Anyone wanting to gain admittance would only have to wait for Crowe to open it up, and walk in after him (if not climb in ahead of him). And, why wasn't Bettany at the Crowe's wedding? Just when I was wondering how to get in touch with director Ron Howard, the truth dawned on me. I was expecting a more traditional film. A couple of surreal moments should have tipped me off; for example, Crowe's barroom deduction concerning the students' chances of 'picking up' a blonde women. Still, I didn't fully appreciate what was going on. Was the rollicking car chase with Ed Harris (as Parcher) supposed to be an illusion? Then, I wondered about the characters 'Charles' and 'Marcee'. I understood 'Parcher' as a manifestation of 'cold war' paranoia. But, I do not understand what, precisely, 'Charles' and 'Marcee' reveal about the title character, other than a propensity for creating illusions. The three imaginary characters are the most important in Nash's life - maybe if I knew what they were around for, they'd go away. Eventually, the film confirms suspicions. I can almost see clearly now.******** A Beautiful Mind (2001) Ron Howard ~ Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany",8,3,6,23 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," If You Believe in Magic
","Heroic young Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) hopes to spend a second year at 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry'. But, the 12-year-old is warned against attending, by a computer-generated 'house elf' named 'Dobby' (voiced by Toby Jones). The little imp prevents Mr. Radcliffe from getting summer letters from pals like red-haired Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and spunky Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger); and, he even manages to block the magical entrance the youngsters use to catch their train to school. So, Radcliffe has to hitch a ride with Mr. Grint in a flying car. Don't fret. Eventually, the lads arrive at 'Hogwarts', where they become embroiled in one of the magic school's darkest secrets.This second 'Harry Potter' film was produced in quick succession, and is quite like the first. The trio of young performers are beginning to make the characters their own, which means they seem slightly different than in J.K. Rowling's original novel. The older actors are, of course, marvelous. Notably, noble Richard Harris (who played Albus Dumbledore) died just before the film was released. It's interesting to see the relatively unknown Christian Coulson (as Tom Riddle) trump accomplished Kenneth Branagh (as Gilderoy Lockhart) in the villain department.

The Departed," Red Meat for Oscar
","Martin Scorsese's blood-splattering story of organized crime and cell-phones, in Boston, Massachusetts. Mainly, it involves two infiltrators: Leonardo DiCaprio (as Billy Costigan Jr.) is a police officer sent undercover into the camp of 'Godfather'-type Jack Nicholson (as Frank Costello). Matt Damon (as Colin Sullivan) is an active detective working undercover for Mr. Nicholson. It is an intriguing plot, directed with a abundance of flair.Mr. Scorsese quite interestingly teams up Nicholson with Mr. DiCaprio; the two actors have often been compared. Nicholson clearly revels in his character; DiCaprio plays along, stroking his face as Nicholson seems to improvise. Mr. Damon is less showy, and more effective; he uses is natural accent well, and is the most consistent of the three leads. The supporting cast is solid. Mark Wahlberg (as Dignam) makes the best of the secondary roles. Pay attention to what Mr. Wahlberg says about haircuts; he's dead on.I have the comic book Nicholson buys Damon's character when he's a kid: it's 'Wolverine #11', dated early 'EARLY SEP' 1989. Note that Scorsese reprises the 'bag of groceries' scene at the end of the movie, without the comic. Rats! That, and the over reliance of cell-phones, place the setting as (roughly) around the film's year of release. I wonder, were the Boston police amused? The soundtrack seems inappropriately laced with 'oldies'; probably, this is reflective of Nicholson's domineering character. It's odd to hear John Lennon's relatively obscure 'Well, Well, Well' played; perversely, Lennon is mentioned as a 'Costello' favorite. Scorsese should have considered using the Plastic Ono Band album's 'Working Class Hero'; the song's infamous use of what Lennon called the 'Fuh King' word would have been appropriate.Scorsese, with a dose of Nicholson, proved to be irresistible red meat for 'Oscar' voters; but, this isn't the director's best work.******* The Departed (2006) Martin Scorsese ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson",7,1,4,1 September 2008
War of the Worlds," Lightning Strikes Twice
","Get ready for a wild ride with the Steven Spielberg 'DreamWorks' production team, in this high quality revision of H.G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'. For this invasion, the story has been updated to focus on the family changes which have become most dominant over the decades since the successful 1953 version. So, the central figure, Tom Cruise (as Ray Ferrier), is not a doctor, but a more ordinary New Jersey dock worker. And, the lead character played by Mr. Cruise is made much more interesting by the fact that he is a divorced man, who is somewhat estranged from his children . Instead of the expected 'hot romance', you have the drama unfolding around the bonding of Cruise and his children.Of course, a lot of disbelief suspension is required, especially in this type of film; but, the updated situation is refreshing, and believable. When the film begins, Cruise's ex-wife drops off the couple's two children while she goes off to spend some time with her new husband, and parents, in Boston. The children are played well, by Justin Chatwin (Robbie Ferrier) and Dakota Fanning (Rachel Ferrier). There is a point (foreshadowed twice) where Mr. Chatwin leaves the action; it seems like a flaw in the storytelling; but, it does work out quite well. The 'son' is replaced by Tim Robbins (as Harlan Ogilvy), in some scenes which would not have worked with the original threesome.Cruise deserves some particular praise, for his performance. He is especially good after suffering a loss, then taking refuge in Mr. Robbins' basement; observe his fight to overcome madness, and protect his daughter, in the bowels of the Earth. Cruise's tearful rendition of 'Little Deuce Coupe' is one of the film's most memorable moments; and, it involves no observable 'special effect'. The alien 'special effects' are fantastic. John Williams is outstanding. Reserving comments on minor difficulties which would reveal too much; (except, the narration was unnecessary); the 'War of the Worlds' is excellent entertainment.******** War of the Worlds (6/13/05) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, Tim Robbins",8,55,92,18 August 2008

To Kill a Mockingbird," Robert Mulligan Shoots To Kill
","In depression-era Alabama, two young children (Mary Badham and Phillip Alford) are afraid of a light-skinned White man (Robert Duvall) while their father (Gregory Peck) defends a dark-skinned Black man (Brock Peters) accused of rape. Mr. Peck helps his children maneuver the fear and prejudice that grips us on the verge of adulthood. The prosecution of Tom Robinson, which has become a cliché, is often given as the film's basic plot; but, this is a serious miscalculation as this much more than a courtroom drama. That story is meant to work in conjunction with the one involving Arthur 'Boo' Radley; together, they give the story poetic justice.This film is impeccable. The ensemble cast is miraculous (witness John Megna as Truman Capote). The photography (by Russell Harlan) and music (by Elmer Bernstein) are symphonious. And, director Robert Mulligan shoots it as a horror story. This may seem strange; but, when you think about it, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' couldn't be shot any other way. It's terrifying. Remember, 'It's a sin to kill a mockingbird.' If you've never read Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize-winning novel (1960), watching Horton Foote's Oscar-awarded adaptation and reading Ms. Lee's book (in whatever order you wish) are a couple of those things to do before you die.********** To Kill a Mockingbird (12/25/62) Robert Mulligan ~ Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, John Megna",10,1,4,23 June 2010
Dark Shadows," Light Shadows
","In 1760 Liverpool (which we later learn reeked with the stench of un-dumped commodes), we meet the 'cursed' Collins family. They move to Maine, successfully start a fishing business, and 'found' the town of Collinsport. Grown up handsome son Johnny Depp (as Barnabas Collins) becomes a real lady killer. This irks sexy servant girl Eva Green (as Angelique 'Angie' Bouchard), who yearned for Mr. Depp from their days in Liverpool. He soon finds 'true love' with pretty blonde Bella Heathcote (as Josette DuPres). Jilted, Ms. Green turns out to be a witch. She turns Depp into a vampire and has him sealed in a chained coffin...This set-up - all occurring before the opening credits - is fine, but offers some timing problems, especially when you consider later revelations. It seems like Depp had to be a vampire before he turns into one, and we aren't sure how it all went down. Possibly there is plot skimmed away, and this feeling continues throughout the film. After the prologue, credits roll and we are in the year 1972. The story shifts to Ms. Heathcote (as Maggie Evans) on a train. She's the mirror image of Depp's 'Josette' from the past. Harboring a more modern mystery, Heathcote takes the name 'Victoria (Vicki) Winters' from a train poster advertisement...The story begins with the arrival of Heathcote to seek employment as governess, coupled with the unearthing and arrival of Depp. The film becomes mostly a situation comedy until the climax. Some of the jokes are funny - some are not. Two of the better characterizations are beautiful family matriarch Michelle Pfeiffer (as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) and troubled young nephew Gulliver McGrath (as David Collins). Depp falls somewhere in the middle. Dead-panning with amusing sincerity, he nevertheless is victimized by a lack of romantic development; increasingly hidden behind elaborate make-up, Depp hits the comic notes well, but he fails to make 'Barnabas' a passionate lead. Director Tim Burton's quirk looks something like a slip. But the art and set direction are good.***** Dark Shadows (5/7/12) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Bella Heathcote",5,6,12,11 May 2012

","'Chance leads Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) to discover his one talent - illegal arms dealing. With his brother (Jared Leto)'s help, he reaches the top of the trade, supplying anyone whose check clears. His skills and quick wits bring him everything he's ever wanted - and help him elude a persistent Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke). But, at the peak of his prowess, he discovers his customers might demand more than he can give and those he's trying to protect could become deadly liabilities,' according to the film's official synopsis. It may be a matter of personal taste, but this film could have done without half of the narration - some of the images have a better effect with musical soundtrack and incidental dialogue only. Pointing out that the film's anti-hero didn't sell arms to Osama bin Laden because his checks bounced, for example, comes across as a pre-calculated, half-hearted apology. Let's leave him out? The film is better when Mr. Cage's 'Yuri' marries Bridget Moynahan (as Ava Fontaine), with relatively little narrative fanfare. Ultimately, however, writer/director Andrew Niccol does create a captivating film statement about gun-running, and its human cost - both literal (Vitaly's body) and figurative (Yuri's soul). There are some outstandingly imagined sequences, beginning with the opening 'credits'. Weaving Rufus Wainwright's singing of Leonard Cohen's broken 'Hallelujah' into the film works very well.

The Good Shepherd," Catching Sheep with Robert De Niro and Matt Damon
","According to the sleeve's synopsis, 'Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie and Robert De Niro star in this powerful thriller about the birth of the CIA. Edward Wilson (Damon) believes in America, and will sacrifice everything he loves to protect it. But as one of the covert founders of the CIA, Edward's youthful idealism is slowly eroded by his growing suspicion of the people around him. Everybody has secretsbut will Edward's destroy him? With an all-star cast including Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton and John Turturro, it's the gripping story David Ansen of Newsweek hails as 'spellbinding'.' That's not entirely accurate, and may make 'The Good Shepherd' easy to dislike, considering its... obliqueness lugubrious pace and Eric Roth's metacognitive script. The film's pace is excruciating...'The Good Shepherd' is the long (yes, too long) character study of a man who is clearly a composite of individuals we will never see more clearly. CIA directors seldom write 'tell all' autobiographies. The film is, also, a fictionalized account of why the 1961 'Bay of Pigs' confrontation failed (for the USA) and/or was successful (for Fidel Castro). Although it is, as Mr. Ansen describes, 'spellbinding', film is more of an 'intellectual-' than an 'action-' thriller. And, Mr. De Niro does not 'star' in the film; he is the director, and essays a relatively minor role. Herein, De Niro proves he should direct more often - both more 'commercial' films, and a sequel to this one.The story begins in 1961, with the clandestine taping of an act of sexual intercourse, between two unrecognizable individuals. Then, in a 'characterization' moment, Mr. Damon (as Wilson) sticks a model ship into a bottle. Obviously, these two events are symbolically connected; in fact, the entire film deals with 'intercourse'. Eventually, the grainy couple will be revealed, and rather artfully connected to Damon's ship-building hobby. Watching 'The Good Shepherd' will require your full attention throughout. Especially, read the small subtitles regarding setting; the film makes some time period jumps, which will otherwise be confusing.Performances are uniformly excellent; the collaboration between the cast and De Niro is essential viewing, for anyone interested in the individuals involved.Damon's portrayal is cold, aloof, and almost entirely humorless. At age six (a 1925 flashback), he is psychologically wounded by the suicide of his father. You should note that Damon's character loses his father when he is six years old; and, later, he enters his own son's life when his son is six years old - making the two 'Wilsons' connecting puzzle pieces. A failed poet, Damon is lifelike only when interacting with certain relatives and acquaintances; otherwise, he carries his emotional wounds, as a walking zombie, until the film's burning closure.Supporting performances have varying levels of importance. Ms. Jolie (as Margaret 'Clover' Russell) rises to the top of the list; introduced 'in heat', she recalls Garbo's erotic seductiveness, then Madonna's 'come hither' look. With, perhaps, a scene excepted, Jolie's work is wonderful. Certainly, her character shows Damon's limited interest in sex. Probably, we see his entire output on screen. Although captured by Jolie, Damon loves a beautiful deaf woman he meets in the library, Tammy Blanchard (as Laura). Mr. Roth's script 'consummates' this relationship exquisitely; first, with partially deaf female spy Martina Gedeck (as Hanna Schiller).Damon has other relationships to watch closely - with professor Michael Gambon (as Dr. Fredericks), who can see Damon's suppressed poet; and son Eddie Redmayne (as Edward Wilson Jr.), who cannot see his father at all. Damon's CIA 'godfathers' include Mr. Hurt (as Philip Allen), Mr. Baldwin (as Sam Murach), and De Niro (as William Sullivan). The more traditional 'godfather' Joe Pesci (as Joseph Palmi) has a small role, which reveals something not only about America's 'exclusive' secret clubs, but also about Damon's character. Yet, no illustration of character beats Mr. Turturro (as Ray Brocco) identifying Damon with the line, 'They said you were a serious SOB that didn't have any sense of humor, there can't be two of you.' Some of the turncoats are too obvious, though their performances are faultless. Last, but certainly NOT least, Robert Richardson's cinematography and the Bruce Fowler/Marcelo Zarvos soundtrack (a symphony of sadness) reach unsurpassable artistic heights.All perform masterfully. ********* The Good Shepherd (12/11/06) Robert De Niro ~ Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon, Eddie Redmayne",9,2,3,24 December 2008

When the orders are given, many of the soldiers are aware the mission is doomed, and retreat to their trenches; although some, like Colonel Kirk Douglas (as Dax) attempt to be valiant. After the embarrassing defeat, the Generals decide to court-martial, and execute by firing squad, a random selection of their own soldiers.'Paths of Glory' are paved with blood.This film showed anyone who wasn't convinced by 'The Killing' that Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker to be reckoned with; it is a bold, innovative, and highly engaging war drama. The French government was, understandably, not amused; but, many other countries recognized France happened to be the setting, and blacklisted the film for its unflattering depiction of military leadership in general.'Patriotism... is the last refuge of the scoundrel.' Quoting Samuel Johnson, Mr. Douglas is towering; suavely Machiavellian, Mr. Menjou plays evil with ease; and, Mr. Macready should have received a 'Best Supporting Actor' award for carrying out his orders. Neither Douglas, Menjou, nor Macready were nominated, surprisingly. The rest of the regimen is no less impressive; with Ralph Meeker (as Paris), Joe Turkel (as Arnaud), and Timothy Carey (as Ferol) obviously moving up in the ranks. And, note how real-life war hero Wayne Morris (as Roget) plays against type.

I was distracted by Depp's different hairstyles. By the 1970s, Depp looked older than his mother. The way people age, and change hairstyles is screwy; so, is the soundtrack song selection order. Depp's characterization is interesting, at least; he has my respect for taking chances with his movie roles. Penelope Cruz (as Mirtha) lifts things considerably when she appears, but it's a long, long wait. For a film so effective in its 'based on a true story' opening, I was surprised so few of the cast seemed to act like they took drugs. Depp performed well, however; with his scenes hitting bottom, and recovering, being impressive (see the beating and childbirth scenes). Emma Roberts performs very well as the daughter Kristina; her scenes with Depp make you care about the character.

","Charlton Heston (as Judah Ben-Hur) grows up in Judea, around the same time as Jesus Christ. A wealthy Jew, Mr. Heston maintains his princely lifestyle, despite the Roman occupation of his land. After a number of years, Heston encounters old friend Stephen Boyd (as Messala), a Roman. Heston soon discovers that politics does not, in every case, make strange bedfellows; as Mr. Boyd is the steadfast leader of the occupying Roman forces. Soon, the political upheaval threatens Heston's freedom, and life 'State-of-the-art' epic, from William Wyler and the outstanding MGM cast and crew. Relatively speaking, this film is not as 'original' as the 1925 version; still, it's a very worthy update, with superlative production values. With a few exceptions, the film looks very natural, unlike the increasingly tired animated 'look' used for big productions some decades later. The film's lighting, scenes, and direction are very aesthetically appealing. The supporting characterizations are better than those in the older version. Christianity remains respectfully restrained; arguably, the amount of Christian faith demonstrated by Heston is unnecessarily subdued.Heston takes some getting used to, as the young Jewish hero; in fact, he looks more convincing as a Roman, especially after his 'adoption' by Jack Hawkins (as Quintus Arrius). An interesting, but unacceptable-at-the-time, idea might have been for Heston and Boyd to switch roles; Boyd appears capable of handling either 'Judah' or 'Messala'. Still, Heston wins you over; his scenes in the 'slave boat', and the reunification with his leper mother are outstandingly played.Boyd's characterization is extraordinary; watching the way his eyes dart over Heston, in their first scenes together, lends credence to co-writer Gore Vidal assertion there was a homosexual subtext planned for the characters. Realistically, homosexual relations were not all that uncommon among the ancient Romans. Although, this was not likely to be found in the Lew Wallace novel, it does help explain the otherwise inexplicable love/hate relationship between the 'Judah' and 'Messala' characters.The entire supporting cast does very well, it must have been difficult for award nominators to single anyone out. But, in addition to those mentioned above, Haya Harareet's 'Esther' and Hugh Griffith's 'Sheik Ilderim' most definitely make an impression. The film's weakest moments occur during the very fake looking 'sea battle' sequence; surprisingly, the old 1925 version is much more consistently exciting. Both films' 'chariot races' are essential thrill rides. ********* Ben-Hur (11/18/59) William Wyler ~ Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith",9,5,10,30 March 2008
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig Assumes the Position
","When negotiations failed to produce Pierce Brosnan, after his fourth appearance as James Bond in 'Die Another Day' (2002), the franchise owners decided upon a new approach. So, while the title 'Casino Royale' suggests familiar ground, it is quite different than what has gone before. There is still a lot of action, but it's more 'realistic' and less gimmickry; gone too is the famed cache of Bond gadgets. The new actor signed to play Bond, rugged blond Daniel Craig, is more bone-crunching than dashing. When asked if he'd like his martini shaken or stirred, Mr. Craig answers, 'Do I look like I give a damn?' Well, no...All if this is claimed, with the filmmakers' blessing, to be a return to creator Ian Fleming's original intent for the character. Fine, but without the forty year-plus tradition of gadgets and gimmickry, this Bond seems more ordinary than original. And, the character lacks his predecessors suave appeal; he's more of a traditional action hero, and humorless. The bosomy 'Bond girl' is Eva Green (as Vesper Lynd), who revealed all of herself in 'The Dreamers' (2003); she's sexy with her clothes on, but these films should, by now, be showing at least as much as an old 'Playboy' magazine. Scar-faced Mads Mikkelsen (as Le Chiffre) leads a pack of perfect villains. A change was needed for the Bond series, but with more of the distinctive style intact.***** Casino Royale (11/14/06) Martin Campbell ~ Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench",5,2,6,24 December 2010
Signs," What in God's Name Is Going On Here?
","Man-of-the-cloth Mel Gibson (as Graham Hess) has left the Priesthood. Six months ago, Mr. Gibson lost his wife in a car accident; and, he is struggling with a loss of Christian faith. Gibson's younger brother, Joaquin Phoenix (as Merrill Hess) has moved in, to help Gibson and his children grieve. Mr. Phoenix was a promising baseball player, but he stuck out too much...Gibson is an Episcopalian, obviously (a wife and sex are permitted), with two children: asthmatic alien-conscious Rory Culkin (as Morgan Hess) and perpetually thirsty Abigail Breslin (as Bo Hess). Gibson is also a farmer. The movie gets started when extraterrestrials startle Gibson's family, by turning their Pennsylvania cornfield into 'Crop Signs' - aka 'Crop Circles'.Soon, these 'Signs' are popping up all over India, and the world. Presumably, the designs are signposts for motherships - it's difficult to understand what logical purpose they would serve, as an alien spacecraft would be too technically advanced to use them... maybe, then, they are merely alien pranks. Or, they could be sent from God, to help Gibson re-harvest his faith 'Signs' borrows its basic plot from H.G. Wells' 'The War of the Worlds' - a frequently tapped well. Gibson, Phoenix, and the kids look very silly in two memorable poses, sitting stone-faced with their palms on their knees and/or wearing pointy tinfoil hats. The biggest 'jolt' comes early in the film, with a simple dog's bark. Mr. Shyamalan builds suspense well, in the early scenes.The best performance is delivered by director M. Night Shyamalan (as Ray Reddy). Cherry Jones (as Caroline Paski) is okay as the local cop, but her character should have written up (as a possessed alien, for example). The main 'special effect' is good; but, the aliens, if they are real, have to be the dumbest extraterrestrials in the galaxy, if you stop and think about it **** Signs (7/29/02) M.

Due to the torrential downpour, these 'Ten Little Indians' must take shelter at a Nevada motel resembling the one in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' and run by twitchy manager Larry Washington (John Hawkes).'Identity' is an imaginative and thoughtful updating of tried and true suspense formulas. You'll want to see it in 'widescreen' but will also be given the choice of two viewing options - the 'theatrical' and 'extended' versions are offered as options. My advice is to see it in 'theatrical' first, although 'extended' will be tempting. The film is enjoyable on several levels, and the 'extended' version will be more fun during a second viewing, when you're examining plot points, performances, and production style. The 'extended' version includes a scene that implicitly gives too much information, due to its placement.A terrific 'motel set' was built for the picture, and is fantastically detailed. Production designer Mark Friedberg, art director Jess Gonchor, and set decorator Cindy Carr should have been nominated for 'Academy Awards'. The broken tiles, drain pipes, 8-tracks, and jigsaw puzzles are among the thousands of parts assembled for the décor of 'Identity' and its crowded psychosis. Director James Mangold and cinematographer Phedon Papamichael make Michael Cooney's story look brilliant, complimented by great editing from David Brenner and music by Alan Silvestri.

","Microwave popcorn and, 'Hold on tight for a rush of pulse-pounding thrills, breathtaking stunts, and unexpected romance in a film you'll want to see again and again. Keanu Reeves stars as Jack Traven, an L.A.P.D. SWAT team specialist who is sent to diffuse a bomb that a revenge-driven extortionist (Dennis Hopper) has planted on a bus. But, until he does, Jack and passenger Sandra Bullock must keep the bus speeding through the streets of Los Angeles at more than 50 miles per hour - or the bomb will explode.

Can a successful young actor become an even more successful action star? In Mr. Reeves' case, the answer was YES. If he had his ear to the ground, Reeves soon learned that when you do both sensitive and big budget action roles, you are remembered for the latter. This film brought the buzz about Reeves' supposed 'non-acting' skills into focus; but, the role doesn't require much, other than demanding stunt work.

Celebrating with beautiful young wife Olivia Williams (as Anna Crowe), Mr. Willis gets drunk, and does 'Dr. Seuss' impressions. The happy couple retire to their bedroom, where they prepare for sex. But, after Ms. Williams begins a playful strip, mysterious sounds are heard in the bathroom. It's Willis' former boy patient, Donnie Wahlberg (as Vincent Grey), all grown up and stripped to his underwear (briefs). Obviously quite deranged, Mr. Wahlberg sobs, 'You failed me!' and shoots both Willis and himself.The next fall, Willis has apparently recovered from his gunshot wound - but, he feels guilty about failing to help Mr. Wahlberg overcome his childhood psychosis. Willis gets the chance to help another emotionally disturbed boy, unhappy Haley Joel Osment (as Cole Sear). Young Mr. Osment reminds Willis of the man who shot him. Osment is having trouble in school, startling teachers with bloody drawings and psychic abilities. Osment is bullied by his peers, who consider him a 'freak'. His mother, Toni Collette (as Lynn Sear), is struggling to make ends meet, after a messy divorce. After a few sessions, Osment reveals his anxiety producing secret, 'I see dead people.' M. Night Shyamalan, who also wrote, does an admirable job directing this unpredictable ghost story; he, with photographer Tak Fujimoto, works storytelling wonders with the camera; even before the revelatory last act, witness how effectively the camera sets each mood. And, the 'Best Director'-nominated Mr. Shyamalan elicits wonderful performances from his cast, especially from Osment; his is one of the era's all-time best kid characterizations.

A Night at the Roxbury," Doug and Steve's Adequate Adventure
","Los Angeles-area brothers Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell (as Doug and Steve Butabi) have a serious case of arrested development. The adult men share a bedroom in their parents' home and dress like idiots. They dream of someday opening their own disco, but neither Mr. Kattan nor Mr. Ferrell seem smarter than a fifth grader. One of their greatest skills is bopping their heads, in unison, to Haddaway's 'What Is Love?' They love the nightlife and wanna boogie, but can't even gain admittance to the popular 'Roxbury' nightclub. One evening, the brothers are lucky enough to get into a fender-bender with Richard Grieco. To avoid blame, the '21 Jump Street' star gets Kattan and Ferrell into the club. They score with attractive women and lose their virginity...All good skits from the late-night TV series 'Saturday Night Live' seem to falter around 30 seconds before they end. Curiously, many go on to become feature-length films. Kattan and Ferrell (as the Butabi Brothers) follow this progression. On television, they were sometimes joined by Jim Carrey; here, he does not appear. We do get to see old favorites Loni Anderson ('WKRP') and Dwayne Hickman ('Dobie Gillis '), although the word 'old' will likely never accurately describe Ms. Anderson. She would have no trouble being admitted to the Roxbury and finding a dance partner. The cast and crew do a nice job and the script seems logical, but the motion picture never seems to stretch.

","Described as, 'Inspired by real events, 'Munich' reveals the intense story of the secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and assassinate the 11 Palestinians believed to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre of 11 Israeli athletes - and the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it,' on the DVD sleeve, 'Steven Spielberg's explosive suspense thriller garnered five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director.' 'Munich' is an undeniably well-produced film; Mr. Spielberg's films generally are.After Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir explains, 'The world must see that killing Jews will be from now on an expensive proposition.,' handsome Eric Bana (as Avner Kaufman) leads Israel's covert team, assigned to assassinate the terrorists responsible for the massacre at Munich. Mr. Bana gives the film a strong, focused characterization. He gets four helpers: pre-Bond blond Daniel Craig (as Steve), bomb-maker Mathieu Kassovitz (as Robert), veteran forger Hanns Zischler (as Hans), and bespectacled diplomat Ciarán Hinds (as Carl).The team of five tracks terrorists around the world. When one is found, the film's excitement is heightened considerably. Informant Mathieu Amalric (as Louis) adds some intrigue, also. The film is slow, and the violence intermittent - but when it occurs, you practically have to scrape the flesh off your screen with a squeegee. There is an attempt to be 'fair' and/or 'straightforward' in that the film gives an 'historically fictionalized' account of a factual event. But, there is a political point being made - the film clearly questions both the righteousness and effectiveness of Israel's decision. ****** Munich (12/23/05) Steven Spielberg ~ Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz, Hanns Zischler",6,3,7,12 January 2009

","In 1944 Belgium, during World War II, handsome American lieutenant Colin Farrell (as Thomas 'Tom' Hart) is captured by the Nazis and sent to a German Prisoner of War (POW) camp. He is a US Senator's son and Yale law student; this was not supposed to happen. After some hairy distractions, Mr. Farrell ends up in Stalag 6A. He meets the prisoners' hard-nosed leader Bruce Willis (as William A. McNamara), who puts Lt. Farrell in a less than worthy barracks; it's one for enlisted men, not officers. The demotion is likely because Col. Willis knows Farrell lied to him about not cracking under German interrogation. Next, two additional men arrive at Stalag 6A. These men cause racial tension among the POWs...The conflict centers on Terrence Howard (as Lincoln A. Scott) and Cole Hauser (as 'Vic' W. Bedford). A Tuskegee pilot, the former becomes an accused black man; the latter is his white racist enemy. These men perform their supporting roles very well. However, the most memorable characterization is given by Marcel Iures (as Werner Visser). As the Nazi leader, Mr. Iures has the meatiest role. He was educated in the west (Yale, again), served in World War I and plays American jazz phonograph records. That background connects everyone...The main star, Farrell employs his Yale studies to defend Mr. Howard. The main co-star, Willis looks steely and determined. Director Gregory Hoblit and cinematographer Alar Kivilo make 'Hart's War' a fine looking film, especially during the first half.

","'For thirteen extraordinary days in October 1962, the world stood on the brink of an unthinkable catastrophe. After the discovery of Soviet weapons in Cuba, events and tension escalate between two military superpowers and within the White House. President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Bobby Kennedy (Steven Culp) and Special Assistant to the President Kenneth P. O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) are in the hot seat as they struggle to prevent nuclear war,' according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.This is an excellent dramatization of the 'Cuban Missile Crisis'; probably, it is a more accurate, more detailed explanation of events than was given to the American public at the time. Interestingly, it focuses on adviser Kenny O'Donnell; as portrayed by Mr. Costner, he is almost as important a player as the Kennedy brothers. Writer David Self and director Roger Donaldson stick with what actually happened, or what conceivably happened; unlike Oliver Stone's 1991 'JFK', which also starred Costner.Too few organizations recognized 'Thirteen Days' during awards season. It did best at the 'Satellite Awards', with wins for Conrad Buff IV's excellent editing and Mr. Greenwood's fine portrayal of JFK ('Best Supporting Actor'), along with a nomination for Mr. Self's script. The art/set direction, Mr. Donaldson, and ensemble cast are also award worthy. Mr. Culp's arms-folded portrayal of Bobby Kennedy at his most serious is uncanny.

The Great Escape," John Sturges Takes You Prisoner
","In 1942, Allied prisoners of World War II who repeatedly try to escape are placed by the Germans in a maximum security camp called 'Stalag Luft III'. As you might expect, they try to escape. Repeatedly. Giving the prisoners a lot of time to meet without supervision, the Germans may be foreshadowing the 'Hogan's Heroes' TV series that poked fun at this film. Top-billed is super-cool Steve McQueen (as Virgil Hilts). He's always earning himself solitary confinement. You'll notice Mr. McQueen looks sharper coming out of 'The Cooler' than he does going in, sliding his jacket down the wall of the cell without fear of scratching the leather. That's cool...Also billed above the title are super-nice James Garner (as Bob Hendley) and mastermind Richard Attenborough (as Roger Bartlett), who travels with English-accented Gordon Jackson (as Andy 'Mac' MacDonald). Known as a scrounger, Mr. Garner takes commendable action when told his forger pal Donald Pleasance (as Colin Blythe) should not go on 'The Great Escape' due to a disability. Garner insists on taking his friend, although it will risk the mission - and both their lives. That's nice...Most valuable players may be muscular Charles Bronson (as Danny Velinski) and his blond companion John Leyton (as William 'Willie' Dickes). These two tunnel diggers actually love each other; you can't definitively say they are gay, but you can't definitively say they aren't, either. Most surprising are the number of people who actually make it out successfully, with Australian manufacturer James Coburn (as Louis Sedgwick) being the second most likely to succeed, due to his choosing not to travel light. British sailor David McCallum (as Eric Ashley-Pitt) develops ways to disperse dirt, and Angus Lennie (as Archibald 'Archie' Ives) is a short-lived favorite...Senior British officer James Donald (as Ramsey) holds down the fort and Hannes Messemer (as Oberst von Luger) humanizes the opposition with a notably 'Best Supporting Actor' worthy performance. Nicely produced and directed by John Sturges, 'This is a true story. Although the characters are composites of real men and time and place have been compressed, every detail of the escape is the way it really happened.' Helping Mr. Sturges in the production are composer Elmer Bernstein, photographer Daniel L. Fapp, and film editor Ferris Webster.

Falsely accused as the titular 'Saboteur', Mr. Cummings recalls employee Norman Lloyd (as Frank Fry) was present during the bombing, but the defense factory has no evidence the man ever worked there, or even existed. Across the United States to New York, Cummings must evade authorities, find the mysterious Mr. Lloyd, and prove his innocence. Pretty billboard model Priscilla Lane (as Patricia 'Pat' Martin) provides part-time feminine companionship.This film featured, inarguably, director Alfred Hitchcock's favorite feature film story - the falsely accused, or 'wronged' man attaching himself to a cool blonde and being perused by both the police and criminal types 'Saboteur' contains elements which appear in many of the director prior works, and in almost every subsequent work - with it all reaching a crescendo in 'North by Northwest' (1959). This film doesn't pack the singular artistic punch as the best of the rest, but the individual sequences are masterful enough to keep it going strong until the classic ending, with Cummings obtaining Liberty from Lloyd.********Saboteur (4/22/42) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Robert Cummings, Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Otto Kruger",8,0,1,23 April 2010
Gangs of New York," Martin Scorsese Makes Crime Pay
","In the bloody backdrop of 19th century gang wars, Leonardo DiCaprio (as Amsterdam Vallon) seeks revenge against dastardly Daniel Day-Lewis (as Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting), who killed his father. As a boy, Mr. DiCaprio witnessed his father being murdered by Mr. Day-Lewis. After fifteen or sixteen years, DiCaprio returns to New York City's 'Five Points' neighborhood, and infiltrates Day-Lewis's organization, actually becoming Day-Lewis' apprentice. While waiting to avenge his father's death, DiCaprio falls in love with slutty pickpocket Cameron Diaz (Jenny Everdeane), who counts Day-Lewis among her bed partners.The DVD sleeve reminds, 'This motion picture event from acclaimed director Martin Scorsese earned 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, along with 5 Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Song! Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis star in this epic tale of vengeance and survival!' Only one of those nominations resulted in an award; Mr. Scorsese got a 'Golden Globe' for directing. But, Day-Lewis's barnstorming supporting role won several other 'Best Actor' awards.Scorsese's well-produced (and very brightly lighted) picture's theme really comes into focus during the last few minutes - that the immigrant 'Gangs of New York' were the foundations of Manhattan, New York, and (by extension) the United States. Or, 'America was born in the streets.' The ending is where the film is at its most powerful.Before that, the movie is about DiCaprio's 'Amsterdam' and how his priestly father was replaced by Day-Lewis' 'Butcher', during an orgy of violence. With his knife, Day-Lewis has 'intercourse' with the priest. He hangs is picture, and adoringly recalls, 'He was the only man I ever killed worth remembering.' Although he adds, 'I never had a son,' Day-Lewis does treat DiCaprio like his 'born' son. Many other interesting characters appear during the long running time, but they aren't developed enough to give 'Gangs of New York' the epic sweep so obviously intended.****** Gangs of New York (12/9/02) Martin Scorsese ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, John C.

Though tirelessly dedicating her hours to listing for meaning in the static of space blips, Foster takes time out for a sexual encounter when she meets handsome wavy-haired Matthew McConaughey (as Palmer Joss). Opposites attract as Mr. McConaughey is a deeply religious man. They want to mate some more, but Foster moves on when her SETI funding source is threatened...Sometime Robert Zemeckis doesn't seem like he was in Carl Sagan's 'Contact' book...So, Foster leaves McConaughey's telephone number behind, after she packs. We see her place McConaughey's number by the telephone next to the bed where they played 'hide the telescope'. The reason for this scene is unexplained, so we'll just have to assume McConaughey's number is being left for the next occupant. Or, maybe the cleaning person. Apparently, Foster's suitcases are jammed, and/or she's one of those people who don't like putting anything in her pockets. Really, she couldn't possibly have disposed of the paper any other way, because we need to play up this 'romance' and widen the audience...Also regrettable is the film's muddying of the 'science' versus 'religion' waters...Anything more on that subject could affect your viewing pleasure. Getting beyond the criticism (and physics improbabilities), you still get an exciting adventure. Foster offers up another strong characterization; amazingly, she has acquired an alien receptive look. The special effects are outstanding, and enough of Mr. Sagan's spacey thoughtfulness remains. The use of 'real' people (Bill Clinton, Larry King) is interesting and may someday lose the datedness; until then, Rob Lowe is a hilarious stand in for Ralph Reed.

Donnie Darko," What's Up, Doc?
","This is 'an edgy, psychological thriller about a suburban teen coming face-to-face with his dark destiny,' according to the promotional verbiage for the film, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as 'a delusional high school student visited by a demonic rabbit with eerie visions of the past and deadly predictions for the future.' This description hardly scratches the surface of 'Donnie Darko'. While watching the film, to enjoy a quirky, satisfying thriller, you may get the impression may be watching something more meaningful. You are. Repeated viewings (recommended) will reveal completely different films. Writer/director Richard Kelly creates more than a movie monster.'Donnie Darko' is an multi-layered, inspirational, and beautifully produced work. Most obviously, it is superbly written and directed. Mr. Kelly, who really pulls a rabbit out of his hat, should have received an 'Academy Award', along with several members of his crew; perhaps, the film's more 'independent' status was an obstacle. The cast is exceptional, from Mr. Gyllenhaal's central role, to the many supporting characterizations, right down to the smallest players. This film is full of memorable characters, arriving on the screen for a variety of reasons, and for various lengths of time, to serve a defined purpose. They're all jewels.The film is set in Middlesex, Suburbia, during 1988. Forget April, for the Darko family, October is the cruelest month. Gyllenhaal is a kid held back in high school, for burning down a house. Presently, Gyllenhaal is a disturbed sleepwalker, who is not taking his medication; perhaps, intuitively, he knows it wouldn't make any difference. Gyllenhaal lives with mother Mary McDonnell (as Rose Darko), father Holmes Osborne (as Eddie Darko), big sister Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Elizabeth Darko), and little sister Daveigh Chase (as Samantha Darko). They're all jewels.As with the entire cast, it's difficult to single out one Darko family performance. Gyllenhaal never disappoints. Secondarily, Ms. McDonnell's may be the best, due to Kelly's skillful writing. Motherly love, for a son who seems to be drifting into madness, is wondrous; the delicacy of McDonnell's performance is perfectly suited to Gyllenhaal's fragility. Even Ms. Chase, who you'd expect to be the minor Darko, is magical; she even writes about 'The Last Unicorn', Ariel (before he died in the possession of Count Petofi).The characters who exist outside the Darko family are as important. Many of them are teachers. At school, Drew Barrymore (as Karen Pomeroy) covers English literature in spectacular fashion; she challenges students' critical thinking skills, and gives Gyllenhaal guidance. As one of the film's producers, Ms. Barrymore's the most valuable member of the faculty lounge. Beth Grant (as Kitty Farmer) displays a limitless ability to multitask. Noah Wyle (as Kenneth Monnitoff) lurks in the science department, and helps Gyllenhaal consider slipping into time. Moreover, he reveals the truth about Patience Cleveland (as 'Grandma Death' aka Roberta Sparrow), who whispers: 'Every living creature on Earth dies alone.' Among the students, new girl in school Jena Malone (as Gretchen Ross) provides Gyllenhaal with love interest; and, with a dark past of her own, she's a natural. Katharine Ross (as Lilian Thurman) is a dignified and memorable hypno-therapist. Patrick Swayze (as Jim Cunningham) plays the self-help guru with a convenient focus, 'Controlling Fear'. Even small parts shine, like Jolene Purdy (as Cherita Chen). And, imaginary friend James Duval (as Frank) belongs in a very special class (note, he is not actually related to the addiction-signaling 'Harvey').Finally, the soundtrack, including original music by Michael Andrews, has to be one of the best assembled for a motion picture. From 'The Killing Moon' (by Echo and the Bunnymen) to the new 'Mad World' (by Gary Jules), the mood is always finely tuned.Look up. Plane to catch. My time's out of space.********** Donnie Darko (1/19/01) Richard Kelly ~ Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell",10,0,4,14 December 2008
Born on the Fourth of July," When Ronnie Comes Marching Home
","According to the special edition DVD sleeve: 'Tom Cruise delivers a riveting and unforgettable portrayal of Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone's Academy Award-winning (for direction and editing) masterpiece. Based on a true story, the acclaimed film follows the young Kovic from a zealous teen who eagerly volunteers for the Vietnam War, to an embittered veteran paralyzed from the mid-chest down. Deeply in love with his country, Kovic returned to an environment vastly different from the one he left, and struggled before emerging as a brave new voice for the disenchanted.' If 'Platoon' (1986) took you to Vietnam, this film will take you home. It's a tremendous, multi-award winning film for Kovic, Stone, and Cruise. Self-described 'pro-soldier' advocates have claimed Vietnam War protesters were 'anti-veteran' - which seemed illogical. Herein, they are interested in the individuals' Vietnam War support, not service - which seems logical. Of the many powerful scenes, the one with Kovic finally confessing to an incident of 'friendly fire' may be the film's greatest moment; although it didn't happen in real life; it perfectly illustrates the film's overriding thesis: 'The Truth Shall Make You Free.' ********* Born on the Fourth of July (12/20/89) Oliver Stone ~ Tom Cruise, Willem Dafoe, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J.

The Birds," Pecking Order
","Tippi Hedren (as Melanie Daniels) visits a San Francisco pet shop when Rod Taylor (as Mitch Brenner) cruises in, looking to pick up some lovebirds for his little sister. When Mr. Taylor mistakes the beautiful and alluring Ms. Hedren for an employee, she plays along, obviously attracted to the handsome man. Since the shop has none of Taylor's desired lovebirds, wealthy Hedren orders some up. Then, she decides to personally deliver them to Taylor's out-of-the-way home, on an island in Bodega Bay. After secretly delivering the lovebirds, Hedren is attacked by a seagull. The freakish incident causes Hedren to stay in Bodega Bay; there, she becomes acquainted with locals, like schoolteacher Suzanne Pleshette (as Annie Hayworth) and Taylor's mother Jessica Tandy (as Lydia Brenner).Inexplicable terror, laced with sexual desire - 'The Birds' is one of director Alfred Hitchcock's best.Worth noting: The lovebirds get excited, but never attack. Hedren makes a sensational starring debut. Brenner daughter 'Cathy' looks like Angela Cartwright for a very good reason, she's Angela's sister Veronica. The Daphne Du Maurier short story 'The Birds' (1952) only slightly resembles Hitchcock's film adaptation. An even earlier 'Battle of the Birds' occurred in the Fawcett comic 'Captain Marvel Jr. #90' (October 1950). The story, probably written by Otto Binder, provides an explanation for the madness in, 'the seeds of the Pyrrhic Plantthat drives all types of birds into a murderous rage!' ********** The Birds (3/28/63) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette",10,3,6,7 April 2008
Cinderella Man," A Working Class Hero Is Something to Be
","'In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of James J. Braddock' is how the famed writer (and boxing fan) Damon Runyon described the Boxer he dubbed 'Cinderella Man'. Director Ron Howard uses the quote to open the film. So, you are guaranteed a heartwarming story of a man who overcomes abject poverty.Russell Crowe (as Jim Braddock) begins as a moderately successful boxer, living with wife Renée Zellweger (as Mae) and their three young children. The Braddock family suffers through bad luck, cold New Jersey winters, and the Great Depression. If you've been cold and poor, you'll identify with warming socks in the stove and adding water to stretch a bottle of milk.The film's, and the leading character's, high moral tone is set when Mr. Crowe, in an early scene, brings his son to the local butcher shop; there, the boy returns a piece of meat he stole to feed the hungry Braddock family. 'No matter what happens, we don't steal,' Crowe explains. Ever. He also promises the children, 'We will never send you away,' and sobs when poverty dictates otherwise. His dedication and commitment to his wife and children are the driving force in the life of the boxer. Today, the boxing ring has been taken over, in popularity, by choreographed pretenders. But, once upon a time, you were to cause your opponent actual physical damage. Continuing to hit someone in the head until they fell, 'Knocked Out', was the prime directive. During a fight, Crowe's manager Paul Giamatti (as Joe Gould) demands, 'Fill his face with blood!' Later, Crowe's Braddock is successful enough to face wicked champion Craig Bierko (as Max Baer), who is credited as having 'killed two men in the ring.' So, the fight is promoted as a chance to witness a potential murder. Boxing and morality make strange bedfellows. But, 'Cinderella Man' is a pretty, predictable, and well-produced film.****** Cinderella Man (2005) Ron Howard ~ Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger, Paul Giamatti",6,1,2,23 December 2008
Jurassic Park," Don't Feed the Tyrannosaurus rex!
","'On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park - and help calm anxious investors. However, their visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results,' according to the film's original synopsis.This spectacular Steven Spielberg production suffers from a sophomoric sense of humor, poor pacing, and shameless merchandising - but, the dinosaurs are amazing. For bringing author Michael Crichton's prescient story to some semblance of realism, 'Jurassic Park' is still worth visiting. That the film boasts only one and a half interesting human characters can be forgiven, especially when one is Richard Attenborough. Multi-award winning dinosaur creators Stan Winston, Phil Tippett, Dennis Muren, Michael Lantieri, and their crew do not disappoint.******** Jurassic Park (6/9/93) Steven Spielberg ~ Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough",8,1,2,26 October 2009
Dodgeball," I Just Threw Up in My Mouth a Little Bit
","Couch-potatoed Vince Vaughn (as Peter La Fleur) and buff 'Happy Days' fan Ben Stiller (as White Goodman) run rival workout clubs. Mr. Stiller, the more successful gym-runner, aims to take over the property run by Mr. Vaughn, which has somehow avoided foreclosure. To settle their disputes, club members from each play in a Las Vegas 'Dodgeball' tournament, for a $50,000 cash prize. Beautiful blonde banker babe Christine Taylor (as Kate Veatch) attracts both Vaughn and Stiller.Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, 'Dodgeball' lost its singular 'Razzie Award' nomination - although Stiller may get a 'Lifetime Achievement' consolation prize, one of these years. This film's joke is, basically people get hit by balls which also happens to be how you describe something in a man's pants Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are good announcers. Rip Torn plays a raunchy urine-drinking coach. Some familiar-faced cameos liven things up a little. Very little.** Dodgeball (6/18/04) Rawson Marshall Thurber ~ Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Rip Torn",2,0,5,20 December 2009
From Here to Eternity," From Montgomery Clift to Eternity
","Fred Zinnemann's 'From Here to Eternity' is really more of a soap opera than a war story. Still, it is very well done, and very entertaining. The main attraction isn't World War II, or the soap opera story lines - the main attractions in 'From Here to Eternity' are the actors' performances.Montgomery Clift's is the 'main attraction' performance. He makes his character the central figure, despite other story lines, and his performance is mesmerizing. Every look Clift gives, every facial tic, every syllable is fascinating to watch. And, it's all very natural very character-driven. Not that all the others aren't terrific, too. Burt Lancaster is a close second, and everyone performs exceptionally well.Mr. Clift's performance helps elevate both the other performances, and the film in general. Check out how great he makes all the other actors, 'look' simply by playing a bugle. This is a case where an actor's performance affects both the other players in the scene, and even leaves its impressions in scenes where the actor doesn't appear. If you take Clift out of the film, you have a much more ordinary movie.I'm not sure, however, what/if the film is trying to say about war - is it making a statement of some kind? The main story is: Will Mr. Clift's character box (fight) or, won't he fight (box)? I guess he is bullied into fighting, but does not initiate fighting (he blinds a man, symbolically, by knocking him out in an unseen fight). I am not sure if I got the film's message, or even if there was one.I would have also made either MORE EXPLICIT or MORE SUBTLE the whole prostitution part - it was a place to have sex during the time, I guess. Donna Reed and the other women were prostitutes, I guess. Since they couldn't make it more explicit, they toned it down to make us really think these men went to town so they could exchange 'nice' smiles with 'nice' women. Elsewhere, Mr. Lancaster and Ms. Kerr's sound like they've had physical relations, when, it looked, to me, like they'd only been hit by a wave. I know this was the '50s, but filmmakers had developed many subtle ways of relaying this information for the prior half century... So, what it boils down to: This is a great wartime soap opera, with great performances. ********* From Here to Eternity (8/5/53) Fred Zinnemann ~ Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Deborah Kerr",9,10,12,14 August 2007
