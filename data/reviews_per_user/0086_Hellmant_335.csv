The King's Speech," The ratings board was established to help protect young film viewers, not punish them!
","'THE KING'S SPEECH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) One of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year and Oscar front-runner (trailing only 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' in top honor predictions) is this highly enjoyable, educational and inspirational film. It's directed by Tom Hooper (who also directed the critically acclaimed and award winning historical mini-series 'JOHN ADAMS' as well as the film 'THE DAMNED UNITED') and written by David Seidler (who's other writing credits include several TV movies and animated films as well as the 1998 Francis For Coppola / Jeff Bridges film 'TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM'). It has an impressive cast including nice turns from Geoffrey Rush, Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter. Most impressive though is leading man Colin Firth (who is expected to take home the best actor Oscar) who gives a great emotional and inspiring performance.The film tells the story of how Albert the Duke of York (Firth), Bertie to his family and friends, overcame his speech troubles and became King George VI. It begins in 1925 at a time when radio is becoming ever more prominent and requiring 'monarchs to become skilled actors' as Bertie's father King George V (Michael Gambon) tells him. After performing an embarrassing stammering speech at the Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium Bertie's wife (Carter) finds him a unique speech specialist by the name of Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Through several years of frustrating training the two form a strong friendship and Bertie eventually learns to overcome his problem (to a certain extent), which becomes a necessity after his father dies and his older brother King Edward VIII (Pearce) neglects his responsibilities and hands over the thrown.The movie is heartfelt and extremely emotional, a truly inspiring film about overcoming one's fears and insecurities. It's also a great story about love and friendship as well as being a well made and entertaining history lesson. Which is a shame considering the movie's R rating, which will keep a lot of younger viewers from seeing it. The film is about as tame and innocent as most PG or even G rated films but it does contain 17 uses of the F word as well as a few other bad words. These are all uttered in two or three short scenes involving their usage in speech therapy and done in a completely non offensive light heart-ed comedic way. The producers of the film tried hard to appeal the rating, in favor of the rightfully deserved PG-13 rating, so that more people can see the film. They argued that by slapping the film with an R rating they're depriving younger viewers of a great history lesson (not to mention an inspiring lesson about overcoming adversity). They successfully argued their case in the UK where they got the movie lowered from a 15 rating to a 12A but the American MPAA was not so wise and refused to grant the ratings change. Which is a real shame considering the ratings board was established to help protect young film viewers, not punish them. I've never had much faith in the MPAA though and have long ignored their biased and manipulated stances. It's too bad the film business relies on them so greatly though. The film is a great and important movie and should be seen by those of all ages.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",9,0,1,7 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," I'd rate this film on about the same level as the first.
","'DESPICABLE ME 2': Three Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2010 hit animated film about an evil criminal mastermind named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) working with an army of minions in a plot to steal the moon. He has a change of heart when he befriends three orphan girls. The sequel begins with Gru now a family man, raising the three girls, and working as a legitimate businessman trying to produce jam. That all changes when he's recruited by the Anti-Villain league to help stop a new powerful supervillain. The film was once again directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It features the voice talents of Russell Brand and Miranda Cosgrove, reprising their roles from the original film, and Kristen Wiig and Ken Jeong are back as well (but playing different, bigger parts than they did in the first film). Steve Coogan joins the cast this time as well and Benjamin Bratt voices the main villain (who was originally voiced by Al Pacino but he dropped out of the film because of 'creative differences'). The movie is about as clever and amusing as the first; if you enjoyed that film you're almost sure to enjoy this one as well.The film opens with the theft of a secret Arctic laboratory (by a flying vehicle using a magnet). A chemical, which mutates ordinary animals into viscous killing creatures, was inside the lab so naturally the Anti-Villain league (AVL) is concerned. They turn to Gru (Carell) for help. AVL agent Lucy Wilde (Wiig) abducts Gru from his home and transports him to the secret underwater AVL base. Once there Gru meets the AVL league director, Silas Ramsbottom (Coogan), who informs him of the laboratory heist and asks him for his help catching the supervillain responsible for it. Gru initially rejects their request but later decides to help the AVL after all. He's teamed with Agent Wilde and of course romance blossoms.The movie (like the original) captures that old style cartoon feel well. It was made on a budget of just $76 million. Compared to other big animated films that's pretty low and compared to how much money it's making that makes it a hugely profitable film (like the first)! Do I think it deserves it's humongous blockbuster success? No but I don't think any of the kids' animated films out today like this do. This one is at least better than average; It's funny (at times) and Carell and the rest of the cast are good in their parts. The minions are a little too gimmicky for me but they're funny at times as well. I'd rate this film on about the same level as the first, I'd have to watch the original again to say if it's better (because I don't completely remember it) but it's definitely a decent crowd pleasing sequel.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n28SgCY6lwc",6,0,2,10 July 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Not as good as the original but it does deliver what most fans of Wan's have come to expect.
","'INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Horror master James Wan reteams with his usual partner in crime Leigh Whannell for this sequel to their 2011 indie spook-fest hit 'INSIDIOUS'. Wan once again directed the film and Whannell wrote the screenplay (as well as co-stars in the movie). Oren Peli (who wrote and directed another low budget scary movie blockbuster 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY') produced the film with Jason Blum (the two also produced the first one together). Stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey all reprise their roles from the first film. Wilson also starred in Wan's recent blockbuster 'THE CONJURING' as well. The film picks up right where the first one left off with the Lambert family still battling ghosts trying to take possession of their bodies. It's not as good as the original but it does deliver what most fans have come to expect from Wan and Whannell. After a flashback to 1986, when Josh (Wilson) was a child (Garrett Ryan) and he first met paranormal investigators Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) and her friend Carl (Steve Coulter), the movie picks up right where the first one left off. Elise has been murdered and the police think Josh did it. Renai (Byrne) at first defends her husband but then slowly begins to question whether he's still the man she knows and loves. Have evil spirits gotten a hold of him? Only the secrets from his past can explain why the Lambert family is still haunted now. Whannell and Angus Sampson reprise their roles as paranormal investigators investigating the Lamberts' haunting.The movie has a lot of cool scenes and scares but as a whole I found it a lot less involving (than the first film, as well as Wan's other work). It's almost too fast paced; there's way too much going on without ever slowing down to develop the characters and their emotional investment in what's happening around them. For me this made the film a lot less scary and effective. Technically it's a perfect example of the genre though (mood and atmosphere are great) and if you look at the movies as just one continuous film this movie works a lot more efficiently as just the second and third acts of a bigger story. I love Wan and Whannell's style though (and Whannell and Sampson are once again comedic scene-stealers in the film). Breaking the movie down I liked and enjoyed each scene on it's own but in the context of the whole film I just couldn't get into it like I could the first. Not a bad horror film in any way just not quite as good as I was hoping.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llO-AVcYkfI",7,0,0,17 September 2013
The Lobster," An excellent analysis on our society's obsession with not being single!
","'THE LOBSTER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A very dark dystopian comedy-drama flick; about a world where single people are required to find romantic partners, within 45-days, or be turned into animals. The film was directed by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos (in his English-language film debut) and it was written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou; the duo also performed the same duties on 2011's 'ALPS' and 2009's 'DOGTOOTH' (which is an outstanding flick). It stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw, Olivia Colman, Jessica Barden and Angeliki Papoulia (who also costarred in 'DOGTOOTH'). The movie has been a critically praised indie hit, and I think it's a near masterpiece.The film is set in a dystopian world; where single people are sent to a special hotel, once they become single, and they're required to find romantic partners there (within 45-days). If they fail to do so, they're turned into an animal, of their choice, and released into the woods. People who escape the hotel are known as loners; they live out in the woods, as their own community. Loners have similar strict rules (to the contrary); prohibiting any romantic (or sexual) relations. Single people are sent into the woods, to hunt the loners down; if they're successful, they're given an extra day to find a partner. The story revolves around David (Farrell); who was recently dumped by his wife, for another man, and he's sent to the hotel (as the movie begins). David is guided through this stressful process, by his brother; who's now a dog.The film is extremely odd, and funny; but it's also very disturbing. It's shockingly brutal, and sexual, at times. It's also an excellent social commentary, on the world we now live in. That's what I like most about the film; it's definitely exaggerated (in a very dark satirical way), but it's also a great analysis of our society's obsession with not being single. Single people are often ostracized, and severely looked down upon (by the rest of society). This movie isn't really that far off, in the way it illustrates how couple's often harshly treat singles. It's also true that most people follow very strict (and severely superficial) guidelines, in finding romantic partners. Most relationships are formed out of desperation, necessity and drastic conformity. Genuine companionship, and true love, is extremely rare. That's why this movie is so brilliant; it's a nearly perfect examination on life (I'd say). It will be seen as far too weird, slow and harshly critical; for most viewers though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",9,0,3,30 June 2016
Moneyball," 'MONEYBALL' is to baseball what 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is to social networks.
","'MONEYBALL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sports biopic based on the Oakland A's 2002 season in which general manager Billy Beane used statistical data (for the first time) to assemble a winning team, overcoming the team's financial drawback. It was co-written by two of the best writers in the business, Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian, from a story by first time writer Stan Chervin which was in turn based on the book 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' by Michael Lewis. The film was directed by Bennett Miller and stars Brad Pitt as Billy Beane (as well as Jonah Hill in a great supporting turn). You don't have to know a lot about baseball (and Pitt claims to know very little) or even enjoy it at all to enjoy this film; it's more about the business of the sport as well as following the passion of one's dreams. It's a very well made and effective film on that level.The film starts out recapping the Oakland Athletics loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. We very quickly learn the team's financial handicap as it's explained to the viewer that the A's had to make do with about a third of the budget as the Yankees. They lose their three star players as a result of this and Billy Bean's dreams of winning a World Series seem almost out of reach as he asks the team's owner for more money and comes up empty handed. Then he meets Peter Brand (Hill), a Yale economics graduate working for the Cleveland Indians. Brand's ideas on building a team based almost solely on the players' 'on base percentage' value impresses Beane and also represents new opportunities for his team despite their lack of money. He hires Brand and the two follow Brand's plan wholeheartedly despite running into a great deal of opposition from the team's scouts, coach (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and just about everyone else in baseball. You don't have to know a lot about baseball to enjoy the film because there's not a whole lot of baseball in it. This film is about as much about baseball as 'BULL DURHAM' is. It's much more about the business end of baseball much like the writer Aaron Sorkin's last film ('THE SOCIAL NETWORK') was much more about the business of facebook than actually about facebook. I found it very interesting as well as informative and entertaining. Sorkin and Zaillian's script is very witty and packed with clever dialogue. It's also strong in character development and Pitt shines in the film. He and Hill have awesome chemistry together as well and Hill, like always, is a scene stealer. The rest of the cast is pitch perfect also and the directing is perfectly fitting too. It's one of those films that just hits all the right notes and leaves an impression long after viewing it (or should, I predict). If you're a baseball fan you'll probably get a kick out of it, even so, too (especially if you're an Oakland fan) for it's history and nostalgia.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOH74YX2UKA",9,1,4,27 September 2011
The Avengers," A comic book fan's orgasmic dream come true!
","'THE AVENGERS': Five Stars (Out of Five) Joss Whedon directed and co-wrote (with Zak Penn) this long awaited film adaptation of the Marvel comic book. Marvel Studios has been building a story arc to this film through five other individual comic book superhero movies (2008's 'IRON MAN' and 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', 2010's 'IRON MAN 2' and 2011's 'THOR' and 'CAPTAIN America'). They brought on Whedon (who many comic book and film fans worship) to co-write and direct the film and being a true comic book fan himself he knew exactly what the fans wanted to see. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Stellan Skarsgard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Paul Bettany all reprise their roles from other Marvel comics movies and Mark Ruffalo was brought in to replace Edward Norton as 'The Hulk'. The movie is a comic book fan's orgasmic dream come true, all other film fans and audiences should be more than pleased as well though.The story of 'The Avengers' revolves around the world peace keeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D.. Nick Fury (Jackson once again) is the director of the agency and has spent the last five Marvel movies recruiting superheroes for a special team known as the Avengers. When Loki (Hiddleston again), brother of Thor, invades the planet and steals the Tesseract, which he uses to control the minds of multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents including Hawkeye (Renner again), it's finally time for Fury to call on the Avengers to assemble and save the world. Loki wants to use the Tesseract to enslave the planet unless Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and the others can stop him. The heroes must work through their own inner demons and conflicts with each other before they can work as a team and find the strength they need to stop Loki and his army.I was expecting something much more campy and mainstream fun but Whedon takes the material very seriously and actually structured a really well written story which develops all of the key characters pretty evenly (with the exception of Hawkeye). Most comic movies kind of cheat their fans by trying more to appeal to the masses whereas this film makes the comic book audience it's target audience (as it should). It doesn't do so to the extent of losing the interest of everyone else though. For me I much more enjoyed 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER MAN 2' or 'X2' as far as comic book films go but I can really appreciate this film. It doesn't give me as big a boner as a lot of my comic book friends but it's definitely a crowd pleasing action film and one of the best of it's kind. I don't know as much about the source material as comic book nerds but I know a good movie and this is one. Whedon was definitely the right man for the job!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNk88XWi4A4",10,1,4,5 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," A fitting tribute to the cult classic original, but just a tad overrated though.
","'BLADE RUNNER 2049': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sequel (35-years later) to the 1982 neo-noir sci-fi classic 'BLADE RUNNER'; which was based on the short story 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', by Philip K. Dick. This film takes place 30-years after the original, and it revolves around a new Blade Runner, who discovers a long hidden secret which threatens their future society's way of life. He must seek out a retired Blade Runner (Harrison Ford, reprising his role from the original film), who's been missing for 30-years, in order to stop this new threat. This new chapter stars Ryan Gosling, Ford, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Dave Bautista and Jared Leto. Sean Young and Edward James Olmos also have cameos in the movie, reprising their roles from the original film as well. It was directed by Denis Villeneuve (who's also helmed such critically acclaimed hits as 2013's 'PRISONERS', 2015's 'SICARIO', and 2016's 'ARRIVAL'), and it was scripted by Hampton Fancher (who also wrote the original) and Michael Green (who also co-wrote 'ALIEN: COVENANT' and 'LOGAN', from earlier this year). Scott Free Productions (ran by the original film's director, Ridley Scott) co-produced the movie. It's received rave reviews from critics (unlike the original, which was snubbed by critics when it first came out) and it's expected to be a big hit at the Box Office as well (also unlike the original, which bombed in theaters when it was released too). Some are calling it one of the best sequels ever, and one of the best films this year. I think it was really well made, and a fitting tribute to the cult classic original, but I also think it's just a little overrated too. In the year 2049, new 'replicants' are obedient, and they serve humanity well. The old 'replicants' (from the first movie) are still rebelling against society, and they're also still being hunted down by 'Blade Runners'. While executing one 'replicant', LAPD 'Blade Runner' Officer K (Gosling) discovers a long hidden secret, that threatens their new society's way off life. He's tasked with stopping this new threat, and in order to do so he must also locate a retired 'Blade Runner', named Rick Deckard (Ford), who's been missing for 30-years. The movie is beautifully shot, and masterfully directed. It's amazing how well Villeneuve recreates the original film's feel and style (I doubt even Ridley Scott himself could have done a better job). It's also filled with decent performances; especially Ford (reprising one of his most popular roles) and Hoeks (who makes a great cold hearted villain in it). I can definitely understand why the critics are raving about it, and it does feel like a classic sci-fi movie, but it's also extremely slow-paced; and at 2 hours and 43 minutes, it's somewhat painful to sit all the way through (in one sitting). Still, the first movie is equally slow-paced (although not nearly as long), and I know multiple people that hate the original for that reason. I think those people will also dislike this sequel, for the exact same reason. Fans of the original will all (most likely) like it though. I think it's almost as good as the 1982 classic, but not quite.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/eoAny_TuUM4",9,6,20,6 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Nowhere near a great sports film.
","'MILLION DOLLAR ARM': Three Stars (Out of Five)Disney sports flick, based on a true story, about how two professional baseball pitchers, from India, were discovered by a determined sports agent; through a reality show competition. It stars Jon Hamm as the sports agent and Madhur Mittal and Suraj Sharma (of 'LIFE OF PI' fame) as the pitchers. It costars Aasif Mandvi, Pitobash Tripathy, Lake Bell, Bill Paxton and Alan Arkin. It was written by Tom McCarthy (who's written and directed such critically acclaimed hits as 'THE STATION AGENT' and 'THE VISITOR') and directed by Craig Gillespie (who also directed the outstanding 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL', in 2007). The film is undeniably inspiring, as the subject matter practically guarantees it would be, but it's also extremely clichéd and unoriginal.The story is set in 2008 when sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) was desperate to find new talent, at a cost he could afford, due to his competitors having a lot more money. One night, while watching 'AMERICAN IDOL' and cricket on TV, he came up with the idea of finding cricket players in India to bring home to America and train to be professional baseball players. Bernstein then developed a reality show challenge, in India, where Rinku Singh (Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (Mittal) emerged the winners; even though they didn't play cricket. He then brought them home to Los Angeles, where he had less than a year to get them ready for a major league try-out. Cultural differences and overwhelming pressure made this challenge nearly impossible for the two young men to overcome.The movie has a lot of heart, and is pretty emotional at times, but it's still nowhere near a great sports film. It's filled with overused stereotypes and has absolutely no signs of originality. The performances are good and the directing and story are decent but I expect a lot more from McCarthy and Gillespie (as well as the material they had to work with). They've done much more memorable work and they should be able to make a more passionate sports drama flick together. Like I said the heart of the movie is in the right place but the craftsmanship, of the filmmakers involved, is not.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/TybVNWfCjYM",6,0,2,2 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I loved every minute of it!
","'THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 1': Five Stars (Out of Five) The third installment in the blockbuster film series, based on the bestselling young adult book trilogy by Suzanne Collins. This chapter is based on the first half of the final book (titled 'Mockingjay') and deals with Katniss Everdeen (once again played by Jennifer Lawrence) having to become a symbol for the rebellion, in their war against the ruthless Capitol. It was directed by Francis Lawrence (who also directed 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE') and written by Peter Craig and Danny Strong. Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Sam Claflin, Jeffrey Wright, Stanley Tucci, Willow Shields, Jena Malone and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman all reprise their roles from the other films and Julianne Moore joins the cast. I loved every minute of it and in many ways think it's an improvement over the previous two films!The story picks up right where the last film left off; Katniss (Lawrence) has suffered a mental breakdown and is having a horrendous time adapting to life at District 13, with the other rebels. She also can't get over the fact that Peeta (Hutcherson) was taken by the Capitol and she'll do almost anything to get him back. Plutarch (Hoffman) introduces Katniss to the leader of the rebellion, President Coin (Moore), and they ask her to be their movement's symbol, in propaganda adds, to incite a rebellion. She reluctantly agrees under the condition that they rescue Peeta, and the other captives at the Capitol. The rest of the film deals with Katniss struggling to adapt to her new role, as the face of the revolution; 'The Mockingjay'.There's been some criticism over the fact that the final book was split into two films and that there's not enough action in this installment to make it as worthwhile a filmgoing experience, as the other movies. I strongly disagree. I think this chapter is much better because of it. There's so much character development and believable human drama that any true fan of film should be thoroughly satisfied. We also get some great acting; Lawrence gives the best performance of the series here and it's arguably one of the best of her career. She also has a lot of help from multiple veteran actors, like Hoffman and Moore. Peeta doesn't have nearly as much screen time, as he did in the other movies, but he's always a strong and pivotal part of the plot. Gale (Hemsworth) is in a lot more scenes, this time around, but he's still just as underdeveloped (he has one powerful dialogue moment though; where he's at least given a chance to show some acting ability). The love triangle definitely doesn't feel necessary anymore, it's obvious that Katniss loves Peeta but the certainty of how Peeta's character will end up is certainly still up in the air. I also enjoyed how much more epic this film feels, over the last two, it really feels like the first half to the conclusion of a classic sci-fi trilogy. The directing, cinematography and music are all breathtaking to watch, as well, and we get to hear Jennifer Lawrence sing! Fans that only look forward to action are sure to be disappointed but everyone else should be more than pleased!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/RGEBSjKSuEk",10,29,72,24 November 2014
Black Swan," Has a very nightmarish dream quality to it, which is one of the highest compliments you can pay a film (in my opinion)!
","'BLACK SWAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Darren Aronofsky, the mastermind director behind such classic films as 'THE WRESTLER', 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM', 'PI' and 'THE FOUNTAIN', brings us another masterpiece, this time revolving around the world of ballet. It's written by Andres Heinz, John J. McLaughlin and Mark Heyman (a buddy of Aronofsky's; co-producer on 'THE WRESTLER' and writer of his upcoming film 'MACHINE MAN'). It stars Natalie Portman, my favorite actress, who turns in an amazing performance and is the Oscar front-runner for best actress this year (which will be her first win and long overdue in my opinion). It costars Mila Kunis (who is also expected to pick up a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), she's came a long way from 'THAT 70's SHOW' and it might be interesting to note that Portman's co-star in her next film is Ashton Kutcher (Kunis's bf on the show.). Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder also co-star.Like 'THE WRESTLER' this film is another story about one's obsession with their given art form. Instead of wrestling this film centers on ballerina but they kind of play out in strikingly similar fashions, if you think about it, especially the ending. Portman plays Nina, a ballerina in New York City who is obsessed with dancing. When the top dancer Beth (Ryder) is retired due to her age Nina is the director's top choice to replace her for the next production of 'Swan Lake'. The problem is that Nina fits the role of the innocent White Swan perfectly but is unable to lose herself in the performance enough to play the darker more sensual Black Swan. So when new dancer Lily (Kunis) represents the talent needed to perform the dark role the rivalry becomes bitter between the two and warps into a weird friendship. To top it off Nina has to deal with her over controlling mother (Hershey) who gave up her dancing career when she became pregnant with Nina.The movie above all has a very nightmarish dream quality to it, which is one of the highest compliments you can pay a film (in my opinion). It's a great throwback to the classic films of decades ago, almost Hitchcockian in style. It's very dark and disturbing and although it's a dramatic character study it's also a lot like a horror film in many ways. It's not as emotionally charged and inspiring as 'THE WRESTLER', in my opinion, but it's technically perfect on all other levels; an artistic masterpiece. Some critics of the film argue that it's so over the top in melodrama that it's unintentionally funny in many ways but I didn't find that to be the case. It's dark and dramatic and maybe a little too melodramatic to really resonate emotionally with the viewer but it's still a stunningly beautiful and captivating film to watch. Highlighted of course by Aronofsky's brilliant directing and Portman's Oscar worthy performance, probably the best of the year!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw",9,3,7,18 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Kind of a step back for the series.
","'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The fourth Jack Sparrow swashbuckling adventure with Johnny Depp once again reprising the role. Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three 'PIRATES' films bowed out this time around. He's been replaced by Rob Marshall, who's former film experience is directing two highly acclaimed musicals ('CHICAGO' and 'NINE') and a romantic period piece ('MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA'). Also absent this time around are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert all returned (for the fourth time) to pen this installment. It's adapted from a book, 'On Stranger Tides', written by Tim Powers. The story revolves around a journey to find the 'Fountain of Youth'. Sparrow and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush also returning for the fourth time) are incorporated into the storyline and are pitted against Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz). The film is a little shorter and lighter weight than the others (the budget was a little slimmer and the film doesn't have quite as epic a feel). It certainly doesn't measure up to the fun of the first two films but I'd say it's equally as impressive as the third chapter.The movie opens with Captain Sparrow attempting to locate an impersonator in London who has been ruining his 'good' name. He re-teams with his old first mate Gibbs (once again played by Kevin McNally) after rescuing him from execution, for crimes allegedly committed by Jack Sparrow. The two are captured though and Sparrow is taken to King George II (Richard Griffiths) who tasks him with the assignment of finding the 'Fountain of Youth' before the Spanish do. Barbossa is now working for the British Navy (after losing the Black Pearl) and is in charge of the mission. Jack escapes and soon learns his impostor is an old love interest named Angelica, who is working with her father (the notorious pirate Blackbeard) to find the 'Fountain of Youth' as well. They force Jack in to joining their crew (which includes men turned into loyal zombies) and help them on their journey. Will and Elizabeth are replaced this time around by a young missionary named Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), who is held captive on Blackbeard's boat, and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), also imprisoned by Blackbeard, that Swift falls for.The film has most of the action and escapism thrills you'd expect from a 'PIRATES' movie. It's a little smaller scale and more simplistic than the other installments and therefore seems like kind of a step back for the series. Depp is just as quirky and funny as usual but Sparrow this time around is a lot less selfish and not nearly as much the antihero fans have come to know and love. Marshall's directing is adequate for this type of movie but it's not as impressive as Verbinski's. The film is not as convoluted a mess as the third chapter but it also lacks it's epicness and larger than life thrills. It probably won't disappoint die-hard fans of the series too much but it certainly doesn't live up to the first two installments. I've never been a huge 'PIRATES' fan but I've always respected the original two films as the fun classic swashbuckling adventures that they are. This film doesn't deserve the same kind of respect but it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the series.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5zRynRifs",7,0,1,24 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Without a doubt an improvement over the second installment, which was kind of seen as the 'GHOST BUSTERS II' of the series!
","'MEN IN BLACK 3': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their popular roles from the hit franchise based on the comic book of the same name. The film comes ten years after the last installment (which was a disappointment to fans and kind of seen as the 'GHOST BUSTERS II' of the series) and fifteen years after the original. Barry Sonnenfeld once again directs and Etan Cohen wrote the screenplay this time around (based on an idea by Will Smith, while filming the last film). The premise revolves around Smith's character Agent J traveling back in time to save his partner, Agent K (Jones), from an alien assassination that changes history and sets in motion catastrophic events which doom the present. Josh Brolin was geniusly added to the cast this time around as a young Agent K. The film is a little hit and miss but for the most part it works and should generally please most fans of the series.The film also casts Jemaine Clement (of 'THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS' fame) as it's main villain 'Boris the Animal', who is out for revenge on the man who took his arm and had him imprisoned for forty years: Agent K. After escaping his prison, on the Moon, Boris steals a time travel device that allows him to jump back in time to the day Agent K caught him (in 1969). With K now out of the way Boris is able to invade Earth with his alien race, the Boglodites, and no one is aware of K's former existence (over the last 4 decades) except Agent J. So Agent J travels back in time to stop Boris from killing K and invading Earth in the present. He teams with a young Agent K in order to do so.If you're a fan of Will Smith you'll love him here and he dominates the movie but Brolin does manage to steal his thunder with his spot-on impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones. Jones is great like always but his time is pretty limited in the film. Clement is great as the movie's villain as well and Michael Stuhlbarg (of 'A SERIOUS MAN' fame) is a scene stealer as well in a supporting role. The special effects are great and Sonnenfeld manages to keep the energy and fun going most of the time. It does get a little bogged down here and there and the script could have used multiple more rewrites but for the most part it's enjoyable. Of course it's not as memorable as the blockbuster original but it is without a doubt an improvement over the second installment. It delivers about what I expected from it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4CvTM3jrK4",7,1,3,30 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Maybe not the way a Sherlock Holmes adventure was originally intended to play out but still a lot of fun!
","'SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS': Four Stars (Out of Five) Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as, the most famous detective from literature and movies, Sherlock Holmes (created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle). Jude Law returns as his partner Doctor Watson and Guy Ritchie once again directs (2 years after the immensely popular updated original). Rachel McAdams reprises her role as Sherlock's loves interest Irene Adler, in a cameo, and Jared Harris, Stephen Fry and Noomi Rapace (the original 'GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO') also join the cast this time around. The movie is complete chaos and extremely hard to follow but it's also got a lot of great thrills and energy. I can't imagine this new Sherlock Holmes being very faithful to the original (which I know little about) but these movies are definitely entertaining in their own right.This chapter is based on Conan Doyle's 'The Final Problem' but only loosely. It revolves around the marriage of John Watson to the love of his life Mary (Kelly Reilly). When Holmes learns that his archenemy Professor Moriarity (Harris) might try and harm Watson and his new wife, to get back at Holmes, Sherlock must of course involve the good doctor in his adventures once again. The two team with Madam Simza Heron (Rapace) who's on a mission to find and save her brother, Rene (Laurence Possa), who's involved in a international conspiracy to start a world war with Moriarity (in order to gain a profit from it). It's up to Holmes, Watson and Heron to save Europe and the rest of the world.There's so much going on in this movie and it's so fast paced that it's almost impossible to keep up with. This left me a little frustrated, to say the least, for a large percentage of the movie. Still Downey and Law are once again fantastic, as well as the rest of the cast, and Ritchie's directing is at it's stylized best. Even though I didn't completely know what was going on for most of the movie I still enjoyed it. It's definitely very funny and action packed. Maybe not the way a Sherlock Holmes adventure was originally intended to play out but still a lot of fun.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lBzdmfUfA",8,1,2,3 March 2012
The Monuments Men," Part 'INDIANA JONES', part 'OCEAN'S ELEVEN' and part 'KELLY'S HEROES'!
","'THE MONUMENTS MEN': Three Stars (Out of Five)George Clooney directed, co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this comedy-drama war flick about a group of soldiers, during World War II, who set out on a mission to retrieve stolen art masterpieces from Nazis. The film was also co-written and co-produced by Grant Heslov (a usual partner of Clooney's) and is based on the book 'The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History' by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter. It features an all-star cast which also includes Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett. The movie is a bit of a mess, amusing at times but poorly put together by Clooney (who just can't seem to prove much talent as a director).The story is loosely based on actual historical events and revolves around a team of soldiers (during World War II) who are assigned (by FDR) to rescue famous pieces of art from Hitler's army. Frank Stokes (Clooney) leads the unit (which is nicknamed 'Monuments Men') and puts together an odd group of art historians, museum directors and curators (who all know very little about actual combat). Stokes knows that the Nazis will destroy the stolen art and he thinks it's worth risking lives in order to preserve our culture. His platoon of friends agrees with him and they embark on the adventurous journey, into Germany, together.The film raises an interesting question about whether preserving art and culture is worth the cost of lives or not. I think it's up to the person putting their life in jeopardy; people brave life-threatening dangers for all kinds of things that are important to them. So the message of the film might feel more meaningful to some viewers and more trivial (or even offensive) to others. It's funny that Matt Damon did also co-star in another World War II flick which raised the question of whether it's OK to risk multiple lives to save just one (in an attempt to relieve the grief of the soldier's mother); 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'. I do like the idea of the movie and what Clooney was attempting to do but he has a lot to learn about making a consistently solid film. The movie has good moments and decent performances but it's too all over the place to confidently recommend it. At times it does feel like part 'INDIANA JONES', part 'OCEAN'S ELEVEN' and part 'KELLY'S HEROES'. If a movie stitched together with all those different pieces sounds like fun to you you might really enjoy it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TT6LZ7cFI",Null,0,2,21 February 2014
Your Name.," Not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film.
","'YOUR NAME': Four Stars (Out of Five)The blockbuster Japanese animated fantasy drama, about a high school girl, in rural Japan, and a high school boy, in Tokyo, that switch bodies. The film was written and directed by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Makoto Shinkai. It's gotten almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's also broken Box Office records all around the world (including becoming the 4th highest grossing film in Japan's history). I enjoyed the film as well.Mitsuha (Stephanie Sheh) is a high school student that lives in Itomori, a rural town in the mountains of Japan. She is very unhappy with small town life, and dreams of moving to Tokyo. Taki (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a high school student living in Tokyo, that also works at a local Italian restaurant (part-time). He aspires to become an architect. One day the two magically switch places, thinking it's just a dream, and their lives are never the same again. I'm not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film. I can definitely see why it's such a huge hit at the Box Office too, and with critics, and not just in Japan. Of course they're already planning an American remake as well (with J.J. Abrams producing). The switching bodies story gimmick has been done many times before, but the body swapping of a male and female high school student seems somewhat fresh and original. Where the filmmakers take the story is also interesting and involving. There's of course some silly coming-of-age humor in it too, and it's far from a perfect movie, but it's definitely a well made and entertaining one (in my opinion).Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",8,1,2,30 November 2017
Captain Phillips," An impressive film with many flaws.
","'CAPTAIN PHILLIPS': Four Stars (Out of Five) Director Paul Greengrass's Oscar hopeful based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking of 2009, which was the first American cargo ship hijacked in 200 years. It's told from the point of view of the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, and based on his book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea'. The events of the story have been greatly contradicted and detested by Phillips' crew, creating a controversy around the film. I doubt the movie is a truthful telling of what actually happened in any way but it's still a good film. Greengrass's direction is once again masterful and the script by, Billy Ray (who's also co-written films like 'THE HUNGER GAMES', 'FLIGHTPLAN', 'HART'S WAR' and 'BREACH', which he also directed), is intense and involving. The film is too long and drawn-out and filled with Hollywood clichés but it builds to a breathtaking conclusion and Tom Hanks, as the title character, gives one of the best performances of the year (and his career).The film takes place in April 2009, off the coast of Somalia, onboard a container ship called MV Maersk Alabama. We first meet it's captain, Richard Phillips (Hanks), as he's driving to his ship, in America, with his wife Andrea Phillips (Catherine Kenner). We know little about him other than he's worried about how current times have gotten much tougher for younger generations. We next see him at sea with his crew as he prepares for the worst and is then attacked by Somali pirates. They're led by a skinny young Somali named Muse (newcomer Barkhad Abdi). We also meet Muse at home, first, where he's barely surviving (like everyone in his community) and is forced into piracy. Phillips is able to ward off Muse and his men momentarily but they later board his ship and terrorize his crew. The captain does his best to protect his men and get the pirates off his ship.Captain Phillips' crew say they were highly offended by the film and that it was 'just horrendous' to see a Hollywood movie depicting the arrogant and reckless Phillips, that jeopardized their lives to save time and money, as some kind of a hero. He was actually anything but and received several e-mails warning him of the piracy in the area but kept them from his crew and went off-course anyway (into pirate areas, despite his crew's cries not to). I usually don't have a problem with filmmakers taking creative license, and changing source material or true events, but in this case I do think it was distasteful. To make a film about a seemingly immoral man, who put his crew into such a torturous life-threatening situation and present him as a hero is morally wrong and offensive to the people involved. Just judging the film as a fictional movie though, and not based on any real people or true events, I do think it was a well made film. Flawed in pacing but strikingly moving in character development and, like I said, the ending is amazing. Hanks is truly astonishing and the film does do a good job of depicting the Somali pirates in a sympathetic way and showing how they were forced into a horrible situation they couldn't get out of (just like a lot of us). The filmmakers also casted inexperienced Somali actors in the pirate roles (through a worldwide casting search) and they were all good and convincing in the film (especially Abdi). The movie is an impressive film with many flaws, and can be seen as offensive, but it's still worth the watch in my opinion. It probably doesn't deserve all the Oscar hype (or future award recognition) though. Except for Hanks.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",8,1,3,18 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good and entertaining 'STAR WARS' film despite what angry, uptight nerds say!
","'STAR WARS: EPISODE I – THE PHANTOM MENACE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) 'THE PHANTOM MENACE' was recently (last February, 2012) rereleased in theaters as a 3D reissue and although the 3D conversion added little to the film it was definitely fun to see the movie in theaters again (and I saw it on Valentine's Day no less!). This first chapter in the series (fourth released film though) is perhaps the least popular with 'STAR WARS' fans but it's the most successful of the series financially and well liked by the general public. I really enjoyed the film (even being a 'STAR WARS' fan) although I have the same problems with it most fans do (I hate Jar Jar Binks and wasn't impressed with the casting of Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywaler) but it's still a lot of fun despite it's flaws. Probably the most true to the original series of the prequels.This prequel is of course set decades before the events of the original three films when Anakin Skywalker (destined to become Darth Vader) is just a young boy. The Trade Federation is attacking Naboo (a peaceful planet) with plans to take control of it. While confronting the leader of the Federation, Nute Gunray (Silas Carson), two Jedi Knights, known as Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), are attacked. They escape and head to Naboo to warn the Queen there (Natalie Portman) of the Trade Federation's evil plans. They flee together to Tatooine where they meet Anakin. Right away Qui-Gon knows he's important.The movie is classic Sci-Fi and a great action adventure film. Some feel that writer/director George Lucas (performing both duties for the first time since the original film) geared it too much towards kids (rather than the now adult original fans) but the movies were always supposed to be kids films. True Jar Jar and Lloyd are more annoying than anything previously seen in a 'STAR WARS' film but there's a lot to praise in the film as well. An all-time great movie villain (Darth Maul) and one of the coolest fight scenes ever in a movie (between him and the two jedi). There's the crowd pleasing pod race scene plus tons of other great action. We get the beautiful Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson giving the best acting performance of any 'STAR WARS' film (the acting and dialogue went severely downhill in the next two installments). Once you get past it's flaws the movie is still a lot of fun! It was the funnest of the prequels to see in the theater (for me; having been 16 years since the last film). 'THE PHANTOM MENACE' is a good and entertaining 'STAR WARS' film despite what angry, uptight nerds say and the rerelease is nostalgic fun!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QlrJnwsHOM",9,9,14,15 May 2012
Sucker Punch," 'SUCKER PUNCH' is a great punch to the senses, nothing more!
","'SUCKER PUNCH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Zack Snyder (the director of 'WATCHMEN', '300', the 2004 'DAWN OF THE DEAD' remake and last year's 'LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE') brings us another visually vibrant action packed fantasy thrill ride. This one he co-wrote with Steve Shibuya and it's his first film not based on other material. While the film is as visually satisfying and enthralling as any of his previous works it lacks the story and character development that made those other films truly great. The film features a gorgeous ensemble cast of tough twenty something girls as the action heroine leads (including Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung) and delivers everything else a teen boy could possibly want to see on screen (as well as many older men) despite it's lack of emotional involvement. In this area it's quite stunning and impressive though.Browning stars as Baby Doll, a twenty year old young woman who's institutionalized in a 1950's insane asylum by her stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) after trying to stop him from molesting her sister. The stepfather bribes the main orderly in charge, Blue (Oscar Isaac), into arranging an illegal lobotomy for the girl. With just five days until this impending doom Baby Doll befriends four other girls and devises a plan of escape. In order to help her process this nightmarish situation she's found herself in she creates two alternate realities. In the first fantasy she's a new dancer at a brothel owned by the mob and is set to lose her virginity to an important client in five days. She then escapes into another fantasy world in which she's a Japanese school girl warrior and must battle giant Tengu samurais, orcs, robots and dragons in order to retrieve five items which will lead to her freedom. In this world she's guided by a wise old man (Scott Glenn).The movie is titled 'Angel Wars' in Japan and has been described as ''Alice In Wonderland' with machine guns.' I like the sound of that but I think it's giving the film just a little too much credit. I admire the overall story and mood of the film and what it attempts to do but I think it could have been greatly improved by a tighter rewrite. The directing is once again topnotch and continues to prove that Snyder is one of the best fantasy / action directors working in film today. Like George Lucas, James Cameron, Bryan Singer and other comparable directors his eye for creative visuals and thrilling action is much more impressive than his emotional depth and character development. Here, working with material all his own for the first time, we see that's definitely the case. We know little about any of the characters in the story really and the fantasy scenes are so emotionally detached from the rest of the film, due to our understanding that none of it is in fact real, that they lose some of their thrill and awe as well. Still the movie is extremely entertaining and so full of enjoyable eye candy that it's hard to complain about any of the film's flaws too much really. It delivers what fan boys want and is an incredibly fun time at the movies despite it's short comings. It could have been better though.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIAZ2104LOU",9,4,8,27 March 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," More of the same trash that's populated the rest of the series
","'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1': One Star (Out of Five) The first of a two part adaptation of the fourth (and final) book in the immensely popular vampire teen romance saga (by Stephenie Meyer). Kristin Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner and the rest of the cast all return to this excruciatingly drawn-out chapter. Melissa Rosenberg wrote the screenplay once again (she's written every film adaptation in the series) and Bill Condon (of 'DREAMGIRLS' fame) directed this time around. If you've hated the other chapters in the series you'll undoubtedly hate this one as well but oddly even a lot of fans are severely disappointed with this film (which surprises me because most of the things that are awful in it have been awful the entire franchise, so I didn't really notice anything that different.) It is undeniably the worst of the series though, for me it wasn't that much more painful to watch than any of the others.This time around Bella (Stewart) marries Edward (Pattinson), much to Jacob's (Lautner) disappointment. Jacob is even more upset when he finds out, at the reception, that Bella plans to consummate her marriage to Edward while she's still human (which could hurt or even kill her). A great deal of the film is then spent with Bella and Edward on their honeymoon and the dangers of vampire/human sex become more and more apparent. Things especially become gloomy when Bella realizes she's pregnant with a nonhuman baby. This puts her in grave danger when the wolf pack learn of the pregnancy and decide they must stop it.This film is pretty much just more of the same trash that's populated the rest of the series but things just drag on more. The dialogue and acting are atrocious and Stewart (the strongest actor of the series) is severely underused and her part is underwritten. There's a strong pro-life message, even at the risk of the mother's life and bringing a possible deadly demon in to the world, that a lot of people have a problem with and there's a lot of life threatening sex. The movie is a joke like all the others and like all the others it is extremely humorous in unintentional ways and entertaining just due to it's overwhelming cheese factor. Some fans of the series will enjoy it but most will hate it and no one should see it, unless you're just looking for a good laugh I guess.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8",2,6,8,14 December 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," My expectations were very minimal but I have to say I loved it!
","'THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Coming of age teen drama film about a depressed and introverted high school freshman who befriends two seniors and his English teacher and finds a new reason to live. The film is written and directed by Stephen Chbosky who adapted it from his own epistolary novel. It stars Logan Lerman (of 'PERCY JACKSON' fame), Emma Watson (of 'HARRY POTTER' fame) and Ezra Miller. It also features supporting turns from Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusack, Kate Walsh, Mae Whitman, Johnny Simmons and Tom Savini. The book is considered a modern classic and has developed a big cult following. Now the film has developed cult status as well and I'd say deservingly so. Lerman stars as Charlie, a fifteen-year-old beginning high school who recently lost his best friend to suicide. He has mental problems of his own that stem back to his relationship with his aunt (Melanie Lynskey), who died when he was still very young. Charlie is extremely shy and afraid to meet new people but quickly takes a liking to his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Rudd), as he also admires him. He then befriends a quirky senior named Patrick (Miller) and his stepsister Sam (Watson). Patrick and Sam introduce him to their friends, a group of offbeat high school misfits and Charlie finds happiness for the first time. He also develops romantic feelings for Sam, who is of course sadly taken. I knew little about the book (although I had heard the name before) prior to seeing the movie and the adds didn't really sell the film that well to me. So my expectations were very minimal but I have to say I loved it. The acting is all exceptional, especially by it's three leads. It's nice to see Emma Watson growing from her 'Hermione' role, Ezra Miller is a memorable scene stealer and Logan Lerman packs an emotional wallop as the powerful heart of the film (Paul Rudd shines in his brief part as well). Stephen Chbosky is a brilliant writer and director and he really has made a classic teen coming of age film. The soundtrack is uplifting and the perfect touch to the film and although some of the subject matter is very depressing it's ultimately an inspiring and heartfelt film. I found the lead character very relatable (in his introverted loner ways) so perhaps the film moved me a little more than it might some others but I think it's a wonderful film for everyone!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA",9,1,2,9 January 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," A truly great sci-fi classic (at least it will be)!
","'10 CLOVERFIELD LANE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sci-fi sequel to the 2008 low budget monster flick hit 'CLOVERFIELD'. The film was once again co-produced by J.J. Abrams, and it was directed by first time feature filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg. It was scripted by Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken and Damien Chazelle (the writer and director of 2014's critically acclaimed hit 'WHIPLASH'). The story deals with three survivors, trying to wait out an alien invasion in an underground bunker; only they are unaware of what the world is really like outside, and one of them might be dangerously insane. It's based on a spec script, by Campbell and Stuecken, and it's been called a 'spiritual successor' to 'CLOVERFIELD', by Abrams (but not a direct sequel). The film stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher, Jr.. The critics have raved about the movie, and it's a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well. The story begins with a woman named Michelle (Winstead), on the run from her fiancÃ© Ben (voiced by Bradley Cooper). While driving though rural Louisiana, her car is struck by a pickup truck; and she's knocked unconscious. She wakes up, locked up in an underground bunker; believing she's being held captive there, by a man named Howard (Goodman). Howard (Goodman), and another man there named Emmett (Gallagher, Jr.), explain to her that the world is under attack; and she's being kept there for her own safety. I'm a fan of the original 'CLOVERFIELD', and I like this sequel even more. In some ways it's a lot like it's innovative predecessor, and in other ways it's completely different. It's made on a similar (but smaller) budget (of just $15 million), and it's set in the same world; but with different characters, a different setting, and different monsters. It's also not filmed in the same 'shaky-cam' found footage format; which I'm a fan of, but I'm happy that the filmmakers took a different approach. The acting is much better, this time around, and the characters are a lot more interesting and engaging (I also like the creatures and special effects a lot more). It's also cool how the movie makes a completely different tonal change (at the end). It's almost like two different films; which has been criticized by some, but I loved it. It's a truly great sci-fi classic (at least it will be).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U",9,0,5,17 March 2016
The Finest Hours," Extremely predictable, old fashioned Disney filmmaking.
","'THE FINEST HOURS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Disney's new historical disaster flick, directed by Craig Gillespie; who also helmed Disney's 'MILLION DOLLAR ARM', as well as 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL' (which is outstanding) and the 2011 'FRIGHT NIGHT' remake! The film was written by Eric Johnson, Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy; and it's based on the 2009 book 'THE FINEST HOURS: THE TRUE STORY OF THE U.S. COAST GUARD'S MOST DARING SEA RESCUE', by Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman. It tells the story of four Coast Guard members, who daringly faced one of the worst storms in East Coast history; to rescue the crew of a sinking oil tanker. The movie stars Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, Eric Bana, Kyle Gallner and John Ortiz. It's classic, and extremely predictable, old fashioned Disney filmmaking.The movie is part disaster flick, and part corny romance film. It focuses on Bernard 'Bernie' Webber (Pine); a crewman for the Coast Guard, stationed at Cape Cod. He falls in love with a young woman there, named Miriam Pentinen (Grainger). She proposes to him, and while Bernie is asking his commanding officer, Daniel Cuff (Bana), for permission to marry Miriam (which was custom then); one of the worst storms, in East Coast history, hits the area. Bernie then volunteers, to lead a four man team to rescue the crew of a sinking oil tanker (the SS Pendleton). The film is cheesy, and just like dozens of other movies, that came before it; but most of those came out dozens of years ago (with the exception of 2000's 'THE PERFECT STROM'). It definitely has a classic, old movie feel to it; and Gillespie's direction is very fitting. The film has a few good inspiring moments; but for the most part it's corny, too long, and dull. The effects are good, but the acting is bad (especially Pine in the lead). It should please it's target audience though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4",6,5,11,5 February 2016
The Equalizer," All action and no substance; that's OK sometimes though.
","'THE EQUALIZER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua team up again, for the first time since 'TRAINING DAY' (13 years ago), for this feature film adaptation of the popular 80s TV series (of the same name). Washington plays a former government agent, named Robert McCall (the role was originated by Edward Woodward), who comes out of retirement to help those in need of his special skills; in this film it's a young prostitute, who's been beaten by the Russian mobsters she works for. It costars Chloe Grace Moretz, Marton Csokas, David Harbour, Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo. It was written by Richard Wenk and based on the TV series created by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim. If you like 80s exploitation action flicks you'll love this movie! Robert McCall (Washington) was a very lethal, and expertly skilled, black ops operative; who worked for an unnamed government agency. He's now retired and trying to live a peaceful life, while working at a hardware store, in Boston Massachusetts. When a young call girl he knows, named Teri (Moretz), gets into trouble with the Russian gangsters she works for, McCall feels compelled to come out of retirement and help her. He becomes a one-man killing machine once again! The film is a lot more violent than I was anticipating. It's gratuitously violent; like the beloved 80s action flicks that used to glamorize excessive blood and gore (there's many scenes of Denzel using various tools, from his store, to brutally murder bad guys). If you don't have a problem with that, and enjoy movies full of it, you'll love this movie. I enjoyed it quite a bit but I used to like this type of movie, a lot. Denzel is great in the film and Fuqua does some awesome stylized directing; but it is all action and no substance. That's OK sometimes though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI",8,2,5,1 October 2014

","'THE EXPENDABLES 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sylvester Stallone and the rest of the all-star action heroes that starred in the 2010 blockbuster (Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture and Terry Crews) reprise their roles for this sequel and they're joined by newcomers Jean-Claude Vann Damme, Chuck Norris, Scott Adkins, Nan Yu and Liam Hemsworth. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis (who had cameos in the original film) reprise their roles as well and play much bigger parts this time around. Stallone handed over directing duties to Simon West (director of such popular B action films as 'CON AIR', 'LAURA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER' and the 2011 'THE MECHANIC' remake also starring Jason Statham). Stallone once again co-wrote the film though, this time with Richard Wenk, Ken Kaufman and David Agosto. If you're a fan of the original and action films in general you're almost sure to enjoy this action lover's dream! The story revolves around Barney Ross (Stallone) and his crew of mercenaries once again being put on a dangerous assignment by CIA agent Mr. Church (Willis). He tasks them with stopping five tons of plutonium from falling in to the hands of a ruthless terrorist known as Jean Villain (Van Damme). They fail and one of their men is killed. So now it's up to Barney and his men to not only stop Villain and save the world (basically) but also get revenge for their fallen comrade. They find help from a few other rival expendables including Trench (Schwarzenegger) and Booker (Norris).The film has some amazing action scenes as one should expect featuring the cast it does. The story is once again almost non existent and the pacing a little slow (during the second act) as it's built much like a Bond film; blowing it's wad in the beginning and then building to a powerhouse conclusion while lacking the same kind of thrills in between. The movie does lack Stallone's directing touch as well (he's a much better director than West) but West is more than adequate in the genre too. I was a little disappointed the movie didn't take itself a little more seriously as it's constantly winking at the audience and plays itself out pretty tongue in cheek. Some would say it's more of a parody than an exciting action film and it definitely does have a lot of fun with itself. It you're just excited to see all of these guys together and relive the action genre's glory days you should be more than pleased. It is nice to see Schwarzenneger and Willis with more screen time this time around and actually getting in on the action but it's also a little disappointing to see so little of Jet Li as he exits the film pretty early on due to scheduling conflicts (I think). The opening delivers about everything you paid for in the price of admission though and then there's still almost 90 minutes of film to go. Stallone and Van Damme's fight scene is also one of the highlights of the film as well. Not quite as good as the original but for me and die hard fans it's still 'Nostalgia Heaven'!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo",9,9,18,20 August 2012
War Dogs," Cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain!
","'WAR DOGS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'men behaving badly' comedy flick from writer/director/producer Todd Phillips (the man who also brought us 'OLD SCHOOL', 'ROAD TRIP', 'DUE DATE' and all three 'HANGOVER' movies). The film is based on a Rolling Stone article, by Guy Lawson, about two twenty-something arms dealers, that land a U.S. contract to supply weapons to Afghanistan military forces. Phillips directed, co- produced and co-wrote the movie; with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic. It stars Miles Teller, Jonah Hill, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak and Bradley Cooper (who also co-produced the flick). The movie's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's done mildly well at the Box Office. I liked it, but it's definitely no 'HANGOVER' (it is far better than it's two sequels though).David Packouz (Teller) was working (unhappily) as a massage therapist, in Miami Beach during the Iraq War. His girlfriend Iz (Armas) unexpectedly became pregnant, and David decided he desperately needed a new source of income. So when he runs into his old childhood friend, Efraim Diveroli (Hill), at another old friend's funeral, he learns he can make a lot of money selling guns to the U.S. military (like Efraim already is). The two form a partnership, and get rich (really fast), but they also run into some serious problems.The movie is only loosely based on true events; a lot of it is entirely made up (which makes for a more entertaining film, of course). It's nice to see Phillips branching out as a filmmaker (and I really wasn't impressed with the two 'HANGOVER' sequels), and it's also cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain. Teller is perfectly cast as the relatable lead, but he's capable of much more than this though ('WHIPLASH' is one of the greatest movies ever made, in my opinion). This film is fun (at times), and kind of interesting. It's a little too dark, to be a lot of fun though, and a little too light, to be really interesting (in a very serious way, anyway). The performances are good though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WJl7HNQ4N_4",8,1,6,22 August 2016
Source Code," 'TWELVE MONKEYS' crossed with 'QUANTUM LEAP', eight minutes at a time!
","'SOURCE CODE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Director Duncan Jones follows up his critically acclaimed low budget sci-fi hit 'MOON' with this critically acclaimed low budget sci-fi hit, although the film is more fantasy than science fiction since the science of it is not grounded in reality at all. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, one of my favorite actors, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright. It was written by Ben Ripley (who's only other film writing experience is in direct to video and TV 'B' movie horror films, like two 'SPECIES' films) and was filmed on a budget of just $35 million. The film tells the story of a soldier who travels into the body of a man killed by a terrorist explosion for the last eight minutes of his life, repeatedly, in hopes of finding information that will prevent the terrorist's next attack. It's sort of like a variation on 'TWELVE MONKEYS' or 'QUANTUM LEAP' (Scott Bakula even has a cameo in the film). While the movie is completely over the top and unbelievable it's still a very well made and entertaining film.Gyllenhaal plays Captain Colter Stevens, a former airman stationed in Afghanistan who, as the movie opens, unexpectedly finds himself in the body of another man sitting on a train. After eight minutes the train blows up and Stevens then comes to in a capsule communicating with another military officer named Carol Goodwin (Farmiga). He discovers he's part of a military program called 'Source Code' and must continue to reenter the man's body for the last eight minutes of his life until he can gather enough information to discover the identity of the terrorist responsible for the explosion and lead authorities to his capture before he strikes again. While doing so he falls in love with another passenger on the train (Monaghan) and becomes obsessed with saving her life even though he's told it's impossible.The story is far-fetched but the characters are involving and believable. While the concept of the film is kind of routine and unoriginal the script is well written in it's details. The performances bring a lot of heart and emotion to the film, especially Gyllenhaal (like always) and Farmiga, and the directing is top notch. In many ways Duncan's two films are very similar in their core. They both deal with a man who unwittingly finds himself the tortured victim of a science experiment meant to serve a greater good. While this film is not quite as clever or interesting as 'MOON' it does match it's strengths in character development and emotional drama. Duncan is definitely a promising up and coming director and I can't wait to see what he does next.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",8,0,2,1 April 2011
Skyfall," A nice 50th anniversary piece, for the series, and fans will love it!
","'SKYFALL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The 50th anniversary of the James Bond series brings us the third appearance of Daniel Craig as Bond in it's twenty-third film. Judi Dench makes her seventh (and final) appearance as M in her biggest turn as the role yet. Javier Bardem also co-stars as the movie's main villain. The film was directed by Sam Mendes (of 'AMERICAN BEAUTY' fame) and written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who also co-wrote the last four Bond films) as well as John Logan. The story revolves around a computer drive, with a list of British secret agents on it, falling in to the wrong hands. The movie is masterfully directed by Mendes and features more than a handful of spectacular action scenes that Bond films are loved for. One of the better films of the series.The movie opens with Bond and another MI6 agent, named Eve (Naomie Harris), in Turkey in hot pursuit of the mercenary, Patrice (Ola Rapace), who stole the list of undercover NATO agents. Patrice escapes and Bond is believed to be killed. The MI6 commander, M (Dench), is being pressured to retire because of the incident when MI6 is hacked and eight agents are killed. Bond learns of the attack and returns to London, after letting everyone think he was dead for months, and is returned to active duty despite failing his aptitude tests (which M keeps secret, even from Bond). Bond then teams with Eve once again to find out who's responsible for the attack on MI6, as more agents are killed, and tracks the culprit to an island in China.I've always found good Bond films to have great elaborate action scenes but to be light on pacing and excitement in between. This film is actually much faster paced than most others in the series. It's really exciting and involving all the way up to the last 40 minutes when it seems to drag a little and go on for too long. It appears to climax at about an hour and forty minutes but then unexpectedly takes another turn and continues on (somewhat needlessly) for another 40 minutes. The ending is still action packed and somewhat exciting but by the time it gets there it's ran a little low on steam. This is a flaw in my opinion but not a great one. It's still better than most other Bond films and Craig and Dench are outstanding in it once again (Bardem is also an excellent bad guy). The script is routine but a little more emotionally involving than usual, especially involving M's character, and Mendes is perfectly apt at directing a Bond film. It's a nice 50th anniversary piece, for the series, and fans will love it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",9,28,56,14 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Does Downey Jr. deserve over ten times the pay of any other 'AVENGERS' cast member?!
","'IRON MAN 3': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Robert Downey Jr. returns to his most popular and iconic movie role (based on the Marvel comics superhero) 'Iron Man' (a.k.a. Tony Stark) for the fourth time (after playing the role in two other 'IRON MAN' films and 2012's 'THE AVENGERS', for which he was paid a whopping $50 to $70 million). Returning to their roles for the third time are Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's girlfriend Pepper Potts, Jon Favreau as security guard Happy Hogan and Paul Bettany as the voice of Stark's robotic companion Jarvis (it's actually the fourth time for Paltrow and Bettany if you count their cameos in 'THE AVENGERS'). Don Cheadle returns to play Stark's buddy Colonel James Rhodes for the second time (after replacing Terrence Howard from the first film). Joining the cast this time around are Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall, James Badge Dale, Stephanie Szostak, William Sadler, Miguel Ferrer and Ty Simpkins (as the first kid sidekick in any 'Avengers' film). Favreau handed off directing duties to Downey Jr.'s pal Shane Black, who directed Downey in the 2005 action buddy film 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' (which he also wrote). Black penned an assortment of other popular 80s and 90s action buddy films as well like the original 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'THE LAST BOYSCOUT' and 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT'. He co-wrote 'IRON MAN 3' with Drew Pearce. The movie doesn't quite live up to the original two 'IRON MAN' films or 'THE AVENGERS' but it's still an excellent inclusion in the popular franchise.After the events of the alien invasion in 'THE AVENGERS' film Stark (Downey Jr.) now suffers from PTSD and spends most of his time making obsessive improvements to his 'Iron Man' suit (as well as building many others). As a result he's been neglecting Pepper (Paltrow) as she's visited by a man from both their pasts, scientist Aldrich Killian (Pearce), who works in regenerative healing research. A new terrorist, going by the name of 'The Mandarin' (Kingsley), has been bombing innocent civilians and harms Starks security chief Happy Hogan (Favreau). This pisses Stark off causing him to threaten the terrorist on TV as well as give him his address. 'The Mandarin' retaliates by attacking Stark at his home and putting both Pepper and an old fling of Stark's (Hall) in danger. Stark's suit is severely damaged as he's forced to battle his enemy with only his ingenuity and the help of a 10-year-old boy (Simpkins). When Pepper is kidnapped and put in grave danger as well Stark is forced to overcome all his inner demons in order to save the day.The story is based loosely on six-issues of the comic from 2005 and 2006 involving the 'Extremis' story arc. 'Extremis' is the regenerative technology Killian's character is working on in the film. I didn't like this element of the movie so much but I did like the PTSD storyline and it was very interesting to see the otherwise super confident superhero suffering from panic attacks throughout the film. This is where the film's greatest strength lies. Of course the Tony Stark character is always one of the greatest comic superheroes to watch and Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as him. Does he deserve over ten times the pay as any other 'AVENGERS' cast member? I don't know but he is a joy to watch here once again and he does help make the film. Black was the perfect director to replace Favreau and the other additions to the cast are good as well. Pearce and Kingsley aren't nearly as memorable or powerful villains as the ones in the first two films though and Black's screenplay isn't quite as clever or well written as those other movies either. Still it is a good addition to the series; flawed but still about as much as you can expect from the third installment in a blockbuster action series like this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",9,3,9,8 May 2013
Child 44," Doesn't quite come together right, I still enjoyed it though.
","'CHILD 44': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A mystery thriller film; starring Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and Gary Oldman. Hardy plays a security officer, that's investigating a child murderer, in 1950s (Stalin era) Soviet Union. The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Richard Price; it's based on the novel, of the same name, by Tom Rob Smith (the first of a trilogy of books). It also costars Joel Kinnaman, Vincent Cassel and Jason Clarke. The movie was a bomb at the box office, and got mostly negative reviews from critics, but I enjoyed it.Leo Demidov (Hardy) is a former war hero, that now works as an MGB agent, in the 1950s Soviet Union. He's a strong supporter of Stalin, and his country's ideals, but when a series of children start turning up dead, his loyalty is put to the test; being that murder is not supposed to exist there (it's believed to be only a capitalism crime). When his partner's son is killed, he refuses to go along with the government's cover-up (of the crime), and he's exiled; along with his wife (Rapace). Despite their treatment, Leo continues to pursue the killer, and justice. The movie is well directed, written and full of great performances; especially Tom Hardy (my favorite male actor). Some people have a problem with the fact that the actors all speak English, in the film, but with Russian accents; that didn't bother me. I actually like the characters (especially Hardy's) and the insightful political commentary of those times; I found the movie to be quite involving as well. Maybe one of the main problems, with the film, is that the first cut was 5.5 hours long; and now it's less than 2.5 hours. It's a lot of story, and character development, crammed into one movie. The film is actually pretty fast paced too, it just doesn't quite come together right. I still enjoyed it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/5zwAFiaOqq4",7,5,9,28 August 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Not enough character development to really care about the characters, but technically well made.
","'DEEPWATER HORIZON': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The new disaster flick about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (which also caused a humongous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico); the catastrophe is the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history (which also killed 11 workers, and injured 17 more). The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, Gina Rodriguez, Dylan O'Brien, John Malkovich, Kate Hudson and Ethan Suplee. It was directed by Peter Berg; who's also teamed with Wahlberg on the 2013 war film 'LONE SURVIVOR', and the upcoming historical disaster flick 'PATRIOTS DAY'. The script was written by Matthew Sand and Matthew Michael Carnahan; it was based on the The New York Times' article 'Deepwater Horizon's Final Hours' (written by David Barstow, David S. Rohde and Stephanie Saul). Due to it's $156 million budget, the film is a pretty big disappointment at the Box Office; but it has done well with critics. I'd say it's about as good a film as I expected it to be. The true story takes place on April 20, 2010; on the oil rig Deepwater Horizon (about 40 miles from the Louisiana coast). The drilling unit was owned by Transocean, and drilling for BP. The blowout, and explosion (on the rig that day), caused it to burn and sink; and release thousands of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This film focuses on some of the 120 crew members, that were on board; including Mike Williams (Wahlberg), Jimmy Harrell (Russell), Andrea Fleytas (Rodriguez) and Caleb Holloway (O'Brien).The film is technically impressive, and it's well made. Berg is a talented director, at making this type of movie, and Wahlberg and Russell are great at acting in them. Although the performances are good, I don't think there's enough character development to really care about the characters. So the movie is not nearly as emotional as it wants to be. I also think spending $156 million on a film like this is ridiculous; how did the producers ever think they were going to make their money back?! It is intense, and suspenseful though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MPT8bbqblmM",7,0,1,4 October 2016
Resident Evil: Afterlife," For the most part it gives the genre fans what they want.
","'RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Video game adaptations are almost never successful at the box-office but studios have been working out the kinks to their problems over the last several years (I really liked 'PRINCE OF PERSIA') and they're actually planning many more, realizing that there's a higher built in fan-base for them than even comic book films. The 'RESIDENT EVIL' franchise is one of the few exceptions; it's already kicking out a 4th installment, that killed at the box-office opening day, and it doesn't look like it's the last (It's rare for any franchise to go beyond two sequels). The fans, for the most part, seem overwhelmingly pleased (as of this writing, on it's 2nd day of release) the film has an average IMDb user rating of 7.8 out of 10, from 2,503 votes, and 62.5% of those are a perfect 10! This is a much higher rating than any of the previous three installments and I've heard it's due to the movie's killer 3D effects (which it's only the second film to be made using the state of art 3D effects that 'AVATAR' did, as opposed to converting the movie to 3D after filming) and also the fact that this chapter is supposedly more faithful to the video games (I wouldn't know, I've never played any of them). Writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson (who many consider to be a hack, but just as many also love) once again directs this fourth chapter, after only previously directing the first (although he wrote and produced all four films).Milla Jovovich returns to her signature role of Alice (a character that isn't from the video games, I know because I read a lot of movie talk). This film takes place right where the last one left off and Alice is leading a team of her clones in an attack on the Umbrella Corporation, the evil big business (representing 'the man') that unleashed a deadly virus on the world, in the first film, which turned most of the world's population into zombies. Alice is the only person that has been successfully combined with the virus (known as the 'T' virus), which gives her super telepathic abilities as well as inhuman speed and strength. After her big attack on the corporation a new deadly villain (played by Shawn Roberts), who's also been linked with the virus to different results, strips her of the virus and makes her human again. She then meets up with an old friend named Claire (once again played by Ali Larter, and she is a lead character from the game) who has amnesia and doesn't know who she is. The two follow a signal, promising a safe haven from the virus, to Los Angeles and meet up with another random group of strangers trying to escape a building surrounded by zombies. The problem is Alice's plane only holds two. So, with the help of a mysterious prisoner there (played by 'PRISON BREAK's Wentworth Miller), they try to find an escape route to safety and the radio signal, coming from a ship, promising it.The movie does have amazing 3D visuals, which is how I saw it, if not for them I might have gone a half a star lower. Some of the stylized action seems played out and repetitive but for the most part it's entertaining. I wish there would have been more use of the zombies and other creature elements (which it still has it's fare share of) but for the most part it gives the genre fans what they want. I don't know how well it lives up to the video games but I like how each installment has a different feel to it; this one feels more like a traditional zombie movie to me, event though the zombies are in it less. Milla is once again a great action heroine and the supporting cast delivers what you'd expect from this type of film, although Shawn Roberts as the bad guy is too cheesy for me and not in a good way. The movie as a whole is about at the same level as the other three installments, with the second being a little lower and the original being a little higher. I think it's everything it was meant to be and just that.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",7,8,17,11 September 2010
It," Great to see an R-rated horror movie become such a huge blockbuster!
","'IT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The first installment in a planned duology, based on Stephen King's popular 1986 book (of the same name); which was previously adapted into a two part TV movie miniseries in 1990 ('IT' was divided in to two chapters in the same way). This installment deals with seven children that have to fight an ancient evil being (in 1980s Derry, Maine); the sequel will deal with the children 30-years later, having to fight the same entity as adults. The movie stars Jaeden Lieberher, Bill Skarsgard, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard (of 'STRANGER THINGS' fame), Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer and Nicholas Hamilton. 'IT' was directed by Andy Muschietti (who also helmed the hit 2013 horror flick 'MAMA'), and 'IT' was written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman. 'IT' has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and 'IT' is a huge hit at the Box Office as well. I absolutely loved 'IT' too.The story (in this updated version) is set in 1989 Derry, Maine. Several children have gone missing, including Bill Denbrough's (Lieberher) 7-year-old brother George (Jackson Robert Scott). Bill and his other preteen friends, a group that calls themselves 'The Losers Club', investigate the disappearances of George and all the other kids. They find that an evil entity, known as Pennywise The Dancing Clown (Skarsgard), is responsible for all the disappearances. In order to fight the monster, they must each confront their own worst fears. I read the book and saw the original TV miniseries, when I was a kid, and I was a big fan of both. I think this theatrical adaptation is about as good as you could expect from 'IT'. 'IT' has a great 80s style 'kids on an adventure together' feel to 'IT'. 'IT' seems effectively scary, and it's also a good 'monster flick' action movie. Pennywise is a classic villain, and I'd say this version is about as good as the 1990 one (played by Tim Curry). The film is not as classic (for me) as the 1990 one, but I can't complain about anything in 'IT'. It's also great to see an R-rated horror movie become such a huge blockbuster at the Box Office; hopefully this means will get more R-rated horror flicks (instead of the routine PG-13 ones).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/SXjABrLbV7A",Null,2,7,13 September 2017
Hereditary," So well made that it will leave you creeped out and disturbed for days!
","'HEREDITARY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new critically acclaimed horror flick about a family that begins to experience supernatural hauntings, after the death of their estranged grandmother. The film was written and directed by debut feature filmmaker Ari Aster, and it stars Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Gabriel Byrne, Milly Shapiro and Ann Dowd. The movie is a modest hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics. I absolutely loved it!After the death of their reclusive grandmother, the Graham family begins having disturbing (and quite terrifying) experiences. They also learn more about their mysterious ancestry, as depression sets more and more in for some. Severe mental illness also begins to cause havoc for the Graham family, especially for the mother, Annie Graham (Collette). The shocking death of yet another family member soon leaves Annie at a mental breaking point too, and the rest of the family begins feeling haunted as well.The film is one of those hauntingly memorable horror flicks, that's so well made that it will leave you creeped out and disturbed for days after you leave the theater (at least if you're someone that's sensitive like me). I love horror films, and I really respect a movie that can make me feel this way. The climax and the ending of the film are so classic, and masterfully effective, that I ultimately had to give the movie the highest rating possible as well. Collette also gives one of the best performances of the year so far too. The film truly is a must see for any die-hard horror fan, or just a movie lover in general as well!",10,25,52,15 June 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Awesome over the top action scenes directed by Bekmambetov in his usual creative style!
","'ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER': Four Stars (Out of Five) The popular 2010 mashup book by author Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the 2009 zombie take on Jane Austin's classic book ('Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'), comes to the big screen! The film was directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (who also directed the vampire films 'NIGHT WATCH' and 'DAY WATCH' as well as 'WANTED'), produced by Tim Burton and written by Grahame-Smith himself. It stars Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rufus Sewell, Jimmi Simpson and Benjamin Walker in the title role. The movie is a decent monster flick with some great action scenes but has almost no depth or emotion to offer. Visually it's stunning though (especially in 3D).The film tells the story of America's 16th (and arguably most popular) President having a secret life as a vampire hunter. It begins with his childhood in 1818 when he befriended an African American boy named William Johnson. Abraham defends his friend from being beaten one day and gets his father Thomas (Joseph Mawle) in trouble with the plantation owner he works for named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), who's also a vampire. Barts takes Abraham's mother's (Robin McLeavy) life one night in retaliation and Abe becomes obsessed with revenge. One night as a young adult man (after his father passes away) he attempts to take his revenge on Barts when he meets Henry Sturgess (Cooper) who informs him of the vampire world and trains him to be a vampire hunter. Abraham later learns of a vampire plot to take over the country and uses his powers as President to stop them.The movie, like I said, has awesome over the top action scenes directed by Bekmambetov in his usual creative style. It's packed with CGI and is probably best viewed in 3D. The film is somewhat surprisingly serious (which a lot of critics have criticized it for) rather than taking a more fun and campy approach to the material. It's also said to have strayed quite a bit from the book but the author did write the screenplay himself and was greatly involved in the film's production. It's definitely his (and Bekmambetov's) vision so book fan's can't complain about someone else butchering the author's work. I found the film to be a bit slow in places and dry. I wasn't entirely impressed with the casting of Walker as Lincoln and think a better actor could have done a lot more with the role. Despite lacking much substance the film is still a lot of fun and the premise is so brilliant and entertaining that the filmmakers really couldn't go that wrong. I liked it; it's definitely not for everyone but fans of vampire movies and historical fiction might get a good kick out of it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0mEP_zzoQ",8,3,6,25 June 2012
If I Stay," Teens, and die-hard fans of the book, might fall for this sappy junk; but everyone else will be bored!
","'IF I STAY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Teen melodrama flick, based on the popular YA novel (of the same name) by Gayle Forman. It tells the story of a teenager who has a major 'out-of-body experience', after being in a severe car accident, in which she must decide whether to go on living, or die; as her family did. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teen, and costars Jamie Blackley, Mireille Enos, Joshua Leonard, Liana Liberato and Stacey Keach. It was directed by R.J. Cutler and written by Shauna Cross (who also wrote the outstanding 2009 teen drama flick 'WHIP IT', and the novel it was based on). I found this movie to be pretty boring, and excessively cheesy as well.Moretz plays Mia Hall; a teenager that's in love with classical music, and playing cello, despite the fact that her parents, Kat (Enos) and Denny (Leonard), are really into rock music; and her dad was in a mildly successful alternative rock band (when he was younger). She falls in love with a rocker from school, as fate would have it, named Adam Wilde (Blackley). Just when she's deep into making really tough and dramatic teenage decisions, about her new love life, her family is involved in a horrific car accident; and Mia falls into a coma. She then experiences life 'out-of-body' and must decide whether to keep living, or pass on; as her parents did. Mia's past life is told through flashbacks.I like the premise of the movie, and I do like well made films adapted from young-adult novels, but this movie is just poorly made. It's way too melodramatic and badly paced; it's even excruciatingly dull at times. Both the director and the writer have made better movies than this, but they really dropped the ball here! I also like Moretz, in other films as well, but she gives a pretty unimpressive performance here too. Stacey Keach is the only person that does anything impressive, in this movie, but his part is too brief. Teens, and die-hard fans of the book, might fall for this sappy junk; but everyone else will be bored.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o",5,6,9,22 February 2015

I found it to be extremely well made and involving.The film begins with a police raid of a private party, in 1967 Detroit, which then resulted in multiple days of rioting. The story then centers on a police raid of the Algiers Motel, on July 25th, where police believed a sniper fired on them from. The raid resulted in the terrorizing of several black suspects, and two white women, and the deaths of some of those involved. The story then shifts to the court room battle that followed the incident.The movie is interesting, and pretty intense, from pretty much the opening scene until the last. All of the performances are good in it as well, and of course Bigelow's direction is almost flawless. For me the film was also very educational, as I knew very little about these events in history (prior to seeing the movie). I think the film is yet another great example of what a talented filmmaker Bigelow is, and obviously her and Boal make a great team together too. It's also cool to see Boyega in another strong starring role; a 'STAR WARS' actor that's actually making a name for himself (outside of the franchise) is always good to see.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/W6So6Kz52VQ",9,33,69,9 August 2017
John Wick," John Wick is about as much of a badass action hero character as I've seen in a film!
","'JOHN WICK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Shoot-'em-up action flick starring Keanu Reeves as an ex-hit-man who comes out of retirement to avenge his dead dog. It was directed by first time feature filmmakers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (former stuntmen and fight coordinators) and written by Derek Kolstad. The film also stars Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe. It's a pretty cool and stylized action flick that's also a great comeback for Keanu Reeves.Reeves plays John Wick; a former hit-man who retired when his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), became deathly ill with cancer. As he's grieving he receives a posthumous gift from her, in the form of a puppy named Daisy. It's explained, through a letter from Helen, that she wanted John to have the dog to help him cope with her passing. John quickly becomes attached to Daisy; so when Russian gang members break into his house and kill the dog, as well as steal his '69 Mustang, John decides to come out of retirement to get revenge. Nyqvist plays the father of one of the gang members, as well as John's former employer.John Wick is about as much of a badass action hero character as I've seen in a film and Reeves is great in the role. I think Reeves has gotten much better, as an actor, overtime; probably especially because his career took a pretty big downward turn recently. It's great to see him back in action and cooler than ever. I think filmmakers will do a lot more with this character as well, he's already a part of the video game 'Payday 2', and a film franchise seems very likely. The movie is also a great showcase for Leitch and Stahelski, as directors, and I can't wait to see more from them too. If you're an action fan you definitely don't want to miss this one!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/N3ywdecCULw",9,8,22,29 October 2014
Gravity," I didn't think it was that good!
","'GRAVITY': Four Stars (Out of Five)This sci-fi 'man vs. nature' disaster film has already won over critics and audiences alike (in the first week of it's theatrical release) and is now considered the frontrunner to win 'Best Picture' at this year's Oscars (which would make it the first science fiction film to ever do so). It's directed by acclaimed Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (who also helmed such critically loved films as 2006's 'CHILDREN OF MEN', 2004's 'HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN' and 2001's 'Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN'). He co-wrote the film with his son Jonas, which is about two astronauts lost in space while struggling to survive the elements and make it home alive. The film stars just two actors: Sandra Bullock and George Clooney (along with the voice talents of Ed Harris, who has appeared in other classic space films like 'APOLLO 13' and 'THE RIGHT STUFF', and a few others). Bullock does give a very impressive performance and Cuaron's direction is once again topnotch but it's the 3D visuals that really make this film a one-of-a-kind experience.Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first mission in space. Clooney plays Matt Kowalski, the commanding astronaut of the flight on his last space mission before retiring. They're on a routine spacewalk attempting a tune-up of the Hubble Space Telescope when debris (from the destruction of a Russian satellite) comes hurdling their way. The debris damage their shuttle beyond repair and kills the rest of their crew, leaving Stone and Kowalski adrift in space tethered just to each other. Communications with Mission Control are completely lost as the two attempt to make their way to the International Space Station near by.The film has been praised by my favorite filmmakers James Cameron (who received a 'special thanks' credit at the end of the movie, along with some of my other favorite directors like David Fincher and Guillermo del Toro) and Quentin Tarantino. Cameron called it 'the best space film ever done'! It's also been praised by real life astronaut legend Buzz Aldrin and almost every film critic. It's guaranteed to get multiple Oscar nominations and (like I said) is now predicted to take home the top prize. I didn't think it was that good. I enjoyed the movie but didn't find it to be one of the very best of the year. Technically it's a flawless masterpiece and the 3D is amazing but it's not as visually striking (or nearly as good a film) as Cameron's own 'AVATAR'. Bullock does give one of the better performances of the year playing a character that's similar to another classic sci-fi heroine: Ellen Ripley (in vulnerability and resilient strength) and the 'man vs. nature' storyline is always a compelling one but this movie mainly works as a beautiful visual feast and little more. Does it deserve to win best picture and all the critical praise it's been getting? No... but it is definitely still worth seeing for the scenery alone.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",8,1,2,11 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Action scenes that should thrill any war film junkie!
","'LONE SURVIVOR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Peter Berg's new war film, based on the book of the same name by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson. The book is based on Luttrell's real-life experiences as a Navy SEAL during the War in Afghanistan. The movie focuses on a (failed) four-man mission, he was involved in, to capture a Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. Berg wrote, produced and directed the film (as well as has a cameo in it, like most of his movies) and Mark Wahlberg stars as Luttrell. The film also features Taylor Kitsch (who also worked with Berg in 'BATTLESHIP' and the TV show 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS'), Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Eric Bana and Alexander Ludwig in supporting roles. It's an exciting action movie and a nice tribute to our soldiers; another impressive achievement from Peter Berg (after a slight misstep with 'BATTLESHIP').The 2007 book 'Lone Survivor' begins with Marcus Luttrell's enlistment (in 1999) and also focuses on his training and deployment to Afghanistan (in 2005). Berg decided the movie should only detail the failed Navy SEAL mission he was involved in, called 'Operation Red Wings', to capture Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami), a notorious Taliban leader. In that assignment Luttrell (Wahlberg) was part of a four-man reconnaissance team which also included LT Michael P. Murphy (Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Hirsch) and Matthew Axelson (Foster). In the film the men must take on 50 Taliban soldiers (in reality it was a lot less, some say as little as 8 to 10).Like most of Berg's movies the film is action-packed for most of it's running time (at least the entire second half) and the war scenes are brutal and violent. They're of course filmed in a very cinematic way but Berg did have multiple war veterans as technical advisors (as he usually does), including Luttrell. The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is all more than adequate. The character development is very minimal and there's not really much of a story but it still drives home it's message of camaraderie and brotherhood. It has a lot of heart and action scenes that should thrill any war film junkie. For fans of Berg or war flicks it shouldn't be missed!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",9,0,3,16 January 2014
Wind River," I got pretty teary eyed multiple times throughout the film.
","'WIND RIVER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new crime-thriller from acclaimed screenwriter Taylor Sheridan; who also wrote 2015's 'SICARIO' and 2016's 'HELL OR HIGH WATER'. Sheridan also directed the film, in his sophomore directorial effort (following the 2011 horror flick 'VILE'). The movie stars Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson (Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch together again) as a US Fish and Wildlife Service agent, and an FBI rookie, trying to solve a murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like Sheridan's other two screen writing efforts), and it's also been a success in it's limited theatrical run at the Box Office so far (also like Sheridan's other recent movies). I found it to be pretty dang good. Cory Lambert (Renner) is a US Fish and Wildlife Service agent who's currently investigating the killing of livestock at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. While trying to find the den of the suspected lions involved, Lambert comes across the body of an 18- year-old female resident. The FBI sends a rookie agent, named Jane Banner (Olson), to lead the Tribal Police there in their investigation. Due to Lambert's skills at tracking in the area, Banner asks him to assist them as well. Their efforts soon lead them to some very dark, and brutal places. Places that Lambert is very familiar with, having also lost a daughter there (the same age) in a similar way. The movie starts out a little slow, in my opinion, and then it keeps picking up pace, until a very intense and dramatic conclusion. The climax is definitely my favorite part of the film, but it's also very dark and violent (and you have to have some patience to get to it). The character development, and performances, are both excellent though (Renner is always good outside of Marvel movies, I think). I got pretty teary eyed multiple times throughout the film as well. It's another near masterpiece from Sheridan, in my opinion, and he proves himself as a very talented director here too.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j_XDrmlMJNY",9,1,6,30 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," It's good if you don't mind really dark political humor, based on actual tragedy.
","'THE DEATH OF STALIN': Four Stars (Out of Five)A historical political satire about the Soviet power struggles that arose from the death of Stalin. It's based on the French graphic novel 'La mort de Staline', by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin. It was directed by Armando Iannucci, and it was scripted by Iannucci, David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows. The film stars Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Jeffrey Tambor, Andrea Riseborough, Rupert Friend, Jason Isaacs, Michael Palin, Paddy Considine, Olga Kurylenko and Adrian McLoughlin. It's gotten almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it's playing in indie theaters now. I found it to be really witty and always interesting, it's also definitely dark and disturbing though. The story takes place in 1953 Moscow, when Joseph Stalin (McLoughlin) has a brain hemorrhage and collapses. The members of the Central Committee all panic, and become divided on what should be done about it. Some, including the chief of police Lavrentiy Beria (Beale), devise plans on how they can benefit from the loss of leadership. The entire movie is played out in an extremely satirical way, with lots of comical political commentary. The film is definitely always amusing, and pretty funny. The cast is all brilliant in their performances, and of course the script is extremely witty and clever. I also learned a great deal about that particular time in history, although I've read that the film is filled with inaccuracies about it. It's also an extremely horrific and dark subject matter obviously, so it does seem odd to play it out in such a seemingly lighthearted comedic way. If you don't mind really dark political humor, that's based on actual historical tragedy, you should probably enjoy it.",8,1,4,25 May 2018
Fury," I especially like the performances of LaBeouf and Lerman.
","'FURY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)World War II war flick written and directed by David Ayer (who also performed both duties on multiple cop movies like 'END OF WATCH', 'HARSH TIMES' and 'SABOTAGE'; he also wrote 'TRAINING DAY' and directed 'STREET KINGS'). It stars Brad Pitt as a U.S. Army Staff Sergeant leading a crew of men into battle in Nazi Germany, in a Sherman tank, on the last days of the European Theater. It costars Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal and Michael Peña. It's pretty gruesome, and very dark, but also a fitting tribute to the soldiers who gave their lives in that hellish war.The story takes place in April of 1945, as the Allies battle bravely to take control of Nazi Germany; during the last month of the European war. Pitt plays Don 'Wardaddy' Collier; the leader of a M4A3E8 Sherman tank, and it's five-man crew. The film centers on each man as they horrendously fight off Nazi soldiers, behind enemy lines. It especially focuses on the relationship between Wardaddy and an inexperienced private, named Norman Ellison (Lerman).The movie is very bloody, and disgustingly violent, and there is some controversy over how accurately it depicts the horrors, and atrocities, of World War II. One of the technical advisors on the film, a World War II tank gunner named Don Evans, says the violence shown, in the movie, is much worse than he remembers (and he wasn't looking forward to seeing it, on the big screen). All of Ayer's films are extremely brutal though, and he did grow up in South Central Los Angeles, so if you can stand the gore I'd definitely still recommend it. The directing is technically (near) perfect and the character study, being presented, is extremely fascinating. I especially like the performances of LaBeouf (one of my favorite actors) and Lerman. Pitt is really good too (but he still always seems like Brad Pitt, in the movie). If you like and respect war films I'd definitely recommend this movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/GmFPW994ONg",9,1,5,24 October 2014
Fight Club," 10th greatest movie of all time!
","'FIGHT CLUB': Five Stars (Out of Five)Director David Fincher's epic masterpiece is now one of the most beloved movies of all time by film buffs but when it was originally released in theaters it was considered a box office and critical failure. The film was made with a budget of $63 million but grossed just a little over $100 million in it's initial theatrical run. Critics were pretty split on the film with the positive reviews being extremely positive and the negative reviews being extremely negative (which is always the sign of a great movie in my opinion). It was one of the most talked about and controversial films released in 1999 and was heavily criticized for it's violence and (what was seen as) immoral content. The movie went on to be a huge hit on DVD, making it's studio a big profit, and quickly developed a cult following. As it's grown immensely in viewer popularity, since it's release, critics have also changed their tune as well (which is often the case). Many now cite it as a great, ground breaking film and most of it's negative criticisms have all but disappeared. The film is based on the 1996 novel, of the same name, by Chuck Palahniuk. It was adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. It tells the story of an unnamed 'everyman' (Norton, who also narrates the film) who works for a traveling automobile company and hates his job. Suffering from depression and severe insomnia he attends several different support groups as a form of relief (pretending to have different problems for each one). He meets a woman, named Marla Singer (Carter), at one who appears to be pulling the same scam. He also meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt), on a flight, and he forms a bizarre relationship with him as well. Durden and our narrator turn to fighting one another at a bar one night as a form of therapy and this later develops into a 'fight club' which attracts a lot of other men with similar problems. 'FIGHT CLUB' was named the 10th greatest movie of all time by Empire magazine readers (in 2008) and also currently claims that same ranking on IMDb's Top 250 movies (voted on by IMDb users). That's about where I'd place it on my 'all time greatest films' list. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors and I'd say it's arguably his best movie (although for me 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' would be a tough rival). I really liked it when I first saw it in 1999 but I actually, initially, liked a few other films even better that year (like 'DOGMA', 'THE SIXTH SENSE' and 'AMERICAN BEAUTY') but with each viewing I've come to like it even more and I'd now say it's probably my favorite movie of 1999 (as well as one of my top ten favorite films of all time). Anyone who's seen it knows how powerful it is but it holds many different qualities and meanings for each viewer. Without going into the twist and all the different layers to the plot and characters here I'll just say it's a movie that really speaks to me. It did when I first saw it in 1999 and it does even more now. I'd say it's arguably one of the greatest films of all time (and I'm definitely not alone in that viewpoint).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A",10,0,2,28 March 2013
Train to Busan," It definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.
","'TRAIN TO BUSAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A South Korean zombie apocalypse horror flick, about passengers on a train to Busan that are trying to survive a zombie outbreak. It was directed by Yeon Sang-ho (who's only previous experience is in writing and directing animated horror and thriller movies), and it was written by Park Joo-suk. The film stars Gong Yoo, Kim Su-an, Jung Yu-mi, Kim Eui-sung and Ma Dong-seok. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it was a blockbuster at the international Box Office (breaking multiple records). I really enjoyed it as well.Seok-woo (Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who's obsessed with his job and has made little time for his young daughter, Soo-ann (Su- an), in recent years. Seok-woo has promised to take Soo-ann to Busan, to see her mother, but of course things don't go as planned. A zombie outbreak spreads throughout the train, and seemingly everywhere in the area. Seok-woo, and his daughter, must work together with other passengers on the train, to survive the trip and hopefully make it somewhere safe. At the same time Seok-woo tries to prove to his daughter what a good father he can still really be (by becoming a badass zombie fighter).The film has some great special effects, and awesome (brutal) zombie action scenes. It's a great dark horror movie, with biting social commentary on the battle of the rich verses the poor (despite how cheesy it might sound). It's also a surprisingly emotional character study, with a pretty diverse (and well developed) group of characters. The film is a lot of fun, it's satisfying to horror fans, and it's even got some decent drama in it (and acting).

Darkest Hour," Educational, and well acted, but admittedly very slow-paced.
","'DARKEST HOUR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A war biopic starring Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, when he first became prime minister in 1940. It was directed by Joe Wright, and it was written by Anthony McCarten. The film costars Lily James, Kristin Scott Thomas and Ben Mendelsohn. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, it's a modest hit at the Box Office, and it's also another upcoming Oscar hopeful (specifically Oldman for Best Actor). I found the movie to be both educational, and well acted. In May of 1940, during World War II, Winston Churchill (Oldman) was made British Prime Minister, after Neville Chamberlain's (Ronald Pickup) forced resignation. Churchill had a poor reputation with others at this time, and he faced a lot of opposition from Parliament. Especially with negotiations for peace (or lack there of). The film centers on this conflict. It also focuses on Chruchill's relationship with his wife (Thomas), and his new secretary at that time (James).I knew little about this specific time in history, before seeing the movie; or at least if I had known much about it, I had forgotten it. So for me, the film was a good history lesson. It also (of course) delivers an outstanding performance from Gary Oldman, and I think Lily James shines in the movie as well. The makeup is pretty impressive too. The film is admittedly very slow-paced though, and it's kind of boring at times as well. It definitely took some effort for me to sit through it all, despite it's multiple qualities.",7,0,3,4 January 2018
The Maze Runner," Like a YA merging of 'LORD OF THE FLIES' and 'LOST'!
","'THE MAZE RUNNER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another Young-Adult book adaptation; this one is based on the first novel (of the same name) in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi trilogy, by writer James Dashner. The film tells the story of a sixteen-year-old boy who wakes up in the center of a maze, inhabited by other teenage boys, and is surrounded by viscous mechanical monsters. It was directed by first-time feature filmmaker Wes Ball and written by first-time feature film writers Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin. The movie stars Dylan O'Brien (of TV's 'TEEN WOLF' fame), Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Aml Ameen, Blake Cooper, Kaya Scodelario and Will Poulter. I found it to be pretty entertaining, and well-made, for a YA movie! O'Brien plays Thomas; a sixteen-year-old kid who wakes up in an old elevator, in the middle of a grassy clearing, surrounded by other teenage boys. He has no memory of who he is, or how he got there, but he does remember his name, after getting in a fight with another boy (Poulter), the first night. He soon learns that all of the other boys awoke in a similar fashion and they've built a community there, which they call the Glade. He also finds out that 'the Glade' is at the center of a deadly maze, surrounded by vicious monsters. No one has ever made it out of there alive but designated 'runners' investigate the constantly changing maze everyday, before it's doors close at night. With the arrival of Thomas things start to change, for the better and worse, for the first time.The film is a little like a cross between 'LORD OF THE FLIES' and 'LOST'. It's of course not nearly as interesting, or thrilling, as either of those cult classics but it is kind of like a YA merging of them. For a movie based on a popular teen book it is pretty dark and suspenseful. The premise is engaging and the acting is all decent enough. The film is definitely not nearly as good as the best YA movies (like 'THE HUNGER GAMES' or 'DIVERGENT') but it is better than most. Hopefully the sequels (with bigger budgets) will be even better. I'll be there.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI",8,1,4,24 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I cried!
","'ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The tenth live-action film in the epic sci-fi franchise (counting two Ewok television movies); and the first standalone 'STAR WARS' film, in a new planned anthology series. The story is set shortly before the events of 'A NEW HOPE'; and it revolves around the Rebel Alliance's attempts to steal the design schematics for the Death Star. They recruit a criminal named Jyn Erso, to help them accomplish this mission. The movie was directed by Gareth Edwards (who also helmed the 2010 indie sci-fi hit 'MONSTERS', and the 2014 'GODZILLA' reboot); and it was written by Chris Weitz, Tony Gilroy, John Knoll and Gary Whitta. It stars Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Alan Tudyk, Jiang Wen, Riz Ahmed, Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker and the voice of James Earl Jones (once again reprising his iconic role of Darth Vader). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and fans alike (including filmmaker Kevin Smith, and series creator George Lucas). I absolutely loved it!The story revolves around a young woman named Jyn Erso (Jones); who is arrested by Imperial soldiers, but then rescued by a small team of Rebel forces. The Rebel Alliance has learned of an extremely powerful (and gigantic) weapon, being built by the Galactic Empire, called the Death Star. Jyn's father, Galen (Mikkelsen), helped design it, and the rebels want Jyn to help them find him. She assists a team, lead by Cassian Andor (Luna), on this important mission (that we all know leads to the events of 'A NEW HOPE').This is the prequel that fans have been waiting for; the film that many had hoped 'THE PHANTOM MENACE' would be (or at least one of it's two sequels), but this actually delivers (where George Lucas previously failed)! I'll admit it's not as fun as any of the other 'STAR WARS' movies, but it is epic (and pretty emotionally dramatic). It's a slow-building character driven drama (with lots of great action as well). The performances are all good, and the dialogue is well written (much like last year's 'THE FORCE AWAKENS'); it also doesn't have any of the lame silly kids' humor, that Lucas's prequels were filled with. There's even some great nostalgic throwback scenes (but it's not nearly as heavy on them as 'THE FORCE AWAKENS' is). Going into the film, I knew pretty much how it would all play out (as anyone that knows the earlier 'STAR WARS' movies, by heart, should); but I still loved watching it all unfold! It's a 'STAR WARS' film, and it's also it's own beautiful sci-fi tale; I cried (like I often do at movies that really move me like this). It's another 'STAR WARS' masterpiece!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GAMlEeVv1H0",10,5,18,16 December 2016
This Is the End," Rogen and Goldberg rival the likes of Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith with this film!
","'THIS IS THE END': Five Stars (Out of Five)   The funniest movie so far this year is this apocalyptic comedy with  Seth Rogen and all his real life buddies playing asshole caricature  versions of themselves while trapped in James Franco's house as the  world comes to an end. The film also features actors Jay Baruchel,  Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson. It has great cameo turns  from Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Channing Tatum and many others as well.  The movie was directed by first time film directors Seth Rogen and Evan  Goldberg and also written by the duo (the team has wrote multiple other  hit comedies together like 'SUPERBAD', 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS', 'THE GREEN  HORNET' and 'THE WATCH'). They also wrote the short this film is based  on, 'JAY AND SETH VERSUS THE APOCALYPSE', with it's director Jason  Stone. That 2007 short also starred Rogen and Baruchel as two guys  trapped in a room together as the world ends. Rogen and Goldberg not  only continue their reputation as great comedic writers here but also  prove themselves to be excellent directors. They rival the likes of  Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith with this film; it's that funny!   The film begins with Seth Rogen picking up his long time best bud Jay  Baruchel at the airport. The two haven't seen each other in a while and  go back to Seth's place to celebrate (by watching movies on a 3D TV and  smoking weed). Seth then talks Jay into going to a party at James  Franco's house (full of celebrities that are all Franco and Rogen's  friends) even though Jay doesn't feel comfortable around Seth's  friends, who he doesn't know very well. Jay meets Franco and Craig  Robinson for the first time at the party and is also reintroduced to  Jonah Hill, who he has a strong disliking for. Feeling uncomfortable  and like an outsider Jay talks Seth into going to the local convenience  store with him and that's when the apocalypse starts. Things begin  blowing up and people start getting sucked into the sky. They rush back  to Franco's house and become trapped there with him, Robinson, Hill and  an uninvited Danny McBride.  The movie is hilarious from start to finish. What's most funny about  the film is perhaps how Rogen, Baruchel and the others present  themselves as very relatable average people that have just been  corrupted by fame and fortune. Everyone in the film is presented as  pretty unlikeable (some more than others) except for Baruchel (who for  me is always very likable and extremely relatable). He's the heart of  the film, and kind of the viewer's guide through it, but the movie also  focuses heavily on friendship (most of all Rogen and Baruchel's) and  relationships with acquaintances (good ones and bad). The awkward  relationships developed in the film lead to some of it's funniest  moments but like all of Rogen's films the movie has a very positive and  heartfelt message about friendship. It also has a somewhat spiritual  message about being a better person. The messages of the film are of  course exaggerated and pretty cheesy though (for the most part). It's  most of all a laugh riot. The film does grow a little long and tiresome  (slightly) towards the end but it has a great conclusion and is mostly  flawless (as a comedy). Rogen and Goldberg do an outstanding job  writing and debut directing but it's the cast that really makes the  film and I think it's great that they're all willing to poke so much  fun at themselves, the way they do in this movie!",10,4,21,13 June 2013
Iron Man 2," It just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words!
","'IRON MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five) Like many second films in popular fantasy / action franchises (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER-MAN 2', 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'X-MEN 2', etc.)'IRON MAN 2' takes what worked about the first film and totally ups the ante and creatively expands on the characters and drama of the first film to probably it's emotional and entertaining peak! It in many ways blows the first film out of the water. Although the action is a lot less frequent than you might expect, from a big superhero blockbuster extravaganza like this, when it does happen it's breathtaking; the race-car fight scene, which happens about a third of the way into the movie, is so cool it's mind-blowing and it's also emotionally intense (It's one of the raddest scenes I've ever seen in a movie and the rest of the movie never quite tops it; so the climax does happen pretty early on but that's OK, there's still plenty of quality movie left even so).What's best about the movie is not the action though it's the character drama and dialog; it would be a crime if this thing doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for best screenplay, although I'm sure that's a crime that will most likely be committed (Robert Downey Jr. also unarguably deserves a nomination for his acting performance as well though). The movie is jam packed with some of the most witty clever dialog and interesting character development I've ever seen in a blockbuster like this! The whole thing is a very complicated psychological character exploration, all revolving around the most fascinating superhero character to ever hit the big screen; the eccentric somewhat mad genius that is Tony Stark (once again insanely but amazingly portrayed by Downey Jr.).The film centers around Stark's battles (not with bad guys and world threats, but) with health issues (he's being poisoned to death by the machine he created, in his chest, that initially saved him), alcoholism, a Government that wants to take control of his technology for what they say is the good of the country and his overall fight to keep his sanity dealing with all this stress. Throw in Sam Rockwell as an impressively portrayed billionaire tech rival and Mickey Rourke as a soft spoken madman bent on revenge against the Stark family, who he blames for stealing his father's ideas, and you've got a complete circus act of oddly interesting characters. There's also Don Cheadle cleverly taking over the role of Stark's best friend James Rhodes (although Terrence Howard in the first film was better), there's a little Samuel L. Jackson being cool like always and there's some more Jon Favreau (more than the first film) that adds some nice comedic touches. There is a very sexy Scarlett Johansson playing another super hero named 'Black Widow' but the female characters are a little underdeveloped compared to the men.You can tell it was written by a man (actor Justin Theroux who's only other writing credit is co-writing 'TROPIC THUNDER', another Downey Jr. scene stealer); the women dialog is mostly important plot advancement stuff but with the guys 80 percent of it could have been tossed and the plot would have been intact but it's just so natural and entertaining; like real people shooting the breeze! That's the brilliance of the film! Favreau has also come pretty far as a director; he's much more polished now and knows what's most important to the film. The whole movie just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words. It's an astonishing film going experience if you really like film!Watch our review show, 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxp3NkMebd8",10,19,39,14 September 2010
World War Z," Arguably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD'!
","'WORLD WAR Z': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)'WORLD WAR Z' is probably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's 1978 classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD', despite it's PG-13 rating (the film should have been rated R but the studio bought a commercial friendly rating for it). Romero was a big influence on the writer of the book it's based on, of the same name, Max Brooks. The book 'World War Z' is a 2006 sequel to Brooks' popular 2003 hit 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. It's a collection of different characters' accounts of a ten year zombie war and what follows. The movie deviates quite a bit from the book and centers on a retired U.N. agent (played by Brad Pitt) that travels around the world looking for a way to stop a zombie apocalypse. It was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (who also wrote the political thrillers 'STATE OF PLAY', 'LIONS FOR LAMBS' and 'KINGDOM') and J. Michael Straczynski (who's well known for creating the popular sci-fi TV series 'BABYLON 5' and the comic book 'Rising Stars'). Two of the best writers in Hollywood, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof (who both wrote over thirty to forty episodes of the immensely popular TV show 'LOST'), rewrote the entire third act of the film. With all that talent attached to writing the script you know you're going to get something good! Marc Forster (director of 'MONSTER'S BALL', 'FINDING NEVERLAND', 'STRANGER THAN FICTION' and the 2008 Bond film 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE') directed the film. The result is nothing short of spectacular!Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a retired U.N. investigator who is now a stay-at-home dad as the film opens. He's stuck in traffic in Philadelphia one day, with his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and two daughters (Abigail Hargrove and Sterling Jerins), when the world suffers a zombie outbreak. Gerry and his family survive the night, on the run, and make it on to a roof top where they're rescued by Gerry's former employers. He's then asked to go back to work and travel the world looking for a way to stop the zombie pandemic before it wipes out all life on the planet. Realizing his family won't survive if he refuses Gerry reluctantly complies.The film is a masterpiece of the horror genre. It's also the first zombie film to take it's subject matter this seriously (since maybe Romero's early work) and portrays it (for the most part) realistically. Some fans of the book hate that it strays so far from it's source material but if you look at it just as a film inspired by a book (rather than the book in movie form) you should be able to enjoy it more. Even the author, Brooks, said Stracynski's last draft of the script was 'amazing' and 'Aint it Cool News' claimed the film could have many arguing 'whether or not a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material'! I doubt it will be nominated for best picture but I agree it should. It's taken the horror genre, and zombie films in general, to new heights in respectable filmmaking. The filmmakers compare it to the 'Bourne' movies but I think it's even better. It works as a political thriller, an exhilarating action film and a creepy and disturbing monster movie. Pitt makes a great 'thinking man's action hero'; he rarely ever fights or uses a gun but instead thinks his way through every situation. All of the characters are intriguing and there's great cameos from the likes of David Morse and Matthew Fox (in a very small part). The film is full of great suspense, fast paced action, spectacular visuals and cool zombie moments (and the zombies look and act great). Forster's directing is more than adequate but once again it's the four grade A writers that really make the film work. It's full of good plot development and amazingly clever dialogue (with lines like 'Mother Nature is a serial killer'). The movie should make George A. Romero proud.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGWqCYOhcJs",9,8,21,22 June 2013
Passengers," Asks some good moral questions.
","'PASSENGERS': Four Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi romantic thriller, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. It was directed by Morten Tyldum (who also directed the 2014 critically acclaimed hit 'THE IMITATION GAME'), and it was scripted by Jon Spaihts (who also co-wrote the sci-fi hits 'PROMETHEUS' and 'DOCTOR STRANGE'). The movie tells the story of two passengers; that awaken 90-years early from induced hibernation, on a 120-year space flight to another planet. The film also costars Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's also under-performed at the Box Office. I enjoyed it, but I enjoy everything with Jennifer Lawrence in it. The story takes place sometime in the near future, aboard the spacecraft Avalon. The Avalon is transporting 5,000 colonists to a planet called Homestead II (from Earth), and it's supposed to take 120-years for it to get there. Since the trip takes so long, the colonists are cryogenically frozen (for the duration of the flight). Two passengers unexpectedly wake up early, 90-years too early, and they also discover there's something seriously wrong with the ship. The film asks some good moral questions, the kind that can create some great conversations (and good debates); like all good science fiction should. It's definitely not a perfect film; I blame most of it's flaws on Tyldum's direction though (I had similar problems with 'THE IMITATION GAME'). I do think it's a good story, and a great concept, and the two lead actors are both good in it (Lawrence is much better though). It's also great to see a woman star getting top billing, in an adventure film like this, and also getting paid $8 million more than the male lead; even though he has quite a bit more screen time (and is arguably the central character of the movie). I think Lawrence definitely deserves it; she's a huge star, and this is a pretty entertaining vehicle for her.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Bm1uDreRMGU",8,10,20,26 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Lawrence is gorgeous and about as strong a role model for young people as you could ask for!
","'THE HUNGER GAMES': Five Stars (Out of Five) Blockbuster adaptation of the immensely popular young adult novel (of the same name) by Suzanne Collins. It was directed and co-written (with Collins and Billy Ray) by Gary Ross (who also wrote and directed such popular classics as 'PLEASANTVILLE' and 'SEABISCUIT'). The film stars Jennifer Lawrence, who rose to fame in 2010's 'WINTER'S BONE' in which, at age 20, she was the second youngest actress ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award! The movie is a very powerful and moving film going experience that is highlighted by Ross's masterful directing and Lawrence's outstanding performance! The film is a science fiction action drama film that tells the story of a dystopian post-apocalyptic future set in the world of Panem. Panem consists of 12 poor districts ruled by a wealthy city known as the Capitol. The masses once attempted to rebel against the Capitol but failed and as punishment are now subject to 'The Hunger Games', a reality TV series broadcast for the public to watch in which a boy and girl (between the ages of 12 and 18) are selected from each district every year to fight to the death in a bloody arena. This first chapter (in a trilogy) revolves around Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence), a sixteen year old who volunteers to participate in the game in order to save her twelve-year-old sister (Willow Shields) from having to. She's joined by Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who's selected as the male participant, from their district.Most young adult novel adaptations are poorly made films (the biggest example being 'THE TWILIGHT SAGA') and it's because they usually come from crappy books. 'THE HUNGER GAMES' is one exception that is widely seen as a very well written book series (another being the 'HARRY POTTER' books) and this first film adaptation is probably the best youth book movie yet! It's extremely dark and violent for a teen movie and I actually think it should have been rated R rather than PG-13; the themes and subject matter are pretty intense and disturbing but that's also why I think so highly of it. It's a very effective and nightmarish film going experience. Shocking, tragic and heartfelt (I cried multiple times while watching it).Lawrence is gorgeous and about as strong a role model for young people as you could ask for. She's everything I would want in a woman as well. She gives an award worthy performance and really powers the film into masterpiece territory. Ross is about as good a writer and director for the material as the producers could have asked for as well. It's the best film I've seen this year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30",10,1,7,22 April 2012
Zootopia," A pretty important movie!
","'ZOOTOPIA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 55th feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. This one revolves around a world of anthropomorphic animals; where a cop bunny teams with a con artist fox, to solve a missing animal case. It was directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and co-directed by Jared Bush (the trio also co-wrote the movie, with 5 other writers). The film stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Octavia Spencer and Tommy Chong. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and I have to agree; it's one of the best films of the year (so far)!Judy Hopps (Goodwin) had always dreamed of becoming the first rabbit police officer (since childhood). When her dreams finally come true, she's assigned to work at the Zootopia police department. Zootopia is a large metropolis; of all kinds of different mammals. Judy is (of course) initially met with a lot of skepticism (and prejudice). She tries to prove herself, by solving a missing otter case. She teams up with a clever con artist fox, named Nick Wilde (Bateman), in order to do so. The film is beautifully animated, and full of colorful (likable) characters. It's both funny and surprisingly touching; but what's most beautiful about the movie, is it's insightful message about bigotry. You can never judge anyone by their appearance, or social background, and what better way to illustrate that message to kids; than with a world full of various types of animals. I love this movie, because of that message (it's one that means a lot to me), and I don't usually love Disney animated films. This one is pretty important.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U",9,11,20,22 March 2016
The Impossible," A true nightmare depicted on screen; definitely worth the watch if you can handle it!
","'THE IMPOSSIBLE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A Spanish dramatic thriller (presented in English) recounting one family's true experiences during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It stars Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor both in highly critically praised performances (and reuniting after starring together in the 2005 thriller 'STAY'). It also stars Tom Holland as their 12-year-old son and he makes an amazing debut performance. It was directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and written by Sergio G. Sanchez (based on a story by Maria Belon). The same team made the 2007 critically acclaimed Spanish thriller 'THE ORPHANAGE'; which was a little more of a spooky supernatural thriller type (produced by Guillermo del Toro), where as this is definitely more of a disaster/drama film. The movie has been praised and condemned for it's believable and shockingly realistic depiction of one of the most disastrous natural catastrophes in history. It's a true nightmare depicted on screen and is definitely worth the watch if you can handle it.The film focuses on Maria (Watts) and Henry Belon (McGregor) as they vacation in Thailand for Christmas with their three sons: Lucas (Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). On December 26, 2004 they're all enjoying their time in a swimming pool, at the resort they're staying at, when the tsunami hits the coast and wipes them all out. Maria and Lucas are swept away but manage to find each other (although Maria is severely injured) as Henry recovers his other two sons. The rest of the movie is spent following Henry as he searches aimlessly for his wife and eldest son and Lucas as he looks after his mother at a emergency hospital.The film is truly nightmarish to watch as the opening tsunami scene is probably the most believable natural disaster scene ever depicted on film. The rest of the movie is just as haunting though as we watch this family in utter despair struggling to survive and find each other (while also watching thousands of other strangers experience the horror as well). The movie almost plays out like a horror film at times (which is probably due to the director and writer's brilliant touches) but it does pay off with a heartfelt and tear soaked conclusion. The film is inspirational in the way it depicts this real life family's strength, love and determination but it also leaves a somewhat depressing and eerie feeling after it's over. This is not a movie you watch to have fun (despite how spectacular the visuals are and Bayona's direction is very beautiful at times as well). Watts does deliver one of the most powerful performances of the year, as well as her career, and McGregor does some of his best work as well. When you think you feel up to sitting through a movie like this it's definitely worth the watch.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xLp95d1OTk",9,2,4,10 January 2013
42," It reminds me of the problems our President faces being the first black man in his job!
","'42': Four Stars (Out of Five)This inspiring biographical baseball drama centers on Jackie Robinson (who's jersey number was 42) and the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers season when Robinson became the first black Major League baseball player since 1884. It also focuses on his relationship with team executive Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson to the team (making history). Chadwick Boseman (a mostly unknown TV actor ) stars as Robinson and Harrison Ford co-stars as Rickey. It's written and directed by Brian Helgeland (who also wrote and directed one of my favorite films 'PAYBACK' as well as wrote other hits like 'MYSTIC RIVER', 'MAN ON FIRE' and 'GREEN ZONE'). The film is a good old fashioned baseball drama that's both emotional and packed with exciting sports action. The strongest element of the film though is how it deals with racism.The story begins in 1946 when Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson to the minor league baseball team the Montreal Royals. Rickey makes Robinson promise that he'll control his temper and never let racist bigots get the better of him, which becomes the main component of the entire film. It then shifts to 1947 when Robinson plays for the Brooklyn Dodgers. It's here that Robinson faces his greatest challenge as he's opposed by almost everyone, including most of his teammates. Nevertheless Robinson triumphs and makes baseball history becoming Rookie of the Year (and later the Baseball Hall of Fame) and leading his team to the World Series.Some say the film plays it a little too safe and family friendly but I was never bored. The baseball scenes are exciting and the emotional drama is always very moving. I think Helgeland does an excellent job brining the material to the big screen, thanks in large part to good performances by Boseman and especially Ford (who's almost unrecognizable in the role). The way the film tackles racism is it's greatest accomplishment though and shows it as something everyone can sympathize and or relate to. It reminds me of the problems our President faces being the first black man in his job (the world hasn't really changed all that much in that way).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",8,2,5,22 April 2013
Argo," A beautiful cinematic achievement and another success for Affleck!
","'ARGO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Ben Affleck's third outing as feature film director (following 2010's 'THE TOWN' and 2007's 'GONE BABY GONE'). This one is set during the Iran hostage crisis (that began in 1979) in which six U.S. diplomats fled the U.S. embassy in Tehran and hid out (for several months) at the Canadian ambassador's home there. It's loosely based on CIA specialist Tony Mendez's account of how he used a fake Sci-Fi film production called 'Argo' to get them out of the country. Affleck also stars in the film (as Mendez, despite the fact that Affleck is not a Latino) but he didn't write the script (like he co-wrote his two other directorial efforts). Chris Terrio wrote the screenplay and it's based on the 2007 Wired article 'How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran' by Joshua Bearman. It co-stars Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham and Clea DuVall. The movie is funny, dramatic and extremely tense at times; like the other two films Affleck has helmed it's a grade A production all around!The film begins in 1979 Tehran with the U.S. embassy being invaded by Iranian revolutionaries (in protest to the U.S. supporting the Shah they recently deposed). Most of the embassy staff is taken hostage except six who escape and flee to the home of the Canadian ambassador there, Ken Taylor (Garbor). Their escape is unknown to the revolutionaries and their whereabouts are kept secret while the U.S. tries to figure out the best way to get them home to safety. CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) is brought in to help with the planning of their exfiltration. He devises a plan to use the cover of a fake Sci-Fi film, called 'Argo', and pretend to scout locations for the film in Tehran in order to get the six diplomats out under the guise of his film crew. Despite skepticism from Government officials Mendez pursues his plan with the help of a Hollywood make-up artist (Goodman) and film producer (Arkin). Cranston plays Mendez's supervisor on the operation.The movie is touching on some issues and politics that are very relevant to the times today (of course) and it's extremely dramatic and emotional because of it. It's also very funny (especially when it gets in to the fake film details of it's story) and, like I said, very tense and suspenseful at times as well (especially in the third act). You can tell events have been altered quite a bit from actual history for dramatic and cinematic effect and the film has been criticized for some of it's changes but Affleck has still mastered a beautiful film. Not taking factual accuracy in to account and just looking at it as a masterful suspense thriller it's a beautiful cinematic achievement and another success for Affleck, who has proved to be a much better director than he is an actor (although he's not a bad actor either and does fine in this film). The problem with Affleck's career a few years back was just the over hyped publicity of it (that and the fact that he did a lot of OK to bad films). He's actually a very talented actor as well as an excellent filmmaker (possibly one of the best working in film today). The rest of the cast is all exceptional in the film as well, especially Cranston and Arkin (who are scene stealers). 'ARGO' isn't quite as impressive a film as 'THE TOWN' but it does deserve all the critical recognition and Oscar hype it's getting and it's a must see for any true film fan.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q",9,2,4,18 October 2012
Last Flag Flying," A great tribute to our veterans!
","'LAST FLAG FLYING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Richard Linklater's new comedy-drama about three Vietnam war veterans who reunite, 30-years after serving together, when one of their sons is killed in the Iraq war. The film is based on the book (of the same name) by Darryl Ponicsan, which is a sequel to his 1970 novel 'The Last Detail' (which was also adapted into a popular 1973 film). This movie stars Steve Carrell, Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne. Linklater also co-wrote the screenplay, with Ponicsan, and the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a really well made character study, that's also a great tribute to our veterans. The story is set in December of 2003, when former Navy corpsman Larry Shepherd (Carrell) is visiting the bar of an old marine he used to serve with, named Sal Nealon (Cranston). Larry reminds Sal who he is (and Sal only knew Larry by his nickname 'Doc'). He also reminds him that he was imprisoned, in a Navy prison, for a bad-conduct discharge, which (it's implied) Sal was somewhat responsible for. After the two get reacquainted, through a heavy night of drinking, they travel to the church of another Vietnam vet they used to serve with, named Richard Mueller (Fishburne). Larry then explains that his son was recently killed, while serving in Iraq, and he asks his two friends to accompany him to burry him. The three of course bond again while on their road trip together. You almost couldn't ask for three better, and more fitting, leads for this film! Carell, Cranston and Fishburne are all extremely likable, and relatable, and they also all have magical chemistry together. The movie is also brilliant in how it combines heart crushing drama, with surprisingly feel good humor. You never quite know how to feel while watching it, but it's always very believable and seemingly true to life (and I did get teary eyed multiple times). The movie doesn't feel like a typical Richard Linklater film, but he definitely still did an outstanding job directing and writing it, and I definitely still recommend it (for all).",9,7,10,1 February 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," The movie delivers almost everything die-hard Trekkies and movie buffs want!
","'STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Current Sci-fi king J.J. Abrams returns to direct the second installment in the 'STAR TREK' reboot/alternate universe series (and twelfth 'STAR TREK' movie) 'INTO DARKNESS'. It's sort of a loose remake of 'STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN' but due to the fact that a time traveling Romulan, with a vengeance, changed the entire 'STAR TREK' universe in the last film things of course happen differently this time around. The new Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the rest of the Enterprise crew are back to battle a genetically engineered super being (Benedict Cumberbatch), with a vengeance of course (against all of Starfleet). Other new additions to the cast include Peter Weller (one of my favorite actors) and Alice Eve (of 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' fame). Abrams produced the film with his long time buddy and partner in crime, Damon Lindelof, as well as the first film's writers (and other frequent Abrams conspirators) Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman once again wrote the script, this time with Lindelof (one of the greatest film and TV writers there is) as well. Michael Giacchino (who does the music for all of Abrams' movies and TV shows) once again did a breathtaking score for the film as well. The movie delivers almost everything die-hard Trekkies and movie buffs want; but for me it didn't quite live up to it's predecessor or the original classic ('THE WRATH OF KHAN') it's trying to emulate (it does beat all other films in the series hands down though).After narrowly escaping death and saving the primitive people of the planet Nibiru from extinction Captain James T. Kirk (Pine) returns home to Earth to find he's been demoted for being a hotshot loose cannon, once again, and not following Starfleet's Prime Directives. Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood once again) replaces him as captain of the Enterprise and Spock (Quinto) is reassigned to another ship. But when a genetically engineered former member of Starfleet, by the name of John Harrison (Cumberbatch), bombs a Starfleet installation in London and attacks a secret meeting at Starfleet Command Kirk is reassigned to Captain of the Enterprise in order to carry out a revenge attack on Harrison (who they learn is hiding out on the Klingon home planet Kronos). Spock is once again assigned to the Enterprise as well and questions Admiral Marcus's (Weller) motives for giving Kirk 72 torpedoes to kill Harrison with, without a trial. Kirk, Spock and the others soon learn there's much more going on than they originally thought as a possible war with the Klingons could result from their actions and there could be corruption among high ranking Starfleet officials.The movie is brilliant in how it incorporates current politics into it's plot and overall message but that's what 'STAR TREK' has always been well known for. As opposed to 'STAR WARS', 'STAR TREK' has always been thought of as the more thinking man's science fiction (I prefer 'STAR WARS' though and disagree with this assessment; I'm also not a Trekkie). With the films (and especially these last two installments) the franchise has grown more and more towards action and spectacle but the thing that Abrams has always been good at is not losing sight of what's most important (the film's characters, heart and themes). This movie is probably the most action packed and visually stunning one yet but it still does have a lot of character development, drama and political ideas. The drama does feel a little more forced this time around though and while the action is exhilarating the movie is not nearly as much fun as being reintroduced to all these characters was last time around (it's also just not as classic as 'WRATH OF KHAN'). While the movie is still a great action film, and stunning sci-fi enjoyment, it disappoints (just a little) by not living up to the two greatest 'STAR TREK' movies. This was perhaps an impossible feat though and Abrams is still one of hottest directors around (he's now in charge of both of the most popular science fiction franchises in history; being given the opportunity to direct the next 'STAR WARS' film as well). This is still an amazing film and is about as much as one could possibly ask for or expect.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",9,4,18,17 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," 'Crazy, Stupid Carell!'
","'CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Steve Carell returning to what he does best, emotionally sweet but honest comedy-drama. After a couple mediocre to dud films (like 'DATE NIGHT', 'DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS' and 'DESPICABLE ME'). It's nice to see Carell getting back to higher caliber quality comedy (like his much better earlier films 'THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN' and 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE'). He's not the only reason to see the film though, like those earlier noted films, this is an ensemble piece made up of a lot of great talented actors such as Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei. It's directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who also co-directed 'I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS') and written by Dan Fogelman (who's worked on the screenplays for several kids' films including both 'CARS', 'TANGLED' and 'FRED CLAUS'). The film tells the story of a recently dumped father who attracts the sympathy and mentoring of a younger popular 'ladie's man' bachelor. Carell plays the sad father and Gosling co-stars as the hip 'hot shot' womanizer. It's a well made and effective buddy film with a lot to say about love, relationships and family life as well.The film opens with Cal (Carell) and his wife Emily (Moore) sitting down to a nice dinner in a beautiful restaurant when Emily tells Cal she wants a divorce, much to Cal's surprise. On the drive home she also lets him in on the information that she's had an affair to which Cal responds by jumping from the moving vehicle. Cal takes it like a man and moves into a small apartment but is devastated inside. Their two young children, Robbie (Jonah Bobo) and Molly (Joey King), are hurt by the news as well. Robbie is a thirteen year old with apparent wisdom well beyond his years and has just professed his love to the family babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who secretly has an obsessive crush on Cal. While telling his sob story repeatedly (to anyone who will listen, or won't even) at a local club Cal attracts the attention of Jacob (Gosling) who offers to teach Cal all he knows so he can hopefully 'regain his manhood'. The two bond during their experiment but things become complicated when Emily begins to show feelings for Cal again and Jacob falls for a young lovely woman (Stone).The film is grade A material and production values all around; the cast is outstanding (especially Carell and Gosling, two of my favorite actors), the directing is decent, the film looks great and the script is smart and fun. It's equally as funny as emotionally charged and honest, although it does lose it's way a little towards the end. Like many, many comedic dramas before it the movie takes brief turns into somewhat sappy slapstick. It's a minor amount of screen time but it does come at key points in the film, which does take away a little from it's otherwise greatness. This is it's only true flaw though and you get so much more good from the film than bad. It's like at least twice as good as something like 'DATE NIGHT'. It's refreshing to see Carell return to form and actors like Gosling and Moore branching out a little (from their usual all too serious Oscar bait). As a buddy film it really works, as an emotional drama it really works as well and as a comedy it's equally as impressive. Other than the previously mentioned flaw it is a near perfect example of it's genre and definitely worth checking out.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOOi1HDSXyA",9,3,7,2 August 2011
Green Room," Unbelievably intense!
","'GREEN ROOM': Five Stars (Out of Five)A crime-thriller/horror flick, written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier (the man who brought us the outstanding 'BLUE RUIN', 2 years ago). The film is about a punk band, touring through the Pacific Northwest, that's terrorized by neo-Nazi skinheads (at a remote Oregon club). It stars Anton Yelchin (in one of his final film roles) and Patrick Stewart (Chekov and Picard, together in a movie!). The film also costars Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole, Callum Turner, Mark Webber and Macon Blair (who also starred in 'BLUE RUIN'). It's gotten rave reviews from critics (91% positive on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans alike (including director Quentin Tarantino). I loved it as well.Pat (Yelchin), Sam (Shawkat), Reece (Cole) and Tiger (Turner) are members of the punk rock band 'The Ain't Rights'. As the movie opens, they're traveling to a show in Seaside, Oregon. When they get there, they find out that the gig has been canceled. The radio host, that set them up with the show (David W. Thompson), sets them up with another gig instead; at a secluded club outside of Portland. The band soon learns that the club is a neo-Nazi skinhead hangout. After Pat witnesses a crime there, the establishment's owner (Patrick) won't let them leave.I was a big fan of 'BLUE RUIN', when it came out. I've been eagerly awaiting Saulnier's next movie, ever since (especially after seeing Tarantino's review for it, and every other critic's). I definitely wasn't disappointed in it! It's involving, from the opening scene to the very last shot, and it's beautifully filmed as well. It's also unbelievably intense (like one of the most intense movies I've ever seen). It's gory, and graphically brutal, but all in a very realistic (yet disturbing) way. It's touching seeing Yelchin again, and he's amazing in the film too. Stewart also makes a very memorable villain. The film is sure to become a cult classic, it's a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg",10,9,19,14 July 2016
The Babadook," I don't think it quite lives up to all of it's hype.
","'THE BABADOOK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Australian indie horror flick about a single mother, still trying to cope with the tragic death of her husband, who also has to now deal with their son's troublesome behavior and fear of monsters. When the mother reads her son a mysterious children's pop-up-book, about a demon called 'Mr. Babadook', it appears there could be a real monster haunting them as well. It was written and directed by first-time feature filmmaker Jennifer Kent and it's based on her 2005 short film 'MONSTER'. The film stars Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman, as the distraught mother and her troubled son. It was made on a budget of just $2 million and is one of the best reviewed movies of 2014 (97% positive on Rotten Tomatoes)! I enjoyed it quite a bit but I don't think it quite lives up to all of it's hype.Amelia (Davis) is a single mother who still has nightmares about the death of her husband, who died in a horrific car crash; on the way to giving birth to their son, Samuel (Wiseman). Samuel has recently been lashing out a lot at school and has an unhealthy fear of monsters, which he makes weapons to fight. Due to Samuel's behavior, Amelia has to take him out of school and homeschool him. To make matters even worse she reads him a scary children's book, that Samuel finds on his shelf one day, called 'Mr. Babadook'. Samuel becomes convinced that the supernatural creature, from the book, is really haunting them. After a series of disturbing incidents, Amelia starts to believe it as well.I'm a huge fan of scary movies, monster flicks and most horror films in general. This is a really well made psychological thriller, that has a pretty cool looking creepy critter in it too, but it isn't really that scary in my opinion (a few scenes are though). That doesn't mean it's not a good movie, it just isn't what I was expecting. I also think the critics' overwhelming praise for the film built up my expectations for it too much. It is nicely directed and acted, especially for it's small budget; Davis is fantastic in it and I look forward to seeing plenty more movies from Kent too. I just wouldn't call it a great monster flick or classic horror movie. It's a good character study, with a pretty insightful message about the struggles of single parenting (a lot of people are calling it a 'feminist horror film' too, which is pretty cool). I still highly recommend it but I think viewers should know what type of movie it is, before seeing it, in order to best enjoy it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N3ywdecCULw",9,1,6,9 January 2015
The Danish Girl," I thought it was OK.
","'THE DANISH GIRL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Eddie Redmayne is up for his second Best Actor Oscar, in two years, for his portrayal of a 1920s transgender Danish artist, named Lili Elbe; a pioneer of her time (after he won last year, for 'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING'). Alicia Vikander is nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar; for playing Lili's wife, Gerda Wegener. The film was directed by Tom Hooper (who also directed the Academy Award winning films 'LES MISERABLES' and 'THE KING'S SPEECH'), and it was scripted by Lucinda Coxon. The movie was based on the 2000 novel, of the same name; which was only loosely inspired by the actual lives, of the Danish painters it portrays. The film has been heavily criticized; for it's historical inaccuracies, and it's questionable depiction of transgender people. Judging the movie, just on its own merits (as a film), I thought it was OK.The story takes place in 1920s Copenhagen. A successful landscape artist, named Einar Wegener (Redmayne), lives happily with his wife, Gerda (Vikander); who's a popular portrait painter. One day, Gerda asks Einar to sit in on a painting for her. He must pose in a dress, and women's shoes, in order to do so. This triggers feelings, that Einar has long kept buried inside; of identifying as a woman. The rest of the movie details her struggles to become one; and Gerda's fight to stay by her husband's side (during the battle).I don't know what it's like, at all, to be a transgender person; so I can't speak to how properly the film portrays it. I have a friend, who is a transgender woman, who says the movie doesn't do an appropriate job, of demonstrating what that life is like (there's multiple flaws in the film, she pointed out). I also knew little about Lili Elbe, or Gerda Wegener, before seeing the movie; so I can't speak to it's historical accuracy, either (but I've read it's horribly inaccurate). I do think the film is well directed, emotionally intriguing and decently acted (although I don't think Redmayne deserved another Oscar nomination). It definitely kept my interest, throughout it's 2-hour running length; and Vikander is fantastic in it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4",8,0,1,10 February 2016
Ted," Mostly a crowd pleaser I'd say if you know what you're getting in to.
","'TED': Four Stars (Out of Five) Seth MacFarlane (the creator of 'FAMILY GUY') makes his feature-length live-action directorial debut (with some computer animation)! The film stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis with MacFarlane voicing the computer animated title character. MacFarlane directed and co-wrote the screenplay along with two other 'FAMILY GUY' writers (Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild). The film is a fantasy comedy film about a teddy bear that comes to life to grant a child's wish and becomes a burden on his romantic relationship when he's a grown man. The movie is surprisingly well made for MacFarlane's first feature effort and more hit than miss with laughs. It's mostly a crowd pleaser I'd say if you know what you're getting in to.Wahlberg stars as John Bennett. As a child John was an outcast and had no friends so when his parents get him a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas he makes it his imaginary best friend. One day he wishes that the stuffed bear could talk back to him and a falling star grants him that wish. The two grow up together and the teddy bear, known as Ted (MacFarlane), helps John overcome his insecurities. Their friendship is finally put to the test though when John's girlfriend of four years, Lori (Kunis), wants John to stop spending so much time with Ted so they can further their relationship together.The movie is crude and vulgar but nothing more than one should expect from the creator of 'FAMILY GUY'. MacFarlane's direction is surprisingly impressive and the jokes for the most part work (which is more than I'd say for 'FAMILY GUY'). Wahlberg is good and likable in the lead and the movie actually has a lot more heart than you'd expect from it. It's actually a positive story of friendship that could have played out the same way even if one of the characters wasn't a magical stuffed bear. It's about how much love and time you give to those who are most important in your life. It's also of course extremely raunchy and hilarious at times but there's definitely heart to it and it's a good, well intentioned buddy film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAxZQ69Tess",8,19,38,4 July 2012
The Secret in Their Eyes," Involving and intriguing crime mystery!
","'THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another film that's made a lot of year end critic's top ten lists and was last year's Academy Awards winner for Best Foreign Language Film. This film is an Argentine mystery / crime drama based on the book 'The Question In Their Eyes' by Eduardo Sacheri. The script is adapted by Sacheri and the film's director, Juan Jose Campanella. Campanella surprisingly has a lot of experience directing American TV series (like several episodes of 'HOUSE M.D.', 'LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT', 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' and others) and his directing here is very impressive and memorable, including a breathtaking chase scene that appears to be all one single camera (although it was edited together using multiple cameras with CGI). The film has impressive acting turns as well from Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil in the two leads.Darin stars as a retired federal agent who tries to lay old memories to rest by writing a novel about them. He turns to an old friend, Judge Irene Menendez-Hastings (Villamil), for help. She was his superior, whom he also had strong feeling for, on a disturbing rape case several years earlier. The case was closed but it's outcome still haunts him to this day and leaves him with many unanswered questions. He tries to piece together the past with the help of Irene in order to finish his book and conquer his nightmares as we watch through flashbacks.The film is a very involving and intriguing crime mystery with a lot of emotion and interesting complex characters. It is very grisly at times though, including a torturous rape scene which is one of the most disturbing visuals I've seen in cinema. There is a lot of graphic violence as well as nudity and the movie is very hard to watch at times but if you can stick it out it's worth it. It's very beautiful in a lot of ways at times and leaves the viewer with as many positive emotions as negative. The writing, directing and acting is all superb and the movie, with all it's ups and downs, is a rewarding and memorable film going experience.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",8,1,2,9 January 2011
127 Hours," Between Life and Death!
","'127 HOURS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Yet another remarkably bold achievement in seemingly impossible cinematic storytelling this year! Like 'BURIED' from earlier this year this film tells the story of one man trapped in a single confined location for the duration of almost the entire film. Unlike 'BURIED' this film sets up the scenario and also leaves the primary location in flashbacks and day dreams. It also utilizes a lot of flashy special effects and stylized visuals to drive it's message home. It's still an astonishingly creative and one of a kind film going experience. It's impressively directed by Danny Boyle (in his long awaited follow-up to the Academy Award winning 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE') and features one of the best performances of the year (right alongside Ryan Reynolds in 'BURIED' in my opinion) from early Oscar front-runner James Franco.The film is written by Boyle and his 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' scriptwriter Simon Beaufoy. It's based on an autobiographical book by Aron Ralston (entitled 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place'). The book tells of Ralston's world famous mountain climbing adventure where he became trapped by a collapsed boulder, which pinned his arm, while climbing alone in an isolated canyon in Utah in 2003. Ralston was trapped for over 5 days and finally grew up enough courage to resort to desperate measures in order to free himself and survive. Franco gives probably his finest performance to date playing the man as he struggles with survival, losing his sanity and facing his biggest regrets in life. The real Aron Ralston kept a video diary while he was stuck, as depicted in the film (using the same exact camera). He had only allowed his family and friends to view the video until he let Boyle and Franco see the footage in order to more accurately depict true events. It's been quoted that Ralston is quite happy with and moved by the film.The film is of course very moving and inspirational (at times even tear jerking) but this is something that any competent filmmaker should have been able to deliver given the material and resources. How Boyle tells the story is what's truly remarkable and memorable about the film as well as his ability to stretch the material into a highly involving and entertaining adventure for a full 93 minutes (credit also has to be given to his co-scriptwriter for that though). The movie is very claustrophobic, surreal and horrifying. The climax is excruciatingly hard to watch and more grotesque than almost any horror film (there have been reports of viewers suffering from shock and needing medical assistance at multiple screenings). James Franco is one of those actors that I never thought had much talent early on given a lot of the choices in film roles he'd take but it appears as though he just made a lot of unwise career decisions (I always thought he was the weakest link in the 'SPIDER-MAN' films). In recent years he's proved himself to be one of the most talented and diverse young actors working today. 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS' was his initial role that really caught my attention (but I also hadn't seen his earlier memorable work on 'FREAKS AND GEEKS' until after that). This is his finest performance to date and one of the best single performances of the year and the movie is one of the most impressive creative achievements of the year as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ4A-I9-JM",9,1,3,8 December 2010
Creed," Doesn't quite live up to all of it's hype.
","'CREED': Four Stars (Out of Five)The seventh installment in the 'ROCKY' film franchise; this one focuses on the adult son of Apollo Creed, who's now being trained by Rocky. The movie stars Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, as Creed and Balboa; and it costars Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashād (one of my biggest childhood crushes) and professional boxers Tony Bellew and Andre Ward. It was directed by Ryan Coogler (who also directed Jordan in his feature film directorial debut: 'FRUITVALE STATION') and it was written by Coogler and Aaron Covington. Being a 'ROCKY' fan, I really enjoyed the film; but it's not quite as good as all of it's critical hype (currently 93% on Rotten Tomatoes!).Adonis Johnson Creed (Jordan) grew up a troubled child; always getting into fights, for no reason. He never knew his father, boxing legend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers, in archive footage), or his birth- mother. He was raised by Apollo's widow, Mary Anne Creed (Rashād). Now, as an adult, Adonis dreams of becoming a fighter, like his father. He travels to Philadelphia, to meet Rocky Balboa (Stallone); his father's old rival (and friend), and asks him to train him.The original 'ROCKY' is one of my all-time favorite movies! I've enjoyed all of it's sequels, as well (some quite a bit more than others). I was excited for this installment, and I really like the idea for the film; I was especially eager to see the movie, after hearing about all of it's rave reviews. Like I said, it doesn't quite live up to all of it's hype. I'd rank it about forth, among all of the 'ROCKY' films; but it's still a good addition to the series. It's classic Rocky, and Stallone gives another amazing performance, in the co- lead. He's still the star of the movie (even as just an elder trainer); fans should be pleased.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0",8,1,4,25 November 2015
Just Go with It," Illogical, predictable and another step downward in the once great comedic career of Adam Sandler.
","'JUST GO WITH IT': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another generic Adam Sandler vehicle, this one teaming Sandler with Jennifer Aniston and re-teaming him with director Dennis Dugan (who also directed 'HAPPY GILMORE', 'BIG DADDY', 'I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY', 'YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN' and 'GROWN UPS'). It's written by Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling and based on a 1969 film called 'CACTUS FLOWER' which was based on a Broadway stage play and a French play. It tells the story of a womanizing plastic surgeon (Sandler) who convinces his loyal assistant (Aniston) to pretend to be his wife for the weekend in order to deceive a young woman (Brooklyn Decker) he's trying to win over. The story is illogical, predictable and another step downward in the once great comedic career of Adam Sandler.Sandler plays Danny Maccabbee, a once 'funny looking' goof who turned to plastic surgery (in order to fix his own problems with attracting ladies) twenty years earlier when his fiancée broke his heart on their wedding day. He also learned the clever art of deception and tricking women into thinking he's unhappily married (by wearing a wedding ring) in order to attract sympathy sex. After meeting a women half his age, named Palmer, and falling for her he talks his assistant, Katherine Murphy, into playing the part of his abusive wife who he says he's divorcing. Then when Palmer discovers Katherine has kids Danny idiotically tells her their his and has to carry on the charade for an entire Hawaiian trip vacation (with Katherine's family).Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston are both talented and funny actors but they do an extremely poor job of picking roles. Here they're both funny in places and have some chemistry but the script is too poorly written for either to do too much of anything impressive with. Anniston has always been known for doing work far beneath her talents but Sandler used to make funny movies, once upon a time. Now everything he does is so formulaic and forced (a lot like TV sitcoms) and lacking of any originality or witty humor whatsoever. They do always do well at the box office though and it's good in today's economy to see the rich keep getting richer. The film's one saving grace is a nice supporting turn from Nicole Kidman though who surprisingly makes the movie a little more watchable. All in all it's about what anyone should expect from an Adam Sandler stock comedy.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",5,8,18,21 March 2011
About Time," Not just another bad chick-flick!
","'ABOUT TIME': Four Stars (Out of Five) Writer-director Richard Curtis (who wrote and directed the critically acclaimed hits 'LOVE ACTUALLY' and 'PIRATE RADIO' as well as wrote or co-wrote other British romcoms like 'FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL' and 'BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY') helmed this 'time travel romantic comedy-drama'. It stars Domhnall Gleeson (who's most famous for playing Bill Weasley in the last two 'HARRY POTTER' films) as a 21-year-old lawyer in training who discovers he can time travel and uses his gift to get a girlfriend. Rachel McAdams co-stars as the number one object of his affection and Bill Nighy plays his time travelling dad. The film is as much a father-son tale as it is a romance but that didn't keep the theater I saw it in from being filled with 90% female viewers. As far as romcoms go it's pretty good but that's to be expected from Curtis.Gleeson plays Tim, who is 21-years-old when his father (Nighy) tells him their big family secret; that the males in the family can time travel. He explains that they can only go back in time and they can't change history. Tim decides to use his special abilities to win over a woman. He first tries it on his sister's friend (Margot Robbie), who stays with his family one summer, but learns that his gift can't make someone fall in love with him. Then, when he moves to London to study as a lawyer, he meets Mary (McAdams) and the two immediately hit it off. As he continually time travels though (to try and fix things in their relationship and his relationships with others) he keeps complicating things and making them worse as well as better.I last saw McAdams as a gorgeous and evil femme fatale in the Brian De Palma thriller 'PASSION' and she was fantastic in it. She used to be one of my favorite actresses but she's done so many bad romantic comedies (and other crap like that) that she's kind of lost my interest. So it was great to see her doing something completely different and good in 'PASSION'. Here she's doing another romcom, as the standard cute and sweet leading female 'love interest' role, but she's great at it too. She's the heart of the film and really drives the viewer's involvement in the story. Gleeson is a good and likable lead as well and Curtis's script (although flawed) and directing are brilliant. It is another romantic comedy but it also has a sci-fi fantasy twist and was in the hands of a good director. McAdams shines in the movie and everyone else in it is more than adequate as well. It's emotionally moving and definitely worth seeing; not just another bad chick-flick!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",8,4,8,13 November 2013
Spotlight," Even the Catholic Church itself, has praised the movie!
","'SPOTLIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This year's Academy Awards Best Picture frontrunner, is this critically acclaimed drama film; directed and co-written (with Josh Singer) by Tom McCarthy. It stars Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Liev Schreiber, Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. The film tells the true story of the Boston Globe's 2001 'Spotlight' team of investigators, which uncovered decades of sexual abuse, towards minors, by Catholic priests; and the Church's cover-up of the crimes. The film deserves all of it's praise; it's one of the year's best!The Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' team, is the longest running newspaper investigation team, in the US. In 2003, they earned the paper a 'Pulitzer Prize for Public Service'; for uncovering decades of child molestation abuse, involving 87 priests in Boston alone, and the Catholic Church's despicable cover-up of the crimes. This film tells that story; and it centers around journalists Walter Robinson (Keaton), Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), Ben Bradley Jr. (Slattery), Matt Carroll (James) and Marty Baron (Schreiber).The film's cast is awesome; especially Keaton (who more than deserves another Oscar nomination, for his performance). The script is brilliant, and the directing is superb (which is a little odd, since McCarthy also co-wrote and directed 'THE COBBLER', earlier this year; which wasn't nearly as good). The movie isn't especially entertaining, or even greatly moving; but it is a very important film (and it's always involving and interesting to watch). Even the Catholic Church itself, has praised the movie; for it's honesty and compassionate treatment of the material. It's definitely a film everyone should see.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/dWmLQGusjEk",9,3,6,9 December 2015
Concussion," The little guy, taking on the big powerful corporation!
","'CONCUSSION': Four Stars (Out of Five)A medical/sports-drama biopic, based on the true story of the Nigerian forensic pathologist, named Dr. Bennet Omalu, who took on the NFL; in trying to expose the dangers of brain damage (in the extremely violent sport). The movie stars Will Smith, as Omalu, and it costars Albert Brooks, Alec Baldwin, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and David Morse. It was written and directed by Peter Landesman; and based on the GQ article 'Game Brain', by Jeanne Marie Laskas. The film is well acted, written and directed; it's definitely pretty powerful stuff (but maybe a little too systematically constructed, in the tradition of big budget Hollywood).The film begins in 2002, when Mike Webster (Morris), a former Pittsburgh Steelers center, suffered from severe brain damage, and died; homeless in his pickup truck. A gifted forensic pathologist (from Nigeria), named Dr. Bennet Omalu (Smith), was assigned to perform his autopsy. Omalu discovered that Webster's death was caused by brain trauma, he later named CTE, and he linked the 'cause of death' to multiple other professional football players. The National Football League, of course, used all their money, and power, to cover-up his findings. The movie is informative, and very involving; for the majority of the film. Smith is fantastic in the lead, and the supporting cast all does adequate jobs. This is a movie that tackles the 'very inspiring subject', of the little guy, taking on a big powerful corporation. Landesman dealt with the same subject matter, in the last film he wrote: 'KILL THE MESSENGER' (except in that movie, the US government was the 'big powerful corporation'). This film reminded me a lot of 'KILL THE MESSENGER', and that was before I even knew it was the same screenwriter. I hope Landesman continues to do movies like this; and maybe next time, without such a big powerful corporation (backing the film). His next movie is (very fittingly) about the Watergate scandal; I just learned!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j9uf6E4pnlw",8,2,8,13 January 2016
Don Jon," As creepy and disgusting as Gordon-Levitt's character is he's still really likable!
","'DON JON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his feature film directorial and writing debut with this romcom/drama film about a New Jersey womanizer who's addicted to porn and lets it get in the way of his relationships with women. Gordon-Levitt also stars in the film as the title character, who's nicknamed 'Don Jon' (after the legendary character Don Juan, from popular literature) due to his ability to 'score' with beautiful woman. Scarlett Johansson co-stars as a beauty he finally tries to settle down with. The film also co-stars Jualianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headley, Brie Larson and Rob Brown. The movie is a triumph for Gordon-Levitt on all fronts and one of the best romantic comedies this year.Gordon-Levitt plays Jon Martello, a man in his thirties, who lives in Jersey and attends dinners and church weekly with his family. He goes to confession once a week and confesses his weekly sexual experiences every time, which is usually 15 to 25 times masturbating (although his record is ten times in one day) and a couple of times engaging in intercourse with a woman. He's addicted to porn and prefers it to the real thing. He also believes every guy watches and jacks-off to porn every day. This leads him to objectify every women he meets until he encounters Barbara (Johansson) at a bar one night. He believes she's a ten (he and his buddies are always rating women) and the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. He thinks he's in love with her so he pursues a relationship with her and is willing to put off sex (at her insistence), while he tries to win her over, but his porn issues become a problem. There's so many things I liked and loved about this movie. Gordon-Levitt's performance is probably the best part of it (he totally lives and breathes his character in this movie) but his clever and thoughtful script and stylized and effective directing are almost equally as impressive. The rest of the cast is good as well but this movie is all about Gordon-Levitt and should make him a bigger star. The movie is equally funny as heartfelt and as creepy and disgusting as Gordon-Levitt's character is he's still a really likable and lovable guy. I didn't know it was possible to jack-off ten times in one day or an average of 20 times a week, weekly, for that matter (not at 32 years old). I also found it crazy that Gordon-Levitt's character actually prefers watching porn to having sex with real women. As outrageous as it all is it does seem believable in the world of the movie and as perverse as the title character is he does learn from his flaws and grow as a person (and maybe teaches the audience something in the process, even if your problems aren't nearly as extreme). A relationship that develops later in the film is truly beautiful and Johansson makes a great despicable bitch, who does seem true to life (I can think of a few people like her at least). I also really liked the commentary on catholicism and the guilt and relationships with God it brings up, that one has at church (the family stuff was also interesting and entertaining). A nearly great film and about as much as one could possible ask for from Gordon-Levitt as a debut filmmaker!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PeSUJEcyg",9,2,6,4 October 2013
Deadpool 2," Too bad we'll never get a true 'DEADPOOL 3', now that Disney owns the rights!
","'DEADPOOL 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2016 blockbuster R-rated superhero flick 'DEADPOOL' (based on the Marvel Comics character), and the 11th entry in the 'X-MEN' film franchise. In this chapter Wade Wilson (AKA Deadpool) fights to defend a young gifted mutant, named Russell, from a time traveling mutant called Cable. He forms a new superhero mutant team, called X-Force, to help him. The movie stars Ryan Reynolds (reprising the title role), Josh Brolin, Julian Dennison,Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapicic, Leslie Uggams, Karan Soni, Morena Baccarin and Eddie Marsan. It was directed by David Leitch (who also helmed 'ATOMIC BLONDE' and co-directed 'JOHN WICK') and it was written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick (the duo who also co-wrote the original film, and 'ZOMBIELAND') and Ryan Reynolds (in his screenwriting debut). I loved the original movie and I found this sequel to be almost as good (but not quite). Wade Wilson (Reynolds) has been killing criminals for two years now (since the end of the first film), under the name Deadpool. He's planning to have a child with his girlfriend, Vanessa Carlysle (Baccarin), when tragedy strikes. Wade then befriends a young troubled mutant named Russell (Dennison), who he later learns has been targeted for execution by a powerful time traveling mutant, from the future, named Cable (Brolin). Wade forms a team of new superhero mutants, he calls X-Force, to help him protect the kid and stop Cable. The movie is filled with nonstop gags and slapstick humor (just like the original), as well as really graphically violent action scenes (also just like the original). For me this film went a little too far in some of it's slapstick humor, whereas I thought the original movie had the perfect balance of action and comedy. This one also has a lot of sci-fi craziness on top of everything else. I still, of course, really enjoyed it, but I definitely can't say it matched the original. Reynolds is once again amazing, in the role he was born to play, and the supporting cast is more than decent. The script is clever and brilliant, and the directing is good enough. I think if they could have kept the original director though, this film could have been even better. As it is, it's still one of the best films of this year, and any year as far as superhero movies go. Too bad we won't ever get a true 'DEADPOOL 3', now that Disney owns the rights (and will never do a hardcore R-rated movie), but we can always dream.",10,14,38,18 May 2018

This sequel has Thor teaming up with Hulk, in order to escape a garbage planet and return to Asgard in time to rescue it from the upcoming Ragnarok. The movie was directed by Taika Waititi (who's also helmed the indie comedy hits 'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS' and 'HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE'), and it was written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost. The film stars Chris Hemsworth (reprising his most iconic role), Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins. It's received some of the best reviews ever for a Marvel Studios film, and it's also another huge hit at the Box Office as well. I really enjoyed it too. Thor (Hemsworth) has been looking for the Infinity Stones for over 2 years now, and he's imprisoned by a fire demon, called Surtur, while doing so. Surtur informs Thor that his father Odin (Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard, and that the planet will soon be destroyed by the prophecy Ragnarok. Thor defeats Surtur and returns to Asgard, only to find his brother Loki (Hiddleston) posing as Odin. Thor then forces Loki to go with him to Norway, on Earth, and find their father. Odin informs Thor and Loki that he's dying, and that their sister Hela (Blanchett) will be able to escape her imprisonment once he's dead, and return to take over Asgard. While trying to stop Hela, Thor and Loki crash land on a garbage planet, called Sakaar. There Thor finds Hulk (Ruffalo), who has been stuck as the green monster for over two years now. Thor then attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard. This Thor film is more of a comedy than anything else. I think it's a very fitting genre for this character though, and the film is very effectively done this way. Waititi has already proved himself a great comedic director, with his other feature films, and he doesn't disappoint here. The 80s kind of 'FLASH GORDON' style of the movie is cool too, and the performances are all more than decent. It's perhaps just a little too long though, and slow in some places. It's also not as exciting of an action film as well, compared to other recent superhero flicks, because of all the comedy. It is a lot of fun though, and more than worth seeing.",9,11,20,8 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," Allen fans will eat it up.
","'MIDNIGHT IN Paris': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Woody Allen's most critically acclaimed film in 6 years and his most financially successful movie ever (before adjusting for inflation). It's received 4 Academy Award nominations including 'Best Picture', 'Best Director', 'Best Original Screenplay' and 'Art Direction' but will be lucky to win one (most likely screenplay). The film is a fantasy comedy and for those who really like Allen it's sure to please, others could be lucky to find a little enjoyment.The film reunites Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams for the first time since 2005's 'WEDDING CRASHERS'. They play a couple (Gil and Inez) who are vacationing with Inez's rich parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) on their business trip in Paris. Gil is a popular screenwriter who's attempting to write his first novel but is suffering some severe writer's block. Gil has always been in love with Paris, especially it of yesteryear (specifically the 1920's), so he's hoping to find some much needed inspiration there. Inez thanks he's a dreamer and should go back to writing screenplays. One night while traveling the streets of Paris alone he finds something magical and possibly the inspiration he was looking for.I've never been a big Woody Allen fan so I don't usually seek his films out. I watched this film because of it's financial and critical success and found it slightly better than Allen's other work but still nothing too special. It is funny and witty in places, Wilson is great in the lead and he and the film are charming (in places) but for me that's about all the film had to offer. Like I said if you're an Allen fan though I'm sure you'll eat this s--- up. Everyone else will find it mildly amusing at best.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SILVr6aykQ",7,0,1,2 February 2012
Ready Player One," Mostly enjoyed it, but I also wasn't overly thrilled.
","'READY PLAYER ONE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new sci-fi adventure from director Steven Spielberg, and based on the book (of the same name) by Ernest Cline. The film is set in a future where virtual reality is commonly used to escape the depression of the real world. A very skilled teenager competes to win control over the virtual universe, with the help of his new friends, while an evil businessman desperately tries to win control over it too. The movie was scripted by Cline and Zak Penn (who also co-wrote such other blockbuster sci-fi flicks as 'THE AVENGERS', 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', 'X-MEN 2', 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' and 'LAST ACTION HERO'). It stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also expected to be a hit at the Box Office as well. I mostly enjoyed it, but I also wasn't overly thrilled.The story is set in the year 2044, when most of the planet's population lives in poverty. They escape depression by doing most of their daily activities in a virtual reality world, called the OASIS. In this world they can be whoever they want to be, but when their avatar dies they lose everything they have, and they have to start over with nothing. The creator of OASIS, the late James Halliday (Rylance), has left behind a game challenge, in which the winner gains complete control over the virtual reality world. A corrupt businessman, named Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn), will do anything to win control. A teenager named Wade Watts (Sheridan), and his new rebel ally friends, will do anything to stop him. The movie has elements of classic Spielberg adventure films in it, but it also lacks a lot of the heart and magic that made those movies so special. Spielberg tries to recapture those strengths in this film, but he's just not able to ever do it. The effects are pretty cool, but they also make the world and characters of the movie seem very distant. The characters also don't seem very developed or truly relatable. Still, technically speaking, the movie is pretty visually flawless , and it's also a lot of fun to see all of these classic movie and video game characters in one film together (but you get that just from watching the trailer). The third act is also really long and uninvolving for the most part too. I liked the film overall, to an extent, but it definitely doesn't live up to Spielberg's greatest work.",8,1,6,29 March 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," One of the most well made, as well as slow paced and convoluted films, of the year!
","'TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) One of the most well made, as well as slow paced and convoluted films, of the year is this British spy thriller. The film is based on the 1974 novel of the same name by John le Carre about an Ex-British secret service agent named George Smiley and his efforts to find a Soviet double agent. The film stars Gary Oldman (in an Academy Award nominated performance), Colin Firth, Tom Hardy (one of my favorite up and coming actors), Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds and John Hurt. It was written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was directed by Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson (who also directed the popular vampire thriller 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN') and scored perfectly by Alberto Iglesias (in which it also received an Academy Award nomination). On a technical level the movie is near perfect but lacks any true substance or heart to make it a truly great film (that and the fact that it's near impossible to follow).The film is set in the 1970's during the cold war and begins with a British Intelligence agent named Jim Prideaux (Strong) on assignment in Hungary. After the mission goes horribly wrong the head of the British Intelligence, Control (Hurt), and his right-hand man George Smiley (Oldman) take most of the blame and are forced into early retirement. The true reason the assignment went haywire is due to a Russian agent among the senior officers and Control was on to them (the Hungary mission was actually a plan to identify the mole). Control dies shortly after retirement (due to an ongoing illness) but Smiley is asked to come out of retirement, by a senior officer, and investigate new information discovered by agent Ricky Tarr (Hardy) on the mole. Smiley sees this as an opportunity to clear his name and seek vengeance by bringing the double agent to justice.Like I said the movie is masterfully made on a technical level, the perfect subtlety of each scene is amazing but the movie is almost too subtle. It takes way too long to get going and is never clear about almost anything. I had to see the movie twice just to fully understand it, paying much more attention to every detail the second time around. I sometimes like to give these kinds of movies credit for demanding a repeat viewing and not spoon-feeding the viewer but there is such a thing as being too vague (as well as being too slow paced). The movie crawls along at an agonizingly dull pace and this is part of the reason the film is too hard to follow; if you're like me your mind will often drift while viewing a movie like this which makes it easy to miss important details thus making it even more frustrating to follow and thus more painfully dull to watch. At least the movie does have a lot to offer in other ways (great acting, beautiful cinematography and a mesmerizing score) but the movie is not involving enough to warrant such craftsmanship. At it's heart it's a routine story with rather dull characters making it yet another example of style over substance (to the fullest extent).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXQWgWt6cw",7,2,4,26 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," Seeing the Roadshow presentation of it, was one of the greatest filmgoing experiences I've ever had!
","'THE HATEFUL EIGHT': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's gruesome western epic; about nine vile strangers, that hold up together in a stagecoach stopover, during a deadly blizzard (in Wyoming), sometime after the American Civil War. The movie stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demian Bichir, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, James Parks and Channing Tatum. The film was released in two versions; a standard 167 minute theatrical cut, and a special 70mm Roadshow version (that's 20 minutes longer). I saw the Roadshow presentation, and it was well worth it. The film is a classic; Tarantino at his best!The story takes place in the Wyoming winter, sometime after the Civil War. It revolves around a bounty hunter, named John Ruth (Russell), and his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Leigh). They're headed to the town of Red Rock; where Daisy will hang, for her notorious crimes. Along the way they meet up with another bounty hunter, named Major Marquis Warren (Jackson), and a man who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock, named Chris Mannix (Goggins). When the group becomes stuck, in the middle of a horrendous blizzard, they head to a well known haberdashery; to wait it out in. Once there, they meet four more strangers; and none of them appears to be very trustworthy. The film is classic Tarantino; if you like his stuff, you should love it. It's filled with grotesque violence, foul language and disgusting debauchery; but it's also a fascinating character study, with a strong message about race relations. The movie plays out in two distinct acts; the first being filled with lots of character development, excessive dialogue, and plot buildup. The second act is almost all violent, bloody, payoff (it's like two different movies almost). I love the way it was structured, and I was intrigued by nearly all of the film's despicable characters. I also really enjoyed seeing the movie in it's glorious 70mm presentation (it's well worth the extra ticket price, in my opinion). The pacing, in the first act, will test some viewer's patience (as all Tarantino films do); and so will the violence, and offensive imagery. I think it's all worth it, in my opinion, though. The film is a masterpiece; and seeing the Roadshow presentation of it, was one of the greatest filmgoing experiences I've ever had!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/A1MyBFioKXM",10,1,18,5 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," Really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her!
","'I, TONYA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sports comedy biopic about figure skater Tonya Harding, and how she and her ex-husband were accused of hiring a man to break the leg of her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan. The film stars Margot Robbie as Harding, and it costars Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser, Caitlin Carver and Bobby Cannavale. It was directed by Craig Gillespie (who also helmed 2007's outstanding 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL'), and it was written by Steven Rogers. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also nominated for three Golden Globes; including Best Motion Picture-Comedy, Best Actress-Comedy, and Best Supporting Actress (which it won). The movie (surprisingly) really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her. The film follows Tonya Harding's (Robbie) figure skating career, and life, from the time she was a three-year-old girl, until the attack on Nancy Kerrigan (Carver) which ended her career. The film shows how Harding was horrendously abused, both physically and emotionally, by her mother (Janney) and her husband (Stan). She was also treated extremely unfairly by figure skating judges, and society as a whole, because of her poor upbringing and appearance. The movie also takes the perspective that Harding had no knowledge of the attack on Kerrigan before it happened.The film actually made me feel guilty for thinking so negatively of Tonya Harding, because I always assumed that she was somewhat of a bad person. Of course the movie doesn't present her like that. It actually makes her out to be a tremendously abused, and oppressed sports hero, who at one time was the greatest figure skater in the world (which is something I didn't really know). She lost it all, of course, due to society bigotry (the film suggests). So I really found the movie to be interesting and involving, and it reminds me to always give people the benefit of the doubt (and to not jump to biased conclusions). Any film that can do all this, deserves a lot of respect in my opinion.",9,4,6,10 January 2018
Molly's Game," Any true film fan has to see this movie!
","'MOLLY'S GAME': Five Stars (Out of Five)Acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (one of my favorite writers) makes his directorial debut helming this crime drama, based on the memoir 'Molly's Game: From Hollywood's Elite to Wall Street's Billionaire Boys Club, My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of Underground Poker', by Molly Bloom. The film stars Jessica Chastain as Bloom, and it was also scripted by Sorkin (who's also Bloom's favorite writer). It costars Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong, Chris O'Dowd, Bill Camp, Brian d'Arcy James and Graham Greene. The movie tells the true story of Bloom's experiences running the most exclusive high-stakes poker game in the world (in Los Angeles and New York), before being arrested by the FBI, and her legal battle against those charges. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards (Best Screenplay and Best Actress - Drama). I was absolutely blown away by the movie! Molly Bloom (Chastain) was a champion skier, who had serious relationship issues with her father (Kostner), who was also her trainer, and she was also seriously injured doing the sport. She later went to work for an abusive real estate agent (Strong), who introduced her to the world of high-stakes poker. Bloom became so good at her job there, that she later started running her own game, and then quickly became caught up in all the dangers of it. She was ultimately arrested by the FBI, and turned to lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Elba) for help. Bloom tells her story to Jaffey, as we all watch. The film is so quickly paced that it was nearly impossible for me to even keep up with it (the dialogue at least), especially at the beginning. I still absolutely loved it though. The characters are so well developed, especially Bloom, and Chastain is amazing in her performance (once again). She's also becoming one of my very favorite actors (as a person, and as a talented movie star). The film is not only a blast to watch, but it's also extremely touching at times. I think I cried tears like 3 or 4 times during it. It's nearly a perfect film in my opinion, and one of the best of 2017. Sorkin also impresses as an amazingly talented director here too, and I'd put the film at least in the same league as 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' and 'A FEW GOOD MEN' (two of my all time favorite movies, that are also written by Sorkin). Any true film fan has to see this movie!",10,3,7,5 January 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Didn't secure even a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars!
","'THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN': Four Stars (Out of Five) .Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson produced this modern American adaptation of the popular long-running Belgian comic series (of the same name) by Georges Remi (who used the pen name Herge). The comics were about a young Belgian reporter named Tintin who got into many adventures with his dog Snowy and other companions he met along the way. Spielberg directed this first film in a planned trilogy under the agreement that Jackson will direct the second. He's been a fan of the series since 1981 when his classic action film 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' was compared to it by critics. This 'performance capture 3D film' has been seen by many to be very much like another Indiana Jones film for Spielberg (except in animated form). I'd have to agree; if you're a fan of Tintin or Indiana Jones you're almost sure to enjoy this action adventure.The screenplay was written by Edgar Wright (of 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD', 'HOT FUZZ' and'SCOTT PILGRIM' fame), Steven Moffat and Joe Cornish and based on three comic books from 1941 to 1944 ('The Crab with the Golden Claws', 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'). The story revolves around a clue to hidden treasure that Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) unwittingly comes into possession of when he buys a model ship, known as 'the Unicorn', at a market stall. He discovers that many want this clue, especially a man known as Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) who will kill to get a hold of it. Tintin soon finds himself kidnapped (as well as his dog Snowy) by Sakharine and his men and aboard a cargo ship sailing to Morocco. On the boat Tintin teams with it's drunken Captain, Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis), and together they try to beat Sakharine to the treasure by escaping and finding the other clues.Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Toby Jones also do nice voice work in the film. The movie is a tad slow-paced at times but for the most part it's pretty action packed. The 3D animation looks spectacular and it's easily the best animated film I've seen all year, which makes it surprising that it didn't secure even a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars (especially when films like 'PUSS IN BOOTS' and 'KUNG FU PANDA 2' did!). It did get an Oscar nomination for Original Score though (by Spielberg's usual partner in crime John Williams) and won Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards. It should be seen as an impressive achievement by just about anyone's standards and deserves much more recognition. Hopefully more new fans will discover it over time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",8,0,3,27 February 2012
Moana," Not as good as classic Disney animation, but it is a very well made and entertaining film.
","'MOANA': Four Stars (Out of Five) Disney's 56th animated feature is this computer-animated fantasy film, starring the voice talent of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The film tells the story of an ancient Polynesian tribe, that's suffering the damage of a horrible curse, when the Chieftain's teenage daughter sets out to end it. She seeks the help of a demigod named Maui, who also caused the curse. The film also features the voices of Auli'i Cravalho (a debut actress, who was cast at the age of just 14), Alan Tudyk, Jemaine Clement, Temuera Morrison, Nicole Scherzinger and Rachel House. It was directed by Ron Clements, John Musker, Don Hall and Chris Williams (Clements and Musker previously co-directed other Disney animated hits, like 'THE LITTLE MERMAID', 'ALADDIN', 'HERCULES' and 'THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG', and Hall and Williams previously co-directed Disney's 'BIG HERO 6'). It was written by Jared Bush, Pamela Ribon and Aaron and Jordan Kandell; along with Clements, Musker, Hall and Williams. The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also done impressively well with critics. I enjoyed it. Moana (Johnson) is the daughter of the chief (Morrison) of a Polynesian tribe, on an island of fisherman. When the fish vanish, due to a curse caused by a demigod named Maui (Johnson), Moana sets out to stop it. She finds the arrogant demigod who caused the curse, and demands he help her. Maui reluctantly agrees and the two go an adventuresome journey together; with the mystical help of the ocean itself. The story is loosely based on Polynesian mythology. The film is beautifully animated and quite colorful. The characters are all likable, and there's even some touching emotional depth (especially towards the end of the movie). Johnson is perfectly cast, and ​ Cravalho does a pretty impressive job as well (for such a young debut actress). There's even a nice message about respecting all life in there, including animals (and not eating them). It's not as good as classic Disney animation, but it is a very well made and entertaining film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/193849869",8,1,10,30 November 2016

The movie stars John David Washington, Adam Driver, Laura Harrier, Topher Grace, Jasper Paakkone, Ryan Eggold and Michael Buscemi. It was also co-produced by Jordan Peele. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's a hit at the Box Office as well. I loved it, and I think it's Spike Lee's best movie to date, as well as one of the best films of the year. It's a really well made cop buddy flick, as well as a great dramatic study of interracial relationships (throughout history). It's also got a little Tarantinoesque vibe going for it the entire time too. I found it immensely entertaining, as well as really emotionally powerful (I even teared up a little in the end) and insightful. It's a must see!",10,6,13,17 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man used to be my favorite superhero, and now Marvel has ruined him for me.
","'SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING': Four Stars (Out of Five) The second reboot of the 'SPIDER-MAN' film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. This one is co-produced by Marvel Studios (for the first time), with Sony Pictures (who previously held the film rights) distributing the movie. It's the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it integrates the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character into the Marvel film universe for the first time. The movie has Parker (now played by Tom Holland) as a 15-year- old high school student, that's trying to balance being a super hero, fighting a new villain called Vulture (played by Michael Keaton, of 'BATMAN' and 'BIRDMAN' fame), and school life (all at the same time). The movie also costars Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man/Tony Stark of course, once again), Jon Favreau, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Michael Chernus, Martin Starr and Donald Glover. It was directed by Jon Watts (who's also helmed such indie hits as 'CLOWN' and 'COP CAR') and it was written by Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Watts and Christopher Ford (a usual writing partner of Watts). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's of course another big hit at the Box Office for Marvel Studios. Being a huge Spider-Man fan, I was severely disappointed with this movie! The story begins in 2012 when a salvage company, ran by Adrian Toomes (Keaton), is ran out of business by Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), but not before Toomes, and his employees, steal some alien technology from a New York site they were working at. They then sell the technology to other criminals, and Toomes builds a suit with it that enables him to fly (and he also takes on the nickname Vulture). 8 years later Peter Parker (Holland) is recruited by Stark to help fight Captain America, and he gives him a special suit to fight criminals with. Parker is eager to become a superhero, while also trying to live a normal high school life. His first major opponent becomes Vulture.I think the film is well directed, acted and even well written (to a certain extent). I also love how minimal the action scenes are, and I like how the villain isn't really that bad of a guy in it. Still I hate how much Marvel changed the source material. This is kind of a good superhero film, but it's just not a good Spider-Man movie (if they would have called it something else, that would have made it a much better film in my opinion). I also don't like how sexist the casting of this film is, all of the women are really attractive in it (including Aunt May, which is ridiculous), and all of the guys are pretty nerdy (even Flash, which is equally ridiculous). I also hate that it's yet another superhero movie that makes rich people the heroes, while the poor hard working Americans are the villains. Tony Stark should not even be in this film too, it's absurd that he's Spider-Man's mentor! So I really hate so much about this film, and I think Marvel is one of the most evil and corrupt businesses in the world, but I have to admit it's still a well made movie. Spider-Man used to be my favorite superhero though, and now Marvel has ruined him for me.Watch our latest 'MOVIE TALK' movie review here: https://vimeo.com/226190246",8,15,26,12 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Every sequel has been a little better than the last!
","'FAST & FURIOUS 6': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The sixth installment in the ever-popular action movie franchise brings back all the stars from the previous films including Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and even Michelle Rodriguez (who's character was killed off two films ago). MMA champion (and rising female action star) Gina Carano (of 'HAYWIRE' fame) and Luke Evans also join the cast this time around. Justin Lin (who directed the last three sequels as well) returns as director and Chris Morgan (who wrote the last three installments) returns as the film's writer. This chapter has DSS agent Luke Hobbs tracking down Dominic Toretto and his team to enlist the gang's help in bringing down a team of deadly mercenary drivers. Toretto reluctantly agrees to help Hobbs when he discovers his old love, he thought was dead, is still alive and working with the team of mercenaries. The film is of course bigger and more action packed than ever and delivers everything die-hard fans of the series have come to expect.The movie begins with Dom (Diesel), Brian (Walker) and the rest of the car racing crew living around the world, on the lam, while spending the $100 million loot they scored in their Rio heist (at the end of the last film). Hobbs (Johnson), now working with his new partner Riley (Carano), tracks down Dom and convinces him to help him capture a team of mercenary drivers led by an ex-British Special Forces soldier named Owen Shaw (Evans). Hobbs offers Dom and his team full pardons if they help him stop Shaw but it's the info that Dom's ex-love Letty (Rodriguez) is still alive that persuades him into doing the job. Action and carnage ensue.I was never a huge fan of the original 2001 hit but I've liked each sequel a little more ever since (although I still haven't seen 'TOKYO DRIFT'). I think the franchise got a lot better with the last chapter when it added 'The Rock' into the mix. That's when box office for the series really skyrocketed and it also reached it's critical acclaim peak; how many movie series can one say that about (I can't think of any). It's great that this film added Carano as well and they also add another big action star at the end, in a post-credits scene, that should build even more anticipation for the next film in the series (which is already planned for next year). The franchise is still just a series of brainless action scenes strung together with no real plot or involving character development but they do keep getting more and more spectacular. This film does have some amazing car chases once again (including one involving a tank) but it still couldn't top the best car chase of the year (or just about any year) from another long running action movie franchise: 'A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD'.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",7,2,6,29 May 2013
The Expendables," Nostalgia Heaven!
","'THE EXPENDABLES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Legendary action superstar Sylvester Stallone stars, directs and co-writes (with Dave Callaham) this action lover's dream featuring an ensemble of most of the biggest names in the genre of the last three decades. Along with Oscar nominee Stallone there's also fellow former nominee Mickey Rourke, former Stallone co-star Dolph Lundgren (probably most well known as Ivan Drago from 'ROCKY IV'), Jason Statham and Jet Li (in their third film together), WWF and UFC champs Steve Austin and Randy Couture, former NFL and extreme sports player Terry Crews and in glorified uncredited cameos (although they're first credited in the adds and trailers) there's Stallone's former business partners (co Planet Hollywood owners) Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Some glaring omissions to the bunch are of course The Rock, Vin Diesel, Chuck Norris, Wesley Snipes (who was cast but had to turn down the part due to his tax problems and could not leave the country), Steven Seagal (who was offered a part but turned it down due to a conflict with one of the producers) and Jean-Claude Van Damme (who rejected a part because he didn't think there was enough substance to the part. Come on Van Damme, give us a break!). Had they cast all those guys it really would have been an action lovers dream feast but there's always the sequels (which one is in development right now).Stallone plays Barney Ross the leader of a team of mercenaries who are hired to perform the most deadly and dangerous military missions the Government and other agencies have to offer, due to the fact that they're deemed 'expendable'. Statham is Barney's best friend and knife throwing expert Lee Christmas, Li is the martial arts expert of the group Ying Yang, Couture is the team's demolition expert Toll Road, Crews is a long time long-barrel expert known as Hale Ceaser and Lundgren is the team's expert sniper Gunnar Jensen. As the movie opens the team is forced to cut Gunnar loose from the team due to his battle with drugs and 'inner demons', this comes back to haunt them later on. They're then offered a job in Vilena by a man they think is a CIA front-man named Mr. Church (Willis) after another team lead by an old rival partner of Barney's named Trench (Schwarzenegger) turns it down. The mission is to over throw a South American dictator (played by David Zayas) so Ross and Christmas travel to Vilena to scout out the area and meet their rebel contact (played by Giselle Itie) who they later learn is the daughter of the General dictator. They also learn that they're also up against a ruthless former CIA operative known as James Munroe (played by Eric Roberts) and his henchman (Austin) who are in league with the general. After narrowly escaping death the team decides to give up on the mission but Barney can't forget about the young rebel who stayed behind and after receiving some advice from his longtime friend Tool (Rourke) decides that the only way to save his soul is to save her. So the team decides to continue with the seemingly suicidal mission.The film is almost wall to wall action with some of the bloodiest and most brutal violence ever depicted on screen and one of the highest body counts of any movie period. The story is of course routine and the characters underdeveloped but those things aren't necessary to a film like this. The sole purpose of a movie like this is to give the action genre fans exactly what they want to see, good old fashioned action. At this it definitely succeeds. It's obviously a nostalgic throwback to the action films of yesterday, although it still has the stylistic camera work and fast cuts action films are famous for today. Stallone is a great movie star, one of the best, not a great actor, although a good one, but a great iconic movie star. He is a great writer and director as well and I think he could be the next Clint Eastwood; the action films he's directed show much more skill and talent than any of the action films Eastwood ever directed. Growing up I was a big Stallone fan, I was a bigger Schwarzenegger and Willis fan, but I also loved Stallone films. Now I've come to realize that he's a better actor and filmmaker than either of the other two. He tends to play the silent and awkward outcast underdog that always beats the odds and conquers his doubters by being the real deal true hero in the end. His films are much more inspirational and relate-able to dreamers everywhere. That's why he's a better movie star than all of the other action heroes. He's made some bad films but they've all been memorable. The rest of the cast are all good and great presences themselves, it's Stallone that really brings it all together and makes it work though. He is the world's top action star and this action extravaganza is one of the great ones.Watch our review show, 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNa6Ky58lm8",10,6,14,17 August 2010
The Way Back," Doesn't live up to it's potential.
","'THE WAY BACK': Three Stars (Out of Five) Peter Weir directs and co-writes (with Keith R. Clarke) this would be epic about about a group of prison escapees that flee a Siberian gulag camp and embark on a 4000 mile trek to India and freedom during World War II. It's based on the book 'The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom' by Slavomir Rawicz, an actual World War II Polish POW of the Soviet Gulag, and was claimed to be (by him) a fact based account of his escape and miraculous journey to freedom in India. The book has recently been proved false and it was discovered that Rawicz was in fact released from the prison by the USSR. Jim Sturgess stars in the film as Janusz, the character loosely based on Rawicz. The film co-stars Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan (of 'THE LOVELY BONES' fame).The film begins with Janusz being sentenced to 20 years in the gulag, in large part due to his wife being tortured and forced to testify against him. Janusz then makes it his mission to escape the prison and make it home to his wife so he can relieve her of her guilt. He makes friends with several other prisoners, including an American named Mr. Smith (Harris) and a Russian criminal named Valka (Farrell), and together they devise a plan of escape. They wait till one night when a storm is so bad it will cover their tracks and, as a group of seven, they make a run for it. They're later joined on their journey by a young teenage girl (Ronan) who claims to have escaped a collective farm after her parents were murdered. The journey becomes extremely treacherous and of course not everyone makes it through alive.Peter Weir is a great director (he's directed such well loved films as 'WITNESS', 'THE MOSQUITO COAST', 'THE TRUMAN SHOW', 'DEAD POETS SOCIETY', 'GALLIPOLI' and 'MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD') but here he doesn't quite live up to his reputation. The film looks beautiful, the acting is effective, the music is fitting and the makeup is exceptional (which is nominated for an Oscar). It has all the ingredients of a classic epic war / drama film but it doesn't quite live up to it's potential. The movie is never as sweeping as it should be and the emotion and depth of the characters just isn't there. At first glance it looks like a great film but it never engages the viewer the way a great film like that should. The film is still mildly entertaining (although it drags in several places) and looks beautiful but it doesn't ever amount to very much. Worth seeing if you're a big fan of these sorts of films but everyone else will be bored.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",6,3,8,18 February 2011
Begin Again," Like a good song you can't wait to hear again!
","'BEGIN AGAIN': Four Stars (Out of Five) Musical romantic comedy flick written and directed by John Carney; who also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed 2007 Irish musical 'ONCE'. Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley star in the movie (Knightley also did all of her own singing) as an alcoholic music executive and a singer/songwriter who collaborate on a music album; they record all live over the summer (in New York City). It costars Hailee Steinfeld, Catherine Keener, James Corden, CeeLo Green, Mos Def and Adam Levine (in his film debut). I found the movie to be really entertaining and emotionally uplifting as well.Ruffalo plays Dan Mulligan, a recently unemployed music label executive who lives in New York City. Dan is separated from his wife, Miriam (Keener), and hasn't signed a successful music artist in seven years. He also has a teenage daughter, named Violet (Steinfelf), and is an alcoholic, due to his depression. Knightley plays Gretta, a singer/songwriter who recently broke up with her longtime boyfriend, Dave (Levine). The two moved to New York because Dave was signed to a record label. He quickly let the success go to his head though and had an affair with a music label associate. Dan discovers Gretta playing one of her songs at a bar, in East Village, and immediately thinks she's the person who will help him get out of the rut he's in. The two soon decide to produce an album together.I like 'ONCE', a lot, because I really like the music and think the movie was filmed beautifully. I like this film for the same reasons; the music is great and the film looks amazing. It's also just a cool feel-good movie. I really enjoyed it, a lot, while I was watching it. Like 'ONCE', it's not a film I'll take a lot away from but it's still a really fun time at the movies. It's also one I look forward to seeing again, like a good song that you can't wait to hear again! To me that's a good movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiVvdUZDgQc",8,1,4,18 July 2014
Megamind," 'Megamind' vs. 'Despicable Me'!
","'MEGAMIND': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The second CGI animated blockbuster this year to revolve around a super villain learning to be good (the other being 'DESPICABLE ME', which I watched the same day). This one comes from DreamWorks Animation and is directed by Tom McGrath (who also directed DreamWorks' 'MADAGASCAR' and it's sequel). It's written by two first time writers, Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons. It features a large voice cast of A list actors including Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, David Cross, Ben Stiller (who also served as an executive producer on the film and was originally cast in the title role) and Will Ferrell as 'Megamind' (after both Stiller and Robert Downy, Jr. backed out of the role).The film opens with an 8 day old big headed blue alien boy being sent away from his planet by his parents before it blows up. In space he crosses paths with another baby boy being sent away from another planet and they both crash on Earth. The blue alien baby lands in a prison as the other baby lands at a rich couple's house. They both attend the same school, in Metro City, with equally impressive powers (one's a genius and the other has super strength and flight) but due to the one babies rich upbringing and good looks he grows up to be an idolized superhero named Metro Man (Pitt) and the other (the blue alien) grows up to be a despised mastermind villain known as Megamind. The two have constant duels but when Megamind kills Metroman (early on in the film) he takes over the city. Although Megamind has everything he thought he ever wanted he's unhappy. He longs for a beautiful reporter (Fey, who voices one of the most attractive animated heroines ever put on film) and for the rivalry of a competitor. So he decides to make a new superhero to challenge him.The film is surprisingly witty and clever; it's filled with several laugh out loud moments and Ferrell gives another classic Will Ferrell performance. It has a slight 'INCREDIBLES' feel to it but never quite reaches those heights. It is better than the other super villain animated film this year though and is one of the best animated films of the year as well. Besides being funny it does have great social commentary: about the people we become because of the advantages and disadvantages were given at birth. It also has some pretty cool animation and action scenes. All in all it's a pretty fun and amusing animated film, better than most.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk",7,6,11,10 January 2011
The Book Thief," Probably would have been better as a TV show.
","'THE BOOK THIEF': Four Stars (Out of Five) World War II drama film about a young girl living with foster parents (during the war in Germany) who also develops relationships with a Jewish refugee (hiding in their home) and a boy (her age) from the neighborhood. It was directed by Brian Percival and written by Michael Petroni. It's based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Markus Zusak. The film stars Sophie Nélisse, Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, Ben Schnetzer, Nico Liersch and Roger Allam (voicing the narrator of the film, Death). I think the movie looks great (and is well made) but it's not quite involving enough to be really interesting or entertaining.Nélisse plays Liesel Meminger, a young girl who is 12 when the movie starts (in 1938 Germany) and 14 by the time it's over. Death (Allam) narrates Liesel's story and tells how her mother (Heike Makatsch) is forced to leave her with foster parents (because her mom is a communist and a target of the Nazis) shortly after her brother (Julian Lehmann) dies. Her foster parents are Hans (Rush) and Rosa Hubermann (Watson). Liesel takes a liking to Hans much more than her new mother because he's a lot kinder. She also takes a liking to a young neighborhood boy, Rudy (Liersch), who thinks he's in love with her (and is constantly asking her for a kiss). When Hans learns that Liesel can't read (after she's picked on for it at school) he begins to teach her. Liesel becomes obsessed with books and later develops a relationship with a Jewish refugee, Max Vandenburg (Schnetzer), who comes to hide in the Hubermann's home.Brian Percival has directed multiple episodes (6) of the popular TV show 'DOWNTOWN ABBEY', which is a historical drama series set right before World War I. That's what this movie feels like to me (a TV show). It's not epic enough to be a great dramatic war film and probably would be much better as a longer developed TV show. The acting is all good (the young actress in the lead is especially impressive) but the characters' drama isn't overly interesting or that memorable. One thing about the film that is truly cinematic is the score by John Williams (one of the greatest music composers of all time) and this is the first movie he's done in 8 years that's not directed by Steven Spielberg. It is a World War II film though, which a lot of Spielberg movies are, so it feels like a John Williams type movie. The film is probably more interesting if you're really fascinated by World War II but most others will be likely be bored.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w",8,2,3,30 January 2014
Horrible Bosses," 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' isn't horrible but it isn't that good either.
","'HORRIBLE BOSSES': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Dark comedy with a plot-line almost everyone can relate to focusing on three men who plot to kill their self absorbed sadistic bosses. In today's economy the premise is almost guaranteed box-office gold but that's one of the only things the film really has going for it. It's yet another comedy that probably sounded a lot better on paper but then failed to translate (any strong humor) to the screen. One other thing the film does have going for it though is a really strong and impressive cast featuring Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Collin Farrell, Julie Bowen, Donald Sutherland and Jamie Foxx. It was written by Michael Markowitz, Jonathan M. Goldstein and John Francis Daley (who also plays a small part in the film) and directed by Seth Gordon (who's known for directing the popular documentary 'THE KING OF KONG: A FISTFUL OF QUARTERS' and a segment of another documentary film known as 'FREAKONOMICS').Bateman stars as Nick Hendricks, an employee of a successful financial firm who has been putting up with his abusive boss, Dave Harken (Spacey), for years in hopes of a promotion. When the time comes for Nick to receive the promotion he deserves Harken absorbs the position himself instead. Day plays a recently engaged dental assistant named Dale Arbus who constantly has to put up with his boss Julia Harris's (Aniston) inappropriate sexual advances. Things escalate to the point where Julia blackmails Dale into having sex with her. Sudeikis also co-stars as a happily employed industrial worker named Kurt Buckman who has a change of fortune when his lovable boss Jack Pellitt (Sutherland) dies and his moronic cocaine addicted son Bobby (Farrell) takes over the company. All three men reach the point where they decide to resort to murder and look into hiring a specialist to 'take out' their bosses. They turn to Dean 'Motherf---er' Jones (Foxx) to do the job.The film works on a lot of levels: the actors are all well cast and deliver strong performances and the movie has a lot of funny ideas. The directing is a little off target though and the script probably could have used some more polishing. The cast is funny but I can think of a few better casting choices, in my opinion. I would have went with a Charlize Theron, Salma Hayek or Sigourney Weaver in Aniston's role. Jennifer does her best but she's a little too sweet and innocent to really pull off that part. I also would have went with more notorious celebrities for the Farrell and Spacey roles (although Spacey is perfect in his part, he seems like he's so full of himself that he does make the perfect ass). Someone like Charlie Sheen or Mel Gibson would have been hilarious in Farrell's role though (especially Sheen). One of the main problems with the film is you don't hate the bosses enough. In order for the film to be really relatable the bosses should have been almost pure evil. The movie is also not dark enough so it has a really uneven tone. Three likable guys resort to murder pretty quickly but of course the viewer always knows they're not going to be able to go through with it. Even with all these flaws the movie's main problem is that it's just not that funny. Parts work but not a single scene is truly laugh out loud hilarious (Foxx is completely wasted in the film). It's a shame because it had so much potential!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWEHzfCd7M",5,1,2,9 July 2011
Black Mass," For the most part enthralling!
","'BLACK MASS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Crime biopic based on the life of notorious Irish-American mobster Whitey Bulger; detailing his relations with corrupt FBI members, including an old childhood friend. The film is being called a comeback, for lead actor Johnny Depp (after five box office and critical failures in a row); and he's also now considered the frontrunner, in next year's Academy Awards Best Actor race. The film costars Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, Dakota Johnson, David Harbour, Kevin Bacon, Adam Scott, Corey Stoll, Peter Sarsgaard, W. Earl Brown, Julianne Nicholson and Juno Temple. It was directed by Scott Cooper (who also helmed 'CRAZY HEART' and 'OUT OF THE FURNACE') and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth; the screenplay is based on the 2001 novel, by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. I found the film to be a little uneven, and slow-paced, but for the most part enthralling. The story begins in 1975; when James 'Whitey' Bulger (Depp) was already a well known gangster, and infamous crime boss, in South Boston. He worked closely with his cohorts: Stephen Flemmi (Cochrane), Kevin Weeks (Plemons) and Johnny Martorano (Brown); to organize most of the crime there. Whitey's leadership was challenged though, by another Italian-American crime group (from the North End), called The Angiulo Brothers. So when his old childhood friend, turned FBI agent, John Connolly (Edgerton), returned to town; Whitey reluctantly agreed to an informant partnership, in order to takeout his enemies. The film follows all of the bloody and horrendous events that followed. The film is very slow paced; but it's also informative, intense and involving. I knew little about the real Whitey Bulger, before seeing the movie, so the story always kept me (at least somewhat) entertained. I'm not a big fan of biopics but it's hard not to find such larger-than-life characters fascinating. Depp's performance is the highlight of the movie (and it's great to see him back in top form) but the supporting cast is all impressive as well (the makeup, on Depp, is superb too). I also really like Cooper, as a director, and have immensely enjoyed all of his (three) films, so far. The movie is definitely worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/a2oJP7OqaOg",9,1,6,22 September 2015
The Town," Believable and gritty as well as thrilling and fast paced!
","'THE TOWN': Five Stars (Out of Five) Ben Affleck, like many 'A' list celebrities, has had a career of pretty big ups and pretty low downs. He broke on to the scene as a regular in Kevin Smith movies, first as a supporting antagonist in 'MALLRATS' and then as the romantic lead in the critically acclaimed 'CHASING AMY'. He followed that up by winning an Oscar for co-writing 'GOOD WILL HUNTING', with buddy Matt Damon, and was poised for super stardom as well as critical darling fame but instead he went for almost solely the paycheck and did one big, mostly critically panned, blockbuster after another. Then he made four critical and financial duds in a row in 2003 and 2004 ('GIGLI', 'PAYCHECK', 'JERSEY GIRL' and 'SURVIVING Christmas') and smartly laid low and disappeared for a couple years after that. He took some time to 'reinvent himself' and broke back on to the scene in 2006 with a Golden Globe nominated performance in 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (as well as a small impressive ensemble turn in 'SMOKIN' ACES') and then surprised almost everyone with his critically showered directorial debut in 'GONE BABY GONE' (which he also co-wrote the screenplay). He stayed behind the camera and let brother Casey star in what became one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2007. Now he's back co-writing and directing again to even more impressive results (as well as starring this time around) with 'THE TOWN' which is easily one of the best films of the year.In the film Affleck plays anti hero Doug MacRay the leader of a team of bank robbers living in Charlestown, a neighborhood in Boston that (as the movie informs us very early on) is the world's capitol for bank robberies (as well as other crimes). Apparently crooks are bread there and the business is passed down from father to son. While pulling a heist, at the opening of the movie, Doug and his crew take a bank manager (played by Rebecca Hall) hostage. They let her go only to discover she lives just a few blocks away from them. Doug takes it upon himself to find out how much information she knows and might be giving to the authorities and ends up falling for her. This causes drama with his best friend James (played by Jeremy Renner, last year's Oscar nominee for 'THE HURT LOCKER') who also is upset with Doug's plans of skipping town (after of course 'one more big job'). There's additional conflict brought on by two FBI agents (played by 'MAD MEN's Jon Hamm and 'LOST's Titus Welliver, the 'Man in Black') whom are trying to find enough evidence to put the boys away for good. Blake Lively co-stars as Jame's single mother sister and Doug's ex girlfriend who's had her problems with drugs.The film is rich in character drama and intriguing dialog which makes the action that much more compelling and the action is breathtaking; it's believable and gritty as well as thrilling and fast paced. It kind of puts the viewer in an odd place seeing as your kind of influenced into rooting for the 'bad guys', which seems more and more common in film lately. That's the power of film though; a movie like this can present these guys to you, who do horrible things, and you still end up feeling sorry for them and relating to them on some level. A great deal of that is thanks to the writing and Affleck's amazing directing. He has such a key eye for interesting visuals that it's kind of remarkable to think he starred in so many cheesy half ass-ed movies. The acting is all outstanding as well especially Affleck and Renner (who makes a great 'wild card'). The film is based on the award winning novel 'Prince Of Thieves' by Chuck Hogan which won the Hammett Prize in 2005 for 'excellence in crime writing'. The film already has a ton of Oscar buzz around it and I predict it will at least get a best picture nod and hopefully directing for Affleck as well. Some say it might be a little too violent for the Academy's taste but if you think about it three out of the last four movies to win best picture were all violent action films ('THE HURT LOCKER', 'THE DEPARTED' and 'NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN'). This film is in the same league as those, in my personal opinion better, I believe it will be long remembered as a classic crime drama. Yet another masterpiece from Ben Affleck!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",10,3,7,21 September 2010
Underworld Awakening," Now it seems to closer resemble the 'RESIDENT EVIL' franchise.
","'UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This fourth film in the successful action/horror series finds Kate Beckinsale returning to her most popular role (after sitting the last film, a prequel, out). This installment was directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein and written by John Hlavin, J. Michael Straczynski, Alison Burnett and Len Wiseman (who also produced). Wiseman has co-written all of the 'UNDERWORLD' films, as well as directed the first two, and is married to Beckinsale. This chapter has Beckinsale's character (Selene) pitted against evil humans determined to exterminate all vampires and lycan alike. It's not as good as the previous three films but it's about as good as you can expect coming from a fourth chapter in a vampires vs. werewolves series.The film takes place 12 years after the second movie, 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (which took place third chronologically), when Selene awakens in a laboratory where she has been experimented on for a dozen years by scientists. She also learns that humans have discovered the existence of vampires and lycan. Both species have also nearly been exterminated by the evil human race, who also plot to create a more advanced and super-powerful lycan being. Selene must team with a human detective (Michael Ealy) in order to stop them.The movie is stylishly directed and action packed. It's almost too fast paced though as the relentless action scenes get a little exhausting. Beckinsale looks beautiful (as always) though and so does the movie (especially in 3D). It's just that it used to be a more involving and intelligent film series and now it seems to closer resemble the 'RESIDENT EVIL' franchise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fii0IC2l7o",7,1,3,5 May 2012
Suicide Squad," An extended director's cut would make it nearly perfect!
","'SUICIDE SQUAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)The highly anticipated superhero flick, based on the DC comics antihero team (of the same name). It's also the third movie in the DC Extended Universe film franchise (following 'MAN OF STEEL' and 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'), and Ben Affleck even reprises his role as Batman in it. The film stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Karen Fukuhara, Cara Delevingne, Ike Barinholtz and Scott Eastwood. It was written and directed by David Ayer. The story revolves around an unlikely team of formerly imprisoned supervillains, that are recruited by a secret government agency; to go on a special black ops mission to save the world. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, but (most) fans of the comic book insist it's a masterpiece. I absolutely loved it! The story focuses around a government program, conceived and executed by U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Davis), in which imprisoned dangerous criminals are selected to be a part of a special black ops team. They're promised a reward of clemency, if they succeed; and threatened with immediate execution, if they try to escape. They're mission is to stop a powerful mystic force, and it's lethal army. The 'bad guys' that make up the team, surprisingly bond in the process.The movie is undeniably fun! It's dark, violent, and sometimes quite disturbing (much like 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'); but it's also hilarious, and highly entertaining. There's some really interesting character development (throughout), and the performances are outstanding (especially Robbie and Leto). The action scenes are kind of by-the-numbers, but they're also involving (because the characters are so likable). My only real compliant with the film, is that's it's too quickly edited; probably due to studio demands (to make the movie shorter and faster-paced). I'm sure an extended director's cut would make it nearly perfect (like the extended cut of 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN')!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",10,4,11,9 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," On a pure action movie level it is the best of the Marvel superhero films!
","'CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2011 hit Marvel Comics superhero flick 'CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER' and the ninth installment in 'THE AVENGERS' film franchise. It picks up two years after the end of 'THE AVENGERS' movie with Steve Rogers still working for S.H.I.E.L.D. (and living in Washington D.C.) when he discovers a terrorist plot inside the agency. He has to team up with Black Widow, and a new ally called Falcon, in order to stop the threat. The movie was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (who are best known for directing TV shows like 'COMMUNITY' and films like 'YOU, ME AND DUPREE' and 'WELCOME TO COLLINWOOD'). It was written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also co-wrote the first one). I found it to be immensely entertaining and well made; on a pure action movie level it is the best of the Marvel superhero films! The action begins when a S.H.I.E.L.D. ship is hijacked by Algerian pirates. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, leads a team into rescue the hostages while agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), a.k.a. Black Widow, retrieves important data from the ship's computers. Rogers was unaware of Romanoff's plan and is angered by her jeopardizing the mission. He later learns, from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), that the data has to do with something called 'Project Insight', in which three Helicarriers are to be used to eliminate potential threats to S.H.I.E.L.D. (using spy satellite intel that they're linked to). After Fury is targeted by crooked S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, led by an assassin known as 'Winter Soldier' (Sebastian Stan), he informs the Captain that the agency has been compromised and gives him the thumbnail drive (with top secret information on it). Rogers then finds his own life in danger as well and has no one to trust (or turn to), except his 'Avengers' ally Black Widow and a new friend named Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a.k.a. Falcon.The cast also includes Robert Redford, Frank Grillo, Cobie Smulders and the stunningly beautiful Emily VanCamp. It's action packed and full of intense suspense driven drama. The stakes feel much higher in this movie than the prior film (or 'THE AVENGERS') and the whole thing is totally engaging and involving (with enough humor thrown in here and there to make it really amusing as well). The CGI is surprisingly light for a Marvel superhero film and the Russo brothers did a great job of giving it that classic action movie/political thriller feel. I like that it has a completely different style than the first one (and any other 'Avengers' movies) and really think it's arguably the best in the franchise (at least as far as action flicks go). I like the real world political commentary (it's obviously a critique on using drone strikes for targeted killing) and it does seem a lot more believable and reality based than most other films in it's genre. It's always funny (though) that none of the other superheroes are around when the world is in great danger (in these individual superhero movies); you'd think the other Avengers would want to be there when something very serious happens to a mutual friend and everyone's lives and well being are placed in harm's. It is a comic book movie though and that's to be expected I guess.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh0hmoLcuEo",10,2,4,7 April 2014
Life of Pi," What the film says about religion will offend some viewers while enlightening others.
","'LIFE OF PI': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Director Ang Lee's adaptation of the popular 2001 book (of the same name) by Yann Martel about a boy who survives a shipwreck only to be trapped on a boat in the Pacific Ocean with a deadly Bengal tiger. The screenplay was written by David Magee (who also wrote the script adaptation for the 2004 film 'FINDING NEVERLAND') and stars Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan in the title role (at two different stages of his life). The film is presented in 3D and packed with visual effects (for the telling of what was said to be an 'unfilmable' book). I found the film to be visually stunning but slow in places. It does build to a satisfactory conclusion though, about spirituality and how we all view the world.The film tells the story of Pi Patel (played by Sharma at age 17 and Khan when he's an adult in his 50s), who was named 'Piscine Molitor' by his parents (after a swimming pool in France). He changed his name to Pi in secondary school after growing tired of constantly being mocked for his name by fellow classmates. He was raised Hindu but also takes up Catholicism and Islam at age 12. His family owns a zoo but decides to sell the animals and move to Canada due to political problems arising in India. A storm causes the ship to sink and Pi is the only one who makes it on to a lifeboat, except for four other animals (a wounded zebra, a spotted hyena, a orangutan and a Bengal tiger). The hyena quickly feeds on the other animals before being killed by the tiger. Pi must then find a way to live on the boat with the deadly tiger (without being eaten by it). He tells this story to a reporter (Rafe Spall) when he's married with children and in his 50's.Of course Pi's religious teachings come in to play while struggling to survive on the ocean. That's what the film is really about and it plays a part in a twist ending as well. What the film says about religion (in the end) might offend some viewers while enlightening others. I liked the overall message of the film. It's definitely a little slow at times due to the fact it primarily takes place on the ocean with one human castaway and a tiger. In that way the film is a little like Robert Zemeckis's 2000 film 'CAST AWAY' as well. Visually it's stunning and probably worth the price to see it in 3D (unless you just don't care for 3D). Not my favorite Ang Lee film but it's definitely a decent fantasy adventure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-fGGKVWPc",9,2,5,27 November 2012
Tangled," A decent animated kids film but certainly not a great one!
","'TANGLED': Three Stars (Out of Five) Disney's 50th animated feature! They spared no expense too, at a whopping $260 million budget it's the second most expensive film in history. The film is a throwback to the great Disney animated films we saw in the 80's and 90's as opposed to the more recent (but it's still a far cry from the classics of the 30's, 40's and 50's). It's a fantasy film based on an old fairy tale again (another from the Brothers Grimm) with plenty of musical numbers. Something kids are sure to love but it may lack the interest of older viewers.Revamped retelling of the Grimms Fairy Tale 'Rapunzel'. It tells the story of a magical flower that has the power to heal the sick and wounded. It also has the power to keep an old witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) young if she sings to it. The Queen of a nearby village becomes ill and having heard of the flower sends her guards to retrieve it to cure her. They do and the Queen is saved. Shortly later she gives birth to a daughter, Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) and Gothel knows that the powers of the flower still exists in the child's hair as long as it isn't cut. So the witch kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her away in a hidden tower raising her as her own. She forbids Rapunzel from leaving the tower, telling her it's for her safety, and never cuts her hair. 18 years later Rapunzel longs for the outside world and truly dreams of traveling to the mysterious lights she sees every year on her birthday. When a thief (voiced by Zachary Levi, of TV's 'CHUCK' fame) stumbles upon her tower while trying to elude authorities she knocks him out and steals his loot. She then makes a deal with him that she'll give him back his valuables if he agrees to escort her to the magical lights. An adventure begins and of course the two fall in love.The movie is predictable and clichéd but it is somewhat fun and amusing as well. The animation is colorful and beautiful and the jokes are somewhat funny. I didn't find the music to be very well written though and when it gets to be one musical number after another the film starts to drag and for me becomes really uninteresting. The film is clever and visually impressive to a certain extent but I didn't find it to be nearly as entertaining as a lot of the glowing reviews it's been getting (like Quentin Tarantino's 5th place 2010 top 20 placing). It is better than a lot of the more recent Disney animated films though and as a kids film it definitely works. Overall it's a decent animated kids film but certainly not a great one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso",6,3,11,7 January 2011
Doctor Strange," It's a little different, than other Marvel Studio superhero films.
","'DOCTOR STRANGE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is based on the Marvel Comics superhero character 'Doctor Strange'. Strange was a talented neurosurgeon that lost his skills in a horrible car accident. He seeks help from a Sorcerer, called The Ancient One, to heal himself; and in the process he gains mystic super powers. The movie stars Benedict Cumberbatch, in the title role, and it costars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Tilda Swinton, Mads Mikkelsen, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Scott Adkins and Benjamin Bratt. It was written by Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and it was directed by Derrickson (Derrickson has previously directed, and co-written, such popular horror flicks as 'SINISTER', 'DELIVER US FROM EVIL', 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' and 'HELLRAISER: INFERNO'). The movie has been a huge blockbuster at the Box Office (much like all Marvel Studio films), and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I liked it. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is a very successful neurosurgeon, that's horribly wounded in a disastrous car accident; losing the use of his talented hands. In a desperate effort to try and heal himself, Stephen travels to Kamar-Taj; and meets a powerful sorcerer called the Ancient One (Swinton). She teaches Strange her powerful mystic abilities; and Strange also learns that the world is under attack, by other evil sorcerers. The doctor might also be one of the only people that can stop them. The movie is just as fun, and entertaining, as most Marvel Studio superhero films. This one is cool because it's a little different; like they all are, but this one feels even more so. Despite it's fresh uniqueness, the film still suffers from a lot of the usual Marvel action film clichés; and overuse of CGI. It does always look cool, but it also loses a lot of it's freshness; in it's overuse of CGI. For the most part though, it's a well made (and fun) superhero action movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30",8,1,1,16 November 2016
Interstellar," Isn't quite as great as I was hoping.
","'INTERSTELLAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)Christopher Nolan's new $165 million budgeted sci-fi epic about a team of explorers that travel across space, through a newly discovered wormhole, in an attempt to find a more habitable planet for humanity to live on; after all resources on Earth are nearly destroyed, by drought and famine. It was directed by Nolan and written by him and his brother Jonathan (the two have teamed together on many scripts for Christopher Nolan films). It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Topher Grace, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn and Michael Caine (plus a few other surprise celebrity cameos, if you don't check IMDb). I think it's a breathtakingly beautiful and impressively ambitious film but it isn't quite as great as I was hoping, even so.The story begins in the near future, when mankind is desperately trying to produce more agricultural resources; due to natural disaster (like mainly huge dust storms) depleting most of what we had. A secret NASA intelligence base, lead by Professor Brand (Caine), has discovered a wormhole that can quickly lead space travelers to other uncharted planets. They hope to send a team of experts through the wormhole, in an attempt to find a planet suitable to live on and colonize (saving humanity). Brand recruits Cooper (McConaughey), a former NASA pilot, into leading the mission; when he mysteriously stumbles across their hidden base. Cooper is reluctant to leave his family behind, especially his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), but he knows it's the only way to possibly save them. The scientific aspects of the story are pretty complex and hard to follow (for me at least) but I think with repeat viewing I'll understand the movie a lot more (it took me at least two or three viewings to fully get 'INCEPTION'). For that reason, plus it's nearly three hour running length, it is very slow and feels really long in places. It's visually stunning and always emotionally involving and interesting (even if you can't always understand what's going on). The acting is all great, especially McConaughey (his character is by far the most developed); he, and his costars, do bring a lot more depth to the film (than just the Nolans possibly could). Like a lot of classic sci-fi it gets really philosophical in the end; attempting to explore really broad elements of love and life that science never has been able to, but that's what I especially liked about it. Nolan does an amazing job presenting the material; even if he's a lot more focused on telling a broader and more emotionally complex story this time around, rather than stunning people constantly with action and quick pacing. It's definitely memorable and one not to be missed (especially if you're a Christopher Nolan or sci-fi movie fan).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/BjKuYpFJY8M",10,2,8,7 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," An excellent tale of forgivenes, and how to accept those you don't agree with!
","'THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI': Five Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed, multi-award winning, Oscar hopeful from Academy Award winning writer/director Martin McDonagh (who previously won an Oscar for writing 2008's 'IN BRUGES', which he also directed). The film is a dark comedy-drama about a grieving divorced mother, who puts up three billboards (outside Ebbing, Missouri) shaming the police for not making any progress in her daughter's brutal rape and murder case. It stars Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell (who also starred in McDonagh's 2012 hit 'SEVEN PSYCHPATHS'), Woody Harrelson, Lucas Hedges, Caleb Landry Jones, Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish, John Hawkes and Samara Weaving. The film has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's also won multiple prestigious awards as well (and been nominated for a bunch of others). It's expected to be nominated for multiple major Academy Awards too. I loved it.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is a single divorced mother, who's still grieving over the horrific rape and murder of her teenage daughter, seven months earlier. She is especially upset with the local police department for not making any progress in the case. So she puts up three billboards shaming them, especially Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Harrelson), who's dying from pancreatic cancer. Willoughby, and officer Jason Dixon (Rockwell), are extremely annoyed by her actions, as well as most of the rest of the town, and Mildred and her depressed teenage son, Robbie (Hedges), are harassed for it. Mildred still presses on though. The movie is especially impressive in how it presents such a diverse range of fully developed characters, that are all extremely flawed and yet still very relatable (as both likable and seemingly very real people). It's an excellent tale of forgiveness, in my opinion, and learning how to accept and tolerate those you don't agree with. The climax and ending of the movie are also both priceless. It's so emotionally charged and totally unpredictable, that the film just really leaves you thinking about it, long after it's over. McDormand and Rockwell are also both outstanding in their roles, and McDonagh proves himself as one of Hollywood's top directors to watch for. The film is definitely a must see!Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",10,4,11,6 December 2017
Pacific Rim," The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie; fanboys should be more than pleased!
","'PACIFIC RIM': FIVE STARS (OUT OF FIVE)Director Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi action film about a future where the world is taken over by giant sea creatures and humanity's last hope is to build giant robots to fight them. The robots are controlled by two pilots who must merge their minds together through a neural link in order to control them. Del Toro uses this theme as a metaphor for how we all must come together in life (accepting each other's flaws and differences and utilizing each other's strengths and empathy) in order to survive and live in peace and happiness. The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie with a lot of heart and fanboys should be more than pleased. The story is set in the near future when a portal is opened, in a crevasse beneath the Pacific Ocean, which leads to another dimension. It unleashes giant monsters into our world, called 'Kaiju', which quickly wipe out millions of lives and destroy much of our resources. All the countries of the world unite together to fight the monsters and develop a technology they call 'Jaegers', which are giant humanoid robots controlled by two pilots. The pilots must link to the robots, through a neural bridge, in order to control them. This proved to be too much for a single pilot so two pilots are required to control the robots and must neurally link together, through a process called 'Drifting', in order to do so. 'Drifting' allows the pilots to see into each others minds, and learn the other's deepest and darkest fears, in order to better cooperate and control the giant machinery. The film focuses on one pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who loses his brother (Diego Klattenhoff) while 'drifting' (during a 'Jaeger' battle with an extremely powerful 'Kaiju'). The trauma of the event forces him to retire and the world continues to decay as the 'Jaegers' become less and less effective in battling the 'Kaiju'. The worlds governments eventually give up on the 'Jaeger' program and terminate it. The 'Jaeger' program's commanding officer, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), isn't ready to quit just yet. He comes up with a plan to end the war with the monsters once and for all but he needs Becket to help him carry it out. Becket reluctantly agrees and teams up with a test pilot, named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), to pilot his old 'Jaeger' (which is named 'Gipsy Danger' and one of only four remaining 'Jaegers'). Mako is very close to Pentecost and has a tragic past involving the 'Kaiju', which causes complications when 'drifting' with Becket. The two must overcome these problems and work together as the 'Kaiju' become an increasingly greater threat. A geek scientist, named Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day, of 'IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA' fame) also becomes intricate in Becket's plan to stop the apocalypse.Del Toro directed and co-wrote the film (with Travis Beacham, who conceived the story idea). Together they really have created an amazing world. I love all the detail and passion that went into creating it and think it really paid off well. Their $180 million budget really went to good use as the film looks spectacular. It's like a beautiful live action cartoon and you really can't go wrong with giant robots vs. monsters (the action scenes are unreal)! It's everything I loved about the movies when I was a kid (this movie would have blown me away). The acting is great (Elba is always too cool, Kikuchi gives a passionate and very strong performance and I could watch Day for hours in a role like this) but the star of this movie really is Guillermo del Toro. He's really outdone himself here. I love movies but I especially like the nostalgic ones that really bring out the kid in me. This is one of those movies and I can't give it high enough praise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P84p-Ba6JbY",Null,2,6,13 July 2013
American Sniper," It's sad that a lot of viewers will go into it uneducated.
","'AMERICAN SNIPER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Iraq war flick that's loosely based on Navy SEAL Chris Kyle's autobiography 'American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History' (written by Klye, Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice). Bradley Cooper stars in the movie, as Kyle, and he also co-produced it. Clint Eastwood directed the film and Jason Hall wrote the screenplay. The movie has been nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay) and it also did huge Box Office on it's opening weekend (in theatrical wide release); making over $105 million in four days. It's received mostly positive reviews, from movie critics, but it's also garnered a lot of negative criticism; for it's historical inaccuracies and glamorized depiction of war. The movie also depicts a pretty distorted image of it's central character; who suffered from severe mental illness, lied a lot and bragged about killing (which he also found immense joy in). As a work of just pure cinematic fiction though, I loved it!Cooper plays a Texan named Chris Kyle; who was a rodeo cowboy until he saw footage of the United States embassy bombings, on TV, in 1998. He decided to enlist in the Navy and became a Navy SEAL sniper. During his training he met Taya Renae (Sienna Miller), at a bar, and he went on to marry her and start a family. He deployed to Iraq after the September 11, 2001 attacks; and served four tours there. During his time of service he claimed to have killed 255 people; 160 were officially confirmed by the Department of Defense. The movie focuses on his obsession with his job and how it effected his family, at home, and his own mental well-being (although it goes into very little detail about it).Cooper secured the film rights to the book and was originally going to have his buddy David O. Russell direct it; I really wish I could have seen that version (O. Russell is one of my favorite filmmakers). After O. Russell eventually passed on the movie, Steven Spielberg was set to direct it; he wanted to make it a much bigger budgeted epic war film though (and it was his idea to add a rival sniper; that Kyle was constantly battling throughout). Spielberg also passed on the movie, after Warner Bros. (the studio releasing it) wouldn't give him the money he wanted to make it with; I would also like to have seen Spielberg's version of the film (Spielberg and O. Russell have directed two of the greatest war flicks ever made; 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' and 'THREE KINGS'). I do like Eastwood's movie, as pure Hollywood escapism, but I also think a more truthful and accurate film, based on Chris Kyle's actual life, would have been more appropriate and insightful. The omission of Kyle's drastic mental issues, constant lying and somewhat psychotic outlook on life (and death) is severely misleading. If you know the true story though, the film can still be appreciated for it's expert craftsmanship and skillfully produced entertainment value. I can understand how some see the movie as unethical; for distorting facts and giving American viewers just what they want to see (and only that). I still thoroughly enjoyed it though. Eastwood's direction has never been better and Cooper turns in yet another amazing performance (one of the very best of 2014). I think that if the film were set in a different setting (like say a futuristic sci-fi warzone), and the filmmakers didn't claim it was based on actual historical events, most movie fans would just see it as an awesome action movie. I also think it's one of the most important films of the year because it does bring up important issues about war and filmmaking and it also raises insightful discussions about the responsibilities that filmmakers should (or shouldn't) have; in telling a true story. It's sad that a lot of viewers will go into it uneducated, on the disturbing details of Chris Kyle's true life, and therefore believe that most of what they're seeing is true. For educated and open-minded viewers though, it still can be a very powerful and entertaining filmgoing experience!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/1_bZp5ejQ4I",10,8,26,20 January 2015
Lion," Definitely one of the year's best!
","'LION': Five Stars (Out of Five)Another upcoming Academy Awards hopeful is this drama, directed by debut feature filmmaker Garth Davis. It tells the story of a 5- year-old Indian boy, that falls asleep on a train car and is taken 1600 kilometers from where he lives. He is later adopted, by an Australian couple, and 25 years later he decides to track down his birth family, by using Google Earth. The film is based on the 2014 non-fiction book 'A Long Way Home' (by Saroo Brierley), and it was scripted by Luke Davies. It stars Dev Patel, Sunny Pawar, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham. The film has performed well at the Box Office, and with critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple respected awards (and it's also won some). I loved it.Saroo (Pawar) goes with his older brother, Guddu (Abhisek Bharate), to work at a train station one night. When Saroo is then too sleepy to help, he waits at a bench, for Guddu, while his brother goes to work. When Guddu doesn't return though, Saroo goes looking for him. He then falls asleep on a train, while looking for his brother, and the train takes off with him sleeping inside it. It takes Saroo 1600 kilometers away, to Calcutta. Having no idea how to get back home, or how to tell anyone where he's from, the boy is forced to live on the streets. He's later put in an orphanage, and then adopted by an Australian couple (Kidman and Wenham). 25 years later, Saroo (now played by Patel) decides to track down his biological family, and finally return home. He uses Google Earth to help him do this, although at first it seems impossible.The movie is very involving, and quite fascinating; I was hooked on it from the very start. The characters are all lovable, and the performances are all topnotch (especially Patel and Kidman). It's also a very emotionally moving film, and in some ways it's quite inspiring. I look forward to seeing what Davis directs next; this movie is definitely one of the year's best, and it deserves all of it's awards recognition.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",10,3,8,18 January 2017
The Lost City of Z," What's most impressive about the film though, is how much it resembles classic cinema of yesteryear!
","'THE LOST CITY OF Z': Four Stars (Out of Five) An adventure biopic, based on the 2009 book (of the same name) by David Grann. It's about the British explorer Percy Fawcett; who disappeared in 1925, with his son, after trying to find a lost city in the Amazon. The film stars Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller and Tom Holland. It was written and directed by James Gray; who also performed both duties on such critically acclaimed films as 'THE IMMIGRANT', 'WE OWN THE NIGHT', 'TWO LOVERS' and 'THE YARDS'. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office so far. While the film is a little too slow-paced at times (for me), I mostly found it to be a very well made and entertaining movie (especially for a biopic).The story begins in Ireland, in 1905, when Percy Fawcett is a skilled British officer participating in an elk hunt (for the benefit of visiting Austro-Hungarian nobility). Although Fawcett kills the elk, he's snubbed at the after-party (due to his social standing). The next year he's asked to lead an expedition in the Amazon jungle (over a Brazil and Bolivia border dispute). While on the expedition, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin (Pattinson); who was sent to join Percy (due to his knowledge of the Amazon jungle). While exploring, Fawcett and Costin discover evidence of an ancient lost city. They have trouble convincing others of it back home in England though. Fawcett then makes it his life obsession to return to the Amazon, and find the city once again (to prove of it's existence to the world). He makes multiple more attempts at it, over several following years, before his disappearance.The movie is extremely slow-paced, as it starts out, and I had trouble staying interested in it. It does get much more interesting, and involving, about 30-minutes into the film though. From then on, I really enjoyed it. It's definitely not an action-packed movie, but it is very fascinating and intense (especially for a biopic). Hunnam is great in the lead; and Miller, Pattinson and Holland all give fine supporting performances as well. What's most impressive about the film though, is how much it resembles classic cinema of yesteryear (from several decades ago). Grann has definitely proved what a talented and highly skilled director he is.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/217879519",8,2,8,11 May 2017
Southpaw," Screw the critics!
","'SOUTHPAW': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the greatest actors of his generation (or any), stars in this boxing drama flick, directed by Antoine Fuqua (the man responsible for such gritty crime thrillers as 'TRAINING DAY', 'BROOKLYN'S FINEST' and 'THE EQUALIZER'). It was written by Kurt Sutter; a TV writer, known for writing several episodes of such popular crime dramas as 'THE SHIELD' and 'SONS OF ANARCHY' (which he also created). The film tells the story of a champion boxer, who desperately fights to get his life back on track; after his wife is killed and he loses his daughter to child protection services. It costars Forest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams, Oona Laurence, 50 Cent, Naomie Harris and Miguel Gomez. The movie also features the final music score of the late James Horner; who worked for free, and the film is dedicated to. The soundtrack also features multiple songs by Eminem, who was originally set to star in the movie (reprising his role from '8 MILE'). The film hasn't received the best reviews from critics; but it's a sports movie classic, and it has to be seen by any true movie lover.Gyllenhaal plays a professional boxer named Billy Hope; who's recently retired from the sport, after winning the World Light Heavyweight championship. His manager, Jordan Mains (50 Cent), wants him to keep fighting, and an extremely arrogant up-and-coming boxer, Miguel 'Magic' Escobar (Gomez), desperately wants to fight him. His wife, Maureen (McAdams), wants him to stay at home, at their house in New York City, with her and their young daughter Leila (Laurence). Everything changes though, when Maureen is killed in a tragic accident; and Billy starts abusing drugs and alcohol, to cope. He eventually turns to a veteran boxer, Titus Wills (Whitaker), for help. I love Jake Gyllenhaal (he's my second favorite male actor right now), I also really like boxing movies and Antoine Fuqua films (to varying degrees). This flick is definitely no 'ROCKY', but it's still a classic (all the same); screw the critics. The movie is pretty dark, but at least it's not filled with sappy and overly clichéd melodrama; like a lot of critical darlings. It's emotional and inspiring, despite it's tragic moments, and Gyllenhaal gives one of the best performances of the year (yet again). Fuqua may not be one of the most talented directors around, but he knows how to deliver a film like this; and Sutter's script is brilliant. It's definitely not a perfect movie but it's still one not to be missed.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/2GU4GdpLvIk",9,3,6,29 July 2015
Ant-Man," Marvel Studios' films like this, could be even better; if they actually had some balls!
","'ANT-MAN': Four Stars (Out of Five)The twelfth film in the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' is this adaptation of the Marvel Comics' super hero character 'Ant-Man'; who was featured in 'The Avengers' comics, as well as a comic book of his own. Several scenes in this movie are setup for his future inclusion in 'THE AVENGERS' film series, as well as other sequels and Marvel movies. 'ANT-MAN' was directed by Peyton Reed (who's previously only directed sitcoms and comedy flicks, like 'BRING IT ON', 'THE BREAK-UP' and 'YES MAN') and it was written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd (Wright was originally set to direct the film as well). Rudd also stars in the movie, as Scott Lang; a highly skilled thief who takes over the role of Ant-Man, from Hank Pym (played by Michael Douglas). The film also stars Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Michael Peña and Bobby Cannavale. I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it's nearly as good as Marvel Studios' best. Douglas plays a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, named Hank Pym. Pym was a genius entomologist, and physicist, that created technology, in 1963, which enabled him to shrink in size, but grow in strength (immensely). In present day, he's retired; but he's looking for someone to take over as 'Ant-Man, and continue to use his groundbreaking work, for good. An ambitious former protégé of his, named David Cross (Stoll), has taken over Pym's company; and he wants to use the technology for bad (by militarizing it). Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne (Lilly), set out to stop Cross; who's also known as 'Yellowjacket' (when he's wearing his new shrinking suit). Pym thinks Scott Lang (Rudd), a former systems engineer and crook, is the perfect person to take over, as 'Ant- Man', and help them. The movie is fun and pretty entertaining, if you like comic book films, but it doesn't live up to the quality of other Marvel Studios' flicks; I think it's their weakest movie (it's even worse than 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD', in my opinion). The action scenes are kind of underwhelming and the whole film just feels like it was made on a much smaller scale (I can't believe it had a $130 million budget). The jokes aren't funny, and a lot of the dialogue is pretty cheesy; as well as the score music. I think the film probably would have been a lot better if Rudd and McKay hadn't rewritten Wright and Cornish's script; and if Wright had directed it. Reed seems like an OK director, but he's no Edgar Wright, and Rudd's comedy skills are definitely not their best here. Too bad Marvel Studios' is so afraid of innovative and original art; they make good movies, but they could be even better, if they actually had some balls!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaTQgKVh7fQ",8,0,6,20 July 2015
21 Jump Street," As witty as anyone could have hoped for from the Johnny Depp career launcher!
","'21 JUMP STREET': Four Stars (Out of Five) Jonah Hill co-wrote and co-stars in this Buddy Cop film reboot of the popular 80's TV series. Channing Tatum also co-stars and Michael Bacall (who also co-wrote 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD' and 'PROJECT X') co-wrote the screenplay. Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who also directed 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS') directed the film. The combination of Hill and Tatum is gold as far as buddy films go and the script is about as witty as anyone could have hoped for from the Johnny Depp career launcher! The original Fox Network TV series ran from 1987 to 1991 and starred Johnny Depp, Richard Grieco, Steven Williams, Holly Robinson, Peter and Michael De Luise and others as young undercover police officers busting crime in high schools and other youth hangouts. This film picks up over twenty years later with the operation being reinstated. It focuses on two rookie cops (Hill and Tatum), who knew each other in high school when Tatum's character bullied Hill's, that are now teamed together to stop a synthetic drug gang.Hill and Bacall's script is genius and the directing fits the material but it's Hill and Tatum that really make the movie work. A 'Buddy Film' is only as good as it's buddies and Hill and Tatum work magic together. The film doesn't have a lot to do with the original series but some of it's stars do show up in memorable cameos. As far as action goes the movie isn't really that thrilling either but the jokes are witty and the leading man chemistry is beautiful.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vhN3UBteY",8,0,1,5 May 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Worth the wait!
","'CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER': Five Stars (Out of Five)The fifth Marvel Studios film adaptation of one of their 'Avengers' comic characters (following two 'Iron Man' films, 'The Incredible Hulk' and 'Thor'), this time based on the original 'Avenger': Captain America. Joe Johnston (the filmmaker behind a variety of genre films including 'THE ROCKETEER', 'OCTOBER SKY', 'THE WOLFMAN' and 'JURASSIC PARK III') directed the film. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also co-wrote all three 'CHRONICLES OF NARNIA' film adaptations) wrote the screenplay. Chris Evans (who's co-starred in a series of other comic book and superhero films including 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD', 'PUSH' and 'THE LOSERS' as well as two 'FANTASTIC FOUR' films from Marvel) stars in the title role. Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Dominic Cooper and Sebastian Stan co-star.Captain America first appeared in comics in 1941 (published under Timely Comics) and was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. The series told the story of a weak wannabe war hero named Steve Rogers with a huge heart and enormous passion for doing good but lacking the physical prowess to match. He was selected for a secret military project which enhanced everything he was good at and gave him the physical capabilities to match his amazing good will. Like 'Superman', 'Captain America' was a great patriotic symbol but after World War II died off in popularity and disappeared in the 1950's. The character was later revived by Marvel Comics in the 60's as part of the Avengers team (it's leader) and it was explained that he had fallen into suspended animation since the end of the war. The film retells his origins story and sets up the Avengers film which is to be released next year.There have been several other film adaptations of the classic character in the 1940's, 70's and 90's but none have been very satisfactory to die-hard comic fans (until now). This is the first time a film studio has spent a significant amount of money on a project and actually invested the resources to do the material proper justice. It's quite surprising if you think about it that it took them so long (for such a beloved and classic iconic character) but it was worth the wait. I don't think any film adaptation until now could have turned out this good. The special effects are amazing (and it does look good in 3D). The movie's villain 'Red Skull' (Weaving) looks incredible, the action is spectacular and the scenes of Steve Rogers looking almost deathly ill are completely seamless and flawless. Johnston's directing is solid grade A filmmaking. Like his similar themed 'ROCKETEER' Johnston really shows a knack for classic nostalgic storytelling. The film is a technical marvel but besides that (like it's lead character) it has tremendous heart to match. It has been a while since such an admirable patriotic symbol has been portrayed in a major motion picture. American pride of course isn't quite as big as it used to be but the heart and nobility of someone wanting to do good (just for the sake of doing good) really resonates with the viewer in this film. Like 'Spider-Man' the classic tale of a wimpy outcast with a heart of gold becoming the super-hero is truly inspirational as well. The acting, cinematography and screenplay are all top-notch too but it's the movie's heart and message that are most impressive. It really is what good filmmaking and storytelling is all about. They don't get much better than this!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDGLg-PRJss",10,7,21,26 July 2011
American Hustle," It's really impressive how O. Russell has became such an 'actor's director'!
","'AMERICAN HUSTLE': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director David O. Russell's new comedy/crime drama film (set in the 1970s) about a con man, and his partner, who are forced to work with a crazy FBI agent as part of a sting operation. It stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence and Cooper recently starred in O. Russell's 2012 hit 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' (which is my all time favorite movie) and Bale and Adams co-starred in his film before that 'THE FIGHTER'. Bale and Lawrence won Oscars for their parts (Cooper and Adams were nominated). Lawrence, Cooper and Bale are likely to be up for Academy Awards again this year (Lawrence is a frontrunner and a win would be back-to-back Oscars for her). The film is also a major Academy Awards contender itself (as is David O. Russell) and has received almost universally positive reviews. I love the film and think it deserves every bit of the hype and praise it's been getting!Christian Bale put on 40 lbs to play the role of Irving Rosenfeld (based on real life conman Melvin Weinberg). Rosenfeld was an intelligent and successful con-artist in 1978 when he met Sydney Prosser (Adams), a stripper who was also very good at the art of 'hustling people'. The two teamed up and became lovers, despite the fact that Rosenfeld was married and had an adopted son named Danny (played by Danny and Sonny Corbo). Danny was the son of Irving's dimwitted wife Rosalyn (Lawrence). All went well for Irving and Sydney until they were caught in the act by an undercover FBI agent named Richard DiMaso (Cooper). DiMaso forced them to help him bust four bigger con-artists and Mayor Carmine Polito (Renner, who's character is based on Angelo Errichetti) got caught in their hustle as well. Adams' character Sydney Prosser is also based on Evelyn Knight, DiMaso is based on Anthony Amoroso, Jr. and Rosalyn is based on Cynthia Marie Weinberg.Lawrence (my favorite actress) is a scene stealer in the movie (once again) and she lights up the screen every time she comes on it, especially the first time she appears, when she really takes the film up a notch! What's surprising is that the film continues to stay at the same energetic level even when Lawrence is off screen (which is a large part of the movie, given her part is a smaller supporting role). For the first 20 minutes or so I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy the film that much but it really picked up in pace (and entertainment value) and I think that's largely due to O. Russell's flawless direction. While the movie is not quite as classic as 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' it is O. Russell's most impressive directing job to date (in a visual and stylistic way at least). The performances are all excellent as well, especially Lawrence and Cooper (who are once again the two craziest characters in the movie). Bale and Adams make great straight men (and women) though; Adams looks more beautiful and acts better than she ever has before and Bale really went all out gaining the weight he did to play this unattractive balding criminal. It's really impressive how O. Russell has became such an 'actor's director' (especially given the history he has with actors he's worked with in the past, like George Clooney and Lily Tomlin). His script is brilliant as well (based on a screenplay by Eric Warren Singer, which is in turn based on historical events involving the FBI ABSCAM operation of the 70s and early 80s). It's yet another amazing masterpiece from David O. Russell and one of the best films of the year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDElhat3XPM",10,14,25,27 December 2013
Rush," I could really relate to the passion and drive of both characters!
","'RUSH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Ron Howard's critically acclaimed sports drama about the 1976 Formula One season rivalry between drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Chris Hemsworth (of 'THOR' fame) and Daniel Bruhl star as the two champion drivers. Peter Morgan wrote the screenplay and he's well known for writing critically acclaimed award winning historical dramas, usually centering around the relationship between two people (like 'THE LAST KING OF Scotland', 'THE QUEEN' and another Ron Howard directed film 'FROST/NIXON'). This is another great example of the kind of storytelling Morgan is great at and Howard does an amazing job bringing it to life as well!The film traces Hunt (Hemsworth) and Lauda's (Bruhl) rivalry back to their first meeting at a 1970 Formula Three race in England. Hunt won that battle but Lauda then went on to 'buy his way in' to Formula One racing by taking out a loan and joining the Scuderia Ferrari team in 1975. Hunt's underdog team Hesketh Racing also entered the Formula One season that year but couldn't find sponsors and was forced to drop out after just that season (which Lauda won). Hunt then entered the 1976 competition as part of McLaren's team and (with a much better automobile to operate) became strong competition for Lauda that year. The film chronicles their obsessive rivalry and their lives off the track (Hunt being a wild 'lady's man' and Lauda being a calculated nerd). It also focuses on their relationships with two women (played by Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara).I knew little about the sport (at that time, or any really) and hadn't heard about Hunt or Lauda or their rivalry (prior to seeing the film) but I was still glued to the screen and totally involved. I could really relate to the passion and drive of both characters (I find myself ideally wanting to be more like Hunt but could understand both men). For me the movie was very moving in that way. Hemsworth has mostly just been known as an action movie star up to this point but this film finally gives him the chance to show off his acting abilities for a change (which are impressive). Bruhl is equally amazing in his role (probably more so) and totally becomes Niki Lauda. I can't say how accurate the film is but I do know the real Lauda loved it (Hunt passed away years ago) and said 'There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively'. I think Morgan's script really made the film work but also Howard's directing. Howard is well respected by critics and audiences alike but some cinephiles (that think they're smarter than everyone else) like to call him a hack; 'a director that just tries to make commercial friendly Oscar bait'. I disagree. I think sometimes his lesser films come off that way but he's definitely put a lot of heart and talent into making a lot of great films as well (and this is one of them). The cinematography (by Anthony Dod Mantle) is gorgeous and the score music (by Hans Zimmer) is beautiful and breathtakingly moving as well (some of the best I've heard in any film all year). It's a film not to be missed!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",9,1,1,17 October 2013
Nightcrawler," Quite possibly one of the best examinations of a sociopath ever put on screen!
","'NIGHTCRAWLER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Indie thriller about a quirky sociopath who aggressively pursues a career in freelance crime journalism; video recording it and selling it to the highest bidding news station (also referred to as nightcrawling). The film features Jake Gyllenhaal in an award worthy performance, as the lead character, and also stars Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton. It was written and directed by debut feature film director Dan Gilroy and has received nothing but rave reviews from movie critics. While I found it to be very sickening, and extremely disturbing, I also think it's one of the best films this year. Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom; a thief as the movie opens, who makes a living selling stolen material from Los Angeles construction sites. He's determined to make something more of himself though and is inspired, by two 'nightcrawlers' one night, to go after a career in freelance video journalism. He specializes in violent accidents and murders, which specifically take place in wealthy neighborhoods, because that's what news stations will pay the most money for. He develops two odd relationships; with a naive assistant he hires (Ahmed), that's desperate to make some cash, and a career driven news director (Russo), that's past her prime. Bloom seems to lose any reasoning of what's right or wrong (if he had any to begin with) as he becomes more and more obsessed with making a name for himself. The film is quite possibly one of the best examinations of a sociopath ever put on screen; I would definitely compare it to other classics like 'TAXI DRIVER' and more recent hits like 'GONE GIRL'. The way Gyllenhaal's character (Louis Bloom) is so brilliantly calculated and disturbingly driven, in accomplishing his lofty goals, he's very similar to a character in 'GONE GIRL'; the two movies are also a lot alike in how they present all the darkest parts of society, and humanity, without showing much of the light or hope. Gyllenhaal's character also (eerily) seems to be driven by the same morals, and ambitious drive for success, that FOX News is always trying to promote on their network. This guy lives by the same exact moral code, and lack of ethics, that the popular conservative news channel is consistently trying to prove is necessary in achieving happiness and success in one's life. Their network is probably made up of hundreds of Louis Blooms, and Russo's news director character, as employees. Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors and this is arguably his best performance; Gilroy's directing and screenplay are masterful too. It's a movie I'll never forget and while it made me sick to my stomach (for awhile) after viewing it (and I found it hard to adjust to any kind of a happy mentality, for a great deal of time afterwards too), it's still a great film and shouldn't be missed. A movie this ugly and disturbing deserves nothing but compliments; for being able to do those things this well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ON8Zn42-940",10,4,7,6 November 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Definitely more hit, than miss.
","'POP STAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING': Four Stars (Out of Five)A pop music spoof, starring Andy Samberg. Samberg plays a former boy band member, that will try anything to remain popular. The film was directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone (who also costar in the movie), and it was written by Samberg, Schaffer and Taccone (the three also worked together on'Saturday NIGHT LIVE'). The movie also costars Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Chris Redd and Imogen Poots. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it still bombed at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it. Conner4Real (Samberg) is a world-famous pop-rap recording artist. He used to be a member of the popular boy band The Style Boyz, and the group had a horrible falling-out. Most of Conner's fans really want the band to get back together though. When Conner's second solo album bombs, Conner becomes desperate to regain his popularity. He refuses to make amends with his old group though. The film plays out like a spoof of Justin Bieber documentaries (or similar movies). I've never seen any of those films, so I can't give a comparison, but I think this movie is hilarious (mostly). It's definitely more hit, than miss. Conner4Real is too unlikable a character though, so I didn't really want him to succeed. Even so, Samberg is great in the role; and the ending is pretty satisfying (to me). So I mostly liked the film, because it is really funny.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/BdhMQkH1n2k",8,1,4,19 September 2016
Oblivion," A great throwback to the sci-fi flicks of the 70s.
","'OBLIVION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new big budget, special effects laden, sci-fi/action film extravaganza starring Tom Cruise. This one was directed by Joseph Kosinski and it's his sophomore film effort (after the 2010 blockbuster sequel 'TRON: LEGACY'). Kosinski co-wrote the screenplay, with Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt (of 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE', 'TOY STORY 3', 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE' and 'STAR WARS: EPISODE VII' fame), and adapted it from his own unpublished graphic novel, of the same name. It's about a future where the world has been attacked by aliens and due to the destruction of the moon, as a result of the war, Earth's surviving human population moves to a space station called Tet and establishes a colony on Titan. Cruise plays a technician stationed on Earth in order to repair drones and protect machinery which is used to gather up the planet's remaining resources. The film is a great throwback to the sci-fi flicks of the 70s and it's visually striking enough, as well as emotionally intriguing, to make it worth while for any sci-fi nerd.Cruise plays Jack Harper, a technician/pilot finishing out the last couple weeks of his assignment on Earth; repairing droids to secure the use of other machinery there (used in gathering resources for the remaining human population). Once finished he can return home to live on Titan. His lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), is a communications officer stationed on the planet with him. The two report to their commanding officer on Tet, Sally (Melissa Leo), and also must worry about the remaining alien hostiles on the planet , called Scavengers (which the drones are used to wipe out). Jack and Victoria live in a tower miles above the ground and have no memory of the past (as their memory was erased in order to protect it from interrogation by the Scavengers). Despite the memory wipe Jack continues to have dreams of a woman from his past (Olga Kurylenko) and when a ship crashes on the planet with her on board (in a sleeping capsule) his whole life (and what he thought he knew) is forever changed. The movie of course has amazing visuals and is breathtaking to look at (any idiot can tell that from the previews though), what I enjoyed just as much as the special effects though was the story. It's involving and full of surprising twists and turns (although it does get a little too complicated towards the end, at least for me). It really does have that classic 70s/80s sci-fi feel to it and I'm sure most fans of the genre will eat it up. Kosinski proves once again that he's a master of these type of movies but the true highlight of the film is Tom Cruise and his performance. No matter what you think of him as a person he is one of the most talented movie stars working in Hollywood today. He always gives 110 percent and this film is no different; you can really feel his emotions and passion every step of the way. The character and his drama isn't quite worthy of such a performance though, and that's the one negative thing about it. The film does still work on all levels though; it's not a masterpiece but Cruise does masterful work in it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",9,3,5,26 April 2013
Baby Driver," One of Wright's best films (and the year's)!
","'BABY DRIVER': Five Stars (Out of Five) The new action-comedy from writer/director Edgar Wright. It stars Ansel Elgort as a young and extremely talented getaway driver, that's blackmailed into working for a team of professional bank robbers. The movie also stars Lily James, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Eiza Gonzalez, Jon Bernthal and Flea. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics so far (it's currently 98% positive on Rottentomatoes), and it's also received nearly unanimous positive reviews from viewers as well. I agree with everyone else, it's one of the year's very best films! Baby (Elgort) was in a horrible car accident as a child, which killed both his parents and gave him tinnitus for the rest of his life. He blocks the illness out by constantly listening to music now, which also makes him extremely skilled at things like driving. When a bank robber kingpin, named Doc (Spacey), caught Baby stealing from him (when he was younger), he blackmailed him into being his most skilled getaway driver (on every heist). After Baby pays Doc back though, everything he owed him, he wants out of his life of crime now. He's also met a young woman (James) he really likes, who also likes him a lot as well. Doc won't let his best, and most reliable, driver leave him that easily though.The movie is extremely well written; it's full of great character development and witty dialogue. It's actually reminiscent of a Tarantino movie in that way, but with Wright's uniquely talented touch too obviously. The characters are all well cast as well, and the action scenes are breathless. There's multiple fully exhilarating car chases in it, and there's also an awesome foot chase scene too (that's inspired by one of Wright's favorite films, 'POINT BREAK'). The soundtrack is also equally cool, and it's always fittingly placed (in a stunningly beautiful way). The movie is a classic waiting to happen, in every way, and it's also one of Wright's best films (and the year's)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/mxz-nUpMk6Y",10,22,44,29 June 2017
Justice League," Bored out of my mind at times!
","'JUSTICE LEAGUE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe, based on the DC comics superhero team, which unites Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg, for the first time on the big screen together (in an attempt for DC to imitate the success of Marvel Cinemas' 'THE AVENGERS'). DC even brought in Joss Whedon (the filmmaker behind the first two 'AVENGERS' movies) to co-write the screenplay, and direct $20 million worth of reshoots. Zack Snyder (who also helmed 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE', 'MAN OF STEEL', and co-wrote 'WONDER WOMAN') directed and co-wrote the film as well, with Whedon and Chris Terrio (who also co-wrote 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'). The cast features Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot and Henry Cavill reprising their roles as Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman (from previous movies). Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher also costars as Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg (which they previously performed cameos as, in previous films). Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielson and Joe Morton also reprise roles from other movies too; while J.K. Simmons and Ciaran Hinds join the cast. The story deals with the superhero team forming, after the death of Superman, to battle a new supervillain named Steppenwolf, and his army of Parademons. The film has gotten mostly positive reviews from fans so far, and some critics even like it too. I was severely disappointed with the movie, and honestly found it to be mostly a bore (sadly). The story takes place months after the death of Superman (Cavill), and the events of 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN', when an alien army of creatures called Parademons are invading Earth. They're lead by a military officer from Apocalypse, called Steppenwolf (Hinds). Steppenwolf is on a mission to find the three powerful 'Mother Boxes', that are all hidden on Earth. Bruce Wayne (Affleck) teams with Diana Prince (Gadot) to stop the invasion. The super duo seeks out three other gifted superheroes to help them; Aquaman (Momoa), The Flash (Miller) and Cyborg (Fisher). Together they form the superhero team called 'Justice League', for the first time.The movie is really slow-paced at first (and for most of the film actually), and I was bored out of my mind at times. There's a lot of ineffective character development, in my mind, that doesn't really help develop the characters much. The action scenes are all uninvolving, and dull, in my opinion as well. This is coming from a fan who absolutely loved 'WONDER WOMAN' and 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' ('SUICIDE SQUAD' and 'MAN OF STEEL' too, to a lesser degree), and I have been a bigger fan of the DC Extended Universe lately even (over the MCU). I have to admit this film just doesn't work for me though. That's not to say it's bad, or overly cheesy at all (that's why I'm still giving it 4 out of 5 stars). It just really let me down. I had really high hopes though, and I still do for future DC movies (especially 'WONDER WOMAN' films). Gadot is awesome in this still, even though she's not given enough to do, and she's the scene stealer (like always) definitely. I think she deserves top billing even.",8,2,6,17 November 2017
Man of Steel," An entertaining blockbuster but definitely not without it's flaws.
","'MAN OF STEEL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The much anticipated reboot to the popular superhero film series based on the iconic DC comic character. This installment stars Henry Cavill in the title role and Amy Adams as his love interest Lois Lane. The movie goes back over Superman's origins as he was sent to Earth by his parents and his coming to terms with his destiny as a savior of mankind here. The film also stars Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne. It was directed by Zack Snyder, produced by Christopher Nolan and written by Nolan and David S. Goyer. The movie is action packed and visually spectacular but it's also lacking in the emotional depth department. An entertaining blockbuster but definitely not without it's flaws.The film begins with war breaking out on the planet Krypton as Jor-El (Russel Crowe) and his wife Lora Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) send their newborn son, Kal-El, away to safety on Earth (shortly before the planet explodes). Traitors General Zod (Shannon), Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) and their followers are also imprisoned and sent away, shortly before Krypton's destruction as well. The movie flashes forward to Kal-El (Cavill) as a young man (in his 30s) traveling from town to town working at various jobs while dealing with his past (through flashbacks) and future destiny as a hero of this planet. The safety of all of mankind is threatened when General Zod locates him on Earth and starts a war here in an attempt to make Earth their new home.The film is full of breathtaking visuals and highlighted with a beautiful score by Hans Zimmer. Scene by scene I found it to be a very satisfying and fun movie (almost everything you could ask for in a Superman film) but looking at it as a whole film it just doesn't quite seem like a complete movie. Lois Lane is never fully developed and her relationship with Kal-El/Clark Kent is never completely flushed out. The supporting actors are all decent in the film and Cavill is the perfect Superman (despite his lacking in acting abilities). The filmmakers did away with the nerdy glasses wearing Clark Kent alter ego in this film (seeing as that was one of the most ridiculous parts of the character's mythology; the idea that people don't recognize him because he puts on glasses and acts like a bumbling dork). A lot of the magic and awe are gone from this film adaptation as well as it centers a lot more on the action (there's almost too much action as it does become a little boring at times). David S. Goyer's script is probably the weakest part of the film as Snyder's directing is once again amazing to watch. While I don't think it's as good as the original 'SUPERMAN' film or the Bryan Singer sequel 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' I still did enjoy it quite a bit despite it's flaws. It's not a perfect film but it is a satisfying action blockbuster all the same.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOSZyJXrwyw",9,0,3,19 June 2013
The Revenant," Could have been truly great, with 15 to 30 minutes more cut out of it.
","'THE REVENANT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This year's Oscar hopeful, from last year's Academy Award winning director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; is this action/western epic (inspired by the life of American frontiersman Hugh Glass). It's set in the 1820's, and tells the tale of Glass's obsession for revenge; against the man who killed his son. The movie was directed by Iñárritu, and co-written by Iñárritu and Mark L. Smith; based loosely on the 2002 novel, of the same name, by Michael Punke. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy; and it costars Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter and Forrest Goodluck. The film was originally budgeted at $60 million; but costs ballooned to $135 million, by the end of filming (due to excessive filming hardships). It's received mostly rave reviews from critics, and it's also expected to be nominated for several major Academy Awards; with DiCaprio a favorite to (finally) win Best Actor. Despite the painfully slow pacing (at times), I really enjoyed it.The story is set in 1823, and it follows a hunting party; searching for pelts, in the Louisiana Purchase wilderness. The most experienced hunter, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), is mauled by a mother grizzly bear; protecting her cubs. Glass's party tries to keep him alive, and take him with them; but he becomes too much of a burden, to their survival. Captain Andrew Henry (Gleeson) offers three men extra pay; to stay behind with Glass, until he passes (to give him a proper burial). Glass's son Hawk, a half-blooded Native American, volunteers; as do John Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Jim Bridger (Poulter). The opportunistic Fitzgerald attempts to kill Glass, by smothering him, and instead kills Hawk, to silence him; when the boy tries to rescue his father (unbeknownst to Bridger). Glass, who's then left for dead by the two others, miraculously survives his deadly wounds. He then makes it his mission, to get revenge on Fitzgerald; for the death of his son.The movie looks breathtaking, and the story always seems very epic. The action scenes are spectacular, and also very realistic looking. DiCaprio is amazing in the film; and he definitely deserves an Oscar (like he has for years now). Tom Hardy (my favorite actor) is also very good, in his despicable antagonistic role. Iñárritu is a very gifted director; but (like any really talented artist) when he's given complete reign of a project (like this), he lets his ego get a little too inflated. He's said to be a very hard filmmaker to work with, but he definitely gets results (this film does seem self indulgent though). The pacing is way too slow; with 15 to 30 minutes more cut out of it, it could have been a true masterpiece. It's still a great film though, and it's definitely worth seeing; for it's stunning visuals, entertaining action sequences, and amazing performances.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j9uf6E4pnlw",9,1,3,8 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Despite what you may think of Eastwood as a person (with his recent political debacle) he's still a charismatic screen presence!
","'TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE': Three Stars (Out of Five) Clint Eastwood returns to acting (after saying he was retiring with 2008's 'GRAN TORINO', but almost no one ever really retires in Hollywood) and appears in the first film he hasn't directed since 1993's 'IN THE LINE OF FIRE'. It is directed by his buddy though, Robert Lorenz, who served as an assistant director on most of Eastwood's films since 'IN THE LINE OF FIRE'. It's Lorenz's first time as lead director and it's also the writer's first feature as well (Randy Brown). The film is about an elderly baseball scout who might be forced in to retirement if his daughter can't help him out. Amy Adams plays his daughter and the film also co-stars John Goodman, Matthew Lillard, Robert Patrick and Justin Timberlake. The movie is a little cheesy and predictable at times but it does work as an emotional drama at times as well thanks largely to the lead performances.Eastwood stars as Gus Lobel, a once great baseball scout who's credibility is now being questioned after failing to keep up with modern changes to the game. He also has vision problems that he keeps a secret until his daughter Mickey (Adams) calls his doctor and finds out about them. Gus is given one last chance to scout a potential recruit in North Carolina and one of his boss's (and buddy), Pete (Goodman), asks Mickey to go with him on the trip to keep an eye on him. A former recruit of Gus's named Johnny (Timberlake) is also in North Carolina scouting for another team. He develops a romantic interest in Mickey who uses the time with her father to better understand past neglect from him.The movie is pretty predictable for most of it's duration and there's definitely nothing new or unique here. It's clichéd and some of the jokes seem a little forced but as a drama it does work when it needs to. Eastwood is as classic and likable as he's ever been, despite what you may think of him as a person (with his recent political debacle), he's still a very likable and charismatic screen presence and he hasn't lost any of his movie star qualities with age. Adams really brings her A game to deliver the emotional punch the film needs and Lorenz's directing is adequate. It's a shame they couldn't get a better actor than Timberlake to round out the cast but Eastwood and Adams as the film's two leads don't disappoint.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q",6,2,6,1 October 2012
Bridge of Spies," I teared up, on multiple occasions!
","'BRIDGE OF SPIES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's new Cold War drama film; about an American lawyer trying to arrange a prisoner swap, with the Soviet Union. The story is based on the 1960 U-2 incident; it was written by Matt Charman, and the Coen Brothers (marking the second film in a row, that was co-written but not directed by the brothers; following last year's 'UNBROKEN'). The movie stars Tom Hanks (in his 4th collaboration with Spielberg), and it costars Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Scott Shepherd, Jesse Plemons and Alan Alda. The film has received rave reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it's considered a likely Oscar contender, at next year's Academy Awards. I really enjoyed it.The film begins in 1957 Brooklyn, New York; where Rudolf Abel (Rylance) is arrested by FBI agents, and charged with conspiracy. An insurance lawyer, named James B. Donovan (Hanks), is hired as his defense. Donovan takes the job very seriously, despite a corrupt court system, and hatred from a biased public. Abel is convicted of all charges, but Donovan is able to convince the judge (Dakin Matthews) to spare his life; on the chance that Abel might prove valuable, as a bargaining tool with the USSR in the future. His predictions come true, when an American U-2 spy plane pilot (Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union.The movie is extremely predictable, even if you're not familiar with the history behind it, but it's still very well made. Hanks gives another outstanding performance; and Rylance is very impressive as well, in his supporting role. The film is beautifully shot, edited and scored; it's classic Steven Spielberg (doing what he does best). I was especially moved by the movie, and teared up on multiple occasions.

Shyamalan wrote and directed the movie (on a budget of just $10 million) and it stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy (who also co-starred in 'THE WITCH' and 'MORGAN'), Betty Buckley, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been a huge hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it as well.Three teenage girls are kidnapped, in broad daylight, while leaving a birthday party. Their captor is a man named Kevin (McAvoy), who also has 23 different personalities. Kevin locks the girls in a room, beneath a zoo, and continues to terrorize them; while demonstrating several different personalities. At the same time a psychologist, named Dr. Karen Fletcher (Buckley), tries to help Kevin. The doctor learns that Kevin is more than just a danger to himself, while the girls desperately try to escape him.Shyamalan used to be one of my favorite directors. I haven't been too impressed with his recent films, like many others, but this is definitely a well made movie. McAvoy is great in the lead, and I'm sure he had a lot of fun with the role. The film is both suspenseful and involving. There's also a great twist at the end, especially for fans of Shyamalan, and I can't wait to see what the filmmaker does next. It's not quite as good as his classic earlier work, but it is definitely an effectively well made thriller.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY",8,6,19,9 February 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Still not a 'HARRY POTTER' fan but I can always admire a well made movie!
","'HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1': Four Stars (Out of Five) I'm not a big 'HARRY POTTER' fan, I've never read any of the books and although I've seen all the movies I've never been that involved in any of them. Although I'm a huge fan of creative and imaginative sci-fi and fantasy the world of 'Harry Potter' has never been that fascinating or interesting to me. With that said I do admire and respect the films for being able to capture the essence of the books (I'm told) and so effectively deliver what the fans want to see. Despite a rough start with the first two films (the poorest received by fans and critics alike) the films have gotten better and more mature, for the most part, with each installment (despite a mild setback with 2007's 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX', the next worst received of the series). It is only fitting that as the characters mature the movies do as well and this installment is by far the darkest and most mature yet; I'd imagine it's far too frightening for most young children.The film is once again directed by David Yates, who has directed the last three films as well as the upcoming final chapter. The only other director in the series to direct more than one installment was Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films (and many thought butchered the job). It's once again written by Steve Kloves (adapted from J.K. Rowling's book of course) who's written every single film adaptation in the series except for 'ORDER OF THE PHOENIX', which was written by Michael Goldenberg (and is where the series faltered of course). Daniel Radcliffe (who is now 21), Emma Watson (20) and Rupert Grint (22) all reprise their roles of Harry, Hermione and Ron. The film is adapted from the first half of the seventh and last book of the series.The film continues the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione's continuing journey to thwart the plans of the evil Lord Voldemort (once again played by Ralph Fiennes) and save the 'Wizarding World'. Voldermort now has control of the 'Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts' and as the movie opens the 'Order of the Phoenix' meets to move Harry from Pivet Drive to the Burrow by flying him there to avoid the Ministry's detection. They also use a special potion in order to create Harry lookalikes to confuse any 'Death Eaters' that might attack mid-flight. After surviving an immediate attack they make it to the burrow with some casualties. Once there they begin preparing for a wedding during which they are again attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Ron and Hermione escape to central London to continue the late Dumbledore's mission of finding the Horcruxes and destroying them in order to defeat Voldermort. The problem is that once they find one they have no idea how to destroy it. Things get dismal and convoluted and the story stretches on (and it's only half over).I found my mind drifting, losing interest and becoming confused on what was going on several times during the movie (as I do with all the films) but I was always visually captivated with what was being depicted in front of me. The cinematography, by Eduardo Serra, is breathtaking and Yate's directing has only gotten better and more interesting with each film. The way he handles the subtlest of character driven scenes is fascinating, as well as his adept ability to orchestrate a complex action scene. The score by Alexandre Desplat is involving but minimally used to great effect. Although I had a hard time focusing at times and felt the story dragged on too long I did admire how well executed it is and could tell if I was a fan of the material I would have been captivated. The filmmaker's obviously treat their fans very seriously and don't talk down to them at all. I like how much more mature the films have gotten with time and truly feel that they're no longer kids' films. I'm still not a big fan of the series but I can always admire a well made movie and this (like most before it) is one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEG4WJ28XNA",8,0,1,23 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Chan and Van Damme together in a film at last!
","'KUNG FU PANDA 2': Three Stars (Out of Five) Jackie Chan and Jean-Claude Van Damme together in a film at last, even if it is just as voices (hopefully they'll do an 'EXPENDABLES' film together next)! The rest of the all-star voice cast, from the original, returns with Chan as well including Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, James Hong and Jack Black as Po (the 'Kung Fu Panda'). New voices (besides Van Damme) include Michelle Yeoh, Gary Oldman, Danny McBride and Dennis Haysbert. This time the film is directed by Jennifer Yuh, an Art and Animation Department vet but first time film director. It was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (who also co-wrote the first film). The movie is not quite as much fun as the original (which wasn't a great film to begin with) but it does deliver the laughs and action fans expect.The first film dealt with Po living out his dream by joining his kung fu heroes, 'The Furious Five', and becoming the chosen 'Dragon Warrior'. In this chapter he struggles with coming to terms with who he really is and where he came from (now knowing that he's adopted). While battling his inner demons he also must lead 'The Furious Five' to face a new enemy with a weapon that destroys kung fu. Of course he won't be able to conquer this new found enemy and deliver peace to his people until he finds peace within himself. To do this he must discover the secrets of his past.The movie is just about what you'd expect from a sequel. If you're a fan of the original you'll probably enjoy this chapter as well, just not quite as much. Black and the rest of the cast are funny, a lot of the jokes are of course silly and geared at kids but the film has a decent amount of laughs to deliver a slightly older crowd as well (like the first). The action scenes are entertaining although I heard from my two young nephews (who I saw the film with) that the movie is too scary at times and much more frightening than the original (I personally didn't notice). Guillermo del Toro was an executive producer and creative consultant on the film this time around and some say he added a darker tone to it. As I said I didn't really notice much of a difference in that way from the original but I'm sure that could be a slight possibility. The movie is fun regardless and should please most fans of the original.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr4LOQxrmg",6,1,4,7 June 2011
Hugo," As far as pure eye candy goes the movie is definitely a cinematic joy!
","'HUGO': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Martin Scorsese tries his hand at 3D and kids' films with this 1930s adventure. It's an adaptation of the 2007 book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick about an orphan living in the walls of a Paris train station trying to solve a mysterious secret left to him by his deceased father. The screenplay was written by John Logan and the film stars Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer and Jude Law. The movie should captivate most children and the visuals are amazing but it's a little too slow paced and emotionally uninvolving to hold the attention of most moviegoers I'd say.Butterfield makes an impressive leading man as Hugo Cabret, an orphan who's father (Law, who we see only in flashbacks) left him a notebook and a nonfunctioning automation with a lock with no key. Hugo now lives in the walls of a Paris train station (in the 30s) fixing clocks and gets by through petty theft. One day he's busted trying to steal from the owner of a toy shop, Georges Melies (Kingsley), who in turn steals his notebook from him (along with all his stolen possessions). He befriends the toy shop owner's granddaughter, Isabelle (Moretz), in an attempt to win back his notebook and the two begin an adventure to solve his father's secret. While doing so they also must avoid the station inspector (Cohen) who loves snatching up orphans and sending them away to orphanages.Scorsese once again masters all the technical aspects of the film (especially the visuals and the 3D is amazing) but the characters and story left me wanting more. The acting is all outstanding but I found the film just a little too emotionally distant and couldn't really relate to any of the characters that much. The heart of the film is in the right place though and Scorsese perfectly captures the look and feel of a classic 1930s kids' film. Like I said I'm sure young children will be more than fascinated by the movie but older teens, as well as adults, will probably be a little bored. It is slow paced but there's always something wonderful to look at; as far as pure eye candy goes the movie is definitely a cinematic joy!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A",7,2,4,7 December 2011
Warrior," Mixed martial arts gets the 'ROCKY' treatment and what a film results from it!
","'WARRIOR': Five Stars (Out of Five) Mixed martial arts gets the 'ROCKY' treatment and what a film results from it! Although this film centers on two 'Rocky' type protagonists whom are both brothers. As a result of that added dynamic the movie is as much about family drama as it is about fighting and overcoming inner demons. Being that the story is about two brothers on parallel journeys, while both fighting their way through an intense fighting competition, sets it apart from the other fighter/sports films and really makes it a truly emotionally rewarding and unique film going experience. The fact that there is no traditional antagonist, other than the other brother, makes it a powerhouse film going experience as well. It leaves you with a K.O. blow, in terms of movie magic and you really wont know what quite hit you (until you've had time to think about it). The film stars Joel Edgerton (a popular Australian actor who's known for such critically acclaimed films as 'ANIMAL KINGDOM' and 'THE SQUARE' as well as playing Owen Lars in the last two 'STAR WARS' films) and Tom Hardy (an English actor best known for playing Eames in 'INCEPTION' as well as being cast as Bane in Christopher Nolan's next 'BATMAN' film) as the brothers, Brendan and Tommy Conlon. Brendan is an ex MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighter who now works as a high school physics teacher. Due to his daughter having heart difficulties he's now in a heap load of debt and unable to support his family despite the fact that his loving wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) also works. Brendan's secretly gone back to fighting, in strip club parking lots mainly, against Tess's wishes and when he's busted by the school he works for for it he's forced into returning to the sport more seriously, including entering a big MMA championship with a huge 'winner take all' cash prize. Little does he know his brother Tommy (an ex-Marine and high school wrestling champion) has returned home to Pittsburgh and taken up the sport as well. He's also enlisted the help of their alcoholic father Paddy (Nick Nolte), whom both had broken contact with, to coach him (as he did in high school). Tommy has a strong dark side and is definitely battling some depression and heart wrenching past memories. The two brothers haven't spoken in decades and Tommy still holds a grudge against his brother for, what he sees, as abandoning him and his mother all those years earlier. The two fight their way through the championship on a parallel course into an obvious collision. The film was directed and co-written (along with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) by Gavin O'Connor (the man behind such films as 'TUMBLEWEEDS', 'PRIDE AND GLORY' and another heartfelt sports drama 'MIRACLE', oddly none of which I've seen!). The script is richly written with strong thought out character development and realistically honest emotional drama. The issues of alcoholism, an abusive father and brotherly love turned to bitter dispute are all very real and common issues and there's not a tad bit of contrivedness here in my opinion. The directing when dealing with these issues is subtle and poignant and the fight scenes are so emotionally heartfelt as a result of it (as well as some of the most spectacularly awesome I've seen in a film). The acting to top it off is astonishing as well. Edgerton, Hardy and Nolte are all exceptional in the film and all three give what could be their best performances. Nolte is so lovable and sad and knowing his monstrous past leaves the viewer somewhat emotionally confused and feeling deeply sorry for the whole situation and everyone involved. Hardy is more of a dark and troubled antihero; we relate to his struggles but the monster he constantly unleashes leaves the viewer split on how to feel about him as well (it makes for some pretty cool fight scenes though). Edgerton is the more traditional underdog hero movies like this are known for, there's nothing too deep or original to his character but he still carries the whole heart of the film on his shoulders and he does an amazing job at it. All the parts are as great as the whole and the film is an epic masterpiece in my opinion. It does live in the same league as 'ROCKY' and all the truly great cinematic sports/fighting films and should be long remembered and revisited as an inspirational classic.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pEuD61SPG4",10,4,12,11 September 2011
Salt," It all really comes down to the Angelina Jolie show!
","'SALT': Four Stars (Out of Five) Angelina Jolie, arguably Hollywood's hottest actress, returns to action form in this spy thriller directed by Phillip Noyce (director of such top notch action and suspense films as 'PATRIOT GAMES', 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' and 'DEAD CALM'). This, sort of female version of a 'Jason Bourne' film, tells the tale of CIA 'super' agent named Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who's accused of being a Russian spy, with a mission to assassinate the Russian President, by a Russian defector (played by Daniel Olbrychski). Knowing that the love of her life, her husband (played by August Diehl), is at risk Salt evades capture and goes on the run. She uses all of her expertise and experience to try and save her husband, clear her name and stop the assassination. The film is full of twists as we learn more and more about the assassination plot and the mystery of Salt's true identity.A lot has been publicized about how this film was originally written for a male lead and Tom Cruise was attached but he later turned down the role in order to do 'KNIGHT AND DAY', which many consider a big mistake considering 'SALT' is a much bigger financial hit than 'KNIGHT AND DAY'. Then it was rewritten for a female lead and Jolie was hired. I still think Cruise made the right choice; this is a better film than 'KNIGHT AND DAY' but that role was just more fitting for Cruise and a smarter choice for him at this stage in his career, regardless of how much money it makes. 'Salt' is a much more fitting role for Jolie. I'd much rather see a female lead in a serious 'balls to the wall' action film like this; it's more intriguing and a lot more fun. With that said who better than Jolie to play the role. She's an awesome action heroine, one of the best, and she definitely doesn't disappoint here. With this and 'WANTED' she has certainly established herself as the world's biggest female action star.On top of Jolie's performance there's a really suspenseful and action packed script. It does get completely far fetched towards the end but the action is so hard, gritty and somewhat realistic, compared to a lot of CGI summer blockbusters like this, that it doesn't matter. The directing is perfectly fitting to the material and once again there's Jolie. The supporting cast is all adequate, including Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but it all really comes down to the Angelina Jolie show. She's never been sexier, at age 35, and she really knows how to put on an 'ass kicking show'. That's why she gets paid the big bucks. She's a Hollywood icon and this movie is a great example of why.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c",8,3,7,14 October 2010
We're the Millers," Genius road trip comedy film!
","'WE'RE THE MILLERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Genius road trip comedy film about a pot dealer who hires a stripper, a neighbor kid and a homeless girl to pose as his family in order to smuggle drugs from Mexico into the U.S.. Jason Sudeikis stars as the drug dealer and Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter (of 'SON OF RAMBOW' fame) and Emma Roberts co-star as his fake family. The film was directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also directed the 2004 hit comedy film 'DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY') and written by Steve Faber, Bob Fisher, Sean Anders and John Morris. Faber and Fisher co-wrote the 2005 hit comedy film 'WEDDING CRASHERS' together and Anders and Morris co-wrote such hilarious comedy flicks as 'SEX DRIVE', 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' and 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE' (they're two of my favorite comedy writers). The film is just a grade A production all around and it's hilarious! Sudeikis plays a pot dealer named David Clark who's been selling weed since he was a kid (and now does it for a living). He works for a rich drug lord named Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) and when he's robbed (by three thugs) he loses a bunch of Gurdlinger's drugs and money as well as his own cash savings. Gurdlinger threatens to kill him for it unless he agrees to transfer a small amount of marijuana over the border for him (from Mexico into the U.S.). Clark reluctantly agrees and comes up with the idea of hiring people to pose as his family so he's not overly questioned (or searched) by authorities. He hires a down on her luck stripper named Rose (Aniston), who lives in his apartment building, to pose as his wife, a local homeless girl named Casey (Roberts) to pose as his teenage daughter and an 18-year-old boy named Kenny, who also lives in his building, to pretend to be his son (Kenny is also mostly to blame for David being robbed). Things go as planned at first but then they run into many complications and end up having ruthless drug dealers chasing them.The movie really surprised me! Watching the trailer and commercials for the film I thought it had a clever premise but didn't think it looked all that funny. Often the best comedy films don't sell that well though (but obviously this one did because it's making a killing at the Box Office. It just didn't sell that well to me, but I still went and saw it I guess). Thurber does a great job directing the film but I think it's the script that's even more impressive. It's just packed with great comedy setups and even better payoffs and all four of those writers are pros (especially Anders and Morris). The cast is probably what really makes the film work though. Sudeikis is quickly becoming one of my favorite comedic actors and he's great in this. Aniston does a lot of bad films but for such a popular actress she also does a surprising amount of good ones as well, especially clever and smart comedy films (and she's great in this too). Roberts is cute and effective here and Poulter really shines (he's a scene stealer). The movie is just an all around grade A production (like I said) and one of the funniest comedy films this year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUymXeqlea0",9,2,9,12 August 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," The best movie about mental illness I've ever seen! Jennifer Lawrence has never been hotter!
","'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK': Five Stars (Out of Five)This critical darling and Oscar hopeful just picked up eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing and nominations in all four acting categories (which is the first time this feat has been accomplished since 1981's 'RED')! Being a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence (she's my favorite actress and top celebrity crush), as well as the writer/director David O. Russell, I had been very eager to see this film since it went into limited release in mid-November (and even before that after watching the amazing trailers) but it still hasn't come to any cities near me and I had to drive 40 miles to the closest one playing it just to finally see it. I know the studio has been waiting to fully release it so it could build bigger business off of word of mouth and Oscar nominations but the buzz is already here! So I finally saw it in Salem, OR and it was totally worth it. It lived up to my expectations in every way and is my favorite film of 2012! In the film Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper plays a former teacher, named Pat Solitano, who suffered a mental breakdown after catching his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) cheating on him with a fellow teacher. He spent eight months in a mental institution as part of a plea bargain for beating the man nearly to death. While there he learned that he's bipolar and has been suffering from the disease all of his life. His father, Pat Sr. (Oscar nominee Robert De. Niro), has suffered from violent mental breakdowns and OCD his whole life as well, he's also a sports nut who believes in superstitions that will help his team, The Eagles, win their games. Pat's mom, Dolores (Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver), takes Pat out of the institution when his committed time is done and brings him home to live with her and his father. Pat learns that Nikki left him, sold their house and filed a restraining order against him (out of physical fear) but he's so obsessed with getting her back that he begins stalking her (which is played off as kind of harmless in the film due to Cooper's good looks I think; looks prejudice once again). Then he meets a girl named Tiffany (Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who's never been hotter or more stunning) who's just as down on her luck (her husband recently died) and is almost as crazy as he is. She, like Pat, just lost her job as well due to a recent sex obsession and the fact that she slept with all her co-workers. The two immediately take a liking to each other but Pat fears what this may mean to him and his love for Nikki. Tiffany has been wanting to compete in a dance competition and needs a partner so they both use each other (in a way) as Tiffany agrees to get a message to Nikki for Pat. Things only get more complicated from there. Chris Tucker also co-stars as Pat's buddy from the psychiatric ward. It's his first film appearance since 2007's 'RUSH HOUR 3' and his first non 'RUSH HOUR' film since 1997's 'JACKIE BROWN' (which also co-starred Robert De Niro)! His part is minimal but funny. The movie is a brilliant character study and the best movie about mental illness I've ever seen! I've had multiple family members suffer from depression and I've experienced it a little myself, as well as other mental issues, so the film was really relatable to me. I also love movies about outsiders and unique individuals who are brave enough to be themselves. Both Pat and Tiffany are brutally honest and not afraid to say what they really feel and like the Pat character says in the movie 'maybe they see things that other people don't'. I was just blown away by the characters and totally involved in what happened to them. All of the performances were outstanding; of course my favorite being Jennifer Lawrence but deservingly so. She's totally beautiful and sexy and maybe too much of a guy's ideal woman in this movie but she's also very confident and self dependent (like almost every character she plays). Her character also has the perfect touch of vulnerability, insecurity and mental instability that really make you feel for her as well. A lot of the biggest A list actresses in Hollywood wanted this role (most notably Angelina Jolie) but Lawrence nabbed it. Partially because she's so popular right now, probably the biggest star in Hollywood (like Julia Roberts in her prime after 'PRETTY WOMAN', and the same age, but about five times as talented) but also because she was the only actress that could play this part that well. Jacki Weaver is amazing too; she says very little but at the same time says so much with just her emotions and facial expressions. You can't not love a mom like the one she plays in this movie. Robet De Niro gives one of his best performances in years and is so complex and interesting that I would have loved to have seen a movie just about his character alone. Bradley Cooper gives by far the best performance of his career (as well as one of the best performances of the year) and is the perfect match for Jennifer Lawrence. Despite their more than fifteen years age difference the two have beautiful chemistry together and that's the driving force behind the whole movie. Of course the film would be nothing without David O. Russell's amazing directing and brilliant script. The man is a genius filmmaker and the movie deserves all the award recognition it's been getting. I'm so passionate about film and the characters depicted in them that when one really moves me it's almost like a religious experience. This is one of those films!Watch our show at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA",10,4,8,12 January 2013
Divergent," The guys cast here are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast!
","'DIVERGENT': Five Stars (Out of Five)Big budget adaptation of the popular youth book about a future world where society is divided into different factions based on people's beliefs and ethics. The hero of the story is a young woman who doesn't fit into any category, so she's labeled a 'divergent', which makes her a threat to government and the accepted conformist way of life. It stars Shailene Woodley as the divergent heroine and co-stars Theo James, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn and Maggie Q. It was directed by Neil Burger and written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor (based on the book by Veronica Roth). I enjoyed it quite a bit and found it to be one of the better youth book film adaptations ever made.The story is set sometime in the future, after a war which divides the remaining civilization into five different factions (that are supposed to represent a person's skills and virtues). There's amity (which are the people who are the most peaceful), abnegation (made up of the selfless), candor (the most honest), erudite (the most intelligent) and dauntless (the world's most brave and fearless). There comes a time when teenagers must make a choice to either stay in the faction they were raised in or pick another. First they take a test which tells them which faction they belong in. Beatrice Prior, who later goes by Tris (Woodley), fails the test and is known by what society calls 'divergent' (due to the fact that she doesn't belong in any faction). Divergent people are seen as a threat to society, since they don't conform, and are killed because of it. Tris joins dauntless and must survive a rigorous testing process, in order to be accepted there, while also keeping her divergent status a secret. At the same time she learns there's a plot by one faction to overthrow another.I really like the setup to this sci-fi tale; it's interesting, complex and very entertaining at the same time. Burger (who won't return for the two planned sequels) and the screenwriters did a great job of bringing this world to life on screen. It's intense and very emotional at times. One of my favorite parts of the film is the performances; I think Woodley is an amazing talent to watch out for and is very impressive as the lead here. Usually the male actors suck in these youth book adaptation flicks but the guys cast in this are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast. I thought James looked horrible in the previews but he's not bad in his role at all. I also think Jai Courtney is always interesting to watch and it's funny to see Miles Teller as Woodley's bitter rival (after last seeing those two as lovers in 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which was one of the best movies of last year). Winslet, Judd, Q and especially Woodley are all of course outstanding in the female roles and I thought the whole film was just really well put together. I especially liked the main message of the movie; that it's good to be different and an independent thinker (even if you're seen as a threat to the conformist way of life) because being unique is definitely something to look up to. It's great that 'THE HUNGER GAMES' has raised the bar so high for movies like this because now we get much better quality films because of it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w",10,16,57,24 March 2014
Ender's Game," I'm pretty sure the point of the movie was that resorting to violence is wrong.
","'ENDER'S GAME': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Harrison Ford returns to sci-fi for this adaptation of the popular 1985 novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card. It stars 16-year-old Asa Butterfield (of 'HUGO' fame) as a genius military student recruited to save mankind from an alien army. Gavin Hood (who also directed movies like 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE' and 'RENDITION') wrote and directed the film. It co-stars Hailee Steinfeld (of 2010's 'TRUE GRIT' fame), Abigail Breslin, Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley. It's not nearly as good as a lot of the hype it's been getting but it is a decent sci-fi youth book adaption film and it's nice to see Ford in this type of role again.The film is set in the distant future after Earth is invaded by an alien race called formics. A young pilot saved the human race by apparently sacrificing himself and stopping their deadly attack. Now mankind depends on their youth to prevent future attacks, and stop the formics, by training young teens to be violent and brilliant soldiers. Ender Wiggin (Butterfield) is one such hopeful savior and has become Earth's last hope. He's recruited and trained by Colonel Graff (Ford), who sees great potential in him.The film is supposed to launch a new series (following the multiple books) but has been negatively criticized for it's justification of violence and it's author's bigoted views (that he's recently made public). A boycott of the film has been promoted by those offended by Card's hateful vocal viewpoints and other's associated with the film (like Ford) have distanced themselves from the author. The guy seems like an ass but, like with all art, you can't judge a person's work by their personality or personal actions. Mel Gibson still makes good films and gives likable performances despite his disrespectful behavior (so do filmmakers like Roman Polanski). I don't know how good the book is but I enjoyed the movie. In some ways it seems to justify violence but it also seems to take a strong anti-war standpoint (by the film's end). I don't know if the book does this as well but I'm pretty sure the point of the movie was that resorting to violence (without looking for other, better, solutions) is wrong. Ford and Butterfield are great in the film and the visuals are spectacular. It's a little slow and uninvolving at times but not a bad sci-fi flick by any means.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",7,0,1,5 November 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A hell of a lot of fun if you're looking for action and good bloody gore!
","'HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another 'hip' modern take on a classic fairy tale 'with a twist'; this one has a grown up Hansel and Gretel as bounty hunters hunting down and exterminating witches around the world. It stars Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner in the two lead roles and was written and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Tommy Wirkola. Wirkola also helmed the cult classic 2009 Norwegian Nazi zombie flick 'DEAD SNOW'. This is his big budget American film debut. It's just a hell of a lot of fun if you're looking for action and good bloody gore. Also is you grew up on these dark and twisted Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and don't mind a little creative liberty taken with them, the movie's a blast as well! As kids Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Arterton) we're abandoned by their father in the woods and kidnapped by a witch living inside a gingerbread house (they went exploring to). Planning to eat the two the witch makes Hansel stuff himself with candy while she forces Gretel to tend to an oven (which she plans to cook them in). The two kids get the better of the witch though and force her into the oven, killing her. They then grow up dedicating themselves to hunting down and killing witches. They have a special gift for this calling due to the fact that they're now immune to the spells and curses of witches (Hansel is a diabetic though, due to the fact he was forced to eat so much candy). As adult bounty hunters they're hired by the Mayor (Rainer Bock) of a town called Augsburg to rescue several children abducted by witches there. They learn that a powerful witch, by the name of Muriel (Famke Janssen), stole the children in order to sacrifice them for the ritual of Blood Moon. It's up to Hansel and Gretel to stop Muriel and her army of witches and rescue the children.As you might have expected the movie is full of dark humor and plays out a little like a spoof but not entirely. The film is actually full of graphic gratuitous gore and is surprisingly action packed. When Hansel and Gretel are kicking witch ass the movie is at it's most fun. The film's sense of humor never gets in the way of it being a very well executed, slick and cool action film and the gore and creature elements of the film will please any die-hard horror fan. The movie did get mostly poor reviews from critics and disappointed at the American box-office (barely making it's budget back) but it made a huge profit overseas and got awesome reviews from horror critics and fans (as well as action lovers). The film has some CGI but also uses classic old school monster movie effects. Derek Mears (of 'Jason Voorhees' and 'Predator' fame, in the latest franchise installments) makes a cool appearance as a troll named Edward, Arterton is gorgeous and makes a cool kick-ass action heroine and Wirkola's directing is extremely stylized and viscerally cool. The movie is just a lot of fun (like I said) and sure to please most die-hard genre fans.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVxCgCFIf8",9,0,2,9 May 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher's remake about the same as the Swedish original.
","'THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)David Fincher's English-language adaptation of the popular Swedish novel 'Men Who Hate Women' by Stieg Larsson, the first in the 'Millennium' series trilogy (which were first adapted in to films in Sweden in 2009). Fincher's remake stars Rooney Mara in the lead role of Lisbeth Salander, A.K.A. 'the girl with the dragon tattoo' (which is a performance she's received an Academy Award nomination for), and Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist. The screenplay was written by Steven Zaillian.The story in this first chapter revolves around journalist Mikael Blomkvist taking on a missing person's case in which he's asked to travel to a remote island and solve the disappearance of his employer's niece, who went missing over 40 years earlier. Blomkvist just had his reputation tarnished by a corrupt businessman and is looking to clear his name, which his new employer, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), promises he can help him do (if he works on his niece's case). Mikael believes the disappearance of Vanger's niece has to do with a series of serial killings and enlists the help of a computer hacker (Lisbeth Salander, who was hired by Vanger to research him) to help him catch the maniac.I'd rate the movie about equal with it's Swedish counterpart. Once again I loved elements of the movie and really wanted to love the entire film but found it just a little too long and dragged out. Fincher's directing, editing and entire visual style is once again superb, Mara is outstanding and the score (by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) is mesmerizing but the pacing is just a little too slow (at least at times). Probably due to the filmmakers once again staying just a little too faithful to their source material. Lisbeth Salander is an all time classic 5 star action heroine role though and I look forward to seeing more of her in future American adaptations.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe8CEO75Pj0",9,2,8,1 February 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I can't wait for 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE VI'!
","'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fifth installment in the popular 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE' action franchise; which is a continuation of the classic 60s and 70s TV show (of the same name). Tom Cruise once again reprises the starring role of Ethan Hunt, head of the 'Impossible Missions Force'. In this adventure the team must take on a rogue criminal organization, called the Syndicate. The film was directed by Cruise's buddy, Christopher McQuarrie; who also directed Cruise in 'JACK REACHER', and co-wrote the screenplays for 'EDGE OF TOMORROW' and 'VALKYRIE' (which also starred Cruise). Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames all reprise roles from other chapters; and they're joined, this time around, by Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin. It's an excellent addition to the series. The movie opens with a spectacular action scene, involving Ethan Hunt (Cruise), and his team, stopping the sale of nerve gas to terrorists. Hunt next attempts to expose the existence of a rogue terrorist organization, called the Syndicate. He's limited in resources though, when the CIA shuts his team down; and orders Hunt captured and brought in. Hunt goes on the run, while continuing to hunt down the Syndicate; with a little help from his friends.This is an action series that never lets up, or falters; it's as good now as it was when it began, in 1996. One of the keys to it's continuous success, is the fact that they bring in a new director, with a different perspective, for every installment. Brain De Palma's original film is a classic action movie masterpiece; the series went in a completely different direction when Hong Kong action master John Woo took over, in 2000. Ever since, a new (up- and-coming) filmmaker has made the series seem fresh and continuously captivating (J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird and now McQuarrie). People love to compare it to the James Bond franchise, and I think it's even better (it's much more consistent). Cruise continuously proves himself to be one of the best action film stars ever, and he has a lot of great help; from Pegg and the stunningly gorgeous Rebecca Ferguson (as well as the rest). The movie, like it's predecessors, is awesome; I can't wait for 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE VI'!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaTQgKVh7fQ",9,0,1,5 August 2015
The Intouchables," The type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman.
","'THE INTOUCHABLES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A French comedy-drama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time. It's also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 Academy Award nomination (due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win). The film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little over-hyped. It's a good movie but it is clichéd and somewhat simple and unoriginal. It's been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. It does seem like the type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman (because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman).The film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.The film was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. It is nicely directed and looks beautiful. It also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. It's just that the film isn't that funny or that emotionally moving. The performances are fine, it has some good laughs and it's a good well intentioned story but it's nothing we haven't seen before and far from anything spectacular. It's enormous success does puzzle me a little but I'd much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like 'TWILIGHT'. So it's definitely a decent crowd-pleasing film, just not a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA",7,6,12,17 January 2013
Bad Teacher," 'BAD TEACHER' is an OK movie.
","'BAD TEACHER': Three Stars (Out of Five) Cameron Diaz stars in this raunchy dark satire, continuing the popular trend of female powered vulgar R rated comedies. She plays an uninspired and useless Chicago junior high teacher who treats her students like annoying stepping stones to her dream life. The movie is obviously a jab at tenure but is mostly just a light hearted dark comedy rather than any kind of political commentary. Jake Kasdan directed the film and Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg wrote it. It's not the best example of it's genre but it could have been a lot worse, definitely not a bad way to spend your time.Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher with no passion for teaching who drinks a lot, gets stoned a lot and swears a lot (in front of her students). She's always planned on marrying rich and leaving the working life behind and as the movie opens she's all set to do that. Then her fiancé's mother catches on to her scheming ways and talks her son in to calling off the wedding. Halsey despairingly returns to work and sets her eyes on a new rich sub (Justin Timberlake) but realizes in order to impress him she's going to need a boob job. So she plots one despicable scam after another ripping her school off of money in order to pay for the expensive operation. She faces competition from a fellow teacher (brilliantly portrayed by Lucy Punch) and also has to deal with the unwanted affection of the gym teacher (Jason Segel).The movie is most importantly funny, it might not have any huge laughs but the jokes for the most part work. Thanks in large part to a nearly flawless cast. Punch is the scene stealer but Diaz holds her own, Segel is convincingly cool and witty and Timberlake is adequate (at least he's been sticking to roles he can pull off lately). There's also nice supporting turns from John Michael Higgins and Phyllis Smith (from TV's 'THE OFFICE'). Kasdan's directing is fitting to the material and I can see why the screenplay attracted the cast it did. It's got heart here and there but the lead character is definitely too unlikeable to ever really care about and what she gets away with in the film is kind of sickening. It is a dark comedy but it would have been nice to have someone to root for (besides Segel, who's part is way too small).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A",6,0,2,4 August 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, I'd go as far as to say it's amazing!
","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, this reboot to Sam Raimi's blockbuster trilogy doesn't disappoint and I'd go as far as to say it's amazing! Director Marc Webb (who made his debut with 2009's critically acclaimed hit '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER') takes over the franchise with Andrew Garfield (of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' fame) replacing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man. The film was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who also co-wrote 'SPIDER-MAN 2' and '3') and Steve Kloves (who wrote every 'HARRY POTTER' film). This film focuses entirely on Peter's high school years while he learns to first develop his powers as well as cope with the disappearance of his parents and who his father really was (unlike the original Sam Raimi film). It's also a little more faithful to the comic, in some ways, by having Parker develop artificial web-shooters that he uses to swing around on, rather than being able to produce them physically as part of his super powers. It also goes back to having Gwen Stacy (his original love interest from the comics) as the object of his affection rather than Mary Jane (like the Raimi films). Gwen is played beautifully by 'it girl' Emma Stone (the object of Jim Carrey's obsession). The movie, despite treading on some old ground, is thoroughly entertaining and powerfully well made. This story begins with Peter as a young boy (Max Charles) being left in the care of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) by his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz), who disappear without ever being heard from again. Peter grows up to be a somewhat awkward teen (Garfield, who's way too old to play a teen) but is much cooler than Parker probably should be; he rides a skateboard and actually flirts (successfully) with his high school crush Gwen Stacy (Stone). One day he finds his father's old briefcase which leads him to seek out his father's old associate, a scientist by the name of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Gwen actually works at Oscorp with Connors, which is where Parker stumbles into a lab experimenting on genetically modified spiders and is bit by one. He of course develops spider like powers and when his Uncle is killed makes it his mission to fight crime and get revenge. In this film he must deal with Dr. Connors' alter ego, the genetically mutated monster 'The Lizard' (which is the first time the classic Spider-Man villain has graced the silver screen), as well as the police, lead by Gwen's father Captain Stacy (Denis Leary).The movie does go over a lot of the same plot points as the original Sam Raimi hit but it delves a little more deeper in to them. I thought the first two 'SPIDER-MAN' films had a great amount of emotional drama and character development (which is why they're two of my favorite films) but this installment manages to outdo them. It really gets in to the character of Peter Parker, on a relatable level to almost every high school nerd (present or past) and Garfield plays him amazingly. I thought Maguire was about as good a Spider-Man as they could have casted but somehow Garfield manages to outdo him, mostly with passion for the role (he says he cried the first time he put on the costume). Stone is a little cuter and more adorable than Kirsten Dunst, I wouldn't say she's a better actress but it's definitely easier to fall for her character than Mary Jane's (due to Stone's likability). Sheen and Field are classic like always and Ifans makes a memorable insane villain. The acting is definitely a little better in this film but the script is also smarter and more complex and Webb's direction is impressively fitting. I wouldn't say he's as good a director as Sam Raimi but it's nice to see a different take on the series. Besides all the material that's already been done there's definitely enough new stuff to make the film interesting and thrilling. I'd say it's a better reboot film than 'BATMAN BEGINS' even, it's no 'THE DARK KNIGHT' but it is better than Nolan's original Batman film. If you're a fan of the series or the character (and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero) you're sure to be thrilled.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcS7Q-CkYE",10,25,36,6 July 2012
The Lego Movie," Will be beloved for many years to come, by many generations (just like the toys)!
","'THE LEGO MOVIE': Five Stars (Out of Five)Blockbuster film adaptation of the popular construction toys, which began in Denmark in 1949. Lego is the third-largest toy maker in the world and in recent years has grown immensely in popularity (closing in on Hasbro for the #2 global ranking). The company has expanded it's market into video games, books, theme parks, kids' clothes, cartoon shows and straight-to-DVD animated movies and now it's conquered the theatrical film business as well with this 3D computer animated comedy/adventure flick. The movie has been number one for three weeks in a row (at the US box office) making $185,829,929 in North America and $278,329,929 worldwide! I found it to be very entertaining and my two young nephews (I saw it with) loved it as well. The story revolves around Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), an average construction worker Lego minifigure who's mistakenly prophesied to be the 'chosen one'; who will save the Lego universe from an evil businessman called Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Emmet has always been an outsider and has never been accepted by his acquaintances or co-workers. He finally feels important for the first time in his Lego life and goes on a journey to save the Lego world. Emmet receives help from a rebel fighter named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) and others. The voice cast also includes Liam Neeson, Will Forte, Charlie Day, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie and many other popular stars.It was directed and co-written (with Dan and Kevin Hageman) by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Lord and Miller also performed the same duties on the popular animated hit 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS' and directed the film adaptation of the popular 80's TV show '21 JUMP STREET' as well (and it's upcoming sequel). The Hagemans also co-wrote 36 episodes of the Cartoon Network's animated TV series 'LEGO NINJAGO: MASTERS OF SPINJITZU' (which is based on the Lego toys of the same name). The filmmakers chosen were obviously the right guys for the job and the cast couldn't be more perfectly fitting either. The result is an animated movie masterpiece; I absolutely loved it and I can't usually get into animated films that much! It's hilarious, visually amusing and surprisingly emotional as well (especially in the end; when I actually got a little teary eyed). There is a twist that really takes the film up a notch and makes it more meaningful (and special) for kids and adults as well. I realized, by the end, that it's a lot like another telling of 'TOY STORY' and I think it's just as well made and classic too. I'm sure 'THE LEGO MOVIE' will be beloved for many years to come, by many generations (just like the toys)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4",10,0,2,28 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," I really enjoyed the film because it's about rebellion and fighting the system and powers that be.
","'DALLAS BUYERS CLUB': Five Stars (Out of Five)Another likely Oscar contender is this biographical drama film starring Matthew McConaughey as an electrician/rodeo bull rider, named Ron Woodroof, who contracted AIDS (in Dallas in 1985) and started a business supplying many other victims of the deadly disease with the (unapproved) medication they needed. The film co-stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Garner, Steve Zahn and Denis O'Hare and was directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. It was written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and is based on a 1992 article, published in 'The Dallas Morning News', by Bill Minutaglio. McConaughey and Leto are almost guaranteed to get Oscar nominations (for 'best lead' and 'supporting' actor) and they deserve to. The film is a bit more of a long shot for 'best picture' but it's possible and would deserve that prestigious recognition as well. The film begins in Dallas in 1985 when Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is told by doctors, while seeing them about a work injury, that he is HIV+ and only has 30 days left to live. Ron originally doesn't believe them because he, like many at the time, believed only homosexuals contracted the HIV virus. He's also extremely homophobic and outraged at the diagnosis (which he sees as an insult). After he learns more about HIV (and AIDS) he begins taking AZT (which he obtains illegally) but it only worsens his condition. He then travels to Mexico and meets Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne) who gives him the information and alternative medication (which is unapproved in the US) he needs to prolong his life and stay somewhat healthy. Woodroof then starts a business in the US supplying the medicine and vitamins to others, with the help of another AIDS patient he meets in the hospital (Leto). The FDA goes to war with him over this. I really enjoyed the film because it's about rebellion and fighting the system and powers that be. In this case the system is the big business of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies, who are always purposefully keeping helpful medication from people in need in order to improve their profits. I also like movies with unlikeable characters that grow and learn throughout their journeys and become better people that not only end up helping themselves but many others as well. That's what Woodroof did; he started out only interested in money but ended up really wanting to help others. McConaughey is great in the film (in one of his best performances) and so is Leto. Garner is surprisingly good as well. The writing and directing is topnotch and it's just a very moving and inspiring film. One of the year's best for sure!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",10,12,19,27 November 2013
Goon," Inspirational and extremely violent hockey movie!
","'GOON': Four Stars (Out of Five) An inspirational and extremely violent hockey movie about a dim-witted outcast that finally finds his place in the world as a 'goon' for a semi-pro hockey team. The film was based on the book 'Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey' by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith. It's a biography based on Smith's successful career as a minor-league hockey 'enforcer' from 1988 to 1998. Sean William Scott stars as the character based on Smith in the film (Doug Glatt) and it was directed by Michael Dowse (who's previous directing credits include the headbangers comedy 'FUBAR' and the 80's themed comedy 'TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT'). It was adapted for the screen by Jay Baruchel (who also co-stars in the film) and Evan Goldberg (who usually works with buddy Seth Rogen on such screenplays as 'SUPERBAD', 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS', 'THE GREEN HORNET' and 'THE WATCH' but this time teamed with their mutual friend Goldberg instead). The movie is funny but more importantly it's a great inside look at the professional world of hockey! As the film opens Doug Glatt (Scott) is a bouncer who's not happy with life and feels extremely undervalued by his family, especially his father who's a successful doctor (Eugene Levy). He idolizes legendary hockey goon Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) and spends most of his time hanging out with his hockey obsessed best friend, Pat (Baruchel), who hosts a commentary show on the sport. One day while the two are at a game a player climbs in to the stands attacking them (after being provoked by Pat) and calls them a homosexual slur. This upsets Doug, who has a gay brother, and he beats the crap out of him. His actions really impress the coach of his hometown hockey team (Nicholas Campbell) and he's asked to join the team as an enforcer. His success there leads to an invitation to join the Halifax Highlanders in Canada where he finally finds purpose and unity with his fellow teammates. He also attracts the attention of a girl (Alison Pill) for the first time and instantly falls for her.Supposedly Doug Smith has been quoted as saying he's very happy with the film and it has been praised by hockey enthusiasts as an authentic look at the game, in all it's bloody glory. Baruchel and Goldberg's script is both witty and inspiring and Dowse's directing is sentimentally fitting. The film has a nice 80's feel to it (just like Dowse's 'TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT', which was a pretty good film as well). All of the actors are more than adequate in their roles; Schreiber is especially memorable and Scott is about as likable as he's ever been. Some may see the tale as sort of a 'FORREST GUMP' style glorification of idiots but I think it's extremely touching and heartfelt. It's inspirational as well as extremely humorous and a grade A crowd pleaser all around.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ld28EwmjL8",8,2,3,31 August 2012
Now You See Me," Inspiring to see Eisenberg pull off yet another successful film!
","'NOW YOU SEE ME': Four Stars (Out of Five) Heist film about a team of four magicians who rob banks while performing shows and then disperse their loot to their audiences. The film reunites stars Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson (who also co-starred in the popular zombie comedy film 'ZOMBIELAND') as well as teams them with an all-star cast including Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Melanie Laurent, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. It was directed by Louis Leterrier (who also helmed such action films as 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', the first two 'TRANSPORTER' movies and the 'CLASH OF THE TIANS' remake) and written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt. The film is a very fun, fast-paced and clever caper film that I had a blast watching (for the most part).The film centers around four magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Franco). As the film opens they're all called to the same location by mysterious cards left for them. The film then fast forwards to a year later when the four are working together as a team putting on an elaborate magic show where they apparently rob a guest of all his money (seemingly in a bank they transport him to at another location). An FBI agent, named Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), and an Interpol agent, named Alma Dray (Laurent), are then teamed together and assigned to the magician case as the illusionists get ready to pull off another big heist.The film is packed with clever magic tricks and witty lines. It's extremely humorous at times and the elaborate schemes are very involving. It's a little far-fetched and perhaps overly complicated but it's still extremely entertaining. I was blown away by the smart script, stylized directing and exhilarating pace. It's also highlighted by a great cast. Eisenberg is one of my favorite actors and seeing the normally really insecure nerd playing a cocky and overly confident ladies' man is kind of interesting for a change. Pairing him with the always fantastic Harrelson is cool once again as well. The rest of the cast are all adequate in their parts too. The movie does get a little bogged down at times, which is a little startling due to it's normal fast pace but those scenes are few and far between. For the most part it's a very well made and entertaining film. It's inspiring to see Eisenberg pull off yet another successful film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ucjLaVv_8",8,13,29,5 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Easily the best movie in the series since Singer last directed!
","'X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST': Five Stars (Out of Five)The seventh 'X-MEN' movie is once again directed by Bryan Singer (returning to the franchise for the first time since 2003's 'X-MEN 2') and written by Simon Kinberg (who also co-wrote 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND') with Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Vaughn and Goldman also co-wrote 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS', which Vaughn also directed). It's based on a 2 issue storyline from the Marvel Comics comic book 'The Uncanny X-Men', called 'Days of Future Past' (written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, in 1981), which has the X-Men using Kitty Pride's abilities, to time travel a person's mind back in time, in order to stop a dystopian future where mutants are hunted down and killed by Sentinels (giant robots). Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Ellen Page, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, Daniel Cudmore, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart all reprise their roles from previous movies. Anna Paquin also returns as Rogue but most of her scenes were cut from the final theatrical film. Peter Dinklage, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Bingbing Fan, Booboo Stewart and Adan Canto all join the cast this time around as well. I found it to be highly entertaining and everything I hoped it would be; easily the best movie in the series since Singer last directed. The story begins in 2023; a dark dystopian future where mutants are being killed off by shape-shifting machines called Sentinels. A small group of X-Men have been able to survive by using Kitty Pryde's (Page) power to transport another mutant's mind, Bishop (Sy), back in time (to warn them about future Sentinel attacks). Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart), now working with Magneto (McKellen), comes up with the idea of time-traveling back to a crucial event, in 1973, in order to prevent the current nightmarish world (they live in) from ever happening. Wolverine (Jackman) is the only one who can survive several decades of time-travel (due to his healing powers), so it becomes his mission to find the young Xavier (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) and get them to stop Mystique (Lawrence) from assassinating a man named Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). Trask designed the Sentinels and became a martyr, in the war on mutants, when he was killed. Mystique was also captured and her DNA was used to give the Sentinels the abilities they now have (to replicate any mutant's powers). Stopping these events should then change the future and it's up to Wolverine, Charles, Magneto and Beast (Hoult) to pull it off. I read 'The Uncanny X-Men' comics when I was a kid (and all of it's spin-offs, like 'X-Force', 'Cable' and 'X-Factor') for multiple years (and read several years of back issues too, including 'Days of Future Past'). So I'm a big fan; next to Spider-Man they're my favorites superheroes. The X-Men stories have always had very cool sci-fi elements, and plenty of action, but they've also had deeper themes about dealing with bigotry and being an outsider (like Spider-Man). This is why I could always really identify with the characters and the stories. I love Singer's first two movie adaptations ('X-MEN 2' is one of my all-time favorite films) because they do such a great job of bringing the characters, and those issues, to the big screen. This movie is equally as impressive; it has all the spectacle and action (that all of the films in the franchise are known for) but it also does a really good job of capturing those human elements (and emotions). It's probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series and it's great to see almost all of the cast back for it. I especially enjoy watching Jennifer Lawrence, in the role of Mystique, because she makes a great badass action heroine and it's cool to see her playing a kick-ass villain this time as well. Jackman, Fassbender, McAvoy and all the rest are of course good once again too but it's Singer (back at the helm) that truly gives the movie it's masterpiece status.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-G3-O3wYgs",10,1,3,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did!
","'CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in Marvel Studios' 'CAPTAIN America' film franchise. The sequel also features many other superhero characters from the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' (especially the 'AVENGERS' films), and the story deals with Captain America taking on Iron Man; in order to protect his friend Bucky Barnes. The movie stars Chris Evans (reprising the title role) and it costars Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man), Sebastian Stan (as Bucky, AKA The Winter Soldier), Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Chadwick Boseman, Daniel Bruhl, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Emily Van Camp, William Hurt, Paul Rudd, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Marisa Tomei and Martin Freeman. The film also introduces the classic comic book characters Spider-Man and Black Panther (Holland and Boseman), in their Marvel Cinematic Universe feature film debuts. Anthony and Joe Russo returned to direct the movie (they also helmed 'CAPTAIN America: WINTER SOLDIER') and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely returned to write the script (they also wrote 'WINTER SOLDIER' and co-wrote 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD'). It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's (of course) a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well.Due to the large number of civilian deaths, as a result of The Avengers' battles with various super-villains (over the years), the United Nations wants to form an international governing body, to control the superheroes' actions. Captain America (Evans) is against it, since he thinks they have better judgment than corrupt government officials, whereas Iron Man (Downey Jr.) supports the supervision (due to guilt over creating Ultron, and other tragedies he's responsible for). Other Avengers divide in the conflict, forming two different factions. At the same time Bucky Barnes (Stan) is framed for a bombing in Vienna (which kills a Wakanda King). Captain America wants to protect his friend, while government officials want to kill him. A civil war between the superheroes erupts. This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did (one of my other favorite movies this year); it's very dark, dramatic and full of rich character development (all things 'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON' got wrong). The plot is involving and the action actually serves the story; rather than vice versa! The action scenes are also really cleverly done, and exciting; something increasingly hard to pull off, in modern blockbusters. Downey Jr. actually gives a really good performance again (and he doesn't deliver any horrible jokes, for a change). It's also interesting to see his character as the antagonist; I know he was more of a villain in the comic book, but I think it was smarter for the filmmakers to make the drama (in the film) more nuanced. The movie's politics are also timely and complex. It's just a grade A film all around; I think it's my second favorite Marvel Studios film (after 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY'). It's one flaw is that they got Spider- Man wrong though; they made some major changes to the source material, that any fan should be mad about. I think his character is the worst of the three movie adaptations (and he deserves his own freaking movie to debut in, he's not second banana to 'THE AVENGERS')! Overall the film is fantastic though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw",10,11,24,9 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," I think I even enjoyed the film more than most of the 'HARRY POTTER' movies!
","'FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A prequel to the 'HARRY POTTER' film franchise, set 65-years before the first film (in 1926 New York City). It tells the tale of an introverted wizard activist, named Newt Scamander, that travels to New York, from England, while writing a textbook (for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) titled 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. The movie was directed by David Yates (who also helmed the last four 'HARRY POTTER' films), and it was written by debut screenwriter J.K. Rowling (adapted from her 2001 book). It's the first installment in a planned series of five movies. It stars Eddie Redmayne (as Newt), Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Carmen Ejogo and Jon Voight. The film has been a big hit at the Box Office, and it's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I enjoyed it.Newt Scamander (Redmayne) is a British wizard, and fantastical animal rights activist, that's traveling form England (in 1926) to Arizona. He stops in New York City, and while he's listening to a 'No-Maj woman (Morton), speak about the dangers of wizards and witches, a 'Niffler' escapes from his magical suitcase; which also houses several other magical creatures in it. While he's trying to catch the Niffler, Newt meets a baker, named Jacob Kawalski (Fogler), and a witch, named Porpentina (Waterston). The witch arrests Newt, for the havoc his critter causes (and for being an unregistered wizard); and while she's taking him to America's Magical Congress headquarters, the two learn of much greater dangers, that are facing the city (and the world), of the fantastic kind. The film is filled with dazzling visuals, wonderful characters (and critters) and magical charm. Redmayne is great in the lead, and his character is extremely likable (and possibly autistic). I think he's a very positive hero, for children of all ages because of this; and so is the beautiful Porpentina (who has just as strong of a heroic role). I really like how the film deals with animal rights too (even if they're of the fictitious kind). I think I even enjoyed the film more than most of the 'HARRY POTTER' movies (if not all of them).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GAMlEeVv1H0",9,1,4,2 December 2016
The Conjuring 2," Not quite as memorable as the original movie.
","'THE CONJURING 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2013 blockbuster supernatural 'fright flick', once again directed by James Wan (who also helmed the original 'SAW', 'INSIDIOUS' 1 & 2 and 'FURIOUS 7'). It was written by Carey and Chad Hayes (who also wrote the original film), as well as Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprise the leading roles, as paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. This time they're investigating an aggressive poltergeist, that's haunting a London family (in 1977). The script is once again (said to be) based on a true story. The film also costars Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Franka Potente and Simon McBurney. It's received good reviews from critics (once again), and it's also another hit at the Box Office (the first movie made over $300 million, on a $20 million budget). I found it to be a more than decent follow-up.The movie begins with Ed and Lorraine Warren (Wilson and Farmiga) investigating the Amityville murders (in 1974), to see if a demonic presence was really responsible for the horrendous slayings. While experiencing a vision of the crimes, Lorraine foresees Ed's murder (by a tragic impaling). The story then flashes forward 3 years, to London; where a single mother (O'Connor), and her four children, are being terrorized by a supernatural presence. Ed and Lorraine are called to investigate the haunting, but Lorraine is extremely concerned about Ed's safety.The movie is once again outstandingly crafted, by Wan. It's got great atmosphere, it's disturbingly creepy, and the 'jump scares' are really well done. The story is (once again) intriguing, scary and filled with good character development. It's a little slow-paced, at first, but the film makes up for it in the second half. There's not really much to complain about, but (still) I didn't find it quite as memorable as the original movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",9,1,4,15 June 2016
Jackie," I've missed seeing Natalie Portman like this in recent years!
","'JACKIE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed biopic starring Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy, arguably America's most beloved First Lady ever. The film depicts her life, following the assassination of her husband, John F. Kennedy, in 1963. It was directed by Pablo Larrain (a Chilean director, with little former knowledge on the movie's subject) and it was written by Noah Oppenheim (who also scripted the YA fantasy flicks 'ALLEGIANT' and 'THE MAZE RUNNER'). It was co-produced by Darren Aronofsky, who was originally set to direct the film (and he also courted his replacement). The movie costars Peter Sarsgaard, Billy Crudup, Greta Gerwig, John Carroll Lynch and John Hurt (in one of his final film roles, before his death). It's one of the best reviewed movies of 2016, and it's been nominated for three Oscars (including Best Actress, for Natalie Portman). I found it to be extremely slow-paced, but at the same time it's also very involving and effective. The film begins shortly after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy (Caspar Phillipson); which is depicted in flashbacks. Jacqueline 'Jackie' Kennedy (Portman) is being interviewed by a journalist (Crudup) about it. Throughout the movie we see two sides of the First Lady; a more elegant and feminine persona, she presented to the public, as well as her more witty and dominant side, that she only showed people in private. We also see how strong she was, in dealing with such a historical tragedy. The movie is only about 100 minutes long, but it feels like it's a lot longer. It definitely takes it's time developing it's characters, primarily Jackie Kennedy, but in that time I think we really feel like we get to know her. Portman is absolutely amazing in the title role, and I've missed seeing her like this in recent years. She's still one of the greatest actresses in film today, and I think this movie definitely shows why. The film is worth seeing just for her, but it's also an important, and very valuable, history lesson.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ZNHDah5M",8,1,2,17 February 2017
No Strings Attached," No substance attached!
","'NO STRINGS ATTACHED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Recent Oscar winner Natalie Portman stars in this raunchy rom-com about a couple of friends who decide to have a casual sexual relationship with 'no strings attached' in hopes it doesn't ruin their friendship. It co-stars the horribly miscast Ashton Kutcher in the male lead role and a handful of other minor celebrities in minor roles (like Kevin Kline and Cary Elwes). It's written by Elizabeth Meriwether and Michael Samonek and directed by Ivan Reitman (of 'GHOST BUSTERS', 'STRIPES', 'MEATBALLS' and 'TWINS' fame). The material is obviously beneath Reitman and it's odd that he would be interested in directing a film like this (although he is getting old). What's more unsettling is that Natalie Portman was interested in doing a film like this. Sure it's a hit at the box office and I'm sure she got a big paycheck but she usually sticks to more artistic fare or at least films with more substance than mediocre crap like this.Portman plays a hospital resident named Emma who is afraid of commitment or any type of real reltaionship. Kutcher plays an aspiring film writer named Adam who's working as an assistant on a popular teen musical TV show. Adam's most recent girlfriend dumped him and started dating his father (Kline). Emma and Adam met as children and kept running into each other randomly throughout the course of their lives, every several years. One morning they decide to sleep together and Emma immediately enforces the rules that if they keep doing it, that's all it will ever be. As this goes on Adam keeps wanting more and things get complicated.Portman's Emma character is pretty abusive to Kutcher's Adam and I think if the sex of the characters had been reversed this movie would not have gone over so well and have been seen as sexist. It's a new day and age though and the movie is primarily written by a woman from a woman's point of view. Even so the movie is mostly fluff and for the most part pretty poorly written. Reitman's directing does little to improve anything as well and is pretty uninspired. Kutcher is horrible as usual and brings the movie down even further. He should stick to supporting comedic roles because he's proved time and time again that he has no leading man acting chops. The chemistry between he and Portman is pretty bad as well and almost nonexistent. I keep wondering how the film might have turned out if they had cast a Jake Gyllenhaal or Shia LaBeouf. The material isn't good enough to warrant their involvement though and it's certainly beneath Portman. She's found her new status as Hollywood's most popular leading lady but just because she's holding a position once held by Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock it doesn't mean she has to act like them. She's much better than that. She does do a decent acting job in the film none the less and looks breathtakingly beautiful (more so than possibly ever before). So if you're as big a fan of Natalie Portman as I am it's worth seeing just for that. Mostly a waste though.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw",5,2,5,10 March 2011
Inside Out," It's not a blatant rip-off!
","'INSIDE OUT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Pixar and Disney's new computer-animated fantasy film, about a young girl that's guided through the struggles of moving, and the frequent absence of her father, by her emotions; which are personified, with individual personalities of their own. The movie was directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen and it was written by Docter, Carmen, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley (Docter has co-written and directed other popular Pixar flicks, like 'UP' and 'MONSERS, INC.'; as well as co- wrote 'WALL-E' and 'TOY STORY' 1 & 2). It features the voice talents of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. The concept for the film has been done many times before (most notably on the 90's TV sitcom 'HERMAN'S HEAD') but it's still a very imaginative and well made kids' film!Riley (Dias) is a young girl, growing up in Minnesota, who has five voices inside her mind; guiding her every decision, and feeling. They're Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black) and Disgust (Kaling). Joy is in charge of keeping Riley primarily happy, but she's constantly struggling with how to deal with Sadness. When Riley is forced to move to San Francisco, at age 11, and her father (MacLachlan) is constantly away at work, things become really challenging for Joy. Especially when Joy and Sadness are thrown out of the headquarters, inside Riley's mind, and have to make a journey back to it, in order to restore Riley's mental stability.I grew up on 'HERMAN'S HEAD'; I used to watch it all the time when I was a kid, so when I first saw the trailer for this film, I wasn't very impressed. It seemed like a rip-off and it also just didn't look that good to me. So I had low expectation for the movie, until I heard all the rave reviews for it, from critics and audiences alike. After seeing the film, I can say it's not a blatant rip-off; and it does have plenty of fresh ideas and creativity of it's own. Although the premise isn't original, it does deal with it in a interesting and entertaining way; the whole world, inside Riley's mind (the film creates), is very fascinating. I do wonder though, if we all have people inside our heads, guiding us through life, do they all have people inside their heads too, guiding them, and so on? The humor is kind of childish but it does have a very positive message; about dealing with depression, and life struggles, that I think could be beneficial for every kid to see. It might not be one of the most original Pixar films, but it is one of it's best (in my opinion).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/3LSix0bykDQ",9,10,36,29 June 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The weakest of Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations!
","'THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The second film in director Peter Jackson's trilogy, based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 novel 'The Hobbit'. The three films also serve as prequels to Jackson's 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film trilogy (which were also based on books by Tolkien). This film picks up where 2012's 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' left off and once again finds the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman once again) and the wizard Gandalf (once again played by Ian McKellen) assisting a team of 13 dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (played again by Richard Armitage). They're on a journey to the Kingdom of Erebor in order to reclaim it from a vicious dragon named Smaug (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). This chapter also stars Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Lee Pace, Ken Stott and James Nesbitt. It was written for the screen by Jackson and his usual writing partners (and co-producers on the film) Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh (Jackson's wife) as well as Guillermo del Toro (who was originally set to direct the 'HOBBIT' films). Despite all the rave reviews (from critics and fans alike) I found the movie to be the weakest of Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations.The film begins shortly after the end of the last one (after a brief flashback of Gandalf meeting Thorin) with Bilbo (Freeman), Gandalf (McKellen) and the dwarfs still being pursued by Azog (Manu Bennett) and his army of Orcs. The team receives aid from a skin-changer, named Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), in the form of horses and a house to rest in. Gandalf then separates from the group and promises to meet up with them before they enter Smaug's lair. Bilbo and the dwarfs must continue to elude the Orc army while also dealing with giant spiders, Wood-elves and the people of Lake-town before taking on the dragon (Cumberbatch). In the mean time Gandalf investigates the whereabouts of the Necromancer (also played by Cumberbatch). The movie is of course visually spectacular and it does have a lot of awesome and gory action scenes (in Jackson's usual style) but there's too much pointless fighting and not enough drama and character development. It's the shortest of all the films in the series (at 2 hours and 41 minutes) but it seems like the longest (to me). Despite the movie being extremely action packed it feels incredibly slow paced (due to the story going nowhere) and really drags on. I felt the same way after seeing 'THE TWO TOWERS' for the first time (which is my least favorite film of that series) so maybe it's just the curse of being the middle movie but I think stretching this book into three (nearly three hour) films was a bad idea. Of course not from a money point of view, the first movie made a billion dollars and I'm sure this one will as well (or at least close to it) but based on artistic film merit this one fails (pretty much). It is a good action flick and a visual feast but that's about it. I'm not one to complain about filmmakers taking creative liberties, when adapting their source material into film, but this movie detours so much from it's story that it weakens the overall viewing experience, even when not comparing it to the book. 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' is slower paced but I still think it's a better (and more enjoyable) film; it also at least stays true to the essence of the book. This chapter is made just to please action junkies (which it should), it does have a minor love story (involving a dwarf and two elves) but that's about all the character drama we really get here. I still enjoyed the movie (and will probably like it more upon repeat viewing, when I know what to expect) but it is disappointing and not as good as the other four films. It's funny how similar these 'LORD OF THE RINGS' prequels are to the 'STAR WARS' ones; Peter Jackson and George Lucas are very similar filmmakers!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",9,2,7,14 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," I don't usually go for cheesy teenage melodrama or painfully bad tragic love stories.
","'THE FAULT IN OUR STARS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A romantic drama film based on the bestselling book (of the same name) by John Green. It stars Shailene Woodley as a 16-year-old cancer patient who falls in love with a cancer survivor (played by Ansel Elgort), that she meets in a support group. It was directed by Josh Boone (who also directed the 2013 romantic drama flick 'STUCK IN LOVE') and written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (the duo also wrote '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER' and 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which also costarred Woodley). It costars Nat Wolff (who also costarred in 'STUCK IN LOVE'), Laura Dern, Sam Trammell and Willem Dafoe. I don't usually go for cheesy teenage melodrama or painfully bad tragic love stories but this movie isn't either of those things. It's actually a well made and moving film that offers up another stunning performance from Shailene Woodley! Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster; a 16-year old cancer patient who lives in Indianapolis, Indiana with her parents (Dern and Trammell). Elgort plays Augustus Waters; a 17-year-old cancer survivor who rid himself of osteosarcoma by having one of his legs amputated. The two meet at a cancer support group that Hazel's parents force her to go to. Augustus is there to support his friend, Isaac (Wolff), who's now gotten cancer tumors in both of his eyes. Augustus immediately takes a liking to Hazel, after running into her outside of a meeting, and then proceeds to stare at her and hit on her (after the meeting concludes). The two watch a movie together (at Augustus's house) and then recommend books for each other to read. They continue to develop a relationship as Augustus tracks down the author (Dafoe) of Hazel's favorite book (a book about a cancer patient much like herself) and they attempt to get answers from him about the book's inconclusive ending.I'll start by saying I'm becoming a huge fan of Shailene Woodley. Much like her buddy (Jennifer Lawrence) I find her to be a very inspiring and likable person (in interviews at least) and also think she's an amazingly talented actress. She's once again excellent in this film and delivers an Oscar worthy performance; she's also the main reason I wanted to see this movie. I haven't read the book and if Woodley wasn't in the movie I probably would have had no desire to see it either. I'm glad I did though and Shailene is the main reason but it's a good film in many other ways as well. Neustadter and Weber are great film writers; I love their other work (especially 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW') but they also obviously had good stories to work with (adapt). Boone is also a good director; I loved 'STUCK IN LOVE' and look forward to seeing many more movies from him in the future. The supporting cast is all decent in it as well but Elgort is especially a great match for Woodley; the two have beautiful chemistry together and they do make the story seem romantic (which is a little odd considering they played siblings in their last film, 'DIVERGENT'). The movie is touching (and funny in places) but I'm sure it's even more moving for those who can more directly relate to the subject. It deals with the issue in a seemingly effective way and never feels forced or overly done. Although the film might look (to some) like it reeks of the bad taste of similar themed movies, it doesn't. It's a well made film and another triumph for Shailene Woodley.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzh1FLmMq4",9,1,4,10 June 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Disney attempts to do a Pixar quality animated picture without Pixar!
","'WRECK-IT RALPH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Disney attempts to do a Pixar quality animated picture without Pixar and they don't do a bad job at it! The film tells the tale of an arcade world where the arcade characters are alive and one video game bad guy is tired of being a villain and sets out to be a hero for once (abandoning his game, which causes trouble for the rest of the game world). John C. Reilly stars as the voice of the titular character and Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk co-star. Rich Moore (a veteran director of cartoon shows like 'FUTURAMA', 'THE SIMPSONS' and 'THE CRITIC') made his feature film debut directing the movie. He also co-wrote it along with Phil Johnston, Jennifer Lee and Jim Reardon. John Lasseter (a veteran Pixar director and producer) executive produced the film. The movie doesn't match the very best of Pixar but it does rival it's less than stellar offerings (There's also a Disney short film before the movie, 'PAPERMAN', that rivals the best of Pixar's shorts).The film is set at Litwak's Arcade where video game characters roam from game to game at night when the arcade is closed. Wreck-It Ralph (Reilly) is tired of being the villain of the game 'Fix-It Felix, Jr.' where the other video game characters have treated him like an outcast all of the game's thirty years of existence. Ralph decides one night, while at a video game villain support group, he no longer wants to be a villain. After learning that characters in the new first-person shooter game 'Hero's Duty' can win a medal for heroics in their game he abandons his game and sets out to win a medal there. This causes havoc not only for his game but the entire arcade as he accidentally unleashes a Cy-Bug, with powers to multiply and destroy everything in it's path (and when a video game character dies outside his own game he dies for good). Ralph meets an outcast, named Vanellope (Silverman), in a kart-racing game and the two team up in order to help each other find happiness and better fit in in to their own video game worlds.The movie is a little like a cross between 'TOY STORY' and 'TRON'; it resembles 'TRON' because of it's story involving characters that live inside a video game and 'TOY STORY' because these characters do what kid's want of them during the day but have their own lives at night, when they're not being watched. Several characters from actual video games have cameos in the film and the movie is a good tribute to video games and arcades. It's funny at times and also has a lot of melodrama (like most Disney, as well as all, animated kids films). It's got a lot of cheesy humor and drama but at times it's genuinely funny as well as touching (like most Pixar films). The message about acceptance of outcasts is also very powerful and positive for kids. It's not quite as clever as the director's TV work or as classic as 'TRON' or 'TOY STORY' but it is as good as your average Pixar film, which is what I think Disney set out to do.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ",7,0,0,9 November 2012
Bridesmaids," 'Dick and Fart Jokes' Chick Flick Style!
","'BRIDESMAIDS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Judd Apatow tries his style of raunchy yet emotional comedy/drama with a chick flick by producing this Kristen Wiig vehicle (an 'SNL' and supporting film player vet). Wiig stars in the film as well as co-wrote it with comedian Annie Mumolo. Apatow's buddy Paul Feig (who created the popular short run TV series 'FREAKS AND GEEKS', which Apatow also produced) directed the film. It co-stars Maya Rudolph (a fellow 'SNL' vet), Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Chris O'Dowd. The film tells the story of a woman going through a midlife crisis at the same time that her best friend is getting married. Most of the film's big laughs come from the type of vulgar and crude humor you usually only see in guy movies, which is a nice change of pace and ballsy. The film isn't quite as consistently hilarious as Apatow's best films but for the most part it works and it does have the touching emotional aspect that Apatow films are known for as well (which it actually does a better job of delivering).Wiig plays Annie, a down on her luck jewelery store clerk who had recently attempted to follow her dreams and open a bakery. Despite Annie's great cooking talents the bakery failed due to the recession (she says). She's also had a lot of poor luck with men and is constantly treated like merely a f--- buddy by the pretty boy she wishes was her boyfriend (Jon Hamm). When her best friend Lillian (Rudolph) tells her she's getting married and asks her to be her maid of honor she falls deeper into depression and despair. Things are complicated further when a rivalry grows for Lillian's affection between Annie and Lillian's new good friend Helen (Byrne, looking more stunning than ever), who's also the rich beautiful wife of Lillian's fiancé's boss.The movie has plenty of hilarious moments, including some of the raunchiest and most vulgar dick and fart jokes of any comedy recently, but at times the jokes tend to stretch on too much and lose a lot of their momentum. The movie is way too long for a slapstick romantic comedy (at a whopping 2 hours and 5 minutes!) and some of the vulgar jokes are almost too grotesque to even sit through (at least for me, I had an extremely hard time stomaching this movie). When it is funny it works though and Wiig is very impressive in the lead. The rest of the cast is more than adequate as well (especially Byrne, McCarthy and O'Dowd). The emotional drama of the film is surprisingly what works best about it, it really feels true and heartfelt (especially the relationship between Annie and a friendly police officer (O'Dowd). While the movie isn't quite as good as Apatow's best it's still an impressive achievement and hopefully will help pave the way for more female driven crude comedies to set new ground in the future.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj550csrEQk",7,2,5,19 May 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A far better prequel than the one George Lucas is famous for!
","'THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The first part of the much anticipated film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic 1937 book. Like 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film series it's directed by Peter Jackson and written by Jackson and his usual writing partners Fran Walsh (Jackson's wife) and Philippa Boyens. This one is also co-written by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who was originally set to direct the films but bowed out after too many delays and filming complications). Like 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film adaptations 'THE HOBBIT' film series was originally set to be divided into two films but Jackson was later given the green light (by producers) to make three films instead. He says he didn't realize it had to be three films until going over all the film footage and realizing there was too much for just two movies (but I find this hard to believe). The first chapter 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' plays out too concisely as a complete and individual film (with a nice climax) to have just happened that way (at the last second, by accident). Some fans had a problem with Jackson stretching and dividing the material out into three films but I was all for it as long as he could make each chapter a satisfying film on it's own (with a good climax for each) and at least with this first film he seems to have done that!The films are a prequel to 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' series (although the book was written and published prior to 'The Lord Of The Rings' book trilogy). Martin Freeman (of 'THE OFFICE' fame, the original British version) stars as the young Bilbo Baggins (and Ian Holm reprises the role, from the 'RINGS' trilogy, in his older years). Also returning from the prior films are Ian McKellen (once again as Gandalf), Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis (as the motion capture produced Gollum, once again). The film begins the legendary story with Bilbo being picked by the wizard 'Gandalf the Grey' to join a team of thirteen dwarfs, lead by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a mission to take back their kingdom from a vicious dragon named Smaug (who stole it years earlier due to it's mass collection of gold). Bilbo is picked for his burglar skills even though he has none and this becomes apparent to the dwarfs who quickly find him useless. Bilbo finds himself in way over his head and wanting to return home when he stumbles across 'the ring' and steals it from the creature known as Gollum. The movie has been criticized for it's length and pace but I found it to be no slower moving than any of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' films (except perhaps the last one) and even a little more amusing. Of course it's too long and drawn out (and perhaps too faithful to the written material) but so were the other films. It's usually not a good thing to try and cram everything from a book into it's film adaptation (and then some in this case) but when it's such a labor of love for the filmmakers and they're that passionate about the material (and giving the die-hard fans what they want to see) it can't all be a bad thing. I only read the book once, as a kid, and don't remember it all too well so I can't remember what entirely is the same and what has been changed but that makes me a better critic of the film as just a film, in my opinion (and not in comparison to the material it's based on). I'm not married to the material at all and had no high expectations for the film adaptation, so I was pleasantly surprised. It's visually spectacular and I did see it in 3D (although not in the new 48 frames per second it was filmed in, there's no theaters near me with the capabilities of showing it that way). The performances are all good (especially Freeman and the scene stealing Serkis) and Jackson's directing is once again beautiful and perfectly fitting. I did find it to be just as entertaining as the other films in the series but it does lack the emotional depth that made 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' films truly great films. While it might not be quite as classic as the great trilogy it follows it's still a magnificent achievement and a far better initial prequel than the one that George Lucas is famous for.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NILhScQxII",10,4,11,15 December 2012
Non-Stop," I for one love wasting time watching dumb movies like this!
","'NON-STOP': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)61-year-old Liam Neeson stars in another B action film, in this one he's an alcoholic air marshal dealing with a plane being held hostage (for a 150 million dollar ransom) by a mysterious text messaging criminal. The former Academy Award nominee is also joined in the movie by another former Oscar nominee Julianne Moore and recent winner Lupita Nyong'o! The supporting cast also includes Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker, Corey Stoll, Michelle Dockery, Anson Mount, Shea Whigham and Linus Roache. It was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed Neeson in the 2011 action thriller 'UNKNOWN') and written by John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle. I found the flick to be fun while I was watching it but ultimately forgettable. Neeson plays Bill Marks, an ex-cop who's now an alcoholic U.S. federal air marshal. He recently lost his job as a police officer, had his wife leave him and lost his eight-year-old daughter to cancer. So he of course drinks a lot to cope. The story takes place aboard Aqualantic Flight 10, a flight from New York to London. We learn Marks is also afraid of flight takeoffs as he explains this to the friendly passenger sitting next to him, named Jen Summers (Moore). Things really get exciting for Marks when he starts getting text messages from a mysterious stranger who's watching him. The texter threatens to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless Marks can have $150 million delivered to a special bank account. Things become even more complicated when it turns out the account belongs to the air marshal. Neeson is once again exceptional in the lead action hero role, he's of course above films like this but it's still a lot of fun to watch him. Moore and Nyong'o are of course above material like this too, so is the director, but their talent makes it so much more entertaining. It's the type of movie that I know I'll forget most of within a year or two; like I'll probably forget who the bad guys are and how it ends but that doesn't mean it's still not worth watching. A good time is a good time regardless of whether it's high quality entertainment or not and I for one love wasting time watching dumb movies like this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBy263FaHs",7,0,2,5 March 2014
Saving Private Ryan," One of the biggest upsets in Oscar history!
","'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's epic World War II film (from 1998) earned him his second Academy Award for Best Director although it failed to win best picture (being robbed by 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE') in one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history and certainly my lifetime (next to maybe 'CRASH' beating out 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' in 2006). It's still considered one of the greatest and most realistic war films ever made though, being praised most of all for it's opening 27 minute 'Normandy Landings' scene (which was named 'best battle scene of all time' by Empire magazine). It's one of my favorite war and Spielberg movies ever and probably my favorite film of 1998!The film was written by Robert Rodat and inspired by a monument, memorializing soldiers killed in battle from the Civil War to Vietnam, which lists eight siblings killed in the American Civil War. 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' revolves around a soldier, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's three brothers are all killed in World War II. In order to relieve distress to his mother Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), orders eight soldiers to find Ryan and bring him home to safety. They're lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), who just survived the Normandy Landings. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Vin Diesel play the other seven soldiers. The film was criticized by some, including filmmaker Oliver Stone, who felt movies like it helped influence the Iraq War (due to World War II being portrayed as 'the good war'). I don't really agree with that assessment but I can see their point. The movie is a masterpiece in my opinion and I think everyone should see it as a tribute to all the soldiers who've died in war. The first time I saw it in the theater was one of the most memorable film going experiences of my life. Who could ever forget those opening 27 minutes (it portrays one of the most nightmarish images ever caught on film)! I think this movie is Spielberg at his very best (in my opinion it's a greater achievement than 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' even). To say I like it more than his more fun movies like 'JAWS', 'E.T.' or the 'INDIANA JONES' series would probably be a lie but it is a more important film and one of the very best of 1998 (definitely better than 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE').Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A",10,2,3,11 April 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Lacks some of the awe and wonder that made the original movie so special.
","'HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2010 DreamWorks Animation hit about a boy (in a Viking world) who befriends a dragon. This computer animated film picks up five years after the end of the original; with Vikings now living peacefully with dragons, until a new enemy emerges (threatening to destroy the peace). It was directed and written by Dean DeBlois (who also co-directed and co-wrote the first movie) and it's once again based on the book series (of the same name) by Cressida Cowell. Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig and T.J. Miller all return as voices; with Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou and Kit Harington all joining the cast. I don't think it's quite as good as the original movie (or as well made as a lot of the overly enthusiastic fan reviews, I've read, have proclaimed it to be) but it is a good movie.Baruchel once again stars as Hiccup; who now spends most of his time exploring the skies with his dragon, Toothless (Randy Thom). The rest of the island of Berk now lives in peace with dragons, sharing food and enjoying dragon races. On one of Hiccup's adventures he, and Toothless, come across multiple angry dragon trappers, led by Eret (Harington), who blame them for a recent attack on their fort (in which dragons were stolen from them). The duo, with the help of Astrid (Ferrera) and her dragon Stormfly, learn that Eret, and his team, are capturing dragons for a ruthless dragon hunter named Drago (Hounsou). They warn Hiccup's father, Stoick (Butler), about Drago but he just wants to prepare for war (where as Hiccup would rather try to reason with Drago). Hiccup and Toothless fly off to try and stop the potential war and also come across a mysterious dragon rider, named Valka (Blanchett), while doing so.Once again the visuals look beautiful (like the original film) and the dragon riding scenes are breathtaking. The movie is darker and a tad more violent (I'd say) this time. I saw it with my two young nephews (Eugene and Justin) and I think they both really enjoyed it; it might have been a little too scary for my youngest nephew (who's 6) at times though. There are some lighter comedic moments, throughout the movie, but a lot of those feel forced (although the dragon humor is always funny). The dragon bonding scenes continue to remind me of my relationship with my best friend Keno (my cat). The film does lack some of the awe and wonder that made the original movie so special though. It does a good job of building on it's mythical world (it established in the original film) but the character development isn't nearly as well played out (this time). With all of it's flaws it's still a better animated family adventure film than most. I'd definitely still recommend it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2f4dnLXvGI",7,4,11,16 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Has Anderson's usual quirky style, humor and offbeat characters.
","'THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Wes Anderson directed and co-wrote (with Hugo Guinness) this all-star comedy film about a popular European concierge trying to clear his name of murder, with the aid of a recently employed lobby boy (who has become his closest friend). The story is set between the two world wars and was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig (a famous Austrian writer during the 1920s and 30s). The film stars Ralph Fiennes as the concierge and Tony Revolori as his lobby boy friend. It also features performances by Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan. Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Murray and many others. I found it to be quite funny and visually interesting but not up to par with Anderson's best films. Fiennes plays M. Gustave; a concierge at a once famous European hotel (in the fictional Zubrowka), during the height of it's popularity (between the two world wars). Tony Revolori plays Zero Moustafa, a recently hired lobby boy who Gustave quickly takes a liking to. Gustave was well liked by the hotel's richest guests (for his excellent customer service), especially older blonde women (who he made sure got all their needs met). When one such regular guest passes on, named Madame D. (Swinton), Gustave is left a very valuable Renaissance painting. This causes quite a controversy with Madame D.'s family, especially her son Dmitri (Brody), and Gustave soon finds himself imprisoned for the Madame's murder. He then must rely on Zero to help him clear his name. F. Murray Abraham plays Zero as an adult (at a much later time), who narrates the story. The movie has Anderson's usual quirky style, humor and offbeat characters. It also has some deeper emotional drama (like his other films) but not at the same level as his greatest work and the characters aren't quite as likable or memorable either. It is really funny, highly amusing and full of great performances (especially Fiennes); like all of Anderson's other movies too. Without that same level of human touch though (as Anderson's best) I can't recommend it quite as much. I'm sure fans of his will be extremely entertained though; as well as fans of any of the actors involved.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TT6LZ7cFI",9,0,6,2 April 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Some hillbillies are just like spiders!
","'TUCKER AND DALE VS EVIL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Backwoods hillbillies horror spoof which uses popular B slasher film clichés and gimmicks to turn expectations completely around on the viewer. The look and style of the film is reminiscent to a Bruce Campbell film, or 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD' type flick, but it takes the satire one step further by completely reversing all predicted stereotypes. It entertains with tons of horrorhound gore and enormous laughs but it also teaches a valuable lesson at the same time (as cheesy as that sounds). For that I think it deserves a lot of credit. The film is directed and co-written (along with Morgan Jurgenson) by Eli Craig and stars Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk in the title roles. If you're a fan of the genre this is one you definitely don't want to miss! Tudyk plays Tucker and Labine plays Dale, two well intentioned but socially naive hillbillies in West Virginia. They recently bought a cabin in the middle of the woods to go fishing and vacation at. While enjoying their time at the cabin they cross paths with a group of narrow-minded and extremely superficial college kids. Dale immediately begins crushing on one of the girls, named Allison (Katrina Bowden), but feels to shy and awkward to talk to her. When the two accidentally startle her and she falls into the lake, knocking herself out, they decide to take her back to their cabin until she comes to. Her friends mistakenly think she's been kidnapped and immediately jump to the conclusion that Tucker and Dale are psycho killers so they decide to take it upon themselves to rescue her. One misunderstanding leads to another as the college kids begin attacking the shocked hillbillies and continue to accidentally kill themselves in the process, thus furthering their belief that Tucker and Dale are insane killers after them.The movie is packed with big laughs like I said and you do get the gore as well, it's just that it's almost all accidental deaths (played out in very dark comedic ways). The death scenes are almost reminiscent of a 'FINAL DESTINATION' film, just far more satirical. My favorite part of the film though is the way it plays with people's prejudices and stereotypes. It shows that usually the one's that think others are scary or creepy are usually the flawed ones with much bigger problems and the people that are perceived to be 'freaks' are usually much more mentally stable and well intentioned. The classic analogy comparing social misfits to spiders often works which shows that people who are thought to be frightening and or creepy are much more afraid of you than you are of them. There's so much more discrimination and hate crimes going on in the world than most people even begin to realize and it's most often done with out any awareness to it. That's the message of this film, it's played out in an extremely comedic way but the message gets driven home all the same and with a surprising amount of heart. Tudyk and Labine are great in the leads and the directing and script are topnotch as well. This is a film I very much look forward to seeing again and would be equally excited to see some sort of a sequel revisiting the characters. It's definitely horror comedy done right!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-KU7aWFnDI",9,2,2,14 October 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Bird shines in first live action outing!
","'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – GHOST PROTOCOL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The fourth 'Ethan Hunt' adventure is both the most financially successful of the 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE' series as well as the most critically acclaimed. It was directed by Brad Bird (former Corvallis High School graduate and Oscar winning Pixar director), in his first live action outing, and written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec (two TV writer vets). 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' director J.J. Abrams produced the film along with star Tom Cruise and Bryan Burk and up and coming actors Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton joined returning cast members Cruise and Simon Pegg. The result is an exhilarating action thrill ride. Not quite as classic as the original but perhaps the best of any of the sequels. This time around Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on a deadly mission to stop a terrorist known as Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) from attacking the U.S. with stolen Russian nuclear launch codes. He and his team, Benji Dunn (Pegg) and Jane Carter (Patton), first attempt to stop the madman at the Kremlin when a bomb goes off and the IMF team is blamed for it. The president cuts off Hunt and his team, issuing 'Ghost Protocol' against them. They do find aid from a intelligence analyst named William Brandt (Renner) though, that seems to know more about Hunt and his team than he lets on. The movie is filled with spectacular edge of your seat action scenes and visuals. Cruise and the rest of the cast are adequate but there's definitely nothing too memorable in the form of acting. It's Bird that shines in the director seat as well as a smart and fun script and excellent work from an awesome technical team. The movie is not nearly as nostalgic or engaging as the original but, like I said, it offers a little more fun than the last two installments. If you're a fan of the series you're sure to enjoy.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvF1PdATGwA",9,2,6,8 February 2012
Foxcatcher," A really dark, disturbing and extremely ambiguous film!
","'FOXCATCHER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed biographical thriller about two Olympic champion brothers, who are asked by an eccentric multimillionaire to be a part of his future wrestling team. It stars Steve Carell as the multimillionaire, named John E. du Pont, and Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo as the wrestling brothers, Mark and David Schultz. It was directed by Bennett Miller; who also directed another critically acclaimed 'true crime' thriller (in 2005) called 'CAPOTE', as well as another critically acclaimed sports film (in 2011) called 'MONEYBALL'. It was written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman (Futterman also wrote 'CAPOTE') and it's based on the tragic true events; which surrounded the lives of the Schultz brothers and John E. du Pont. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and it was nominated for five Academy Awards; including Best Director, Best Actor (Carell), Best Supporting Actor (Ruffalo) and Best Original Screenplay. It's a really dark, disturbing and extremely ambiguous film; I enjoyed it quite a bit.Mark and David Schultz (Tatum and Ruffalo) both won gold medals for wrestling, in the 1984 Olympics. Four years later Dave lived happily with his wife (Sienna Miller) and kids, but Mark was relatively depressed and poor (despite his gold medal and past fame). So when Mark is suddenly contacted by a multimillionaire, named John E. du Pont (Carell), and asked to come stay at his estate in order to help train a wrestling team for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mark happily takes him up on his offer (as he's paid very well in return). Du Pont asks Mark to invite his brother along as well, but Dave doesn't want to leave his family. A strange bond forms between Mark and du Pont as Mark is eager to win another gold medal and du Pont sees an opportunity to become a respected wrestling coach, as well as finally win the approval of his overbearing mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Things don't go as planned and tragedy strikes.The real Mark Schultz served as a consultant for much of the film's production but when he first saw the completed movie, he ranted on Twitter about how much he hated it. Critics had pointed out that the relationship shown in the film, between his character and du Pont's, has 'homosexual undertones'. This is what upset Schultz the most; but he later apologized for his harsh words and now says he loves the movie. I think there is some homosexuality, implied in the film, but like everything else, in the movie, it's very ambiguous. That's what I kind of like most about it; it's very dark and creepy but nothing is spelled out for the viewer. I think almost everything, in the film, is left up to an individual's interpretation. Miller has said he was trying to show a 'narrative of a cult'; with the characters and situations being studied in the movie. I think it's all very fascinating and well made. It's maybe a little too slow paced and seemingly uneventful, at times, but it does have a powerful payoff. Carell really did an amazing job transforming himself into the role; and he does deserve all of the acclaim he's been getting. Tatum is pretty good as well but he seems more naturally fitting to his role; so it doesn't seem like it was as big of a stretch for him to do. Ruffalo is good, like always, but no better than he normally is, in my opinion. It's an all around well made film. Probably not one of the very best of the year, but a pretty good one all the same.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/O9KTvaLDibs",9,4,10,21 January 2015
It Follows," A classic horror film, in every way!
","'IT FOLLOWS': Five Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed indie horror flick about a young woman who's constantly followed by a mysterious unknown entity, which is trying to kill her. It was written and directed by David Robert Mitchell and filmed on a budget of just $2 million. The film stars Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Lili Sepe, Daniel Zovatto, Jake Weary and Olivia Luccardi. It's a classic horror film, in every way, and it definitely lives up to all of it's hype!Jay (Monroe) is a nineteen-year-old college student with a crush on a 21-year-old guy, named Hugh (Weary), she just met. The two go out on a couple of dates and then have sex together, in Hugh's car. Hugh then knocks her out, with chloroform. When Jay wakes up, Hugh informs her that he's transferred a curse to her, by sleeping with her, and she'll now be followed by a mysterious unknown force, that will constantly try to kill her. He explains that the only way she can get rid of the curse is to sleep with someone else, as he did with her. Jay spends the rest of the film frantically trying to elude the deadly entity, that's now following her, with the help of her friends.The film appears to be set in the 70s or 80s, most of the time, but the characters also use cell phones and other modern devices, at other times. Still it has that classic 70s, or 80s, horror movie feel to it; and the timelessness of the film's setting is part of it's magical charm (Monroe also starred in the retro 80's action flick 'THE GUEST', just last year). The score, by the electronic musician known as Disasterpeace, is strikingly haunting and very reminiscent of the popular slasher flicks of yesteryear. The whole movie just has that classic horror genre movie feel to it; like those directed by John Carpenter or George A. Romero. It feels a lot like a very haunting, and quite disturbing, nightmare; which is what Mitchell says he based the premise for the movie on (his own recurring bad dreams, about something constantly following him). There's of course a lot of unexplained mystery to it, and several aspects of the story that don't seem to always make sense, at all, but that's part of the movie's charm as well. I think 'IT FOLLOWS' will go down in history, as one of the truly great horror movie classics; just like all the ones that seem to have inspired it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/-bmQZTEkHT0",10,60,123,1 April 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," It's pretty amazing how a film like this can get the viewer to turn so quickly on their own race!
","'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four Stars (Out of Five)Prequel/reboot to the 1968 classic science fiction film 'PLANET OF THE APES'. This film tells the origin story of how apes originally evolved and started an uprising against the human race. It's sort of a remake of the fourth film in the original 'PLANET OF THE APES' series, 1972's 'CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' (since that film went back in time and told a similar story) but it's more of a fresh reboot to a totally new series than anything else. It was directed by Rupert Wyatt and written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (who have experience in the sci-fi/horror genre co-writing films like 1997's 'THE RELIC' and 1992's 'THE HAND THAT ROCKED THE CRADLE'). The film is full of spectacular visual effects (but surprisingly wasn't released in 3D) and is a much more satisfying re-imagining than Tim Burton's 2001 remake.James Franco stars as Will Rodman, a scientist working for a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company. Will is hard at work trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, motivated by his father Charles (John Lithgow) who is a victim of it. He's testing a new drug out on lab apes and one shows remarkable promise. When the ape goes crazy defending it's baby, that no one knew she was pregnant with, all the apes are ordered put down and the experiment is canceled. Will secretly takes the baby home with him and continues doing tests on it. His father bonds with it and names it Ceaser (he's played as an adult by Andy Serkis, through motion capture filming). What Will and Charles don't know is that Caesar will one day lead his fellow apes in a rebellion and when he's sent to an ape holding facility the world as we know it is forever changed. Freida Pinto (of 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' fame) co-stars as a veterinarian Will falls for.The CGI is breathtaking, it's finally gotten to a point where the creatures they bring to life on screen look much more real than actors in costumes do. That's one of the ways this is far superior to Burton's 'ape' film. Serkis's performance is outstanding and he brings a lot of heart to the film through it. Lithgow also gives a 'heart tugging' performance but Pinto is wasted here. She's proved she can act as well as look stunningly beautiful but with this the filmmakers obviously just wanted her to look pretty. Her character is not developed at all and pretty much the only point of her even being there is to fill the void of a human female presence. Franco is good and relatable at times but he's done better work (he's also done worse though). Brian Cox, David Oyelowo and Tom Felton (of 'HARRY POTTER' fame) all make great antagonists (especially Felton, which he's now beginning to be typecast as). One of the biggest strengths of the film is how much it makes you loath the humans and root for the apes. Besides Franco, Lithgow and Pinto none of the other humans in the film are very likable and the rest of the human population is portrayed as pretty hateful and morally deprived. It's pretty amazing how a film like this can get the viewer to turn so quickly on their own race. The rebellion of the film is very involving and impressively built up to (but it plays a pretty small part of the actual film). There's almost nothing more satisfying in my opinion than watching tormented victims get the upper hand on their oppressors. This is where the film really works (Wyatt really did a good job directing the film in that way). The writing and acting is decent as well but it's the emotional build up and striking visuals that really make the film worth while. If you're a fan of the series you'll almost definitely enjoy this new installment.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nse6Wm1EtZU",8,2,4,10 August 2011
Legend," Being a huge fan of Hardy's, I enjoyed the film immensely!
","'LEGEND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Tom Hardy plays dual roles, in this British crime thriller, as the Kray twins. Hardy plays Reggie and Ronald Kray; British gangster twins, that terrorized London in the 1960s. The film was written and directed by Brian Helgeland (who also performed both duties on movies like 'PAYBACK', '42' and 'A KNIGHT'S TALE'); it's based on the 1972 novel 'The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins', by John Pearson. The movie also costars Emily Browning, David Thewlis, Christopher Eccleston and Chazz Palminteri. Being a huge fan of Hardy's, I enjoyed the film immensely!The story begins in late 1950s London. It's told from the point of view of Frances Shea (Browning); who was the girlfriend, and later wife, of mobster Reggie Kray (Hardy). The film details Reggie and Ronald's brutally violent rise to criminal fame; as Reggie constantly tried to keep his mentally ill brother in line. It also focuses on the romantic relationship between Reggie and Frances. Tom Hardy is my favorite (current) actor, and he definitely doesn't disappoint here. If you're a fan of his, seeing him play such distinctly different (and very memorable) characters, is wildly entertaining. The movie, as a whole, is a pretty well made gangster flick as well; I've liked Helgeland's other films (especially 'PAYBACK'), and I think he does a more than adequate job helming this one. The movie is definitely worth seeing!watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/A1MyBFioKXM",9,4,6,24 February 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," It's better than 'JUSTIC LEAGUE' at least.
","'AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR': Four Stars (Out of Five)The third installment (not counting 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR') in the blockbuster superhero franchise, based on the Marvel Comics' characters. This one has the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, to stop Thanos from collecting all of the Infinity Stones so he can bend reality to his will. The movie was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (who also both co-directed 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER' and 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and it was scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also both co-wrote all of the 'CAPTAIN AMERICA' movies). It stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Chadwick Boseman, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan and the voices of Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to break all kinds of records at the Box Office of course. The movie is a pretty epic action flick, but it's a little light on actual character development and meaningful story. The story begins two years after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', and the Avengers are still not on speaking terms. Thanos (Brolin) has come to earth to collect the last of the Infinity Stones, which will allow him to form a gauntlet that can bend reality to his will. Hulk (Ruffalo) has arrived just before him, to warn Tony (Downey Jr.) about his plans. At the same time Thor (Hemsworth) meets the Guardians of the Galaxy, in space, and the Avengers must later team-up with them in order to stop Thanos, and save the universe. The film definitely has a great epic feel to it, and look, and the action scenes are spectacular. There's way too many characters in the movie though, and each one has their own little story; which when added all together makes the whole film feel kind of pointless and empty. I'm sure nerd comic book lovers will still love it, and on a purely superficial/technical level it's quite a film-going experience. In the end though, it's all style over substance, and it's kind of like movie junk food with no real value. It is better than 'JUSTIC LEAGUE' at least though.",8,8,25,27 April 2018
Behind The Candelabra," Filled with bad homosexual stereotypes!
","'BEHIND THE CANDELABRA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Supposedly director Steven Soderbergh's last film is this made-for-TV biopic about the last ten years of Liberace's life and his six-year affair with Scott Thorson. Michael Douglas stars as Liberace and Matt Damon also stars as Thorson. Richard LaGravenese wrote the screenplay, which is based on the autobiographical book ('Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace') by Thorson and Alex Thorleifson. The performances are great and the makeup is really impressive but the movie as a whole is too dark and depressing.The film begins in 1977 when Scott Thorson (Damon) was just 17. He had grown up in multiple foster homes and was then working as an animal trainer for films. He meets a producer named Bob Black (Scott Bakula), at a gay bar, and Black then introduces him to the famous pianist Liberace (Douglas), backstage at one of his shows. Liberace was a sex obsessed (but closeted) homosexual who was immediately attracted to the young Thorson (who was bisexual). He throws his current lover (and musical protégé), Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson), out on the streets and seduces Scott, while also offering him a job. Scott leaves his adoptive parents and moves in with Liberace, who totally begins controlling his life (including altering his face, through plastic surgery, to look like him). I'm not a fan of biopics (although the ones I've seen recently, before this one, have been better than those of years past) and I didn't enjoy this film for that reason (as well as many others). I found the Liberace character to be way too unlikeable and the film itself to be way too disturbing and sad. The way Liberace preyed on a teen, Scott Thorson, and ruined his life is just devastating. If it's true to life than I understand the filmmakers' intentions but I don't think the movie offers anything of emotional or inspirational value. It's just a very dark and gloomy look at life in the celebrity world (it's also filled with a lot of bad homosexual stereotypes). Douglas and Damon are outstanding in their roles (like I said), the makeup is amazing and Soderbergh's directing is once again topnotch but I didn't care for the characters or story at all.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOD_FVRPTm4",7,0,2,19 December 2013
Beasts of No Nation," A hard film to sit through, but well worth it!
","'BEASTS OF NO NATION': Four Stars (Out of Five)Netflix's new critically acclaimed war film; starring, and co- produced by, Idris Elba. The movie was also co-produced, written and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (who's probably most well known for helming season 1 of 'TRUE DETECTIVE'). It's based on the 2005 novel, of the same name, by Uzodinma Iweala (a Nigerian-American writer). It tells the story of an African child, forced to become a soldier in a brutal civil war. It also stars Abraham Attah, as the child soldier, in his film debut. It's a hard film to sit through, but well worth it.The movie takes place in an unnamed West African country, where a violent civil war has broken out. Agu (Attah) is a young boy, living in a peaceful village, when it's attacked by the army; and the men are all viciously killed. Agu escapes, but he's quickly captured by the rebel forces instead. They're lead by their ruthless commander 'Commandant' (Elba). Commandant forces Agu to join his battalion, or be killed, and we watch as the young boy is stripped of his childhood. The film is brutally violent, and heartbreaking to watch. It's so disturbing, to experience, that I have a hard time giving it a favorable review; but that's what some films are made for, and this one (impressively) still finds hope in the darkness. The performances of Elba and Attah are both fantastic, and the directing is superb. If you can stomach horrific war films, it's definitely worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/dWmLQGusjEk",8,3,5,3 December 2015
Gone Girl," It kind of made me completely afraid of women!
","'GONE GIRL': Five Stars (Out of Five)Dark Comedy/Mystery Thriller flick directed by David Fincher and based on the 2012 book (of the same name) by Gillian Flynn; who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Ben Affleck; as a bar owner who becomes the center of a media circus, when he's suspected of killing his missing wife. The film costars Rosamund Pike (as the missing wife), Kim Dickens, Carrie Coon, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Patrick Fugit and Missi Pyle (doing an impressive Nancy Grace impersonation). I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons, but the movie is a masterpiece!Affleck plays Nick Dunne; the co-owner of a bar (cleverly titled 'The Bar') he owns with his sister Margo (Coon). Nick has been unhappily married, to Amy Elliott-Dunne (Pike), for sometime and on their fifth wedding anniversary he comes home to find their house ransacked and her missing. A media storm arises as an intense missing person search begins. Things become even more stressful (and nightmarish) when the police investigating the case, Detectives Rhonda Boney (Dickens) and Jim Gilpin (Fugit), consider Nick the prime suspect of his wife's disappearance (and likely her murder). The narrative begins to change, even more, as flashback scenes are revealed; from Amy's point of view.I'm a big fan of David Fincher and this is definitely one of his better movies. It's not just his flawless stylized directing though, that makes the film work so well, there's also a great story too (like all of his work); filled with nonstop twists and incredibly clever dialogue. There's also an awesome score, once again by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (in their third collaboration with Fincher), and amazing acting. Affleck has never been better; I was already a huge fan of his but this movie should turn any haters out there (if not they're idiots). Pike also gives a mesmerizing, award worthy, performance and the supporting cast is impeccable. I couldn't possibly praise the film anymore! It is really dark and disturbing though, definitely not for everyone, and it kind of made me completely afraid of women (without giving away too much). You have to see this movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Xz0GNkin4cw",10,0,11,3 October 2014
Django Unchained," 'DJANGO UNCHAINED' is too good! Tarantino at his best!
","'DJANGO UNCHAINED': Five Stars (Out of Five)Quentin Tarantino's homage to spaghetti westerns about pre-Civil War America in the South. Basically it's a slave revenge tale done in B western movie style but it also tackles some serious issues from America's horrifying past. The film stars Jamie Foxx in the title role of a freed slave turned bounty hunter who teams with the bounty hunter who freed him (played by Christoph Waltz) in order to rescue his wife. It co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. The movie is ultraviolent and as disturbing as hell but it's also highly entertaining and a great example of cinema at it's finest. The movie opens with a bounty hunter posing as a dentist (his former profession), named Dr. King Schultz (Waltz), tracking down a slave by the name of Django (Foxx) as he's being transported across the country by his two slave owners (James Remar and James Russo). Schultz purchases Django (by force) and makes him a proposition. He wants Django to help him track down his current bounty, the Brittle Brothers (who Django knows), and in return he'll give him his freedom (as he despises slavery). After Django helps him kill the Brittle Brothers Dr. Schultz makes him another offer; that if he stays on as his bounty hunting partner he'll help him track down his wife, Broomhilda (Washington), and free her. Django is a natural shot and reluctantly becomes an expert killer as the two find his wife; staying under the ownership of a ruthless plantation owner named Calvin Candie (DiCaprio).The film is Tarantino at his very best and delivers plenty of stylized visceral action as well as smart and intriguing dialogue. The characters are as rich and thought out as you could possibly expect from any film (yet alone a B western) and what happens to them is as emotionally involving as one could possibly anticipate from just about any film as well. The acting is all outstanding, especially three scene stealers in particular (Waltz, DiCaprio and Jackson), and the pacing (of the 165 minute movie) is exhilarating as well (It never feels slow or too long). The film is very violent and disturbing and leaves a bitter taste long after it's over but that's to be expected from such shockingly nightmarish but true subject matter. Tarantino has said he wants to do films that deal with our horrible past (that most people are too ashamed to deal with) but depict them as stylized genre films rather than 'big issue movies'. At this he definitely succeeds.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMIq71cWOY",10,3,9,3 January 2013
Get Out," Definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years!
","'GET OUT': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new horror flick from writer/director/co-producer Jordan Peele (in his directorial debut). The film is also Peele's first venture into the horror genre, as he's previously only worked in comedy (most notably on the TV shows 'KEY AND PEELE' and 'MADTV'). The story revolves around an interracial couple, that visits the estate of the wealthy white woman's parents, where things don't seem quite right there (especially for people of color). The movie has been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also received almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike. I think it's a modern horror masterpiece.Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is an aspiring photographer that's about to visit the parents of his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), for the first time. He's concerned because Rose, who's white, hasn't told her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) that Chris is black yet. Things are definitely awkward, upon meeting the girl's parents, and they only get stranger as Chris meets other people at the estate. Things especially don't seem right with the family's servants; who are both black, and they also both appear to be under some kind of possessive hypnosis. The movie is extremely creepy, and masterfully directed (almost in a classic Hitchcockian way). It's also very witty, and full of biting social commentary. It's exaggerated, but it really does make you feel what it might be like to be a person of color, in a world ran by privileged (and usually quite bigoted) white people. The performances are all good (especially Kaluuya in the lead) and I think Peele has definitely proved himself to be a very talented, and quite diverse, filmmaker. I can't wait to see what he does next, and this is definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ",10,6,17,9 March 2017
Drive," Gosling is the man with no vocabulary!
","'DRIVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Art house indie action film from director Nicolas Winding Refn (a man well known in the genre for films like 'BRONSON', 'PUSHER' and 'VALHALLA RISING'). It was written by Hossein Amini and adapted from the book of the same name by James Sallis. The book was a popular property in Hollywood and went through multiple filmmaker's and producer's hands before successfully going into production. It was star Ryan Gosling that picked Refn to direct the film because he was a fan of his earlier work and thought he'd be a good fit. The result is what many call a masterpiece and a joyous example of cinematic style and art. It's rare that an action film like this receives such high praise from critics (making it one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year) and because of it's bold character and individuality it has received the opposite approval from the viewing public, with many showing a strong dislike to the film (obviously they were expecting a different movie). I don't always do so but this time I definitely agree with the critics. The film is a wonderful example of stylish action done right. Gosling plays an unnamed mechanic who also does part time work stunt driving for major motion pictures as well as getaway driving for crooks. In his illegal ventures he always remains unknown to his business partners and only allows them five minutes to do their business before he abandons them. He's an expert at everything he does and always remains cold and calculated. He also remains distant and aloof to everyone he meets (never saying more than a couple words to anyone) except his employer at the car shop where he works Shannon (Bryan Cranston), who's also his closest friend. That all changes when he starts to get to know (and develop feelings for) a young mother, named Irene (Carey Mulligan), in the apartment complex where he lives. When her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns home from prison and puts his wife and son in jeopardy the 'driver' steps in and offers to help him out. When the job he assists him on goes bad 'driver' soon finds himself in a s--- load of trouble with some local mobsters (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) and things turn bloody really fast.The film is visually stunning and almost always pleasing to the senses in almost every way. The soundtrack and score add the perfect touch to an already extremely visceral film going experience. The violence is stunning and overly graphic but in my opinion not too distracting or unsettling; it all fits well in the context of the film. The screenplay is cleverly written and the directing of course top notch. The film is very reminiscent of classic 'grindhouse' as well as classic Hollywood 'film noir'. Gosling is decent in the lead but it's not his best work in my opinion. I'm a fan of his and know he can do much better. Here he plays the silent 'I'm too cool to acknowledge you' type that he's somewhat been type casted as in a number of films. The character is supposed to be a 'man with no name' Clint Eastwood type but to me it just came off as Gosling doing Gosling. He speaks very little in the entire film so we never really get to know his 'driver' character and the romance between he and Mulligan feels a little forced and unbelievable as a result of it as well. The routine character he does is fitting to the film though and makes for a good Hollywood tough guy even so. The rest of the cast is more than adequate in their parts and makes up a variety of distinct and unique characters. The film as a whole is a stunning piece of thrilling cinema and packed with memorable visuals. Classic action film making at it's best!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pEuD61SPG4",9,1,5,20 September 2011
Insidious," 'INSIDIOUS' is insistent horror fun!
","'INSIDIOUS': Four Stars (Out of Five) The team that brought us the original 'SAW' once again team up to bring us this creative low budget shocker. James Wan (a member of the unofficial 'Splat Pack'; a grouping of the best of modern horror filmmakers) directs and Leigh Whannell writes this supernatural thriller. The film stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye, Angus Sampson and Whannell (in a rare comedic turn) and was made for a mere $800,000! Which goes to show what you can really do with a limited budget given a lot of passion and creativity. The film is a good old fashioned creepy ghost thriller, sort of like a modern variation on 'POLTERGEIST' in many ways.'INSIDIOUS' tells the tale of the Lambert family, who recently moved into a new house. Dalton Lambert (Simpkins) is one of two brothers who falls into a coma early on in the film, for unknown reasons. His mother Renai (Byrne) keeps seeing creepy images in the house and believes it's haunted. She also thinks the things she's seeing are after her son. Her husband Josh (Wilson) is disbelieving and hides from the family's problems by staying late at the school where he works. He eventually gives in and hires a supernatural expert (Shaye) who discovers something more terrifying than either had imagined.The film, like I said, is just a good old fashioned spook fest. What Wan and Whannell pull off on such a low budget is amazing. There's no CGI here just classic horror gimmicks; clever camera motion, lighting and creepy music. They also do so with little to no blood or gore. This is their first PG-13 effort and it's just as creepy and effective as their other films. I enjoyed this much more than either of the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' flicks. The acting is adequate, the screenplay well polished (including some pretty humorous moments) and the directing top notch. If you like this sort of film you definitely won't be disappointed.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",8,6,11,1 April 2011
The Theory of Everything," Should have focused more on Hawking's passions for science and discovery!
","'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING': Four Stars (Out of Five)The Oscar contender biopic about renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and his relationship with his wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. It's based on Jane's memoir 'Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen' and focuses more on her point of view; of their lives together. The film stars Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. It costars Charlie Cox, Emily Watson, Simon McBurney and David Thewlis. It was directed by James Marsh and written by Anthony McCarten. Hawking approved of the film's production (and the finished product) and even provided his Equalizer computerized voice, for his character in the movie. I found the film to be pretty well made, and somewhat interesting, but also a tad too slow and uninvolving (in places). The story begins when Jane Wilde (Jones) first met Stephen Hawking (Redmayne) and follows their relationship, as he first finds out he has motor neuron disease. She stays with him, through the hard times, and accepts his proposal for marriage. The two have a family together as Hawking continues to pursue his dreams in physics, and eventually becomes one of the most famous physicists of all-time. The story stays focused on the couple's love for each other and doesn't stray too much into the details of Hawking's groundbreaking scientific discoveries. As a love story I thought the film was very sweet and touching; I especially like how it shows the ways in which Stephen and Jane made things work, despite their troubles; especially the ones brought about by Stephen being an atheist and Jane being a faithful Christian. Still I'm not a big fan of biopics and I had hoped a movie about one of the greatest geniuses of all-time would have focused more on his passions for science and discovery, rather than just being another routine relationship study. The performances are good though and the directing is decent. It's definitely a movie worth seeing, even if it doesn't quite deserve all of it's hype and possible (upcoming) awards recognition.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chY2PeSnCng",8,3,4,3 December 2014
Frozen," For people that grew up on movies like this it's a joy and kids will probably like it too!
","'FROZEN': Four Stars (Out of Five) Disney's most financially successful and critically acclaimed animated musical film since it's glory days in the 1990s! It's a loose adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale 'The Snow Queen' and tells the story of a queen with cryokinetic abilities who accidentally places her kingdom in a state of constant winter weather and her estranged sister who sets out to save the land and her sister. The film stars one of my favorite actresses Kristen Bell, as the voice of the heroic princess, and also features a voice cast including Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, Santino Fontana, Ciarán Hinds and Alan Tudyk. It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee and co-written by Buck, Lee and Shane Morris. I'd say it's definitely a lot better than the current crop of animated Disney films (that Pixar's not involved with) and mostly deserves it's critical praise.The film begins when Anna (Bell) and Elsa (Menzel) are children. They're princesses of Arendelle and Elsa also has the ability to freeze things. One night when they're playing together Elsa accidentally hurts Anna with her powers. Their parents take them to see magical trolls and Anna is healed but in order to protect her Anna's memories of Elsa's special abilities are erased and Elsa is forbidden from playing with her little sister anymore. After the king and queen die at sea (when the girls are much older) Elsa is made queen of Arendelle. At her coronation Anna meets Prince Hans (Fontana) and immediately falls for him. When he proposes Anna gleefully accepts but Elsa refuses to give her blessing for their wedding (due to the fact that they just met). This causes an argument which unleashes Elsa's magical powers in front of all the guests. Elsa runs away while accidentally freezing all the land. Anna sets out to find her sister in order to save her and Arendelle. She finds help in the form of a childhood snowman which comes to life, named Olaf (Gad), and a mountain man, named Kristoff (Groff), and his reindeer Sven.The film surprisingly isn't filled with the usual bad kids jokes (and lame pop culture references) Disney usually fills it's animated kids' movies with. It's actually charming, the characters are likable and the story and drama is somewhat involving. It's funny enough in an adequate way and emotional enough where it needs to be. The songs are also catchy and well done. It's got all the magical touches that used to make Disney animated films classic and Kristen Bell is wonderfully cast as a Disney princess. The movie also has a great message about family and love. For people that grew up on movies like this it's a joy and kids will probably like it too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAefz9rzS5w",8,2,6,18 December 2013
Room," Everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'!
","'ROOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed dramatic thriller flick; directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue (based on her 2010 novel, of the same name). The film is about a young mother, being held captive in a locked single-room, with her 5-year-old son. The boy has never known life, outside of the room; so his mother creates a complete alternate reality, inside the room for him. It stars Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, as the kidnapped mother and son. It also costars Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The film is predicted to be a likely Oscar contender, come awards time, and it's received almost unanimously positive reviews, from critics. I liked it.Jack (Tremblay) is five-years-old, and he's been locked in a single- room, with his mother Joy (Larson), all of his life. He's never seen the world, outside of the room, and his mother has taught him 'room' is all there is. We later learn that Joy was kidnapped when she was 17, and her captor impregnated her, with Jack, five-years earlier. As Joy becomes even more desperate, to escape, she finally enlists Jack's help, in a dangerous plan. The film is really dark and depressing, but there's also a slight bit of hope (in the darkness). Larson is fantastic in the lead, and Tremblay is also amazing (especially for an actor so young). The movie is very moving, intense and heartbreaking; it's beautifully directed by Abrahamson, and brilliantly written by Donoghue. The film is basically everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'. It's pretty hard to watch though, at times, but it's worth it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MylbbGyo_MU",9,7,14,4 January 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Should become a beloved classic.
","'THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY': Five Stars (Out of Five) Ben Stiller directs, produces and stars in this second film adaptation of James Thurber's classic short story (following the 1947 version starring Danny Kaye). The screenplay was written by Steve Conrad (who also wrote such critically acclaimed drama films as 'THE PURSUIT OF Happiness', 'THE WEATHER MAN' and 'WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY'). It's about a day-dreamer who's always dreaming of adventure and romance (often involving his new co-worker) who finally goes on a real life adventure to find a missing photograph. The film also stars Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn. I found it to be visually beautiful and emotionally breathtaking; the perfect adventure-drama film for the kid in all of us! Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a day-dreamer in his 40s who is constantly dreaming of a better and more exciting life than the one he seems like he's trapped in. He works at Life Magazine and has recently became romantically interested in his new co-worker Cheryl Melhoff (Wiig). Both their jobs are threatened though as Life Magazine is transitioning into an online magazine and will be laying off a bunch of employees soon. Mitty has worked there a long time (16 years) but his job is especially in jeopardy when he can't find a special photo that Life's photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Penn) has entrusted him with; the picture is supposed to be the cover of the last magazine. Mitty must follow clues, from other negatives, and travel around the world in order to find the missing photo (by tracking down O'Connell).I was really looking forward to this film, from seeing the amazing trailers, and I wasn't disappointed (in the slightest). Stiller has never been more likable and his direction has never been more beautiful. I like his other films ('THE CABLE GUY', 'TROPIC THUNDER', 'REALITY BITES') but this is his masterpiece. The music is moving and perfectly placed and the visuals are stunning. Most of all it's a very relatable and inspiring film (for me at least), these are my favorite movies. The fantastical dream scenes get a little too cartoonish and comedic but at least that element of the film is contained just in the day-dream sequences (which makes sense). The rest of the movie is emotionally dramatic and extremely touching and moving. I don't see anything to really complain about in it; it's a truly beautiful film and should become a beloved classic!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Q1b3lZ2TY",10,4,8,26 December 2013
A Quiet Place," Like classic M. Night Shyamalan, in the years when he used to be a really good filmmaker!
","'A QUIET PLACE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new critically acclaimed horror flick about a family of four who must live in complete silence in order to avoid being killed by creatures which hunt only by sound. It was directed by actor John Krasinski, who also co-wrote the script with Bryan Woods and Scott Beck. Krasinski also costars in the movie as well, with his wife Emily Blunt, and young actors Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also a surprise blockbuster at the Box Office (breaking all kinds of records too). Being a huge horror movie fan, I absolutely loved it. The story is set in an apocalyptic future, where the surviving humans must live in complete silence in order to avoid being hunted by predatory creatures. These creatures can only track their prey by sound. The Abbotts are a family of four, who are expecting another child very soon. They've learned to adapt to this silent way of life, after losing a young member of their family (who made a fatal mistake at the beginning of the film). Of course accidents happen, and their secure routine way of life soon comes crashing down around them. The movie is classic suspenseful horror at it's best. It's masterfully directed by Krasinski, who also delivers an emotionally charged performance in it (Blunt is equally as impressive too). What's amazing about the film though, is how much it's able to accomplish on such minimalistic storytelling efforts and production values. There's not a lot to the world that's established, including absolutely no backstory or explanation for why things are the way they are, but the film still works, and it's able to accomplish so much more because it's not held back by these routine movie making methods. I loved it, and I really like how much it reminds me of some of my favorite horror movie monster flicks, like 'SIGNS and 'THE VILLAGE'. It's like classic M. Night Shyamalan, in the years when he used to be a really good filmmaker!",10,3,10,13 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," 'Universal Soldier' meets 'The Bourne Identity'!
","'THE BOURNE LEGACY': Four Stars (Out of Five) 'UNIVERSAL SOLDIER' meets 'THE BOURNE IDENTITY'; this spin-off of the Bourne franchise finds a new star, Jeremy Renner, taking over for Matt Damon as a new character with his own story in the Bourne universe. Like the other films it's loosely based on Robert Ludlum's books and takes one book's name only (while creating it's own entirely new premise, just like the other films in the series). This one tells the story of Aaron Cross, a member of a black ops program where soldiers are given pills to enhance their physical and mental abilities. They're all assigned to be terminated due to the actions of Jason Bourne in the previous films. This installment was directed by Tony Gilroy, who co-wrote all of the previous Bourne films as well as this one (with his brother Dan Gilroy). The movie co-stars former Bourne actors Joan Allen, Albert Finney, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn as well as newcomers Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton. The movie is a little more dumbed down than the other installments but it's still packed with breathtaking action scenes and moves at a breakneck pace.Renner is Aaron Cross, a former U.S. soldier of below average intelligence who's had his physical and brain powers enhanced through a black ops program called Operation Outcome. In the operation he is known as 'Number Five' and is addicted to green pills which make him stronger and blue pills which make him smarter. If he stops taking the pills he loses all his special powers and possibly something worse. When Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, seen only in pictures) starts causing havoc and leaking government information CIA operative Eric Byer (Norton) decides to have the operation terminated and all the operatives killed. Cross escapes death and leads the CIA to believe he's dead. He then makes his way to the home of one of the Doctors in the program, Marta Shearing (Weisz), in order to get more pills. Shearing is wanted dead too so the two go on the run together. They're soon hunted down though by another government super soldier Larx-03 (Louis Ozawa Changchien), who was trained to be a relentless killing machine.The film is very similar in style and mood to the other Bourne films (with a little bit of 'UNIVERSAL SOLDIER' thrown in as well, like I said). It is involving despite it's somewhat cartoonish premise and the two lead characters are likable despite their limited character development. Weisz and Norton are both on their A game like always and Renner proves he can be a dependable action star. It would be nice to see another film or two with him in the lead (hopefully with a smarter script) and a later pairing of him and Damon would be awesome. Overall the movie works, not quite as good as the other three films but about what you'd expect from the fourth film in a series like this and a reboot to boot.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo",8,11,20,15 August 2012
22 Jump Street," Not as funny as the original movie but it still delivers the laughs.
","'22 JUMP STREET': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again team up for this buddy cop sequel, to the 2012 hit '21 JUMP STREET' (loosely based on the 80s TV show of the same name). It was once again written by Hill and Michael Bacall, this time along with Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller returned to direct the movie; they've gained a lot more celebrity status since directing the first one, for directing and co-writing 'THE LEGO MOVIE' (released earlier this year). I don't think this installment is as consistently funny (or as well made) as the original but it still has a ton of great laughs.The sequel has Officers Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) now going undercover as college students (as opposed to high school ones, like in the first movie) to catch the drug supplier of a new deadly drug called 'WHYPHY'. Also unlike the first movie Jenko is now the popular student, once again (and becomes really good at football), and Schmidt is a picked on nerd, once again. Jenko also makes friends with a jock named Zook (Wyatt Russell) while Schmidt starts to develop a romantic relationship with an art student named Mercedes (Jillian Bell). The two grow further and further apart while also blowing their case. Ice Cube, Nick Offerman, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco also reprise their roles from the first movie.The film is of course, once again, all about Schmidt and Jenko's relationship and how it's jeopardized by their new fake identities (returning to school life). Hill (like his buddy Seth Rogen) is a master at these exaggerated male (friend) relationship movies. The story is pretty predictable, and it is kind of just a rehash of the original movie, but there's still a lot of great jokes and Hill and Tatum have beautiful chemistry together (once again). People, that are looking forward to seeing a movie like this, should know to expect a male bonding (spoof) commentary with lots of silly jokes (mostly gay or 'not gay' ones). It's not as funny as the original movie but it still delivers the laughs; they're just a little more hit-and-miss this time. More hit than miss though (once again).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2f4dnLXvGI",9,1,8,18 June 2014

Another tale of the adventures of Lightning McQueen and buddy Mater in a world of all living cars and other automobiles. John Lasseter (who also directed the original and first two 'TOY STORY' films) returned to direct the film (his first time doing so since the film's predecessor five years ago) with newcomer Brad Lewis. It was written by Lasseter, Lewis, Dan Fogelman and Ben Queen. The film is only the third sequel Pixar has released (after the second and third 'TOY STORY' films) but many more are planned. This is not a good sign by the looks of 'CARS 2'. Hopefully this was just a speed bump but it was not a good film by any means and by no measure lived up to the previous standards set by the respectable studio.The film picks up with race car Lightning McQueen (once again voiced by Owen Wilson) returning home to his hometown of Radiator Springs after a successful racing trip. His best friend, the tow truck named Mater (once again voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), is overjoyed to see him. After spending a day together catching up Mater quickly becomes jealous when McQueen wants to spend time with his girlfriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt reprising her role) alone. He then gets heated up when he hears a cocky Grand Prix race car named Francesco (John Tuturro) boasting how he could easily take McQueen in any race, on TV. Mater calls up the news show and challenges the race car which leads to McQueen entering the Grand Prix and taking Mater along with him. Once there Mater becomes involved in an espionage adventure (through a classic movie mistaken identity scenario) and teams up with two spies (voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer).The film does have a positive message about friendship and being true to yourself regardless of how others treat you because of it, as well as an environmental message about alternative fuel sources, but it seems tacked on and forced. The rest of the movie is a pain to get through to get to it and not quality entertainment for anyone (of any age). I was extremely bored and annoyed by the film and I could tell most others in the theater I was seeing it in were as well. Kids were crying and being antsy and parents were moaning and constantly yawning. The film barely got any laughs or signs of positive emotion from anyone in the theater that I could tell. The magic just wasn't there like with other Pixar films. The movie is loud, clanky and simply put a mess. The characters are underwritten and the story barely holds together for it's nearly two hour running time. Nothing about the film works. It feels like a bad Saturday morning hangover. All except for the visuals, the visuals are still grade A but for the money spent on the film ($200 million) they should be a lot better. Pixar definitely has run low on gas, at least for the time being. Hopefully it can get a jump start.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHRJKrR2Lk",4,12,22,29 June 2011
Kick-Ass," Morally reprehensible, NOT!
","'KICK-ASS': Five Stars (Out of Five) This is one of those movies that you're so hyped up about after watching it that you can't wait to tell your friends and see it again! It's definitely a crowd pleas-er and seeing it with an enthusiastic overwhelmed audience only enhances the effect of the movie. The film is a darkly comedic and excessively violent superhero satire based on the popular comic book of the same name (By Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.).It tells the story of an average nerdy high schooler named Dave Lizewski (played by Aaron Johnson) who's so obsessed with comic books and super-heroes that he decides to become one. In his first attempt he's severely beaten and injured but much of his damaged body is replaced by steel implants which make him much more successful his second time out. He has no real powers but he wears a green costume and can take a serious beating. After being caught on tape and made famous to the entire world Dave, known as 'Kick-Ass' to the rest of the world, becomes an inspiration to people everywhere including a father, Damon Macready (played by a scene stealing Nicolas Cage), bent on revenge against the town mob boss (played by Mark Strong). Macready and his eleven year old daughter Mindy (played by the very impressive Chloe Moretz), whom he's trained to be a killing machine since birth, dawn superhero costumes of their own as 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' and wage a war against the local crime ring which 'Kick-Ass' is believed responsible for.The film is raunchy, hilarious, surprisingly emotionally dramatic at times and just an action packed blast to watch. It's extremely well written and directed (by Matthew Vaughn, of 'LAYER CAKE' and 'STARDUST' fame) and this is by far his best work yet. The film, like I said, is excessively violent and is probably the most violent super-hero movie ever made. It's been criticized by some for this reason but I think these critics are missing the point. The film is a great gift to comic book and super-hero fans everywhere and is already one of the most popular films ever in this genre (according to IMDb user ratings).It's one of those movies that perfectly builds tension and then releases to the utmost satisfaction to the viewer. The score is perfect, the pacing and editing is perfect and the movie just hits all the right notes for it's near 2 hour running time perfectly. It's a classic that I'm sure will be remembered and loved for many years to come and anyone who criticizes it for it's so called 'offensive content' isn't watching the movie for what it really is; an inspirational and satirical ode to comic books and super-heroes; a masterpiece in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pmr_F8e44c",10,2,7,14 October 2010
Unknown," Another kick-ass Liam Neeson action film with Liam once again in a foreign country single-handedly taking on dozens of inept bad guys!
","'UNKNOWN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another kick-ass Liam Neeson action film with Liam once again in a foreign country single-handedly taking on dozens of inept bad guys. In this one Liam plays a man who awakens from a four day coma, after a freak automobile accident, and finds another man has taken his place. No one believes who he really is, including his wife. The film was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed the popular well made horror films 'ORPHAN' and the 2005 remake of 'HOUSE OF WAX') and written by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. It's adapted from a French novel titled 'Out of My Head'. The film is an interesting and suspenseful thriller and Liam once again makes an engaging action hero lead.Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris, who's visiting Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for a biotechnology summit. As the movie opens the two arrive at their hotel when Martin realizes he forgot his briefcase at the airport. He takes a cab back to get it when the delivery truck they're following loses a refrigerator and the cab driver (Diane Kruger) drives off a bridge in order to avoid crashing into it. He survives the crash thanks to the cab driver, Gina, but falls into a coma for four days as a result of it. Upon awaking he returns to the hotel and finds another man (Aidan Quinn) is claiming to be him and even Liz goes along with the charade. Alone with no ID, money or help Martin sets out to prove his true identity and unmask the culprits as well as their motives. He finds help from a reluctant Gina and a private investigator (Bruno Ganz) but soon realizes he, as well as they, are in grave danger.The film was marketed as another no holds barred 'TAKEN' type action film but this is more of a suspense thriller and doesn't have quite as much action. The action it does have is pretty spectacular though, including some amazing car chases. Neeson doesn't do as much hand to hand combat as his other popular action role but he's still quite good and a decent action presence. The supporting cast is all more than adequate and Kruger and Jones (two of my favorites) are both stunningly beautiful like always. The story is involving and very fast paced, it's pretty unbelievable at times (including a pretty far fetched twist) but for the most part it works. The directing is nicely fitting and efficiently stylized. It might not be quite as good as some fans might have been expecting as Neeson's action followup to 'TAKEN' but it's a decent action thriller all the same.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrH0mjY9QTY",7,4,8,10 March 2011
Call Me by Your Name," Well made, but extremely slow-paced.
","'CALL ME BY YOUR NAME': Four Stars (Out of Five)A coming-of-age romantic drama from director Luca Guadagnino (who also helmed 2009's 'I AM LOVE' and 2015's 'A BIGGER SPLASH'). It's about a 17-year-old living in Italy, who begins a romantic relationship with his father's American assistant. It's based on the 2007 novel (of the same name) by Andre Aciman, and it was scripted by James Ivory. The film stars Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar and Esther Garrel. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards (including Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Actor-Drama, and Best Supporting Actor). I found it to be well made, but extremely slow-paced. Elio (Chalamet) is a 17-year-old Jewish American boy, who lives in Italy with his parents (Stuhlbarg and Casar). During the summer of 1983, his father, an archaeology professor, invites a Jewish American graduate student, named Oliver (Hammer), to come stay with the family in order to help with paperwork. Elio initially doesn't like the presence of Oliver, but he slowly becomes attracted to him. A romantic relationship between the two soon develops. 
 
I've enjoyed Guadagnino's other films, especially 'I AM LOVE', but this one I had a hard time sitting through. I appreciate that it's a coming-of-age gay love story, I think Hollywood needs more of those, but it's just so slow-paced in my opinion, and long. The acting is all good in it though, the cinematography is beautiful, and the climax is involving. It's definitely not a bad film by any measure, but you have to have a lot of patience to sit through it (I did at least).",8,1,5,10 January 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," I mostly enjoyed the film.
","'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES': Four Stars (Out of Five) The fifth film in the 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' film franchise, with Johnny Depp once again reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. In this installment Jack must locate an artifact called the Trident of Poseidon, in order to stop his old enemy Armando Salazar, and his Spanish ghost navy crew, from controlling the seas and killing every pirate on them. The film was directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, who also co-directed the 2006 western-comedy 'BANDIDAS' (starring Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz). Jerry Bruckheimer once again produced the movie, and it was written by Jeff Nathanson and Terry Rossio. It costars Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario and Javier Bardem. Kevin McNally, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley all reprise their roles from the earlier films. The movie has received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has done well at the Box Office so far (on a $230 million budget!). I think it's at least better than the last sequel.Henry Turner (Thwaites) desperately wants to break a curse that is imprisoning his father, Will Turner (Bloom). He needs an artifact called the Trident of Poseidon in order to do so. Henry believes that Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) can help him find it. At the same time Jack's old nemesis Armando Salazar (Bardem) has escaped the Devils Triangle, with his Spanish Navy ghost crew, and he's coming for Jack. An astronomer, named Carina Smyth (Scodelario), who's also looking for the artifact, joins Henry and Jack on their journey.The movie starts out promising but (like the other installments in the series) it gets overly complicated and somewhat boring in the middle. It also ends with a great climax though. Depp is once again hilarious in the lead role, but it's definitely nothing we haven't seen him do before. The movie also has some great visuals and the action scenes are somewhat exciting too. I mostly enjoyed the film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/4Bt6rG-Wb0c",8,2,6,1 June 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Way too ambitious!
","'X-MEN: APOCALYPSE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 9th film in the 'X-MEN' movie franchise; including two 'WOLVERINE' films, and a blockbuster 'DEADPOOL' flick. This chapter finds the outcast Marvel superheroes taking on an ancient mutant, named Apocalypse, and his team of four 'Horsemen'. Apocalypse was just awoken from a very long sleep, and he now wants to take over the world; by destroying all the humans. It's up to the 'X-Men to stop him. The movie was directed by Bryan Singer (who also helmed 'X-MEN', 'X2' and 'X- MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST') and it was written by Singer, Simon Kinberg, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne and Evan Peters all reprise their roles (from earlier films); while Oscar Isaac, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn, Alexandra Shipp and Kodi Smit-McPhee all join the cast. It's received less than stellar reviews from critics, but it has performed well at the Box Office (thus far). I enjoyed it, but I also found it to be kind of disappointing.En Sabah Nur (Isaac), also known as Apocalypse, was a powerful mutant in Ancient Egypt; who was betrayed by his people, and entombed alive. He awakens in 1983, and decides the world must be destroyed and rebuilt. The ancient mutant then recruits four new lieutenants, to help him; including Erik Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto (Fassbender). Erik recently lost his family in a tragic accident, so he's easily manipulated by Apocalypse. Mystique (Lawrence) discovers what happened to her old friend, Erik, and enlists the rest of the X-Men, to help her save him (and the world).I'm a big X-Men fan; I grew up reading the comic books, and I absolutely love the other Bryan Singer helmed films. Sadly, he kind of missed the mark here. It's still a good movie, but there's just way too much going on. There are so many characters, and the movie would honestly be pretty hard to follow; if you're not previously familiar with the material at all. I still enjoyed it, but it is way too ambitious. Hopefully the filmmakers can learn to minimalize what's going on, in future installments.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7RzcKeZWWA",9,3,7,2 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Extremely satisfying!
","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)Big budget sequel to 2012's 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN' (which is a reboot to director Sam Raimi's film trilogy, released in 2002 through 2007). It's once again directed by Marc Webb and stars Andrew Garfield as the popular Marvel Comics character. Garfield's real life girlfriend Emma Stone also returns as Peter Parker's main squeeze Gwen Stacey. Scenes were shot introducing Shailene Woodley as his other main love interest, from the comics, Mary Jane Watson (but they were cut in a decision to save that character for a later film). Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan and Paul Giamatti all play new villains in the movie and Sally Field, Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz return as members of the Parker family. The screenplay was written this time around by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt also co-wrote the last Spider-Man movie and Krutzman and Orci are known for co-writing lots of popular sci-fi flicks (like the first two installments in the 'STAR TREK' reboot series and 'TRANSFORMERS' franchise). This installment is meant to setup not only two more planned sequels (in the next four years) but two spinoffs as well ('VENOM' and 'SINISTER SIX'). I found it to be immensely entertaining and (being a huge fan of the characters) extremely satisfying as well! As the film opens Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man (Garfield), is taking down a Russian mobster known as Aleksei Sytsevich (Giamatti). In the process he rescues a nerdy and extremely insecure OsCorp electrical engineer, named Max Dillon (Foxx), who becomes a huge fan of his for it. This is all on his way to his own high school graduation, in which he misses his girlfriend Gwen Stacy's (Stone) speech. Due to his constant guilt, over a promise he made her dead father (Denis Leary), Gwen brakes up with him. Parker then continues to fight crime while stalking Gwen, dealing with his Aunt May (Field) constantly pestering him and further investigating what really happened to his parents. At the same time Max has an accident at OsCorp that turns him into an electrically charged supervillain and Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (DeHaan) returns to Manhattan to see his dying father (Chris Cooper). Things get really messy when Harry learns that Spider-Man's blood might be the only thing that can save him from his father's same fate.The movie has received a lot of mediocre to negative reviews from critics but has mostly been praised by comic book fans of the character. I never read the comics regularly but I've always been a big fan of the superhero (due to his relatability) and this movie is everything I would want from a Spider-Man flick (I've heard that it's the most faithful of the entire franchise as well). I thought the filmmakers did a really good job of developing each character (as well as their drama) and all the actors are great in their roles. Giamatti's villain isn't developed at all but he's not supposed to be (he's just introduced as setup for a later installment/spin off). Foxx does something comedic with his role, at first, (that's kind of reminiscent to what his former fellow castmate on 'IN LIVING COLOR', Jim Carrey, did in 'BATMAN FOREVER') but he turns into a really frightening and equally sympathetic bad guy as well. DeHaan continues to bare a striking resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio and he shows a lot of talent while doing so. It's Garfield that really shines though; he is the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he and Stone do have awesome chemistry together. Webb's direction is cool, the script is clever and well thought out and the action scenes and visual effects are to die for! I really loved Raimi's first two 'SPIDER-MAN' movies but Webb's films (so far) are equally as impressive. I can't see why any fan of the character or film franchise wouldn't be more than thrilled with this installment.

Ex Machina," A creepy sci-fi classic!
","'EX MACHINA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Popular sci-fi writer Alex Garland makes his directorial debut, with this dark thriller about artificial intelligence. Garland also wrote the screenplay (he previously wrote the scripts for '28 DAYS LATER', 'SUNSHINE', 'NEVER LET ME GO' and 'DREDD'). The film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander and Sonoya Mizuno. It tells the story of a computer programmer, selected through a company lottery, to evaluate the world's first fully functioning A.I.. The movie is a creepy sci-fi classic!Gleeson plays a 26-year-old programmer named Caleb. Caleb works for an internet company in New York, called Bluebook, and he's picked, by a random company lottery, to visit Bluebook's CEO, Nathan (Isaac). Nathan is an eccentric genius, who lives at a house, far secluded in the mountains. After Caleb makes the trek to meet him, he finds out he's also been picked to test the human qualities of a true artificial intelligence being. The A.I. also has the body of a beautiful robot woman (Vikander), who Caleb finds very attractive. The test, Caleb's involved in, becomes very fascinating and psychologically dangerous.The film is interesting, and always involving, but it's also very creepy and disturbing. The end is quite haunting and also very memorable (so is the film's score). The three leads all give decent performances (especially Isaac) and Garland makes a very impressive director, as well as an equally good writer (once again). The movie should become a sci-fi cult classic that will have people talking, and evaluating, for years to come.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP0y3MxfaMM",9,2,7,1 May 2015
Grudge Match," Rocky vs. Raging Bull: thirty some years later!
","'GRUDGE MATCH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Film icons Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro (who last appeared on screen together in 1997's 'COP LAND') star in this boxing movie about former boxing champions who decide to have one last bout together, 30 years after a tiebreaking title match was supposed to take place. The movie obviously could have been titled 'ROCKY VS. RAGING BULL: THIRTY SOME YEARS LATER', which probably would have sold more tickets. As it is it's a decent boxing comedy drama film and is about what anyone should expect going into it (No more, no less).Stallone plays Henry 'Razor' Sharp and De Niro plays Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen. They're both retired Pittsburgh boxers who each held the title and won one fight against the other. They were supposed to have a tiebreaking match thirty years earlier but Razor retired the night before the big fight. Kid has been wanting to fight Razor again ever since and when a boxing promoter named Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart), the son of the promoter who arranged Razor and Kid's earlier fights, proposes a new match between the two Kid of course jumps at the opportunity. Razor is (of course) not into the idea at all at first, largely due to the fact that Kid slept with his ex-girlfriend, Sally Rose (Kim Basinger), thirty years earlier before the cancelled bout. Due to financial difficulties Razor agrees to do the fight. Alan Arkin also co-stars in the movie as Razor's old trainer and Jon Bernthal (of 'THE WALKING DEAD' fame) plays Kid's son (and Sally's) who he never knew.The movie is full of all your usual clichés and cheesy drama but it is funny and a lot of fun. If you're not interested in seeing a boxing match between Rocky and the Raging Bull, thirty some years later, than this isn't the movie for you but I love the idea of it and got what I paid for. Stallone and De Niro are both great in the film (and looked like they had a lot of fun doing it) and the supporting cast is all decent as well. Peter Segal (who also directed films like 'TOMMY BOY', 'ANGER MANAGEMENT', '50 FIRST DATES' and 'GET SMART') does a decent job directing and the script (by Doug Ellin, Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman is adequate). Of course it's not a great film but it's not a bad one either and it's definitely a lot of fun.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gmBnRGZV8o",7,2,6,27 December 2013
Pawn Sacrifice," Zwick made a movie about chess, feel like an exciting sports flick!
","'PAWN SACRIFICE': Four Stars (Out of Five)Biographical drama flick; examining American chess champion Bobby Fischer's fight with mental illness, as he also attempted to win the 1972 World Chess Championship. It stars Tobey Maguire, as Fischer, and it costars Liev Schrieber, Peter Sarsgaard, Michael Stuhlbarg, Lily Rabe and Robin Weigert. The film was directed by Edward Zwick (who also helmed such acclaimed drama flicks as 'GLORY', 'LEGENDS OF THE FALL', 'THE LAST SAMURAI' and 'BLOOD DIAMOND') and it was written by Steven Knight, Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson. I found the film to be extremely interesting, insightful and surprisingly intense. The story follows Bobby's (Maguire) life story; beginning when he was a child (Aiden Lovekamp), and continuing all the way up to his victory, at the 1972 World Chess Championship. The film first focuses on his relationship with his mother (Weigert), and his depression/anger over the absence of his father. The filmmakers show how Bobby first got into chess, and then became obsessed with it; through his teenage years (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick). The movie also (obviously) centers on his mental illness (as an adult), and his fight to defeat Boris Spassky (Schrieber), at the Chess Championship.Maguire gives another amazing performance in this film, and it's a shame he hasn't been working nearly as much lately. The rest of the cast is decent as well, but it's totally Maguire's movie to shine in. Zwick always delivers excellent direction, and it seems as though he had a really good script to work with too. I really enjoy how much the film focuses on mental illness, and how someone who suffered with it, so severely, was still able to accomplish great things. I also like how Zwick made a movie about chess, feel like an exciting sports flick. It's definitely a movie worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/uU2Z04j5ZzE",8,2,6,2 October 2015
Magic Mike XXL," Male stripping seems like it would be an awesome job!
","'MAGIC MIKE XXL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 hit stripper flick 'MAGIC MIKE'. This one has the star, Channing Tatum, reprising the title role (one of his most popular parts); but the original's director, Steven Soderbergh, is only serving as an executive producer this time around. Gregory Jacobs, who was the first assistant director on the original movie, directs this sequel. Reid Carolin did return to write the script, but Matthew McConaughey didn't return to reprise his popular costarring role (due to money restrictions); Alex Pettyfer and Cody Horn are also absent. Actors Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Kevin Nash and Adam Rodriguez did happily reprise their parts. They're joined by newcomers Amber Heard, Jada Pinkett Smith, Elizabeth Banks, Andie MacDowell, Gabriel Iglesias, Michael Strahan and Donald Glover. I don't think it's quite as memorable a film, or as well made, as the original, but it's close. The story (if you can call it that) begins three years after the events of the original. Mike (Tatum) was recently dumped by his girlfriend (Horn, in the original), who he had planned to marry, and his business is struggling. It turns out that Mike's old stripper boss, Dallas (McConaughey, in the original), abandoned his old stripper team and started a new touring show, with Mike's old protégé, Adam (Pettyfer, in the original). So Mike's old buddies call on him, to join them for one last big performance. Mike reluctantly agrees and a chaotic road trip adventure begins (fueled by stripping, drugs and sex with older women).The movie is definitely not as magical as the original, especially without Soderbergh at the helm (and minus Matthew McConaughey), but it's still a lot of fun. Male stripping seems like it would be an awesome job, if you're good at it, and these films do a great job glamorizing it. These movies also have some amazing dance moves (especially by Tatum), some good laughs and some nice male bonding (especially in this sequel). Jacobs does a more than adequate job, trying to fill his old mentor's shoes, and the cast is fantastic. It's not quite as memorable, or as classic, as the original, but it's pretty damn close.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ke2k3oL5gSI",8,3,20,2 July 2015
Hidden Figures," Multiple really good scenes, and no bad ones!
","'HIDDEN FIGURES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed biographical comedy-drama, from director Theodore Melfi (who also helmed 2014's 'ST. VINCENT'). Melfi also co-wrote the screenplay, with first time feature screenwriter Allison Schroeder, and it's based on the book (of the same name) by Margot Lee Shetterly. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali and Glen Powell. It tells the true story of the brilliant African- American mathematician Katherine Johnson, and her two colleagues, who helped John Glenn become the first American to completely orbit the Earth (while they worked segregated at Langley). The movie has received almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it's a hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it as well.The film takes places in the 1960s; at a time when America was desperately trying to get ahead in the 'Space Race' with the Soviet Union. Katherine Johnson (Henson), and her two friends, Mary Jackson (Monae) and Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), worked at Langley; in the segregated West Area Computers division. Despite dealing with heavy racism, and the lack of true credit for their work, the three women helped John Glenn (Powell) become the first American astronaut to make a complete orbit of Earth. This movie passionately tells their little known story.The film has multiple really good scenes in it; that are extremely emotional, inspiring and quite moving. The performances are all really good; especially Henson, Monae and Costner (Costner is a great actor, he should be getting a lot more work). While the movie is really well made, and very touching, it's still just a little too Hollywood manufactured for me. Melfi is a very talented filmmaker though ('ST. VINCENT' is a really good movie as well), he just needs the studios to let him have complete creative freedom of his work. It's almost a truly great film, but not quite.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",9,3,8,11 January 2017
Coco," Something different, and fresh from Pixar and Disney!
","'COCO': Four Stars (Out of Five)Disney and Pixar's new computer-animated film about a 12-year-old music fan, despite his family's long ban on it, who accidentally enters the land of the dead, and goes on an incredible journey there. The movie was directed by Lee Unkrich (who previously helmed 'TOY STORY 3', and co-directed multiple other Pixar films), and it was co-directed by Adrian Molina. The screenplay was written by Unkrich, Molina, Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's also another big hit at the Box Office for Disney and Pixar. I found it to be visually stunning, and mostly entertaining as well. Miguel Riviera (Anthony Gonzalez) is a 12-year-old boy, who lives with his very conservative family in the small Mexican village of Santa Cecilia (a fictional village). Miguel dreams of becoming a musician, like his deceased idol Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), but music has long been forbidden in his family, due to the fact that his great-great-grandfather left their family to become a musician. When his grandmother (Renee Victor) destroys his guitar, to prevent Miguel from entering a local music contest, he breaks into a mausoleum to steal the guitar of his late idol. This causes Miguel to become a partial ghost, and enter the world of the dead. He then must team up with another ghost (Gael Garcia Bernal), that is forbidden from entering the world of the living, in order to return home. In the process of this adventure, Miguel learns a great family history lesson. The movie is definitely beautiful to look at, and the land of the dead is a great setting for a Pixar animated film (in my opinion). At least it's something different, and fresh, and the story actually has some surprise twists towards the end. The film is also mostly amusing, and it has some touching family drama, and a positive message about following your artistic dreams as well. I think as far as most animated movies go, this is definitely an above average kids film. It's worth seeing for it's visuals at the very least.",8,3,11,29 November 2017
Lincoln," It would have taken a huge miscalculation for Spielberg not to deliver a good film (given the subject matter).
","'LINCOLN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's adaptation (in part) of Doris Kearns Goodwin's 2005 book 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln'. The movie centers solely on the last four months of Lincoln's life (unlike the book) when he fought to emancipate the slaves. The screenplay was written by Tony Kushner (who also wrote the 2005 Spielberg directed film 'MUNICH'). It stars Daniel Day-Lewis as America's 16th President Abraham Lincoln (and perhaps most beloved). It co-stars Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, John Hawks and Jackie Earl Haley. The film is powerful and moving (as it should be, given it's subject matter) but it's still just a little too long and slow paced at times. Spielberg gives it his Spielberg touch though and Day-Lewis is amazing.The film begins in 1865 as the American Civil War is coming to a conclusion and President Abraham Lincoln has began his second term in office. His main objective is to pass the historical constitutional amendment which banned slavery from the United States. He fights to do this before the war ends because if peace is reached before he can pass the amendment the southern states will stop it. As Lincoln deals with trying to collect enough votes he also deals with his conscience for not ending the war earlier (which would save thousands of lives). He must decide which is more important. The film deals with one of the most important moments in the history of the United States so it would have taken a huge miscalculation for Spielberg not to deliver a good film. The subject almost guarantees an Oscar caliber film in the hands of any decent director. Some say Spielberg has lost his touch and although this film has received wide critical praise many viewers and former fans of Spielberg find it a tad boring. It is grand, visually breathtaking and monumentally epic and Spielberg does give it his usual magical touch. With that said it's also a little too long and slow paced at times. As emotionally moving as it is it seems like it could have been even more touching and powerful (given the subject matter). Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing as Lincoln though and gives one of the best performances of the year (without a doubt). The supporting cast is all exceptional as well, especially Tommy Lee Jones in my opinion. The movie may not be as classic and memorable as it could have been but it's still a great film and if you're interested in the subject matter (which almost everyone should be) you're bound to find it at least somewhat interesting and involving.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NArnnDLm6Zo",8,0,4,19 November 2012
Sing Street," John Carney's best film yet!
","'SING STREET': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another comedy-drama musical film, from writer/director John Carney (the man who also brought us 'ONCE' and 'BEGIN AGAIN'). It tells the story of a boy, growing up in Dublin (during the 1980s), who starts a band to impress a beautiful girl he likes. The film stars newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (in his film debut); and it costars Lucy Boynton, Jack Reynor, Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy. Like Carney's other films, it's received rave reviews from critics, and it's also been a hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well (like Carney's other films).The movie takes place in south inner-city Dublin, in 1985. Robert Lalor (Gillen) sets his family down, to explain that they're struggling financially. In order to save money, he's taking his youngest son, Conor (Walsh-Peelo), out of paid schooling; and he's sending him to a free state-school, called Synge Street CBS. It's a Catholic school, run by a sadistic principal (Don Wycherley). Right away Conor feels like he doesn't fit in. Then he meets a girl named Raphina (Boynton), and he immediately takes a liking to her. In order to impress Raphina, Conor tells her he's in a band. This leads Conor into making more friends, to start the band, and a journey of self-discovery begins. The movie is extremely uplifting, and inspiring; especially if you feel like you're an outsider. Like Carney's other films, the music is really catchy (and well produced) as well. The performances are all good, and the characters are almost all lovable. Carney just seems like a master, at making this type of movie; and I think this is his best one yet!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA",9,1,2,27 July 2016
Big Hero 6," There was potential here, to make a really cool movie!
","'BIG HERO 6': Three Stars (Out of Five)Walt Disney Animation Studio's first adaptation of a Marvel comic book is this 3D computer-animated film about a team of superheroes, led by a 14-year-old robotics genius and his inflatable robot sidekick. It was directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams and written by Robert L. Baird, Dan Gerson and Jordan Roberts (based on the comic book series created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau). It stars the voice talents of Ryan Potter, Scott Adsit, T. J. Miller, Génesis Rodríguez, Damon Wayans, Jr., Jamie Chung, James Cromwell, Maya Rudolph, Daniel Henney and Alan Tudyk. It's a huge hit at the Box Office and has gotten mostly positive reviews from critics and movie fans alike. As far as animated kids' movies go, I think it's a pretty good one but it's still too full of stupid kids' jokes.The story takes place in a futuristic city called San Fransokyo. Hiro (Potter) is a 14-year-old genius, who specializes in robotics and already graduated from high school. He spends most of his time, and wastes most of his talent, competing in illegal robot fights. His older brother, Tadashi (Henney), takes him to see the robotics lab at his university; in hopes it will inspire him to do something more with his skills. Hiro is especially impressed by an inflatable robot, designed to assist people with health issues (his brother created) called Baymax (Adsit). He meets the professor in charge of the school, Robert Callahan (Cromwell), and asks to join the school. Hiro then amazes everyone at a science exhibition, with his microbots project (tiny robots that combine together in multiple different forms) and is accepted to the university. Then his brother and Callahan are killed in a school fire and Hiro wants to get to the bottom of what happened, He teams up with Baymax, and his brother's friends, to do so. The five young scientists, and robot, become a superhero team. The film does feel a lot like an anime action movie and it's pretty different for a Disney film. It's great to see Walt Disney Pictures diversifying itself, and doing different things with their kids' films, but it's not different enough. While the action and visuals are cool it's still full of stupid jokes and is made to appeal mostly to grade-schoolers. It's too bad because there was potential here, to make a really cool movie, and I like the idea of Disney adapting obscure Marvel comic books (since they own the rights to them now). If they really want to make films that compare to the level that Pixar is putting out, they'll need to do a lot more though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/D17O2xOoOCw",6,2,14,21 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Surprisingly unpredictable, and filled with shocking twists!
","'STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI': Five Stars (Out of Five)The ninth installment in the 'STAR WARS' film franchise (12th counting two made for television 'EWOK' movies, and an animated film). It picks up right where 2015's 'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS' left off, and revolves around Rey teaming up with Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Finn, Poe, and others, to defend the galaxy from the First Order, and the dark side of the force. The movie was written and directed by Rian Johnson (who also helmed the critically acclaimed 2012 sci-fi hit 'LOOPER'). It stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher (in one of her final film roles), Domhnall Gleeson, Andy Serkis, Anthony Daniels and Peter Mayhew, in returning roles. While Kelly Marie Tran, Benicio del Toro and Laura Dern all join the cast. It's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to be another huge blockbuster at the Box Office as well, of course. I of course loved it! The film begins with the Rebel Alliance desperately trying to escape an attack by the First Order (in space). At the same time Rey is meeting Luke Skywalker (Hamill) for the first time, in his distant place of hiding, and he is not happy to see her (at all). Rey persistently tries to convince Luke to return with her, to aid the Resistance in their great time of need, while General Leia Organa (Fisher) is harmed in an attack, and put into a coma. Poe Dameron (Isaac) concocts his own plan to get the Alliance out of danger, against the orders of the new Admiral (Dern), and he finds help from Finn (Boyega), and a new friend named Rose (Tran). Kylo Ren (Driver) also deals with his own inner struggles, in dealing with the force (and his fate), as does Rey. The movie is surprisingly unpredictable, and filled with shocking twists. The suspense, and action scenes, are also really well done, to the extent where I was literally on the edge of my seat, throughout a good chunk of the whole movie. The humor is a little too comedic, for a 'STAR WARS' film (in my opinion), at times, but the emotional drama, and character development, is more than most fans could even ask for. There's also really effective social commentary, on corrupt government and big business, and there's even a few scenes promoting veganism, and animal rights, which I loved. Most of all, the nostalgia of the whole thing is once again breathtaking (I cried multiple times). Being a huge fan of 'STAR WARS', I was definitely more than pleased with this installment. It might not be quite as good as 'ROGUE ONE', but it's definitely one of the best films of the year, and I can't wait to see it two or three more times, in the theater!",Null,3,18,15 December 2017
Brave," It's nice to see such a strong positive female protagonist in a Pixar film!
","'BRAVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) 'BRAVE' marks many firsts for Pixar; it's the studio's first fairy tale as well as it's first film featuring a female protagonist. Pixar also completely rewrote their animation system in order to give the audience the most state-of-the-art visuals possible and the feature is the first film to use Dolby Atmos sound as well. The movie is a little darker than other Pixar films and tells the tale of a rebellious Scottish princess who accidentally brings a curse upon her family that puts her love for her mother to the ultimate test. The story is a bit like classic fairy tales from yesteryear and not nearly as dumbed down as something like Disney's 'TANGLED'. It doesn't live up to the very best of Pixar or Disney's animated films but it is better than average in my opinion. It's nice to see a slightly more mature and dark fairy tale film from the studios as well.Kelly Macdonald stars as the voice of Princess Merida, daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). At a young age Merida was given a bow by her father and has since trained to be an expert archer; to the joy of her father and the distaste of her mother. Her tomboy ways displease the Queen who would very much like her daughter to be a more ladylike Princess and this has caused conflict between the two for many years. When Elinor informs Merida that she's to be betrothed to the firstborn of one of her dad's allied clans Merida runs away and finds a witch (Julie Walters) to grant her one wish. This brings a curse to her family that will truly test the strength and willpower of Merida as well as her love for her mother.The film was written by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell and Irene Mecchi and directed by Andrews, Chapman and Purcell. It's a little slow in places but for the most part is a well made and entertaining animated film. It looks fantastic and although it wasn't quite as thrilling as it possibly could have been I appreciated that it wasn't packed with simplified childish humor. For the most part I enjoyed the story and by film's end was somewhat touched by the mother/daughter story. It was nice to see such a strong positive female protagonist in a Pixar film for a change and the message was one definitely worth teaching kids. It might be a little too dark and scary (at times) for really young children but for the most part it's a good kids film and another impressive inclusion in Pixar's resume.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",7,2,3,4 July 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," My favorite movie so far this year!
","'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY': Five Stars (Out of Five)Sci-Fi superhero flick based on the popular Marvel Comics team, of the same name. It was directed by James Gunn and written by Gunn and first time film writer Nicole Perlman. Gunn is mostly well known for directing and or writing (or co-writing) popular indie cult classics like 'SLITHER', 'SUPER' and 'TROMEO AND JULIET'; this is his first big budget blockbuster (and it was produced with a $170 million budget). It stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. John C. Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, Glen Close, Benecio Del Toro and others also play parts in the film. The story revolves around a group of misfit outlaws who attempt to keep a powerful orb out of the hands of a monstrous villain named Ronan. It's my favorite movie so far this year.Pratt plays a thief named Peter Quill. He goes by Star-Lord and travels around space hooking up with hot young alien women and stealing valuable artifacts. He was abducted from Missouri as a child, shortly after his mother died, and raised by smugglers called Ravagers. When Quill betrays Yondu Udonta (Rooker), the leader of the Ravagers, Yondu puts a bounty on him. Quill stole a valuable orb for him but doesn't deliver it. The price on his head attracts the attention of a genetically modified raccoon, named Rocket (Cooper), and his tree-like friend, named Groot (Diesel). Quill also runs into an alien assassin, named Gamora (Saldana), who wants the orb so she can keep it out of the hands of her employers, Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Ronan (Pace). When the four outlaws are captured and imprisoned, by the Nova Corps, they decide to team up to escape. They also join forces with a warrior named Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), who wants revenge on Ronan for killing his family.I found this film to be immensely entertaining; it's the type of movie I grew up on and became fascinated by filmmaking because of. It reminds me of a classic 80's sci-fi flick, in the same league as 'STAR WARS' or 'STAR TREK', and the characters are all really enjoyable. The performances are all great (especially Cooper in my opinion) and Gunn did an amazing job directing and co-writing the script. The soundtrack is perfect and it's a beautiful movie to look at too. I laughed, I cried, I was really thrilled and entertained by it; it has a little bit of everything in my opinion. I couldn't praise the movie more; it's a near perfect film. I can't wait for the sequel!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/UUizoy5DkRo",10,3,7,3 August 2014
Evil Dead," Being a huge fan it's an enormous pleasure to watch.
","'EVIL DEAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)The first five star movie of 2013 is this long awaited reboot to writer/director Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic original 'THE EVIL DEAD'. It's a loose sequel that finds a new group of young adults stumbling across the 'book of the dead', from the original trilogy, in the same cabin that iconic hero Ash and his friends did in the original two films. Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell (who played Ash) have returned as producers of the film (along with their buddy Robert G. Tapert, who produced the original three films). Raimi picked Fede Alvarez to make his feature film debut directing and co-writing the film (along with Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody). It stars Jane Levy (from TV's 'SUBURGATORY'), Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. Levy plays Mia and she's supposed to reprise the role for two more films, the last of which is supposed to link this new film series to the adventures of Ash and the original films (following a 'ARMY OF DARKNESS 2' movie). I grew up on these films and am extremely excited to see Raimi and Campbell picking the series up again and think they're off to a great start.The story picks up 30 years after the original 'THE EVIL DEAD' film ended with a new group of kids going to the same cabin so Mia (Levy) can try to detox and get over her opiate addiction. Her friends Eric (Pucci), Olivia (Lucas), Natalie (Blackmore) and brother David (Fernandez) are there as well to help her get through it. They come across the 'book of the dead' (the Naturom Demonto) from the original films, in the cellar and Eric foolishly reads from it (despite several warnings not to). He of course awakens the dead and Mia is possessed. The others originally think she's just going through withdrawals but they soon find themselves being taken over and killed off one by one as they fight the deadites for their survival.The film was made on a budget of just $17 million (which is a lot higher than the original film obviously but a pretty small budget by Hollywood standards). The filmmakers decided not to use CGI (except for touch ups) and filmed for 70 days. The results are definitely rewarding. The film really has that 'old school' classic slasher film feel to it and it's surprisingly loyal to the original films (in style). It's lacking the power of a performance like Bruce Campbell's but it is really funny and satirical (more so than the first film I think but not it's sequels). The violence and gore is out of control (It was first rated NC-17, like the original) and it really is a true hardcore horror film; it's truly exhilarating and relentless. I think the filmmakers did about as good a job as they possibly could rebooting this classic series and being a huge fan it's an enormous pleasure to watch. I have no real complaints; it's a masterpiece just like the original film and it's sequels!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0mEP_zzoQ",10,172,302,9 April 2013
The Imitation Game," I've seen too many of these Oscar-bait movies lately!
","'THE IMITATION GAME': Four Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed historical drama flick about the famous cryptanalyst Alan Turing, and his team of mathematicians, who helped end World War II by cracking Nazi Germany's Enigma code. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing and costars Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong and Charles Dance. It was directed by Morten Tyldum and written by first time feature film writer Graham Moore (based on the book 'Alan Turing: The Enigma', by Andrew Hodges). In addition to receiving mostly positive reviews from critics, the movie has also been nominated for several major awards (including five Golden Globes) and is an upcoming Oscar hopeful. The film is also yet another awards contender to be negatively criticized for it's historical inaccuracies (much like fellow critical darling 'SELMA'); most notably for exaggerating Turing's social awkwardness, downplaying his homosexuality, slandering his name in other ways (that I won't reveal here) and treating another historical figure like a villain (Commander Denniston). As with 'SELMA', I don't have a problem with the filmmakers taking many creative liberties, with their subject, but I still think it's a highly overrated movie.The film tells the story of British mathematician Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) and his special team of code-breakers; who were stationed at Hut 8 in Bletchley Park (the British code-breaking station during World War II). The group worked tirelessly to crack Germany's Enigma code and end the war. The movie centers on Turing and his odd relationships with everyone around him, as he obsessed over his important mission. It often cuts to flashbacks of him at boarding school and tells how he had to hide his homosexuality, from everyone around him (due to it being considered a great criminal offense, at the time).I've seen too many of these Oscar-bait movies lately (like this, 'SELMA', 'UNBROKEN', 'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING', etc.), as they're all starting to feel pretty corny and overly melodramatic. 2014 is definitely not one of the better years for awards contenders and this film is no exception. I found parts of it to be pretty involving and somewhat intense but then other moments seemed really forced and disingenuous. I like Cumberbatch's performance, as a brilliant but extremely inclusive social outcast, but after hearing how different the real Alan Turing was from his interpretation, I have to admit, it does take some of the emotional involvement out of the viewing experience. The supporting cast is mostly good as well but I didn't care much for Knightley's role in the film (her part is mostly historically inaccurate too and she gave a much better performance, earlier this year, in 'BEGIN AGAIN'). The movie is definitely not without it's moments but it's still pretty disappointing, considering all of the critical acclaim and awards attention it's been getting.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Wr8Cd6IYNLs",8,1,4,15 January 2015
Jurassic World," Any animal lover, like myself, will definitely love this film!
","'JURASSIC WORLD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fourth installment in the blockbuster monster flick series 'JURASSIC PARK'; which director Steven Spielberg began in 1993 (he serves as an executive producer on this movie). Successful indie filmmaker Colin Trevorrow (who also directed the 2012 quirky time traveling comedy flick 'SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED') directed and co- wrote the movie (Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Derek Connolly also worked on the screenplay). It stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Omar Sy, Jake Johnson (who also co-starred in 'SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED') and BD Wong (the only returning cast member from the original film). The story is set 22 years after the original movie, on the same island, where a new Jurassic park has been successfully operating for ten years. When scientists decide to create a new breed of dinosaur, in order to boost declining sales, things once again go disastrously wrong. The film had the biggest opening weekend of all time, making over $500 million worldwide (which is an industry first). It may not be the greatest film of all time, but it is a fun movie!Jurassic World has been a successful theme park for 10 years, but sales are starting to decline. It's up to operations manager, Claire Dearing (Howard), to boost profits again. The company's owner, and CEO, Simon Masrani (Khan), has asked the genetic scientists, working for him, to create a new breed of dinosaur; to attract more tourists. The new monster they've created isn't really a dinosaur though, and it quickly figures out a way to escape it's confinements, and wreak havoc on the park (and it's guests). Claire enlists the help of an expert Velociraptor trainer, named Owen Grady (that she once dated), to help stop the 'indominus' creature.The film is full of a lot of great monster fights and violent attacks on tourists; it's got all of the thrills, and gore, that fans are looking for. Once again the human characters aren't as interesting. Bryce Dallas Howard is really good in the lead though, which is by far the most developed character, and she actually gives one of her best performances. Chris Pratt is really funny, and very likable, as the action hero lead (and I definitely agree with all the Harrison Ford comparisons). I also really like his relationship with the Velciraptors (which is my favorite part of the movie). I think any animal lover, like myself, will definitely love this film. It's not as good as Spielberg's classic original, of course, but it is the best of the sequels and a really entertaining movie!Watch our movie review show at: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=zfYb1KqmKxo",9,17,42,15 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Damon and Blunt's chemistry on screen is pure magic!
","'THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A man challenges fate itself and it's protectors in this adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story 'Adjustment Team'. Matt Damon stars as politician David Norris and Emily Blunt co-stars as ballerina dancer Elise Sellas, the two must fight for their love when the enforcers of fate try to keep them apart (for reasons not fully explained). First time director George Nolfi wrote and directed the film (he also wrote and co-wrote the screenplays to two other Matt Damon films: 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' and 'THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM'). The movie is a fantasy / romance / thriller and it doesn't do a very good job of mixing the genres thoroughly but it does play out with a lot of enjoyment all the same.As the movie opens David Norris is a popular and very promising political figure on the verge of winning a U.S. Senate seat when he blows his lead through a highly publicized and very unpopular reunion party prank. This is when 'The Adjustment Bureau', as they call themselves, is first brought into action to clean things up. They work for a higher power (presumably God) and are what some people call angels (although they act a lot like bureaucrats). They have special powers, can teleport through magical doors and alter (as well as erase) people's minds. It's their job to make sure their boss's plan (they call him 'the Chairman') is executed. Their skills are further put to the test when Norris, by chance, continues to run into the woman of his dreams, Elise, who he's not supposed to be with. When he, by chance again, witnesses the men in action he is told of their duties and that he can never reveal them to anyone or suffer the consequence of being lobotomized. They also tell Norris he can not see the girl. Norris following his heart, passion and love of course decides to ignore their commands.The movie is as silly as it sounds and completely over the top (which is odd for a Matt Damon film) but it had a lot of potential to be something really great. The acting by Damon and Blunt is outstanding and their chemistry on screen is pure magic (one of the best cinematic relationships I've seen depicted on screen in a while). That's why I really wanted to like the movie and after a botched and cheesy scene here and another there I kept hoping it would redeem itself. The writing is a little weak and the directing is amateurish (although there are several scenes that work, all involving Damon and Blunt). The whole movie it felt like their was a great movie waiting to break free but it couldn't. Even so it's worth seeing if for nothing else than to see Damon and Blunt in action together. As a romance and a film about the power of love it definitely works.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIAZ2104LOU",7,2,4,5 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," The uninspired sequel part 347!
","'THE HANGOVER PART II': Three Stars (Out of Five) Following the likes of 'GHOSTBUSTERS II' and 'HOME ALONE 2' this sequel is an exact carbon copy of the original with mild variations for setting and time differences. It also plays on the Deja Vu 'it's happening again' formula (used by many unimpressive sequels) for shameless and forced comedic effect (like 'HOME ALONE 2'). Stu, Phil and Allan (Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis reprising the roles that made them famous) are once again completely hungover, missing a buddy and don't have a clue how they got so 'shit faced' or what happened to them. It's once again two evenings prior to one of the three's wedding except this time they're in Thailand and it's the bride's younger brother that's missing. The film plays out almost in step by step formation to the original. Tod Phillips once again directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong (replacing the original two writers). I think the writer change-up might be one of the film's biggest problems because the movie is not only unoriginal but it's not nearly as funny as it's predecessor, with many of the jokes (as well as performances) feeling forced and weak.This time around Stu is getting married to a young Asian beauty named Lauren (Jamie Chung), who's father completely disapproves of him. At Phil and Doug's (Justin Bartha also reprising his role from the original) insistence Stu invites Alan to his wedding in Thailand at the last minute. This causes problems from the get-go when Alan is immediately intimidated by Lauren's 16 year old brother Teddy (Mason Lee), feeling that he threatens his close friendships with the others. Stu doesn't want anything to jeopardize his ideal wedding so he refuses to have a bachelor party. After agreeing to one drink on the beach with his buddies though things get crazy somehow regardless.I was a huge fan of the original film, in my opinion it's a 5 star comedy classic (out of 5 stars), so I was especially disappointed with this sequel. I really wanted to like it (like many), so I didn't completely give up on it until I finished watching it. I kept really hoping it might turn itself around but it just didn't work in my opinion. It's not just the fact that it's a lazy duplicate of the original it's the fact that it's just not nearly as funny. The actors feel like they're just going through the motions again at times. I thought Helms was really funny in the original but here he's mostly just annoying. Galifianakis is funny at times but his material also feels the most forced (most of the time). Cooper is the only one that truly stays true to his original character but he's not enough. Although the film has funny moments and reaches new realms of disgusting crudeness the writing just feels uninspired. Phillips' directing would work if the material was fitting of it. The humor has just lost all it's freshness and joy. The filmmakers rely too much on the fact that most viewers are big fans of the original so they think the jokes will work just out of familiarity. They try too hard to recapture the magic of the first film when it's way too soon for that. The nostalgia feel really could have worked for a sequel ten to twenty years later, especially with the characters (and actors) being much older and being too old to be getting blackout wasted and involved in all kinds of drunk hooligan antics. That could be a hilarious sequel and now that I think about it I really hope they do that for the third chapter. Any sequel sooner than that will most likely spell DISAPPOINTMENT once again. Comparing the film to the first movie makes me want to give it something like a two out of five star rating but I know that wouldn't be fair. It's still at least slightly better than your average slapstick comedy film, just extremely disappointing.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB9HKWgqhbY",6,6,12,27 May 2011
Prisoners," Jackman should definitely see at least an Oscar nomination come awards time (so should Gyllenhaal)!
","'PRISONERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal star in this crime thriller about a father obsessed with finding his kidnapped daughter. The film co-stars Terrence Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, Viola Davis and Maria Bello. It was written by Aaron Guzikowski and directed by critically acclaimed (and award winning) Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. Mark Wahlberg (who was originally set to star in the film) produced it (he also starred in the 2012 Guzikowski penned crime thriller 'CONTRABAND'). The movie is about as intense and emotionally involving as crime dramas get and it's filled with stellar performances. It was just a tad too disturbing for me (at the time of the viewing) but worth it. Jackman stars as Keller Dover in the film. Keller is a religious family man with a wife, Grace (Bello), teenage son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and six-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). As the movie opens his family visits their neighbors, Franklin (Howard) and Nancy Birch (Davis) and their two daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons), for Thanksgiving dinner. The two six-year-old daughters run home to the Dover's house to retrieve Anna's security whistle and never return. Ralph and Eliza saw their younger siblings playing on an RV parked down the street earlier that afternoon and tell their parents this (they also noticed someone was inside it). The RV is no longer there when Keller and Franklin go looking for it. The police are alerted and Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is put on the case. They locate the RV but the kids aren't inside it and the man driving it, Alex (Dano), is mentally retarded with the IQ of a ten-year-old. Alex is arrested but later released (as Loki pursues other leads) but Keller is sure that Alex knows where his daughter is and will stop at nothing to get the information out of him. Gyllenhaal has been one of my favorite actors for several years (ever since films like 'DONNIE DARKO' in 2001 and 'MOONLIGHT MILE' in 2002). He gives one of his best performances to date here; as a cop almost as obsessed with saving the kids as Jackman's father character is. It's Jackman that gives the best performance of his career here though (I believe). He's so emotional and convincing that he should definitely see at least an Oscar nomination come awards time (so should Gyllenhaal though). The rest of the cast is all more than adequate as well but it's not just the acting that makes the movie work so well. The script is gut wrenchingly suspenseful and fast paced and the directing is equally as intense. The movie kicks into high gear once the kids are kidnapped and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's disturbing, heart breaking and very hard to watch (and I've seen a few too many of these types of films lately) but it's definitely worth it.

Silence," Definitely one of Scorsese's best!
","'SILENCE': Five Stars (Out of Five) Martin Scorsese's new historical epic, which has been a passion project of his for over 25 years! The film is adapted from the 1966 novel, of the same name, by Shusaku Endo; which has been adapted into a movie once before (in Japan, in 1971). Scorsese directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay, with Jay Cocks; who also co-wrote 'GANGS OF NEW YORK' and 'THE AGE OF INNOCENCE' (both directed by Scorsese). The story revolves around two 17th-century Jesuit priests, that travel to Japan, from Portugal, to find their missing mentor; who is reported to have renounced his faith there. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciaran Hinds. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, it was named one of the ten best movies of the year (by the American Film Institute), and it's expected to be a major Oscars contender. I think it's an absolute masterpiece.Two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Father Sebastiao Rodrigues (Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Driver), learn that their mentor, Father Cristovao Ferreira (Neeson), supposedly committed apostasy; in Japan, years earlier, after being tortured there. The two priests do not believe this information is true though, and they decide to travel to Japan to find out the real truth. Once they arrive in Japan, they learn that all Christians there have been forced to go into hiding; and many are executed if they're discovered. Rodrigues and Garupe struggle to keep their faith, while they're also put through a grueling test to renounce it.I have mixed feelings about what Scorsese is trying to say (about Catholicism) in this movie; and I'm not even completely sure what the film's true message is. Being raised a strict Catholic though, I'm fascinated by movies that deal with religion; and I think Scorsese is a very talented filmmaker at bringing them to life. The movie is always intriguing, highly involving, and breathtakingly beautiful to watch. Garfield is fantastic in the lead role, and I think his character is very sympathetic; I think almost anyone can relate to being forced to go against what you've always believed, in order to accomplish a greater good. The movie is a pure masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Scorsese's best.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",10,0,1,24 January 2017
Logan," The type of superhero movie that could finally get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture!
","'LOGAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third and final standalone Wolverine movie (and the 10th installment in the 'X-MEN' cinematic film universe); once again based on the popular Marvel Comics character, with Hugh Jackman reprising his most iconic role (for supposedly the last time). The film has an aging Wolverine traveling across a dystopian future America, in order to help a special young mutant girl. The movie also costars Patrick Stewart (reprising one of his two most iconic roles, once again, as Professor Xavier), Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Richard E. Grant and Stephen Merchant. It was directed by James Mangold (who also helmed 2013's 'THE WOLVERINE'), and it was written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green. The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office, so far, and it's received nearly unanimous positive reviews, from critics and fans alike. I enjoyed it as well. The story is set in the year 2029, when mutants are almost entirely extinct. Logan (Jackman) is now aging like a human does, due to the fact that his adamantium skeleton is now poisoning his body (and it's stopped healing him as well). He's now working as a chauffeur driver, in Texas, and helping to take care of Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart); who's suffering from a disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities. Logan is approached by a nurse (Elizabeth Rodriguez), who wants him to help transport an 11- year- old girl (Keen), with very special powers, to a place in North Dakota. Logan reluctantly agrees.The movie is surprisingly dark, and extremely dramatic. It's definitely a very serious character study, and not a fun action flick like it's predecessors. The movie is also shockingly violent; and it's the second 'X-MEN' film to be rated R, in as many years (following last year's blockbuster 'DEADPOOL'). Hugh Jackman is also fantastic in the lead, giving arguably his best performance in the role. For all of these reasons, I really respect this movie. Like I said, it's not a fun comic book flick (like some might be expecting), but it is a really well made drama film. It's actually the type of superhero movie that could finally get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but we'll have to wait and see about that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/203409666",9,4,9,9 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," It's definitely a mixed bag, but mostly entertaining and satisfying.
","'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 blockbuster superhero flick 'THE AVENGERS'; and the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Joss Whedon returned to write and direct this installment (as he did the first) and most of the cast reprises their roles; including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Bettany and Cobie Smulders. Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Hayley Atwell and others also reprise their parts from other Marvel films; while James Spader, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and Linda Cardellini join the cast. This time around the mighty superhero team must battle an artificial intelligence unit, created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, that's bent on revenge; against all of humanity. I found the film to be entertaining, and it's sure to satisfy most comic book fans, but it's definitely a mixed bag. The story revolves around an A.I. named Ultron (Spader), who comes to life as part of Tony Stark's (Downey Jr.) defense program. Ultron is bent on destroying humanity, instead of protecting it, and enlists the help of two genetically altered twins (Taylor-Johnson and Olsen). He also builds an army of deadly robots, to serve as his army. It's up to the Avengers to stop Ultron and once again save the world.The movie is all over the place; there's a lot of characters and most of them are pretty underdeveloped. We do get to learn more about Hawkeye (Renner) and Black Widow (Johansson), the two Avengers who haven't had their own movies yet, but the rest of the principal players don't have engaging story lines. Thor (Hemsworth) serves as great comic relief; but Stark's one-liners are getting very tired and poorly written. There's also some pretty badly done melodrama (throughout the movie) and an oddly placed romance between Hulk (Ruffalo) and Black Widow (What happened to Betty Ross?!). It's also never explained why Tony Stark came out of retirement and has several suits of armor again (after destroying them all in 'IRON MAN 3'). The action scenes go on for way too long (and are pretty reminiscent of 'MAN OF STEEL', or a Michael Bay 'TRANSFORMERS' film). It does have plenty of good moments too, though, and most die-hard fans will still love it; for all the geeky comic crap it does stay true to. It's just not the most well developed, or balanced, movie (as a result). The first film and some other installments, in the Marvel Universe, are better; but this film is definitely still an entertaining and mostly satisfying addition!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/kdQGbNrUAnk",9,9,23,6 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," You'd think the talented cast could have done a little more with the material.
","'HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA': Three Stars (Out of Five) Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Fran Drescher, Molly Shanon, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Chris Parnell and other comedy talents voice this computer-animated kid's monster movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (of 'SAMURAI JACK' and 'DEXTER'S LABORATORY' fame). It was written by Peter Baynham (co-writer of movies like 'BORAT' and 'BRUNO') and Robert Smigel (a long time veteran writer of 'SNL' and 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN') as well as new writers Todd Durham, Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman. The film tells the story of Dracula running a hotel for monsters, to get away from humans, and his daughter, who wants to venture out and see the world. The movie was a huge blockbuster around the world grossing $321 million on a budget of just $85 million. Despite it's immense popularity it only received lukewarm reviews from critics. I thought it was good for a kids movie of it's type but nothing spectacular. I'd put it in the same league as the animated kids monster film 'PARANORMAN'.Adam Sandler voices Dracula and Selena Gomez voices his daughter Mavis. Dracula is throwing a 118th birthday party for Mavis at his hotel and has invited monsters from all around. Monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James) and Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi) bring their families to vacation there away from the evil humans. Dracula and the rest of the monsters are afraid of humans and do their best to hide from them. So when Mavis tells Dracula she wants to travel out and see the world he freaks out and goes into overprotective father mode. Especially when a 21-year-old human (Andy Samberg) stumbles on to the castle and Mavis shows interest in him.The movie is really simplistic and uninspired in it's story structure and character development but the animation is cool and the actors are great. I don't usually enjoy kid's cartoon movies like this at all (for the problems I listed about this one) but it is funny at times thanks to the cast. Sandler and his friends do a good job of adding character and a little more flare to an otherwise pretty generic animated movie. Tartakovsky adds some nice visual style to the material as well but you'd think the talented cast could have done a little more with the material.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ",6,1,3,31 January 2013
Everest," Entertaining enough.
","'EVEREST': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Disaster flick, based on actual events; detailing the fatal attempts of two exhibition groups, to summit Mount Everest. It was directed by Baltasar Kormakur and written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy. The film stars Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Sam Worthington, John Hawkes, Emily Watson, Robin Wright and Keira Knightley. It's a slow moving, but ultimately intense, mountain climbing adventure flick; not great, but definitely worth the watch.The film takes place in 1996; and follows a very experienced mountain guide, named Rob Hall (Clarke). Gyllenhaal plays Scott Fischer; another very skilled guide, who led another group up Everest. Other climbers included a doctor named Beck Weathers (Brolin), and a mailman named Doug Hansen (Hawkes). The movie details their disastrous attempts, to reach the summit that spring (and come back down), as well as many others. The first half of the movie is extremely slow-paced, it did help me to get to know, and care for, a lot of the main characters though. The second half of the film is both suspenseful and visually spectacular (it especially looks beautiful in 3D). It's also pretty depressing; and I was surprised to learn which characters survived, and which didn't. The directing is decent, and I like most of the main cast (especially Gyllenhaal). It's not the most consistently thrilling adventure flick, but it is entertaining enough.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/NdWU81GeyN4",7,1,2,30 September 2015
Friends with Benefits," Timberlake just doesn't have the skills to hold his own with someone like Kunis!
","'FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another movie about friends trying to stay friends while involving sex in their relationship and hoping not to complicate things. This one features yet another talented and high caliber actress (Mila Kunis) coming off a critically praised film ('BLACK SWAN'), in a critically acclaimed performance, and is paired in a lowbrow 'f--- buddy' film with a much less talented actor (Justin Timberlake). This one is slightly better than Kunis's 'BLACK SWAN' costar's ('NO STRINGS ATTACHED'), despite lacking the presence of the great Natalie Portman. Kunis is great in the film and does have a certain amount of chemistry with the lightweight Timberlake but the movie as a whole is still very predictable and extremely light on laughs.Kunis and Timberlake play Jamie and Dylan, Jamie is an Executive Recruiter for a New York based job agency and Dylan is an art director for a company in Los Angeles. Both have had their fair share of failed relationships and are ready to give up on love all together. When Jamie tries to recruit Dylan for a GQ art directing job in New York City the two immediately hit it off. Dylan takes the job and the two quickly become best friends. One day while watching a romantic comedy together (starring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones) the two come up with the idea of adding sex to their relationship without any of it's romantic entanglements. This of course leads to many complications especially when they begin falling for each other.The film is directed by Will Gluck (who also directed the critically acclaimed hit 'EASY A' in 2010, and it's star Emma Stone has a cameo in this film) and it was written by Gluck, Keith Merryman, David A. Newman and Harley Peyton. It's adequately directed and the relationship aspect of the film is believable. The problem with the film is it's just not funny. Kunis has by far the most laughs and brings a lot of energy to her performance but Timberlake almost sucks all the energy out of the film at the same time. His line delivery is pretty bad and he just doesn't make a good leading man. He's been fine is supporting comedic performances but when he has to play it straight he just doesn't have the skills to hold his own with someone like Kunis. Like I said the two do have some chemistry together but it's not enough to really make the film work.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30",5,0,1,3 March 2012
War Machine," If you have Netflix, I'd definitely give it a try.
","'WAR MACHINE': Four Stars (Out of Five)   A satirical war film based on the nonfiction book 'The Operators' (by  Michael Hastings), about the firing of United States Army General  Stanley McChrystal. The movie was written and directed by David Michod  (who also helmed the 2010 critically acclaimed crime drama 'ANIMAL  KINGDOM', and the 2014 post-apocalyptic thriller 'THE ROVER'). It stars  Brad Pitt, Emory Cohen, Anthony Michael Hall, RJ Cyler, Anthony Hayes,  Topher Grace, John Magaro, Scoot McNairy, Daniel Betts, Aymen  Hamdouchi, Will Poulter, Lakeith Stanfield, Meg Tilly, Alan Ruck, Ben  Kingsley and Tilda Swinton. It was released on Netflix to mostly  positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it too.  The story is narrated by Rolling Stones reporter Sean Cullen (McNairy).  He was assigned to interview Four-star General Glen McMahon (Pitt), a  fictional character based on General Stanley McChrystal, and his men,  about their service in Afghanistan. Cullen explains how McMahon was  hired to end the war there, but instead he felt the obsessive need to  win it. This ultimately lead to his firing (sadly).  The movie is a pretty insightful look at war, and those who have to be  involved with it. Some very much love their job, like the General in  this movie, and (as the film points out) they usually mean well. The  film does a great job of making characters like that (that might be  played as villains in other movies) very sympathetic. Pitt does a great  job in the role too, and Michod is definitely a very skilled director.  I was touched by this film multiple times; and it's funny, and quite  depressing, all at the same time as well. If you have Netflix, I'd  definitely give it a try.",8,27,44,1 June 2017
Puss in Boots," Should please little kids.
","'PUSS IN BOOTS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A spin off prequel to the four 'SHREK' films focusing on the character 'Puss in Boots' (once again voiced by Antonio Banderas). Joining him in the voice cast is Salma Hayek (once again playing a love interest of Banderas's), Zach Galifianakis, Billy Bob Thornton, Amy Sedaris and Guillermo del Toro. The film was directed by Chris Miller (who also directed 'SHREK THE THIRD') and written by a team of writers including David H. Steinberg, Tom Wheeler, Jon Zack, William Davies and Brian Lynch. The movie is pretty much a waste of time in my opinion. It's nether funny nor involving in anyway as there's just not much done with the characters.The film is set several years before the first 'SHREK' film when 'Puss in Boots' was a wanted fugitive. Puss plots to steal magic beans from Jack (Thornton) and Jill (Sedaris), who are criminals, in order to clear his name. He meets up with an old female friend named Kitty Softpaws (Hayek) and his childhood friend Humpty Dumpy (Galifianakis) who betrayed him. Puss must decide if he can trust the two before agreeing to team with them. They then plot to steal the beans together, get the golden goose from the Giant's castle and clear Puss's name.I was never a big fan of the 'SHREK' films. I enjoyed the first one to a certain extent but found all of the sequels to be lacking any real entertainment value of any kind. They do seem to appeal to kids though and they're not painful to watch for adults so I'll give them some credit for that. I'd say the same thing is about true of this spin off. It probably would have been a lot more entertaining to see a 'Donkey' prequel starring Eddie Murphy but the Puss in Boot's character could have been interesting. They of course failed to make use of anything they actually had going for them with the character but the movie still should please little kids.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",5,1,5,8 March 2012
Elysium," Gives viewers something to think about and digest while enjoying the action.
","'ELYSIUM': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Neil Blomkamp's second feature (and follow-up to his immensely popular and critically acclaimed 2009 sci-fi hit 'DISTRICT 9') is yet another sci-fi action film laced with social and political commentary. Where 'DISTRICT 9' deals with social segregation and racism in South Africa this film deals with class warfare, immigration and the healthcare system in America. The film is set in a future world (2154) where the poor are forced to live on an overpopulated, disease and war stricken Earth while the rich live on a space station (called Elysium) without these problems. Blomkamp has been quoted as saying although it's set in the future it's about right now. Above all it's an awesome action movie. It stars Matt Damon as a an ex-con who's exposed to a deadly level of radiation, at his crappy job, and will stop at nothing to make his way onto Elysium in order to cure himself. It co-stars Jodie Foster and the star of 'DISTRICT 9' Sharlto Copley (who's a scene-stealer).Damon plays Max Da Costa, an ex-con who now lives in a ruined Los Angeles working a dead-end factory job. The factory is ran by CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner), who routinely visits Earth in order to make sure his company becomes profitable again. While returning to Elysium a high ranking government official, named Jessica Delacourt (Foster), asks Carlyle to write her an illegal computer program, that will allow her to override Elysium and make her the President, in return for years of defense contracting business. When Da Costa is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation (that will kill him in five days) doing a deadly job for Carlyle's company (and simply 'thrown away' by him) he wants revenge. He agrees to take a job, from a smuggler named Spider (Wagner Moura), stealing corporate information from Carlyle in exchange for a free ride to Elysium. Due to the fact that Max is deathly ill Spider has a strength enhancing exoskeleton surgically attached to Max's body (to help him do the job better). When Delacourt finds out what Spider and Max are up to she enlists an insane South African mercenary, named Kruger (Copley), to stop them. Damon is once again a great action hero (but nothing too much, in terms of acting, is required of him here). Foster makes a good despicable corporate villain as well but it's Copley that once again steals the show. He and Blomkamp make a great team and going from bumbling nerd hero (in 'DISTRICT 9') to treacherous lethal villain in this is remarkable (He was also a great scene-stealer in 'THE A-TEAM' in-between). Copley makes a classic and very memorable movie villain here and the movie overall is just great sci-fi action. The drama isn't quite as effective as it would like to be but it works. Like all great science fiction the film is a thinking man's movie and full of brilliant social commentary. Everything the movie says about society is exactly true, as well, right now (like Blomkamp says). It's only a matter of time until things turn disastrous or we do something about it. The movie delivers this message in a very effective way. I've heard people complain (as they did with 'DISTRICT 9') that the movie absorbs itself in action by the end and turns from smart to the routine. I agree but I think it's a good thing. This (like 'DISTRICT 9') is primarily an action film; Blomkamp obviously loves action and movie violence and he glorifies it in both films. It's not that he turns his films from thinking man's movies into action films it's that he makes his action films 'thinking man's movies' as well. That's a good thing! He gives viewers something to think about and digest while enjoying the action and the thrill ride. He's an awesome action film director and I love his movies. I can't wait to see what he does next!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxMJBjPRxAc",10,5,10,14 August 2013
Avatar," With an extra 9 minutes of footage in IMAX 3D, it's like a whole new movie going experience!
","'AVATAR: SPECIAL EDITION': Five Stars (Out of Five) I just saw this movie for the fifth time (including two past viewings in 2D, one of them being on Blu-ray) and I have to say seeing this 'special edition' re-release, with an extra nine minutes of footage in IMAX 3D, is like a whole new movie going experience. First of all seeing it on an IMAX 3D screen is like a spectacular new and visually stunning way of seeing a movie. It feels like the movie seriously surrounds you and you're apart of what's going on on screen! The amazing visuals and astonishing 3D of 'AVATAR' make this a once in a life time type of experience. There's also the new footage, including four entirely new scenes that add new depth and a completely new way of viewing key plot points of the film. A couple of scenes even alter the story somewhat. It was not only visually mind blowing but an entirely new way of seeing the movie as a whole.For those who don't know the movie it tells the story of a paraplegic marine named Jake Sully (Played by the now famous Sam Worthington). When Jake's twin brother is killed he's asked to take his place in an expensive military project on the alien world of Pandora, due to the fact that he has matching DNA to his brother. There he's asked to link to an 'avatar' body which is a physical body made up of a marines DNA matching that of a planet native, known as Na'vi, which is piloted mentally by the marine. His assignment is to use the 'avatar' to infiltrate the Na'vi, gain their trust and convince them to move from their land so an unnamed corporation can gain control of all the valuable mineral there. This of course draws many parallels to current and past corrupt business and military involved situations.The movie is extremely emotional and enlightening as well as the best damn visual experience ever put on film. It draws inspiration from other great films like 'RETURN OF THE JEDI', 'DANCES WITH WOLVES' and heavily from writer / director James Cameron's own classic 'ALIENS' but it's also like nothing you've ever seen before, a truly unique film going experience. Cameron is my all time favorite director (Just look at his track record: 'TERMINATOR', 'ALIENS', 'THE ABYSS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'TRUE LIES', 'TITANIC'. These are all some of my all time favorite movies!) but this in many ways far exceeds anything he's ever done before! I saw the movie once again with my friends Ed and Erika, as I did the midnight showing on it's original opening night, and they both agree it's a five star movie and one of their all time favorite films as well.The added footage is so good it does make you wonder why it was ever deleted to begin with; I get the argument that it was to shorten an overly long film (for marketing reasons) but these new scenes are much better and more important to the film than much of the footage left in the original version. James Cameron has released far superior extended versions of his films in the past (like the special editions of 'TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY', 'ALIENS' and 'THE ABYSS') and it almost seems like he saves key footage so he can release a better version later down the road, much the way it felt with director Peter Jackson special editions of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' trilogy. I do believe if you're a fan of the film this special edition is worth another visit to the theater to see, especially in IMAX 3D, and I still stand by my argument that it's one of the greatest films ever made; twice now it's been one of the best single cinematic experiences I've ever had! I think it's an important film and an astonishingly beautiful one as well and if you're a fan of film and the whole film-making process like I am than I think you have to agree. Film is the most collaborative art form there is, and that's why it's my favorite, and 'AVATAR' is arguably the greatest example of this. It's an artistic masterpiece in my opinion as well as one of the greatest films ever made.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",10,3,7,9 September 2010
Frank," Bizarrely entertaining and subtly moving.
","'FRANK': Four Stars (Out of Five)Indie comedy-drama flick about a small-time alternative pop/rock band that builds a small fan base, due to their new keyboardist's Twitter and YouTube postings (of the band). The leader of the music group is the quirky titular character Frank; who constantly wears a papier-mâché head and never reveals his face. He's based on the late comic Chris Sievey's popular character Frank Sidebottom. The film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Scoot McNairy and Michael Fassbender (in the title role). It was directed by Irish filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson and written by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. It's a really weird movie but it's also bizarrely entertaining and subtly moving (at times) as well. Gleeson plays Jon; a keyboardist who desperately wants to write songs, and be a rock star, but can't find the right motivation to do so. McNairy plays Don; the manager of a quirky unknown pop band called 'Soronprfbs'. When the keyboardist for Soronprfbs (Shane O'Brien) has a mental breakdown, and tries to drown himself, Don asks Jon to fill in for him at a concert (that night). Jon then travels to Ireland, with the band, to record an album with them. The group is filled with multiple eccentric characters; like Clara (Gyllenhaal), who seems to hate Jon, and their mentally ill lead singer Frank (Fassbender). Frank hides his true identity behind a papier-mâché head, which he never removes. Jon posts videos of the band practicing, and Twitter updates of their album's progress, which makes them a mild internet sensation and lands them their first major gig. The newfound popularity threatens to tear them apart though.The film is really dark and weird; almost to an unlikeable extent. If you can sit through the whole thing though it does finally payoff. The characters are all strangely relatable (and likable) and the movie does have a positive message about doing music just for the love of music, and not seeking out too much success or fame. The performances are all more than decent and Abrahamson seems like he was the right director to bring this bizarre story to life. If you don't mind movies that are really strange, and hard to comprehend, this film might be the right one for you.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto",8,1,3,18 September 2014
Selma," Not one of my favorite films of the year but still one of the most important.
","'SELMA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)One of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2014, and another big Oscar hopeful, is this historical drama film about the 1965 voting rights marches, led by Martin Luther King, Jr.. It was directed by Ava DuVernay (who made history this year by being the first black female director to ever be nominated for a Golden Globe award) and written by first time feature film writer Paul Webb. The movie stars David Oyelowo as King and costars Tom Wilkinson, Common, Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, Tim Roth, Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr. and many others. It's drawn controversial criticisms, from some, for being historically inaccurate in it's portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson and DuVernay was also forced to write new versions of King's speeches, for the movie, due to another film studio owning the rights to them. While the movie is not one of my favorite films of the year, I do still think it's one of the most important.The film tells the story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s (Oyelowo) three month long battle to secure equal voting rights, in 1965; alongside James Bevel (Common), Rev. Horsea Williams (Wendell Pierce), John Lewis (Stephan James) and other civil rights activists. The film details the historical march they led, from Selma to Montgomery, and the horrendous opposition they faced, from bigoted legal forces. Wilkinson plays President Johnson; who was eventually persuaded to sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as a result of their heroic actions. Critics of the film say Johnson is displayed too much as an opponent to King, when he in fact was a compassionate ally. Historians are divided on the truth to these claims.The film contains a Golden Globe award winning song, titled 'Glory' (performed by Common and John Legend), which references the current protests in Ferguson. I think the parallels drawn between the struggles of equality now, with the 60s, show how much King and other protesters were able to accomplish, while still illustrating how far we need to go today. This is why I think 'SELMA' is one of the most important movies of the year, despite it being far from perfect. Oyelowo is fantastic in the lead and Winfrey, Wilkinson and others give good performances as well; but I think actors like Ejogo and Common are a bit lacking, in their roles. At times the movie feels a little too melodramatic, and slow paced; it also doesn't quite feel like it reaches it's full emotional potential (it seems like the subject matter could have been even more moving and inspiring). I do think DuVernay did a great job directing the film but perhaps the screenplay could have used a little more fine- tuning. I don't have a problem with the possible historical inaccuracies of the story; it's an artistic interpretation of events, not a documentary, and it's impossible to say who's right or wrong in such debates. While I do think the movie could have been even better I still think it's a really well made film and one that needs to be seen, by pretty much everyone.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/fbw9P594Crc",9,4,9,16 January 2015
The Artist," A shining example of creative art and love for cinema!

It stars 'Best Actor' Academy Award nominee Jean Dujardin and 'Best Supporting Actress' nominee Berenice Bejo. The film was written and directed by Berenice's husband, 'Best Director' and 'Best Original Screenplay nominee, Michel Hazanavicius. I didn't find the film to be quite as good as all the awards and critical acclaim it's received but it's definitely a very unique and original film going experience. The film is set in 1927 Hollywood during the last great days of silent film. It focuses on one of the biggest stars of that era: (the fictional) George Valentin (Dujardin). Valentin feels his marriage, sanity and everything else he holds near and dear fall apart when he starts to become a fading star from a bygone era due to the arrival of talking films. A young rising starlet named Peppy Miller (Bejo), that he helped give a career boost to, fondly watches over him though as he continues to drift into destitution and madness. The movie is a shining example of creative art and love for cinema, in that way I definitely admire it. It's also an honest story of self-indulgence, excessive pride and depression. Not the uplifting romance some people might be expecting but a quality drama nonetheless. The directing, art design, cinematography and acting are all exceptional. Is it the best film of the year? Not by a long shot, especially when movies like 'WARRIOR' are out there, but a very good film all the same.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe8CEO75Pj0",8,2,4,4 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," It's really sad that the series was ever so popular!
","'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)I've never been a fan of the 'TWILIGHT' series; I've seen every chapter, but only so I could review them (because of their immense popularity). I've always thought the series was really poorly made, but I can handle bad movies, the thing I really despised about each film is how tasteless and morally depraved they all are. They send horrible messages to their target audience, young girls, and are extremely sexist to both women and men. The heroine, Bella (played by Kristen Stewart throughout the series), is a terrible role model for young women; she's weak, obsessive and totally dependent on men (to the point where she's suicidal if one breaks up with her). The films also kind of sends the message that every girl wants two cute guys to fight over her and all women look for in a romantic love interest is a guy that looks good (and that no other redeemable qualities are necessary). While Bella at least has some character and admirable skills the leading men in the series are both emotionless, wooden and completely lacking of any wit or charm. With that said this film does finally give viewers a heroine worth rooting for; Bella in this film is finally strong and self dependent. It does kind of send the message that a woman has to become a vampire in order to become those things though. The film is a little more entertaining than the rest but it's so full of flaws (once again) and just extreme trash filmmaking (to put it simply). It's really sad that the series was ever so popular. The film is the fifth and final installment in the franchise and is based on the second half of Stephenie Meyer's fourth book. It was directed by Bill Condon (who also directed the last film in the series) and written by Melissa Rosenberg once again (she wrote all five films and appears to be just as bad a writer as Meyers (having improved nothing on the awful books). It once again stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner as the three leads and has most of the key supporting players returning from the other films as well. In this film Bella (Stewart) has just awoken to discover her new powers as a vampire and meets her newborn daughter Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy), who is a gifted half vampire / half human creature (who ages extremely fast). She also learns that her werewolf buddy Jacob (Lautner), who used to be obsessed with her, has now dedicated his love to her baby (in order to save her from being killed by other werewolves). Bella, understandably, does not take kindly to the idea of her ex-stalker now agreeing to spend the rest of his life with her newborn baby. More problems arise when the kid is mistaken for an immortal child and the Volturi (the vampire ruling class) decides to execute her. Edward (Pattinson) and his family of vampires then raise an army of their own (from old vampire friends) to combat the Volturi.The film is more of the same cheesy dialogue, acting and atrocious romance but it does have more action than the other films. This one has a gruesome climactic battle scene that proves the motion picture rating system is a joke. If a film with as many beheadings, body burnings and other violent mutilations as this can get away with a PG-13 rating obviously any studio (with enough money) can buy the rating they want for any film. While the movie does have a somewhat cool final fight scene and a newly improved kick ass heroine it still reeks of horrible flaws. One I especially didn't like is a major plot twist at the end that feels extremely overdone, cheep and a total rip-off (but that's to be expected from a series like this). Fans of the franchise will once again eat it up and anyone else (who has to see it) will be extremely sickened.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olADa6vEcMk",3,4,8,6 December 2012
La La Land," I saw it with my parents and they loved it!
","'LA LA LAND': Five Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed romantic comedy-drama musical, from writer/director Damien Chazelle; who also performed both duties on 2014's 'WHIPLASH' (my favorite movie of that year). Â The film tells the story a jazz pianist, that falls in love with a struggling actress; while they both try to get by in Los Angeles. Â The movie stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, in their third film together playing lovers (after 'CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE' and 'GANGSTER SQUAD'), and it costars John Legend, Rosemarie DeWitt and J.K. Simmons in a cameo appearanceÂ (he won an Oscar for hisÂ performance in 'WHIPLASH'). Â On top of being almost unanimously praised by critics, it was also named one of the ten best movies of the year by the American Film Institute, and it's expected to likely win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards. Â I really enjoyed it.Â Â Â Â Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) are both strugglingÂ artists, trying to make a living (while doing what they really love) in Los Angeles. Â Sebastian is a jazz musician, who attempts to pay the bills by playing bars and parties, while Mia is an aspiring actress, who gets by serving coffee to actors on the set of a movie studio. Â The two meet, and don't immediately take a liking to each other, but eventually mutual attraction appears to grow between them. Â They then take turns supporting each other, in their different passions, while attempting to maintain a relationship.Chazelle is a drummer, who wrote 'LA LA LAND' back in 2010 (when he was still just an aspiring filmmaker). Â All three of his movies, including 2009'sÂ 'GUY AND MADELINE ON A PARK BENCH' (which is also a musical), focus heavily on jazz music. Â I think this is a very passionate subject for him, as is film, and it's because of this strong (heartfelt) passion, that his films become such great masterpieces. Â This is an old fashioned (soon to beÂ classic) musical; I saw it with my parents and they loved it. Â Because this genre of film is so rare, I think it will win Best Picture (it's definitelyÂ one of my favorites of the year). Â Gosling and Stone are both fantastic in it, and theyÂ have beautiful chemistry together (once again); the romance between their characters is both very touching and believable as well. Â It's a great film! Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_ufnweLGYJ4",10,4,8,31 December 2016
Mama," When del Toro is involved (even just as an executive producer) you know you're going to get a quality film.
","'MAMA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Guillermo del Toro executive produced this supernatural horror film about two young girls left in the forest to live on their own, with a spirit (they call 'Mama') watching over them. When they're found and go to live with their uncle, and his girlfriend, 'Mama' goes with them (causing lots of havoc of course). It stars multi Oscar nominee and 'it girl' Jessica Chastain as the 'girlfriend' watching over the girls. The film was directed and co-written by Andres Muschietti. Andres wrote the film with Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti and it's also an adaptation of a 2008 short film he wrote and directed. As far as these clichéd ghost horror films go this is a pretty entertaining one, that delivers the spooks you expect it too.The film opens with a man named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) suffering a mental breakdown, as the outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis is upon him, and he kills his business partners and wife. He takes his two young daughters for a drive, speeding down a snow covered road, and crashes in the forest. Planning to kill himself and his daughters he takes his two young girls to a cabin, in the woods, but is killed by a ghost before he can kill the children. The two girls, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse), are then raised by the mysterious spirit, which they call 'Mama'. When they're found, by a search party sent by Jeffrey's brother Lucas (also played by Coaster-Waldau), they're very animalistic (Lilly walks on all fours). After being examined by a psychiatrist (Daniel Kash) the girls are sent to live with Lucas and his punk rock girlfriend Annabel (Chastain). This becomes much more work than the couple is expecting, especially when 'Mama' begins making her presence noticed.The movie is spooky, creepy and full of great visual effects. While the film is light on actual gore, unlike a lot of other modern ghost films, you do get to see a lot of the ghost action and 'Mama' makes a pretty classic movie monster/spirit. Chastain is of course above this kind of work but her presence does make the movie that much more believable and effective. When del Toro is involved (even just as an executive producer) you know you're going to get a quality film and this one definitely delivers what fans of the genre should be expecting. I'd say It's a pretty pleasant surprise for ghost/thriller fans!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-onDgBMVyo",7,0,1,15 March 2013
Super 8," Nostalgia at it's best!
","'SUPER 8': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Nostalgia at it's best! 'SUPER 8' is a great throwback to the 80's sci-fi kids films that inspired it. Just like producer Steven Spielberg's classic flicks from that decade. Writer/director J.J. Abrams has been quoted by many to be the next Spielberg and with this film I think he definitely lives up to that representation (also following the very impressive 'STAR TREK' reboot from 2 years ago). The movie is a classic coming of age film mixed with adventure and sci-fi, much like many of the great films of the 80's like 'E.T.', 'THE GOONIES', 'EXPLORERS', etc.. The film stars a group of mostly unknown child actors like Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths (both in their film debut roles) as well as Elle Fanning, Zach Mills, Ryan Lee and Gabriel Basso. It's complete fun popcorn entertainment with equally impressive parts of alien action flick adventure and emotional coming of age drama.The movie is set in 1979 when 13 year old Joe Lamb (Courtney) just lost his mother to a work accident. It flashes forward four months to when Joe is helping his three friends make a zombie movie on Super 8 film. The director of the flick Charles (Griffiths) asks one of the most beautiful and popular girls at his school, Alice (Fanning), to star in his film because he has a crush on her (I know this move pretty well). Once filming Joe and Alice hit it off instead though, much to Charles' disappointment. While filming at a local train station the five kids witness a train wreck and capture glimpses of it on film. When people begin disappearing and strange occurrences keep occurring the kids find themselves involved in something well over their heads.The movie is whimsical and very adventurous as well as touching and full of strong character driven drama. It works best as a coming of age film, despite the cool effects and thrilling action scenes. The mystery and surprises touted in the advertisements are nothing more than a marketing gimmick. The film is pretty straight forward traditional film telling and pretty much everything you'd expect from the trailers going into it. The previews did a good job of not giving away too much of the film or revealing the monster to you but there's really no mystery here. Just a good old fashioned kids monster movie. The effects are impressive and the action scenes are well shot and edited, never showing you more than you need to see until the big payoff at the end. The drama builds at the same rate as the action though and the two climaxes occur at the same time (which is the way all great films like this should play out). Spielberg of course set the mold for films like this, Shyamalan and others have followed to great results. This is another masterpiece in the same league. It will probably disappoint those looking for something more (in the way of action and special effects) but for movie nerds like myself it fulfills everything about cinema we grew up loving.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4tG6zhJxO8",10,1,4,13 June 2011
Sinister," As far as being creepy and disturbing the movie really works!
","'SINISTER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Supernatural horror film from writer/director Scott Derrickson and starring Ethan Hawke. The film has Hawke playing a true-crime novelist who moves his family in to a house where the previous family was murdered, except the youngest girl who went missing, in hopes he'll find material for another hit novel. Derrickson directed and co-wrote the film with C. Robert Cargill. He performed the same duties on other horror films like 'HELLRAISER: INFERNO' and 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (which is one of my favorites). This film isn't quite as deep or thought provoking as 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' but it's a pretty effective and chilling horror film nonetheless.Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a true-crime novelist who had a hit book a decade earlier in which he also helped authorities solve a crime. The books he followed it with were not nearly as successful and now he's looking for another hit in the house where a family was murdered and the youngest girl went missing some months earlier. He doesn't tell his wife (Juliet Rylance) or son (Michael Hall D'Addario) and daughter (Clare Foley) what happened there. Upon moving boxes in to the attic he discovers a box left there with a projector and multiple reels of Super 8 footage inside. He discovers a recording of the family that lived there prior to them being hung from a tree on one reel and four other families being murdered on the other reels. As he investigates further in to each killing he finds they're all connected and much more as it starts to drive him mad.As far as being creepy and disturbing the movie really works. The music (by veteran composer Christopher Young) is very haunting and effective and there are several startling moments which are definitely satisfying if that's what you're looking for. Hawke dominates every scene and Derrickson's directing is stylish and fitting. Derrickson's screenplay is intriguing as well but once it gets to the supernatural elements of the story it starts to lose it's effect a little and becomes a little clichéd. I found the film much more effective and disturbing when it was just about murders that were probably arranged by some deranged lunatic rather than some form of a supernatural being. Once a film like this turns to fantasy it seems less creepy and disturbing (to me). A horror film is much scarier when it's something that could really happen. Still it has plenty of great scares and memorable scenes and it works for the most part. It is a grade A production made on a budget of just $3 million so it's an impressive achievement by any measure. Fans of horror films should more than be pleased.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qTKOxmDvq0",7,0,1,15 October 2012
Snowden," Gives some great insight into one of the most respected, and hated, political figures in U.S. history.
","'SNOWDEN': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new political thriller biopic, based on the life of Edward Snowden. It was directed and co-written (with Kieran Fitzgerald) by Oliver Stone. The script is based on the books 'The Snowden Files', by Luke Harding, and 'Time of the Octopus', by Anatoly Kucherena. It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (in the title role), Shailene Woodley, Rhys Ifans, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson, Scott Eastwood, Ben Schnetzer, Timoghty Olyphant, Logan Marshall-Green, Lakeith Lee Stanfield and Nicolas Cage. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's performed moderately well at the Box Office. I liked it, but I definitely expected a little more from it. The movie follows the life of Edward Snowden (Gordon-Levitt); from his time first serving his country (in the U.S. military), until he was labeled a traitor, by some, and a national hero, by others. We see Edward meet his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills (Woodley), and we also see them struggle through a hard relationship (which was mostly due to the troubles of his job). We see the conservative computer professional join the CIA, while profoundly loving his country, and then feel deeply betrayed by it. We then (of course) see him leak classified information, from the NSA, and distribute it to the press; becoming one of the world's most wanted (and admired) men.The film gives some great insight into the life of one of the most respected, and hated, political figures in U.S. history. I, for one, think he's a hero; and I enjoyed learning more about him. The performances are all good (especially Gordon-Levitt and Woodley), and the movie is always fascinating to watch. It does feel a little unbalanced though, and I was hoping for just a little more emotional depth; the setup is definitely there for it. The film is well made, but it's definitely not as interesting, or compelling, as the 2014 documentary about Edward Snowden 'CITIZENFOUR' (now that's a great film).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFMQ3xbt9g",8,5,11,1 October 2016
Woman in Gold," Really slow going, at first, but quite captivating by it's conclusion!
","'WOMAN IN GOLD': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) British- American drama flick starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds and directed by Simon Curtis (who also directed another historical drama flick: 'MY WEEK WITH MARILYN'). It tells the true story of a Jewish refugee, in her 80s, who battled the Austrian government for nearly a decade; to regain control of famous artwork (especially a painting of her aunt, known as the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I), which was taken from her family by the Nazis before the war. Mirren plays the Jewish refugee and Reynolds plays the young American lawyer that helped her. The film costars Daniel Bruhl, Katie Holmes, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Jonathan Pryce and Elizabeth McGovern. It was written by Alexi Kaye Campbell and based on the life stories of Maria Altmann and E. Randol Schoenberg. I found the movie to be really slow going, at first, but quite captivating by it's conclusion.Maria Altmann (Mirren) was a young Jewish woman (played by Tatiana Maslany, in her earlier years) who fled Austria, with her husband Fritz (Irons), as the Nazis were taking it over, right before World War II. Family art, including a painting of Maria's aunt, were seized by the Nazis, shortly later, and after the war the Austrian government took possession of them. The artwork became very valuable and iconic over the years (especially the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I). Maria decided, while in her 80s, to fight to get them back; due to their sentimental value, and the fact that they rightfully belonged to her. She enlisted the help of a young, and very inexperienced, lawyer named Randol Schoenberg (Reynolds).The movie is powerfully acted (especially by it's two leads) and decently directed; but the story could have played out in a much more emotionally charged and engaging way. As it is, it takes a long time to really catch the viewer's interest. Once it gets to the meat of the story, though, it's very involving stuff. By the end of the film, I was quite satisfied with it; but I can't dismiss the first 30 to 45 minutes, of rather dull material I had to sit through. It's a decent film but it could have been even better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/rxD9sln4Qkg",7,2,3,16 April 2015
Rio," Should please kids but no one else.
","'RIO': Two Stars (Out of Five) Another computer animated kids film from the director of 'ICE AGE' (and it's two sequels) Carlos Saldanha. This one tells the story of a Minnesota raised Macaw, who's afraid of flying, that's taken to Rio to mate with a female macaw in order to save their species. The film is written by Saldanha (who was born in Brazil) and six other writers and is said to be his 'dream project'. That's kind of sad considering the film isn't very good. It's beautiful to look at but it's also filled with cheap jokes and is rather boring and predictable. It should please kids but no one else.Jesse Eisenberg stars as the voice of Blu. Blu is a macaw who was born in Brazil but was captured, along with his family, by smugglers and shipped to Minnesota. The box that Blu was in fell off a shipping truck though and he was picked up by a small child named Linda, who named him. The movie then flashes forward 15 years when Blu is living with Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann) in a bookstore she owns. He still has not learned to fly but constantly attempts to teach himself. One day a Brazilian scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) comes to the door and asks to take Blu with him to Brazil in order to mate him with the last female macaw named Jewel (Anne Hathaway), in an attempt to save the species. Linda and Blu reluctantly go with Tulio to Brazil but once there Blu and Jewel are kidnapped by more smugglers.I don't usually see most animated kids films in the theater (or at all for that matter) unless they really look appealing or have gotten rave reviews (usually both). This film got decent reviews from critics and fans (not great but decent) and it also has been huge at the box office so I thought I'd give it a try. The film reminded me why I don't see most animated kids films; they're a waste of time and money (if you see them in the theater). Sure the computer animation looks beautiful but that's not enough to keep my interest and with this film I really had a hard time staying interested. I found my mind drifting a lot after witnessing repeated silly jokes and a completely uninvolving string of events (which is the movie's excuse for a story). I like Jesse Eisenberg (he's another reason I thought I might like the movie) and he does decent voice work here but all the supporting comedic players are so tired and played out (including George Lopez, Wanda Sykes, Jamie Foxx and Will i Am). The movie just has nothing of any interest or entertainment value to offer anyone over the age of ten (other than good visuals) and a decent kids film should.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk",4,5,17,20 April 2011
Love & Mercy," Really fascinating to watch!
","'LOVE & MERCY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic about iconic singer-songwriter Brian Wilson, of the Beach Boys fame, centering on two different times in his life (in the 60s and 80s). The film stars Paul Dano and John Cusack (as the legendary musician) and it costars Elizabeth Banks, Paul Giamatti, Kenny Wormald and Jake Abel. It was directed by Bill Pohlad, written by Oren Moverman and Michael A. Lerner and it features amazing score music by Atticus Ross. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews (from critics) and Wilson, himself, says the film is 'very factual'. I really enjoyed the movie as well (and I don't usually like biopics).The film begins in the 1960s, when Brian Wilson (Dano) first became a pop music sensation; then it flashes forward, about 20-years, to when Wilson had succumb to a battle with severe mental illness, and was legally bound to the obsessive guidance of a therapist, named Dr. Eugene Landy (Giamatti). The story goes back and forth, as we watch the young Wilson obsess over creating 'the greatest album ever made', and suffer from severe panic attacks. We also watch the older Wilson continue to fight mental illness, and overmedication, as he meets his second wife, a Cadillac saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Banks). Ledbetter became determined to free Wilson, from the sadistic control of Landy. The movie is really fascinating to watch, especially if you're a fan of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. Like I said, I've never been a big fan of biopics; but this movie is definitely done in a very unique and highly interesting way. Dano and Cusack are both fantastic, in the lead role (especially Dano), even though they look nothing alike (and Cusack looks nothing like Wilson). Banks and Giamatti are also equally as impressive; especially Banks (who has become one of my favorite actresses recently). Ledbetter is kind of (surprisingly) the hero of the movie. Pohlad's directing is great, and the script is outstanding; although I don't like biopics, I do love movies about mental illness. It's a very impressive film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wOi4IC8bxg",9,2,4,17 July 2015
Limitless," 'LIMITLESS' definitely has limits but still entertaining.
","'LIMITLESS': Three Stars (Out of Five) Bradley Cooper has came a long way from TV's 'ALIAS'. Here he headlines his first major motion picture, taking over a role once filled by Shia LaBeouf (who backed out of the film after hurting his arm in an automobile accident). A film with Robert De Niro playing a supporting player! As a whole the movie is entertaining but nothing great and Cooper's leading man performance is adequate but not spectacular. I think he's better in ensemble pieces like 'THE HANGOVER' and 'THE A-TEAM'. The film tells the story of a down on his luck writer who takes a secret drug which enhances the level his brain is able to function at, making him 'super smart'. It's directed by Neil Burger and written by Leslie Dixon (based on the book 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn).Cooper plays Eddie Morra, a New York City writer who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, who has also recently been seen co-starring in 'SUCKER PUNCH'). He's struggling to meet a deadline for a book he's been contracted to write when he stumbles upon his ex brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) who offers him a free sample of an unknown pharmaceutical drug called NZT. The drug provides him the ability to use a hundred percent of his brain's full capacity, as opposed to the supposed normal twenty percent, and makes him super confident. When he comes across a full stash of the drug he begins succeeding at everything he had always dreamed of. Then the side effects kick in and he discovers there are others after the drug as well that will stop at no cost to get a hold of it.The movie has an interesting premise and is played out at an amusing pace but it's full of holes and moral detachment. Without giving away too much I'll just say that if you stop to think about many details in the story they don't really make sense. There's also several things the main character does in the film that are highly morally questionable yet they're portrayed as if they're heroic actions. I also think Cooper isn't quite cut out to carry a film like this and makes the character even a little less likable. With all it's flaws the movie is still somewhat interesting and intriguing and definitely entertaining. It's a mixed bag but worth the watch.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",6,8,9,8 April 2011
Don't Breathe," About as good as horror films get!
","'DON'T BREATHE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new hit horror flick, from Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez (who also helmed the hit 2013 horror remake/reboot 'EVIL DEAD'). Alvarez directed, co-produced and co-wrote the movie (with Rodo Sayagues). Horror master Sam Raimi (who of course directed the original 'EVIL DEAD' franchise) also co-produced the flick; which stars Jane Levy, Stephen Lang, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto. Alvarez, Sayagues, Raimi and Levy all performed the same duties on the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' reboot. The film was made on a budget of just $9.9 million; and it's already made almost three times that, in it's opening weekend. It's gotten almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it was another entry in this year's 'Fantasia International Film Festival'. I think it's a masterpiece. Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto) are three young crooks; that rob wealthy customers of Alex's dad's security company. Rocky is trying to make enough money to move her, and her little sister (Emma Bercovici), away from their abusive mom (Katia Bokor). She wants to start a new (happy) life for them, in California. Alex has strong feelings for Rocky, but she's currently dating Money (who's of course an asshole). When the three friends learn of an old Army veteran (Lang), with a $300,000 cash settlement (or more) sitting in his home, the job seems too tempting to pass up. When Alex learns that the man is blind though, and that his young daughter was recently killed in a car accident, he doesn't want to go through with the heist. His feelings for Rocky (of course) motivate him into it. It's a crime that the three criminals desperately soon regret, when the blind vet starts hunting them down, and killing them, in his own (locked-up) home. The movie is about as good as horror films get; it's a soon to be classic (on a Hitchcock level standard)! I'm a big fan of the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' (and of course the original franchise), but this film is even better. The concept of a blind old Army vet, hunting down intruders in his home, is brilliant. Usually only heroes, in films, are handicapped; making it much more inspiring, when they overcome their weaknesses (through hard work and passion, of course). So to make the villain the handicapped one, who's still just as relentless (and terrifying) as any other movie 'bad guy', is really fun to watch. Especially when the protagonists are severely morally flawed, as well. I had so much fun watching this movie, and I can't wait to see it again! Lang is also amazing in it, and I think a sequel could be a lot of fun as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bmrjYaOGPmk",10,8,18,29 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Not as good as the Disney animated classic, but it is a pretty entertaining and well made update.
","'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST': Four Stars (Out of Five)Disney's live-action remake of their 1991 hit animated musical, of the same name; which was based on the eighteenth-century fairy tale, also of the same name, by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. The film tells the classic story of a woman who falls in love with the beast that imprisons her, in an enchanted French castle. It stars Emma Watson, Dan Stevens (of 2014's 'THE GUEST' fame), Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Kevin Kline, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and others. It was directed by Bill Condon (who also helmed 'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1' and '2', as well as the musical 'DREAMGIRLS'), and it was scripted by Evan Spiliotopoulos and Stephen Chbosky (who also wrote and directed 'THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER', also costarring Emma Watson). The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office so far, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I mostly enjoyed it as well.Belle (Watson) lives in the village of Villeneuve, with her father Maurice (Kline). She is harassed constantly by a popular, and extremely arrogant, former soldier named Gaston (Evans); who desperately wants to marry her. One day, on a trip to the market, Maurice gets lost in the woods and stumbles upon an old castle. He's then attacked, and imprisoned there, by a beast that lives in the castle (Stevens), for stealing a rose from the garden. When Maurice's horse rushes to Belle for help, she returns with it to the castle and offers to take her father's place, in order to free him. The Beast accepts her offer, against Maurice's wishes, and Maurice is set free. Belle slowly begins to sympathize with her captor, as she learns how he, and his staff, were transformed into a monster, and a bunch of inanimate objects, by a powerful enchantress. She also later learns, that only true love can break their curse.The 1991 animated film is one of my favorite Disney animated movies (excluding Pixar), I remember fondly when it was shockingly nominated for Best Picture (at the Academy Awards for that year). I haven't seen it in a while, so I don't remember for sure how faithful this live-action remake is, but it seems pretty faithful to me (there's a few things I noticed that were probably changed though). One of the most notable changes, to the original animated film, is the controversial inclusion of an openly gay character (played by Josh Gad in the movie). I think his character definitely makes the film more entertaining (and Gad is great in the role). I definitely can't say I enjoyed this new version as much as I remember liking the Disney animated classic, but it is a pretty entertaining and well made update.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ",8,3,8,23 March 2017
Sicario," Dark, violent, disturbing, and brilliantly made!
","'SICARIO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed crime thriller flick; directed by Denis Villeneuve (who also helmed 2013's 'PRISONERS' and 2014's 'ENEMY') and written by, actor turned writer, Taylor Sheridan. The film revolves around a naïve, and young, F.B.I. agent; that's asked to help a special government task force, take on a viscous drug cartel at the border. It stars Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Daniel Kaluuya and Victor Garber. The movie is dark, violent, disturbing, and brilliantly made!Kate Macer (Blunt) leads an F.B.I. team into a suspected kidnapping raid, on a house in Chandler, Arizona. She's stunned to find out that the house is full of dozens of dead bodies; as well as explosives, in the shed in back, which detonate and kill two officers. Her boss, Dave Jennings (Garber), then asks her to join an elite group of agents, in finding the people responsible; which includes traveling to Juarez, Mexico, and taking on cartel members there. Macer joins forces with two Department of Defense members, to do so, named Alejandro Gillick (del Toro) and Matt Graver (Brolin). She soon finds out that she's in way over her head.The film is brutally violent and gritty; it's extremely hard to watch in places, and it always keeps you on the edge of your seat. The three leads are all great in it (especially del Toro); I would have liked to have seen a little more from Blunt's character, but she does what she can with the role. Villeneuve's direction is once again superb (I love his two previous movies as well), the story is captivating (and always involving and interesting) and the pacing is intense. The film is just a grade A production, all around, and it's definitely one you don't want to miss!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/dWmLQGusjEk",9,0,4,28 October 2015
Jack Reacher," Fans of Cruise should be pleased, although this isn't one of his best films.
","'JACK REACHER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Tom Cruise stars as the title character from author Lee Child's popular book series about a former U.S. Army Military police major turned drifter investigator. This film is based on the 2005 novel 'One Shot' in which Reacher is investigating the shooting of five random strangers by an ex-military sniper he once knew. It was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (who frequently works with Cruise, having written 'VALKYRIE' as well as upcoming 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE' and 'TOP GUN' sequels). McQuarrie is a better writer than he is a director. He's written multiple films for director Bryan Singer, which have all turned out well, and has only directed one other film (2000's 'THE WAY OF THE GUN'). The film seems clever and somewhat thrilling but lacks the style of a seasoned director to really make it a worth while film noir action flick. The film opens pretty disturbingly as five apparent random strangers are shot dead in a park in Pittsburgh by a sniper at a parking garage across the river. The police find more than enough evidence to link the shootings to a former Army sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). Upon bringing the suspect in for questioning he asks for a man named Jack Reacher (Cruise). The DA (Richard Jenkins) and lead detective (David Oyelowo) investigating the case learn who Reacher is as he suddenly shows up. Reacher soon finds himself working for Barr's defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) as he discovers there's a lot more to the case than meets the eye. A lot has been said about how Cruise doesn't match the height, build or general physical description of the Jack Reacher from the books and therefore isn't a good match for the character. I haven't read any of the books and therefore had no expectations for Cruise as the character. I do know that the author and many book fans are pleased with the result of Cruise playing the popular character all the same. As far as the film goes he's definitely one of the best things about it. He always makes a good confident action hero and here he definitely delivers what he's known for. Like I said the directing and overall style and feel of the film left something to be desired but the story is interesting and for the most part involving. Fans of Cruise should be pleased; although this isn't one of his best films he still does gives them what they've grown to want and love.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMIq71cWOY",7,3,10,2 January 2013
"McFarland, USA"," Routine and clichéd, but not without it's moments.
","'MCFARLAND, USA': Three Stars (Out of Five)Disney's sports drama flick, based on a true story, about the high school coach of a Mexican-American cross country team, in a small California town in 1987. It stars Kevin Costner as the coach and was directed by Niki Caro (the director of such other critically acclaimed films as 2002's 'WHALE RIDER' and 2005's 'NORTH COUNTRY'). It was written by Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois and Grant Thompson. I found the movie to be pretty routine, and clichéd, but not without it's moments. Costner plays Jim White; a high school football coach who's forced to relocate his family to McFarland, California; after getting into trouble in Boise, Idaho (for being too rough on his players). It's a mostly Hispanic small town and Jim worries that, due to gang violence there, it might not be the safest place to raise his two daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher). He attempts to fit in, at the school, but once again gets into trouble; this time with the head football coach. After noticing what fast runners a lot of the students are, he asks the principal if he can start a cross country team. White then begins enlisting troubled, but very quick, students.The story is an inspiring underdog tale, with a lot of heart, in classic sports film tradition. Costner is great in the leading role and the supporting cast, of mostly young unknown Hispanic actors, are all good too. The directing is decent, for this type of film, as well; but I think Caro's previous work is much better. While this movie goes through all the right motions, and does what it's basically supposed to, that's also (basically) all it does; there's nothing refreshing or original to it. I also found it quite boring, at times, due to it's clichéd nature and tired overused melodrama. It's an inspiring story though and Costner is especially good in it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/IG_hW4WZgWE",6,13,27,8 April 2015
Les Misérables," If you like musicals you're almost sure to enjoy!
","'LES MISERABLES': Five Stars (Out of Five)Director Tom Hooper's British film adaptation of the immensely popular French musical play (by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michael Shonberg) from the 1980s which was adapted from the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo. It's the first time the musical play has been adapted into film form and is entirely 'sung-through' (like the play), which I wasn't expecting. It was scripted by Boblil, Shonberg, Herbert Kretzmer and William Nicholson and stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. The film contains all the songs from the play except one (although some have been shortened) and contains one new song (Oscar hopeful 'Suddenly'). The actors all did their own vocals live on set using only piano accompaniments, through earpieces, to sing to. I've never seen the musical, any other film adaptations or read the novel so I knew little about the storyline or what to expect (I have heard many of the songs multiple times before though). For me it was an interesting and awe-inspiring film-going experience that took some time to process (how I felt about it) but came to the conclusion that it's a musical masterpiece and one of the best films of the year!The film is set in 19th-century France and centers on an ex-convict named Jean Valjean (Jackman) who breaks parole in 1815, after serving a nineteen-year prison sentence for theft. He moves to a town called Montreuil-sur-Mer and becomes mayor, as well as purchases a factory. One of his employees, named Fantine (Hathaway), is fired by the foreman for having an illegitimate child, named Cosette (Isabelle Allen). She turns to a life of prostitution on the streets and grows ill. When Jean Valjean comes across her, and learns he is somewhat responsible for her condition, he vows to take care of her child (as she dies in a hospital). The rest of the film focuses on Valjean raising Cosette to adulthood (then played by Seyfried) as she falls in love with a student turned revolutionary fighter named Marius (Redmayne). Valjean is also constantly pursued by the prison guard turned police inspector who released him (Crowe) while Marius's friend Eponine (Barks, who also played the part in the 25th Anniversary Concert) deals with her rejected love for her friend.I do love musicals if they're done right. I think they're a very beautiful and artistic form of film that requires a lot of skill to do right (more so than most other film genres). A great deal of likability to a musical has to do with how good the music is though (and if the viewer likes it). So if you don't like a lot of the music in a musical you're probably not going to like the film very much either (no matter how much it might work on other levels). Here the music is about as good as it gets and the rest of the film is so beautiful to look at and acted so well (especially Hathaway, Jackman and Barks) that one almost has to give it respect. It is odd at first to see the characters singing nonstop (if you're not prepared or used to it) and some of the scenes seem to go on for too long. Also it's hard to really develop the characters well when you only get to know them through singing. Due to these flaws I wasn't sure how I completely felt about the film but I knew I was blown away by parts of it and loved the music and performances (all of the actors do a decent to excellent job singing). A lot of the time the films you have to think about for a while (and come to love more over time) are the very best ones. This is definitely a unique and wonderful film going experience.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," One of the very best films so far this year (that's for sure).
","'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The highly anticipated sequel to the blockbuster 2014 superhero flick 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY', based on the Marvel comic book of the same name. The film is once again written and directed by James Gunn, and all of the original's starring cast return as well; including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. They're joined this time around by Kurt Russell, Elizabeth Debicki, Pom Kelmentieff, Chris Sullivan and Sylvester Stallone. The story this time deals with the Guardians helping Peter Quill learn more about his father, who he meets for the first time. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (just like the first) and it's a blockbuster at the Box Office so far as well (just like the first). I loved it.The story begins in 2014, when Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord (Pratt), and his friends, are now all well known (across the cosmos) as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy'. They're hired by the Sovereign race to protect valuable batteries from a giant space monster. In exchange they're given Gamora's (Saldana) sister Nebula (Gillan); who was trying to steal the batteries for herself. Upon leaving, Rocket (Cooper) also steals some of the batteries, for no apparent reason, and the Sovereign race hunt the Guardians down for it. They crash on a planet close by, after being rescued by Peter's father Ego (Russell). The Guardians then help Quill get to know his dad, for the first time. Things are not all as they seem though.The movie is once again full of colorful characters and visuals. It's also full of witty jokes, decent performances (which are all very well cast once again), exciting action scenes, and an awesome soundtrack (featuring Brandy, by the Looking Glass, which is a karaoke song I've done hundreds of times before). The film, this time around, is not quite as original, creative, action-packed or as hilarious as the original though; it does all of those things well, but just not quite as well as the first film. It is once again filled with great character development though (including a lot of psychology and family drama), and very touching dramatic scenes; this is where this sequel actually outdoes the original (I cried more times in this movie than in it's predecessor). Gunn gives it his all once again, and he definitely delivers (it is a near perfect film). When the original is as classic as it is though, it's almost impossible to top the second time around. I still give the movie 5 stars though, and it is one of the very best films so far this year (that's for sure).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo",9,7,11,10 May 2017
In Time," Extremely disappointing considering all it had going for it!
","'IN TIME': Three Stars (Out of Five) A futuristic dystopian science fiction film that starts out with a great premise but loses all of it's creativity and originality to routine by the numbers action scenes. It's written and directed by Andrew Niccol, who also helmed the similar themed 'GATTACA' which was quite good. Niccol also wrote 'THE TRUMAN SHOW' which was a very good film as well so it's a little surprising that he handled this one so ham-handedly. The film stars Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy and Murphy is the only one who brings anything to the table. The film as a whole is very clunky and disappointing.It's set in a world where people stop aging at 25 and will die a year later if they don't earn enough currency to prolong their lives. Time is traded as money and the rich live as immortals while the poor scrape by what ever they can just to make it another day. Your remaining time is worn on your arm, in a digital readout, and scanned to pay all monetary transactions. Prices and taxes are raised all the time without warning in order to keep the weak majority at bay. Timberlake plays Will Salas, who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos and never has a full day's worth of hours. One night he helps a rich man, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), from being mugged and killed in a bar by gangsters known as the Minutemen. Hamiltion repays Salas by giving him all his remaining time, 116 years before committing suicide. He passes on some words of wisdom and lets Will know that everyone could and should live a happy natural life and then die. Will is then suspected of murdering Hamilton and goes on the run with a millionaire's daughter, Sylvia (Seyfried), he meets while flaunting his new money. The two begin robbing from the rich and giving to the poor while trying to disrupt the system and avoiding the Timekeeper (Murphy), who polices time.The idea behind the film is the perfect social commentary and is especially relevant to our times and modern economy. Life in the film isn't really that much different from modern reality. It's a shame that such a great idea was wasted though. It could have been the perfect Philip K. Dick type sci-fi film and instead we get a weak action film starring Justin Timberlake! His casting was the first way the movie went wrong but there's a lot more at fault to it than just that. Every word of dialogue seems forced and every scene seems like nothing more than the plot and action formula just pushing itself forward. There's no heart or character to it at all. Most of all the film is just disappointing, considering all it had going for it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30",6,1,2,6 March 2012
Thor," The 'God of Thunder' equals big big screen entertainment!
","'THOR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The fourth Marvel comics 'Avengers' film (following two 'IRON MAN' films and an 'INCREDIBLE HULK' flick, all leading up to the 2012 ensemble piece based on the combined team of the 'Avengers'). This one focuses on the popular comic book superhero version of the mythical Germanic paganism God known as Thor who first appeared in Marvel comics in the 60's. In this film he's played by Chris Hemsworth (probably most well known for playing James T. Kirk's dad George in the 2009 'STAR TREK' redo film). The film co-stars Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgard, Anthony Hopkins, Kat Dennings and Clark Gregg (reprising his role from the other 'Avengers' films as Agent Coulson). It's written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich and directed by none other than Kenneth Branagh. I never read the comic regularly (or much at all for that matter) but I've heard the film is a pretty faithful adaptation. As far as pure cinema goes it's grade A classic popcorn fare all around, what the big screen was made for.The film takes place on modern day Earth after Thor is banished there by his father King Odin (Hopkins). He was set to take over the throne of Asgard when creatures known as Frost Giants broke into their kingdom and attempted to steal back the Casket of Ancient Winters which Odin took from them in battle in 965 A.D.. Thor believed Asgard must retaliate, against his father's wishes, and broke the long standing truce with the Frost Giants by attacking them in their homeland. For his arrogance Odin exiled Thor to Earth and sent his magical hammer with him, placing a spell on it so that only someone worthy of it's powers could use it. Thor lands in New Mexico where he's found by three scientists including Jane Foster (Portman). The S.H.I.E.L.D. agency finds his hammer, which no one is able to remove from the ground where it lands. Thor finds himself stranded in this land while his mischievous brother Loki (Hiddleston) plots to take over the kingdom of Asgard back home.The 'Thor' comic character has been said to be the most trickiest of the 'Avengers' to adapt to the big screen, by many, and prior to seeing the film I would have agreed but after watching it I actually disagree. The story is somewhat timeless and the themes involving brother rivalry and fatherly approval are classic as well. The legend of 'Thor' and the comic story actually lend themselves to cinema form very easily and that's why the film really works. It's thrilling big spectacle entertainment and at the same time it never takes itself too seriously; it has fun with itself and plays out somewhat tongue in cheek at times. The 'fish out of water' material is played to it's ultimate comic effect and at the same time never over done. Branagh's directing is perfectly fitting and despite the number of writers used the script is well written and beautifully timed. Hemsworth is probably about as fitting an actor as the filmmakers could have found to play the title character and although his performance is nothing close to anything award worthy it's just what the film needed. The supporting cast is all more than adequate as well, especially Portman who's once again doing material that is far beneath her talents but still gives it all she's got and it's kind of fun seeing her play such a sweet giddy character with a big schoolgirl crush on the film's hero (which is pretty against type for her as of late). The movie just hits all the right notes and plays out exactly like a movie of it's type should. The perfect summer comic book action movie blockbuster, not the best of it's type but it's definitely among them.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7A8qHI10rk",9,0,2,9 May 2011
The Disaster Artist," I worry a little that the filmmaker's are exploiting Wiseau, but I think it's a mostly loving tribute.
","'THE DISASTER ARTIST': Five Stars (Out of Five)A comedy-drama biopic based on the making of Tommy Wiseau's 2003 beloved cult film 'THE ROOM', which is considered (by many) to be one of the worst movies ever made. The film was directed and co-produced by James Franco, who also stars as Wiseau. It was written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (the duo previously co-scripted such critically acclaimed hits as '500 DAYS OF SUMMER', 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', 'THE FAULT IN OUR STARS', 'PAPER TOWNS' & 'OUR SOULS AT NIGHT'). The script is based on Greg Sestero (who costarred in 'THE ROOM') and Tom Bissell's non-fiction book, of the same name. The movie also costars Dave Franco (James's brother), Seth Rogen (who also co-produced the film), Alison Brie (Dave Franco's wife), Ari Graynor, Josh Hutcherson and Jacki Weaver. There's also a load of other celebrity cameos in the movie as well (including ones by Kevin Smith and Judd Apatow, two of my favorite filmmakers). It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics (especially for Franco's performance), and a shitload of awards attention as well. I found it to be a very powerful, and well made movie! It's also pretty disturbing though. The story begins in San Francisco, in 1998, where young aspiring actor Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) meets another aspiring actor named Tommy Wiseau (James Franco). Tommy is much older than the 19-year-old Greg, and he's also very odd, eccentric and possibly mentally unstable. Greg is impressed by his passion for acting though, and the two become close friends. They then move to Los Angeles together to pursue their dreams. After failing to get cast in any major roles, the two decide to make their own movie together, 'THE ROOM', so they can cast themselves in big roles. The film then follows the whole long, bizarre process of the making of that cult classic movie. The film is a beautiful character study, of a very unique but passionate character, Tommy Wiseau, and his loving friend, Greg Sestero. The Franco brothers are both good in their roles, and Rogen is once again a fantastic scene stealer. Franco also does a really good job directing. I love the movie, because it's about having an uncontrollable passion for an art form (film in this case, and mine), and it's also about accepting people that are different, and dealing with their mental illness. The film is really disturbing, and intense to watch at times, because Wiseau's mental illness does sometimes turn abusive, and creepy. It's still always incredibly fascinating to watch though, and funny. I worry a little that the filmmaker's are exploiting Wiseau, and others involved in the making of 'THE ROOM', but I think it's mostly a loving tribute. I really enjoyed it, and I do think it's one of the year's best movies.",Null,0,2,20 December 2017
American Made," Just a hell of a lot of fun!
","'AMERICAN MADE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic based on the life of a former TWA pilot, named Barry Seal, who became a contract pilot working for the CIA, as well as a drug smuggler for the Medellin Cartel (in the 1980s), and later served as a DEA informant. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, and it costars Domhnall Gleeson and Sarah Wright. It was directed by Doug Liman (who also directed Cruise in 2014's 'EDGE OF TOMORROW'), and it was written by Gary Spinelli. The film is a modest hit at the Box Office so far, and it's also garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a highly entertaining, and pretty educational crime biopic. In the late 1970s, Barry Seal (Cruise) was a bored pilot working for TWA, and also smuggling illegal cigars into America. He's approached by a CIA operative, going by the name Monty Schaefer (Gleeson), and offered a job flying clandestine reconnaissance missions over South America. Seal is later asked to be a courier between the CIA and General Noriega, and during this time he's also asked to fly cocaine into the US (on return flights), by the Medellin Cartel. The CIA pretends not to be aware of this, and continues to employ Barry; while moving him and his family to Mena for safety. Seal continues working for the cartel, and the CIA (making tons of money), while also trying to keep his wife (Wright) and daughter happy. The movie is surprisingly entertaining, from the opening scene till the very last (and that's a pretty high compliment in my opinion). It's just a hell of a lot of fun! Cruise is amazing (like usual) in the lead, and he pretty much makes the whole movie work (on his own almost). Liman is a decent enough director too, but this movie is all about Tom Cruise (and he totally sells it). It's also amazing how he can make a character that should be pretty unlikable, in any other film, totally lovable (despite all of the immoral things he does). The movie is just a blast to watch, and that's saying a lot for a biopic (in my opinion). I usually think they're boring.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://vimeo.com/236806254",9,2,5,5 October 2017
The Witch," I can understand why the average (unintellectual) viewer wouldn't like it.
","'THE WITCH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed indie horror flick, from debut feature filmmaker Robert Eggers. It tells the story of a deeply devout Christian family, living in the wilderness (of 1630s New England), that are terrorized by a witch (and other evil forces). The movie stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw. It was made on a budget of just $3.5 million, and received rave reviews from critics (but poor reviews from theater audiences). I enjoyed it quite a bit. William (Ineson), and his family, leave the New England plantation they're staying at (in 1630), and head out to the edge of the wilderness, to start life over there. William and his wife Katherine (Dickie) have their fifth child together, named Samuel, but he immediately goes missing. Katherine blames her oldest daughter, Thomasin (Taylor-Joy), for the baby's disappearance; since she was the one watching over him at the time. More mysterious, and very creepy, things keep happening, as the family continues to turn on each other; while always trying to stay true to their faith. The movie is very purposefully slow-paced, and it works. It's always building towards something, and always digging under the viewer's skin. What Eggers does, with such a limited budget, is extremely impressive; and the cast is all great as well. The movie is very creepy, and horrifying, while never giving the viewer any cheap thrills; it's horror done right! It also has some great social commentary, on how being deeply religious can do a lot of psychological harm; to individuals and families (the Satanic Temple even enthusiastically endorsed this movie). Being raised catholic, I'm always fascinated by (well done) religious themed movies (like this). I can understand why the average (unintellectual) viewer wouldn't like it, but everyone else should be blown away!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY",9,3,10,25 February 2016
Jersey Boys," If you like musicals, and The Four Seasons, you'll probably really enjoy it.
","'JERSEY BOYS': Four Stars (Out of Five)Film adaptation of the popular (Tony Award-winning) jukebox musical (of the same name); based on the history of the 1960s pop group The Four Seasons. Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice wrote the screenplay (and the musical book it's based on) and Clint Eastwood directed the movie. John Lloyd Young reprises his role, from the musical, as Frankie Valli (and does all of his own singing). He's joined by actors Vincent Piazza, Erich Bergen and Michael Lomenda as the rest of The Four Seasons (Christopher Walken also plays a big role in the movie). I found it to be a little too long and clichéd at times but entertaining enough (especially with the great music).The story begins with the four young singers starting out as a 'boy band' in the 1950s and follows their many years of touring, recording, breakup and reunion (decades later). It focuses on the different singers struggling with family relationships, friendship drama and mafia trouble (due to large debt accrued by one member). It pays special attention to the bond between Frankie Valli (Young) and Tommy DeVito (Piazza). Different band members narrate different parts of the story (by talking directly to the camera). I've never seen the musical, and didn't really know anything about it's story (prior to seeing the film), but I've heard it's much better than this movie. As a film the story is definitely pretty cheesy and clichéd at times. It's still really entertaining though. It's hard to see why Eastwood wanted to direct it and his presence, at the helm, is hard to detect (while watching it). Still the music is beautiful and watching it come to life is pretty moving. The performances are decent enough and Walken does shine throughout. It's too long, and would be much better cut to less than 2 hours, but if you like musicals, and The Four Seasons, you'll probably really enjoy it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiVvdUZDgQc",8,11,17,25 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," If you're looking for action this isn't the movie for you but 'ZERO DARK THIRTY' is an effective and informative historical thriller.
","'ZERO DARK THIRTY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Kathryn Bigelow's much anticipated and highly controversial cinematic recreation of the events that lead to the killing of al-Quaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. It turns out that most of the political criticisms of the film are untrue and one could say that the movie plays out more like a Bush/Cheyney apologist film than the pro Obama movie that conservatives feared it would be. President Obama is never seen in the film and barely mentioned and the story seems to imply that he had very little to do with the killing of bin Laden. Ridiculous accusations that the Obama administration leaked classified information to the filmmakers have been proved false and now the movie has come under attack by liberals for what they say is glorifying torture and implying that it lead to the CIA finding bin Laden. Having seen the film I don't think it implies that at all. The film does depict some gruesome and disturbing torture scenes but it definitely doesn't glorify the method and it does show the detainee who was tortured finally giving his torturers information (after being tricked by them) but that's what happened (there's no distortion of facts). It's up to interpretation whether the torture lead to finding bin Laden in the film just as it is in life. I don't think the film has a political agenda of any kind (liberal or conservative) it's just a historical thriller that gives the viewers a lot of information about the ten year manhunt of Osama bin Laden. Maybe too much information (not because it's information that shouldn't be exposed) but because the movie is perhaps too long and very slow paced at times. Technically it's a masterpiece though and a great examination of the hunt for one of the world's most notorious terrorists.The film focuses on a CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) and begins in the year 2003. As the movie opens she's assigned to work with another agent named Dan (Jason Clarke) at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan. Her first job is in aiding him in the interrogation of a detainee named Ammar (Reda Kateb). After torturing him multiple times (and tricking him) Ammar gives them information that eventually leads them to a personal courier for Osama bin Laden named Abu Ahmed (Tushaar Mehra). Maya pursues the lead for several years (at one point being mislead into believing the man is dead) as Dan grows tired of his gruesome job and asks to be reassigned. As he leaves he asks Maya to go with him and warns her that politics are changing (under the upcoming new presidential administration) and she needs to be careful when it comes to using torture. There's also a video clip of President Obama saying torture would not be tolerated but Maya remains undeterred and continues on her obsessive hunt while surviving multiple attacks and attempts on her life. The movie builds to the infamous raid that is depicted in a surprisingly uncinematic way and actually does seem like you're watching live footage of the actual event.At first I was a little disappointed in 'ZERO DARK THIRTY'. I think I was in the wrong mood for it at the time I saw it and had a hard a time getting in to it but it's definitely a different movie than I expected. I knew it wouldn't be action packed but I did expect it to be more suspenseful and emotionally involving. The only character fully developed in the film is Maya and Jessica Chastain does a great job bringing her to life but she's kind of a cold and obsessive character and we know nothing about her other than the job at hand. So the one character we have to relate to is mostly unrelatable. Jason Clarke, Jennifer Ehle, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, Kyle Chandler and Mark Strong all do a good job of bringing a little more humanity to the film in supporting roles but their characters aren't fully explored. There's also nice cameos from James Gandolfini, Edgar Ramirez, Harold Perrineau, Frank Grillo, Mark Duplass and Scott Adkins (of all people). The movie isn't about characters though (unlike Bigelow's superior film 'THE HURT LOCKER'). It is a great in-depth and detailed look at one of the most extensive and hard fought manhunts in U.S. history though. It's long and very slow paced but it does serve it's purpose well. It doesn't use a lot of music or other traditional cinematic tools and it does have a strong documentary type feel to it. If you're looking for action this isn't the movie for you but 'ZERO DARK THIRTY' is an effective and informative historical thriller.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xLp95d1OTk",9,0,6,14 January 2013
Steve Jobs," I enjoyed 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' more, but this movie comes pretty close!
","'STEVE JOBS': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new biopic about the life, and career, of Steve Jobs; the revolutionary co-founder of Apple Inc.. The film was directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin; it's based on the 2011 biography book, of the same name, by Walter Isaacson. The movie stars Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs; and it costars Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels and Michael Stuhlbarg. It's received almost nothing but rave reviews, from critics, and it's also considered an early Oscar frontrunner; at next year's Academy Awards. I absolutely loved it!The story plays out over three acts (that are all pretty close in running length); detailing three important new product launches, in the career of Steve Jobs (Fassbender). It begins in 1984, with the introduction of the Macintosh. The film then continues through 1988, with the debut of NeXT computer. It concludes in 1998, with the launch of iMac. We experience what Jobs was going through, involving everyone around him, during these three critical times in his career. The film especially focuses on Jobs' relationship with his daughter, Lisa (played by Peria Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo and Makenzie Moss). A lot of people have compared this movie to 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' (even going as far as to call it 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK 2'), and there are a lot of definite similarities. Both films were written by Aaron Sorkin (a genius screenwriter), and both tell the story of a similarly flawed, but very gifted man; who became an iconic revolutionist, in the technological world (and the world in general). Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs are both very unlikable men; but they're also both very inspiring, and brilliant people. Both movies ask the question 'Can a great person, who accomplishes great things, also be a good, and compassionate, human being?'. The answer is obviously yes (at least in my opinion), but some would disagree; these films love to analyze that subject. I enjoyed 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' more, but this movie comes pretty close to matching it (David Fincher was even set to direct 'STEVE JOBS', at one point!). This is definitely a big improvement over the 2013 'JOBS' film (starring Ashton Kutcher). It's one of those movies that everyone needs to see; and it's definitely one of the best films of the year, without question!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/f4ptmnmXTWE",10,1,7,23 October 2015
Mudbound," Does a really good job of showing what racial relations were like at that time!
","'MUDBOUND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A period drama about two former soldiers returning home from World War II, to work on a farm in Mississippi, and each having to deal with racism and life after war in their own ways. The film was directed by Dee Rees, and it was written by Rees and Virgil Williams. It stars Garrett Hedlund, Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke, Rob Morgan, Mary J. Blige and Jonathan Banks. The movie was released by Netflix, through their streaming site, to almost unanimous rave reviews from critics. It's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well (with Blige getting the most recognition so far). I agree with all the other positive praise. The story begins in 1939 Memphis, Tennessee. Laura (Mulligan) is a 31-year-old virgin, that still lives with her parents. She's courted by her brother's boss, Henry McAllan (Clarke), and the two marry. They then have two children together, and move to a farm in Mississippi, that Henry bought. Henry's racist widowed father, Pappy (Banks), moves with them. There they meet Hap Jackson (Morgan), and his wife Florence (Blige), and the two begin working for the McAllan family. Henry's younger brother Jamie (Hedlund), and Hap's eldest son Ronsel (Mitchell), both enlist in the army, during World War II. When they return home they meet and become friends. They also both have to deal with their own personal issues, including racism and PTSD, which are enhanced by Pappy McAllan, and the other local white townspeople.The film is a really well made and detailed story, that covers a lot of different characters, with completely different stories. It does a really good job of showing what racial relations were like, for both whites and blacks at that time, and of course not all whites were bad obviously. Rees's script and direction are both excellent, and there's a number of good performance from a more than decent ensemble cast. I'd also have a really hard time saying who the main character is; Mulligan gets top billing, but she's arguably the most famous. The heart of the movie revolves around the two soldiers, and their relationship, even though that's just a portion of the whole story. I think it's a really effective movie, because of all of these different great qualities.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",9,12,20,30 November 2017
12 Years a Slave," McQueen has created a cinematic masterpiece and a film that everyone needs to see!
","'12 YEARS A SLAVE': Five Stars (Out of Five)'12 YEARS A SLAVE' is now the top contender to win Best Picture (and many other awards) at this year's Oscars. It's about a free black man, named Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841 Washington, D.C.. He spent 12 years working on Louisiana plantations before he was freed. The film is based on the 1853 autobiography, of the same name, by Solomon Northup and was written by John Ridley. It was directed by Steve McQueen and stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong'o, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Sarah Paulson and Brad Pitt (who was also one of the film's producers). The movie deserves all the critical praise and award recognition it's been getting (and will receive) and is definitely one of the year's very best films (and a must see)!The movie begins in 1841 Saratoga Springs, New York where Solomon Northup (Ejiofor, who's fantastic in the film) works as a carpenter and a very talented violin player. He has a wife (Kelsey Scott) and a young son (Cameron Zeigler) and daughter (Quvenzhané Wallis of 'BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD' fame). One day he meets two men (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) who claim to be touring musicians. They take him out drinking and offer him a high paying gig in their show. Solomon then wakes up to find himself in chains, realizing he had been drugged and sold into slavery. He spends the next twelve years working for two different plantation owners in Louisiana: William Ford (Cumberbatch) and Edwin Epps (Fassbender, who's a scene stealer and starred in McQueen's last two films as well). Northup gets along with Ford but finds himself in many confrontations with the sadistic and extremely abusive Epps. He befriends another younger female slave named Patsy (Nyong'o, who's amazing) who, despite being an excellent worker, is constantly beaten by Edwin and his wife (Paulson), due to the fact that she's the object of Mr. Epps affection (as he constantly rapes her as well).The movie is extremely depressing and hard to watch (as it should be). It does build to an overwhelmingly emotional and satisfying conclusion though. All the same many will never go near a movie like this (because of it's violent and disturbing content) but it's definitely a movie that everyone (of a certain age) should see (in America at least). Some (of the racist nature) like to complain that movies like this are exploitative and prey on white guilt, making racial relations more difficult (they say). I disagree and think important events in history should never be forgotten or ignored. They should always be examined, and looked back on, despite how painful they might be. This movie bothered me for days (as I couldn't get several scenes from it out of head), it's like a true life historical horror story and the filmmakers did an excellent job of bringing it to life. That's why I think it deserves a perfect rating; because of how powerful and memorable it is (and how much it really sticks with you and affects you, long after it's over). I'd compare it's quality to something like 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' and even say it's a little better. It deals with very similar subject matter; slavery in the US (in the 1840s) was very much like what was going on in Germany (during World War II) with Jewish people (it is an American equivalent of almost the same crimes). You don't hear nearly as many complaints about how movies about the Holocaust are exploitative (when the same type of argument could be made). McQueen has created a cinematic masterpiece (whether some want to acknowledge it or not) and a film that everyone needs to see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGndm52qI4",10,5,10,14 November 2013
Sausage Party," Rogen could have made an honestly insightful movie, with clever comedy as well!
","'SAUSAGE PARTY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The first R-rated CGI animated movie! The film comes from the vulgar minds of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir and Jonah Hill (who all co-wrote the movie); and it was directed by Greg Tiernan (a veteran director of the animated kids' TV series 'THOMAS & FRIENDS') and Conrad Vernon (who also co- directed 'SHREK 2', 'MADAGASCAR 3' and 'MONSTERS VS. ALIENS'). The film stars the voice talents of Rogen, Hill, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, Edward Norton, Bill Hader, Salma Hayek, Danny McBride, James Franco, Paul Rudd and many others. It tells the story of several sentient beings, that are food living in a grocery store. One sausage sets out to learn the truth, about their deadly fate. It's of course a raunchy adult- themed spoof, on popular CGI kids' movie blockbusters. The film's received mostly good reviews from critics, and it's also performed surprisingly well at the Box Office (although exit poll rankings haven't been that positive). I think it's somewhat clever and funny, but not nearly as much so as Rogen's, and company's, best.The food, living in Shopwell's Grocery Store, all believe that when they're purchased, they'll go to a heavenly place; and live happily ever after. This is something they've been taught, all of their short little lives. Just when a sausage, named Frank (Rogen), and his girlfriend, a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), are about to leave the store; a traumatized honey mustard bottle (McBride), who was previously bought and returned, commits suicide. This causes Frank and Brenda to fall out of their grocery cart. Frank then sets out to learn the full truth about their fate.The movie is somewhat funny, but it does seem a lot like a 'one-joke comedy'; it's a clever idea, but almost all of the jokes revolve around the same gimmick (with a lot of vulgarity thrown in as well). The animation is well done; and there is some insightful criticism on religion, and how people mostly prefer to believe what they want to believe (instead of hearing the harsh negative reality). Still, Rogen says his idea for the film was based on the concept 'what if our food had feelings'! Our food does have feelings, because most of it comes from sentient animal life! He could have made an honestly insightful movie, with clever comedy as well, about how immoral (and unhealthy) the average human diet is. Some people just need to believe what they want to believe though (like obviously Seth Rogen does); and they refuse to listen to the harsh negative reality.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",7,12,24,17 August 2016
Burlesque," Admirable effort just isn't enough to save this movie from the trashy musical that it is!
","'BURLESQUE': Two Stars (Out of Five) Over the top musical depicting the glamorous life of a burlesque club in the 70's starring the aging ex-diva Cher and the past her prime pop singer Christina Aguilera. Aguilera is better than Britney Spears and a few other pop stars turned actresses but still not leading woman material. Cher has fun with her role but is uninspired. The film is filled with a much more talented and impressive supporting cast including Kristin Bell, Stanley Tucci, Peter Gallagher, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandet and Alan Cumming (who's performance is slightly reminiscent to Joel Grey's academy award winning turn as the 'Master of Ceremonies' in 'CABARET'). The film is written and directed by Steve Antin.The story revolves around a failing burlesque club ran by an ex-dancer named Tess (Cher). The club was popular in it's heyday but is now long past it's prime and struggling to stay in business. A local successful businessman (Dane) has offered to buy the club but Tess really doesn't want to give it up. A young girl from Iowa, named Ali (Aguilera), shows up looking to escape her past and falls in love with the burlesque life. She's given a shot at dancing, much too the disappointment of the club's pampered star Nikki (Bell) and the rivalry gets even more heated when Ali shows off her amazing singing voice and breaths new life into the club.The film is full of big numbers and lavish costumes and set designs but it really doesn't live up to it's promise of a big brash musical. The dialogue is intentionally funny and clever at times but also unintentionally laughable at others and the drama is a joke. The songs are mediocre at best although Aguilera does have a more than decent singing voice. Bell is great as the bitchy villainess and it's nice to see her breaking her type cast and getting away from the goody tushu princesses she usually plays. Although the movie probably would have been much better if her and Aguilera had switched roles. Tucci and Cumming are great as well as the rest of the supporting cast but their admirable effort just isn't enough to save this movie from the trashy musical that it is.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8",4,0,2,26 January 2011
Edge of Tomorrow," Definitely one of the best movies of the year, so of course it's one of the least successful!
","'EDGE OF TOMORROW': Five Stars (Out of Five) Tom Cruise stars in this big budget sci-fi action flick based on the Japanese 'young-adult book' (referred to as a 'light novel' in Japan) 'All You Need Is Kill', by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. It was directed by Doug Liman (who's also directed such hit movies as 'SWINGERS', 'GO', 'THE BOURNE IDENTITY', 'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' and 'JUMPER') and written by Christopher McQuarrie and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth; the Butterworths also wrote the 2010 political thriller 'FAIR GAME' (which Liman also directed). McQuarrie previously worked with Cruise on 'VALKYRIE' (which he co-wrote) and 'JACK REACHER' (which he wrote and directed). This movie also stars Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson and Noah Taylor. It's a clever and fun thrill ride that's as much a thinking man's action film as an effects filled alien/war flick.The story begins five years into a war with an invading alien species called Mimics. The Mimics are winning and about to take control of Continental Europe as the United Defense Forces, UDF (combined NATO armies), introduces a new weapon to their soldiers called 'Jackets'. 'Jackets' are mechanized exoskeleton body armor; which one soldier, Rita Vrataski (Blunt), used to kill hundreds of Mimics at Verdun (giving her the nickname 'Angel of Verdun'). A UDF spokesman, named Major William Cage (Cruise), has made a career out of promoting military products, like the 'Jackets', to the public. When a UDF commander, named General Brigham (Gleeson), wants Cage to join beach forces in France (in order to report on them), Cage blackmails the General in an attempt to get out of it. Brigham then has Cage arrested, stripped of his rank and shipped to the London Heathrow Airport; where he's ordered to join the forces in combat there. His worst fears come true when the Mimics slaughter the UDF armies and kill Cage. To his surprise he wakes up a day earlier and finds himself continually repeating that day; until he can some how change things and stop the Mimics. He of course joins forces with Vrataski, who seems to know what might be happening to him.The film is sort of like a sci-fi/action version of 'GROUNDHOG DAY' but that doesn't mean you've seen anything like it before. It's completely original and different than any other potential summer blockbuster you might see this year (or any other). The script is brilliant, Liman's directing is perfectly fitting (to the material) and the acting is superb. Cruise gets to play a cocky pussy in the beginning of the movie and then evolves into a precise 'killing machine'. He makes a great reluctant hero and this is one of his better performances. Blunt is hot and also an awesome action heroin; she just kicks so much ass, the entire movie. It's also great to see Bill Paxton as another soldier (this time an officer) killing aliens again (it's an awesome homage to 'ALIENS'). It's definitely one of the best movies of the year (so far), so of course it's one of the least successful (so far). It is doing really well overseas though (where Cruise is still a huge star) so it should at least make it's money back. It's just a shame more people won't see it on the big screen domestically; they'll definitely be missing out!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Ie33IbZzmi0",10,1,3,11 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," I look forward to the third installment!
","'PITCH PERFECT 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 hit musical-comedy flick 'PITCH PERFECT'; which was based on the book 'Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory', by Mickey Rapkin. Actress Elizabeth Banks reprises her supporting role, from the original film, and she also makes her feature film directorial debut, with this movie (she served as a producer on both films as well). The movie was written by Kay Cannon, once again, and it has most of the original's cast, reprising their roles; including Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean and John Michael Higgins. Hailee Steinfeld, Katy Sagal and Keegan-Michael Key also join the cast, this time around. I really enjoyed the first movie, a lot, and I think this one is just as good. The collegiate a cappella group 'The Barden Bellas', are performing for President Obama, at the Kennedy Center, when 'Fat Amy' (Wilson) has a wardrobe malfunction. They become a nationwide disgrace, due to the incident, and are banned from doing any shows, or competing in any challenges, ever again. The girls realize that they're only chance of continuing on, as an a cappella team, is to compete in the world tournament, and win. They must travel to Copenhagen, in order to do so. At the same time a freshman, named Emily Junk (Steinfeld), joins their team; and Becca (Kendrick) secretly pursues a career as a music producer, by starting an internship at a successful recording studio.I was surprised to find out, just how good the first movie is; due to how popular it's become, with teen girls. Still I had doubts, about this sequel, because it's even more successful; with the kind of audience that (seems) to usually love movie like 'TWILIGHT'. Both films are really well made; the music is always likable, and performed well, and the comedy is brilliant. They're also both kind of moving, and inspiring, in a sappy way (but still, it's impressive). The cast is all great again, the script is really well written and Banks did an awesome job directing.

Whiplash," One of the most epic showdowns in cinematic history!
","'WHIPLASH': Five Stars (Out of Five) A critically acclaimed (and Oscar hopeful) jazz musician character study that plays more like a psychological thriller than a heartwarming drama. It was written and directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. The film tells the story of a young jazz drummer studying to become great at an acclaimed music school, under the obsessive guidance of an abusive instructor. It also features Melissa Benoist and Paul Reiser, in supporting roles. I found it to be nothing short of great and a true masterpiece.Andrew (Teller) is 19-years-old and just started school at the Shaffer Conservatory, which is widely known as the best music school in the country. He really wants to be one of the great jazz drummers and to do so he'll need to gain the approval of a highly respected conductor, at the school, named Terence Fletcher (Simmons). Fletcher is determined to find the next great musician and his tactics for bringing out the best in students are highly questionable, and border on psychological abuse (and torture). Andrew is just as determined to become a great musician though, and the two engage in a battle that turns into one of the most epic showdowns in cinematic history.Simmons is great in the movie (and he's now seen as the Best Supporting Actor frontrunner, at this year's upcoming Academy Awards). I've been a fan of his, as a character actor, for years and it's great to see him taking on a lead role that he's this powerful and memorable in (it showcases all of his best talents). Teller is just as good as the main character though, he's a new actor but he's already shown an amazing gift for acting. The two very flawed but inspired characters, these actors bring to life in this film, are classic. It's a great story but what's even more impressive is how visceral a film going experience it is; Chazelle's directing is always breathtaking and beautiful to watch. I don't think a character study could possibly be more intense and thoroughly involving than this (and it does feel like a thriller or fast paced sports drama). It's one of the best movie experiences I've had this year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/TybVNWfCjYM",10,0,3,17 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," A highly amusing but deeply disturbing look at the American dream of excessiveness and self obsession!
","'THE WOLF OF WALL STREET': Five Stars (Out of Five)Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's fifth film collaboration together is this dark comedy biographical film based on the life of self-made millionaire Jordan Belfort (it's also based on his book of the same name). Scorsese directed the movie and Terence Winter wrote the screenplay (Winter was a regular writer for 'THE SOPRANOS' and previously worked with Scorsese on another popular crime show called 'BOARDWALK EMPIRE'). DiCaprio plays Belfort in the film and it's his second time playing a crazy self-made millionaire in the same year (following 'THE GREAT GATSBY' from last summer). Jonah Hill, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Spike Jonze, Ethan Suplee, Jean Dujardin (of 'THE ARTIST' fame) and the gorgeous Margot Robbie all co-star in the movie. The film is highly amusing but it's also a deeply disturbing (and completely honest) look at the American dream of excessiveness and self obsession.The film is narrated by Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), who often speaks directly to the camera, as he explains how he rose from the middle class to become one of America's most successful stockbrokers (and make millions). We meet many of his other crooked but brilliant cohorts along the way, like Donnie Azoff (Hill) and Nicky Koskoff (P.J. Byrne). Belfort was married twice and had a daughter but could never quite settle down and stop his crazy sex and drug habits. His many illegal business tactics eventually attracted the attention of the FBI. The movie once again supports the popular belief that in order to get ahead in this world you can't really care about anything; the more you're willing to compromise your morals the more money, sex and popularity you'll achieve (that's what people ultimately respect). It's sad but true. Of course there's always exceptions to this accepted way of life but they're very few and far between. DiCaprio is once again genius in the lead role and Scorsese's directing is (once again) masterful. The supporting cast is all excellent as well (especially McConaughey who's had an amazing last couple of years). It's perhaps a tad too long at three hours (no movie really needs to be that long) but the running length fits the main theme of the film (excessiveness). The movie is especially entertaining because it does appeal to the weakest part of human nature: just living life to the fullest without caring about anything. There are so many hilarious drug and alcohol abuse scenes (which is one of my biggest temptations and weaknesses) and the movie is just a blast to watch (even if there is too much of it). It's definitely not for everyone but I'm always surprised to see people walking out of a movie like this (just a third of the way into it, on it's thirteenth or fourteenth explicit and outrageously crude sex scene) like they didn't know what they were paying to see! The film is a masterpiece and Scorsese and DiCaprio prove once again why they're one of the best cinematic teams working today (perhaps even better than Scorsese and De Niro were)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",10,1,6,6 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," I especially enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich's performance!
","'HAIL, CAESAR!': Four Stars (Out of Five)The Coen Brothers' new comedy flick; about a 'fixer', in 1950s Hollywood, trying to deal with the abduction of a popular movie star (and other various scandals, involving celebrities). The movie stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill and Frances McDormand. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, directed, edited and co- produced the flick; and (like all their films) it's gotten rave reviews from critics. It didn't perform that well at the Box Office though. I really enjoyed it. Brolin plays Eddie Mannix; a 'fixer', who keeps celebrity scandals out of the news. His employers' latest big production is a biblical tale, called 'Hail, Caesar!'. The film's star, Baird Whitlock (Clooney), was recently abducted from the set. It's Eddie's job to get him back, while also fending off other negative news stories; involving a pregnant (unwed) starlet, and a rising Western film star (Ehrenreich).The movie is just as odd, crazy and quirky, as you'd expect any Coen Brothers' movie to be. I had heard this film was kind of dull (and slow) though; but I didn't find that to be the case. I love all of the movie's elaborate dance scenes, and it's insightful look at 1950s Hollywood. The characters are all funny, and quite likable, in it. I especially enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich's performance; for me, the movie is all about him. He's set to play a young 'Han Solo', in an upcoming 'STAR WARS' flick; and after seeing this movie, I think he'll do an awesome job. Clooney is pretty good in the film too. It's a lot of fun!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",8,2,4,12 July 2016
Dark Shadows," For fans of Burton it can't be labeled anything but a disappointment!
","'DARK SHADOWS': Three Stars (Out of Five) Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team together once again to bring the popular 1960's horror soap opera (of the same name) to the big screen in campy spoof form. Fans of the original series will most likely not be pleased by Burton's rendition of the melodramatic soap as it lacks strong character development as well as story structure and never takes the material seriously in the slightest. The film was written by Seth Grahame-Smith and John August (both future and past Burton collaborators on other films as well) and co-stars the likes of Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jackie Earl Haley, Johnny Lee Miller, Bella Heathcote and of course Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's mainstay and partner). The film will most likely let down Burton and Depp fans as well, although Depp is good in the film like always.The story focuses on Barnabas Collins (Depp), a rich playboy in 1752 who breaks the heart of a servant named Angelique Bouchard (Green), who also happens to be a witch. Out of anger and jealousy Angelique curses Barnabas to be a vampire and causes his one true love to commit suicide. She then convinces the townspeople to turn against him and bury him alive. Barnabas is trapped, chained in a coffin, for centuries until he is freed by some construction workers in 1972. He then returns to his estate to find it in ruins and under the hands of his depressed distant relatives, lead by Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer). Barnabas must then do battle with Angelique once again in order to save his new family.The film is darker than I was expecting! Depp's Barnabas is not a good vampire like the trailers lead you to believe; he murders and feeds on innocent victims and yet he is the film's hero. Depp is hilarious in the role and the 'fish out of water' humor does work for the most part but the rest of the story does not. It has no direction and seems to just consist of a bunch of random scenes thrown together. Burton's directing is not efficient and I actually found the film quite boring at times. Still Green looks gorgeous, it's nice to see Pfeiffer working again and the rest of the cast is adequate. The film just had potential to be a lot more and for fans of Burton it can't be labeled anything but a disappointment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01kYho5uKO8",6,5,11,16 May 2012
12 Strong," For me the film is just way too boring.
","'12 STRONG': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A war film about CIA Paramilitary and U.S. Special Forces who were sent to Afghanistan, immediately after the September 11th attacks, to combat Taliban soldiers there. It's based on the non-fiction book 'Horse Soldiers' by Doug Stanton, and it was scripted by Ted Tally and Peter Craig. Sophomore feature filmmaker Nicolai Fuglsig directed the movie, which stars Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Navid Negahban, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, William Fichtner and Rob Riggle. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be pretty dull and uninvolving. The story begins with the September 11th terrorist attacks being witnessed on TV by Captain Mitch Nelson (Hemsworth), and his family. Mitch is eager to retaliate against those responsible, and he begs his superior officers for his Captain position back, in order to do so. Mitch, along with Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spencer (Shannon), Sergeant First Class Sam Diller (Pena), and other U.S. soldiers, are then sent to Afghanistan to attack the Taliban forces there. Once there, they partner with the leader of the alliance, General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Negahban), and quickly start to plot their revenge. The movie looks like a fun war action flick, and I like the premise to it, but for me the film is just way too boring. I couldn't even get into the action scenes (which I'll admit happens a lot for me with recent action flicks), but the whole story, and character development, is pretty weak and uninvolving. The performances are pretty dull and uninspired too, and it's definitely a talented cast. With the exception of Navid Negahban (he's a scene stealer in it), most of the actors seem to be just there for their paychecks. I could not wait for the movie to be over, for most of it's 2 hour and 10 minute running time, but I'll admit that I'm sure some action junkies, and war film fans, will probably enjoy it. Technically speaking, the movie isn't half bad.",5,13,39,19 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Action-packed, and a lot of fun!
","'KONG: SKULL ISLAND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A reboot to the popular monster movie franchise, which began in 1933. It's also the second film in Legendary's new monster universe franchise, called MonsterVerse, following 2014's 'GODZILLA' and leading up to a planned crossover film (in 2020) titled 'GODZILLA VS. KONG'. The story deals with a couple of government agents, and their military escorts, investigating an uncharted island, in the Pacific Ocean, where they're attacked by a giant monster known as Kong. The movie was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (who also helmed the 2013 indie coming-of-age flick 'THE KINGS OF SUMMER') and it was written by Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein. The film stars Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Thomas Mann, Shea Whigham, Tobby Kebbell, John Ortiz, Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell. It's been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it as well.A government agent, named Bill Randa (Goodman), and a seismologist, named Houston Brooks (Hawkins), lead an expedition to map out an uncharted island, in the Pacific Ocean, known as 'Skull Island'. They hire the Sky Devils Helicopter squadron, lead by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Jackson), and a former British Special Air Service Captain, named James Conrad (Hiddleston), to escort them. A photojournalist, named Mason Weaver (Larson), who thinks the expedition has sinister motives, also joins the team. Once they reach the island, the group realizes there's a very large creature there, known as Kong, that is unhappy with their presence.The movie is action-packed, and a lot of fun. I love monster flicks, and this is definitely a really well made one. It's not as epic as Peter Jackson's 2005 remake, or the 1933 original, but it's still a more than decent installment in the long running series. It's also definitely a lot better than the 2014 'GODZILLA' reboot. I look forward to the upcoming crossover flick (with both classic movie monsters in it), and more entries in the new MonsterVerse franchise!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo",9,3,7,23 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Everything the second film was lacking!
","'THE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES': Five Stars (Out of Five)The final installment in director Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation, of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic 1937 novel 'The Hobbit' (following 2012's 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' and 2013's 'THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG'); which also serves as a prequel trilogy to Jackson's blockbuster 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' movie series (also based on Tolkien's popular books). Jackson once again directed and co-wrote the movie; with his wife Fran Walsh, his other usual writing partner Philippa Boyens and acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who was also originally going to direct 'THE HOBBIT' film series, in two-parts). Walsh and Boyens also co-wrote all of the other Tolkien movie adaptations (as well as multiple other Peter Jackson films) and del Toro also co-wrote the other 'HOBBIT' movies. The film once again stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Lee Pace, Luke Evans, the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch and many other returning cast members (as well as a few new ones). I highly enjoyed it, surprisingly to me, and think it's the best of 'THE HOBBIT' film trilogy; but I still don't think it quite lives up to any of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' movies. It's definitely one of the best films of the year though!The film opens, where the last installment left off, with the dragon Smaug (Cumberbatch) attacking Lake-town (which is resolved 12 minutes later, before the title of the movie even appears). Gandalf (McKellen) is still a prisoner of the orc prison and Thorin (Armitage) has gone mad with power and greed. He desperately wants to find the Arkenstone, which he still doesn't know Bilbo (Freeman) has. At the same time armies of elves, dwarfs, people and orcs approach the Lonely Mountain; ready for war. A lot of action ensues.Although I enjoyed 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' (a lot) and thought it was true to the book in spirit, I was deeply disappointed with it's first sequel. That whole movie feels like excessive filler, packed with uninvolving video game style action scenes (that go on for way too long); which makes it a pretty boring and uneventful film. It also lacks it's natural ending (which was instead used to open this movie with) making it by far the weakest installment out of all of Peter Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations. I once was a big fan of Jackson's because he does have a lot of talent and passion for making films but 'THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG' is the biggest example of how much of a sellout he's become (kind of obsessed with power and greed, like Thorin is in this movie). For that reason I went into this movie with pretty low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong. The film is completely fast paced, filled with brilliantly thought out and involving action scenes, and it also has a great deal of emotional depth and character development (everything the second film was lacking). It's far superior to 'SMAUG' and definitely the best film of this trilogy (which should have never been a trilogy). Still it's a great movie, one of the best of this year, and a fitting conclusion to the entire epic six film series. Obsessive book fans and purists will still be disgusted, and hate it, but most others should at least have a fun time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/zsvb7ypwxL4",10,4,9,22 December 2014
Inception," If 'ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND' and 'THE MATRIX' had a child together and 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE' was the sperm donor 'INCEPTION' would be the conception!
","'INCEPTION': Five Stars (Out of Five) If 'ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND' and 'THE MATRIX' had a child together and 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE' was the sperm donor 'INCEPTION' would be the conception. Writer / director Christopher Nolan, arguably the greatest filmmaker working today (and the man behind such beloved blockbuster and indie cult classics as 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'BATMAN BEGINS' and 'MEMENTO'), gives us this ingenious sci-fi / horror / drama / 'thinking man's' action film about shared dreaming! The movie is so well made and confident in every way that the viewer just automatically believes they are seeing something truly great and clever from the opening scene to the last. To carry out his impossible mission Nolan has assembled the most talented and fitting cast and crew members he possibly could.At the heart of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. The man is one of the most talented and iconic actors working today; like Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp and a few others he's as gifted at the art of acting as he is famous and this is one of his best performances to date (although very similar to another lead performance of his this year in the similar themed Martin Scorsese film 'SHUTTER ISLAND', in which he was also dealing with the battle of reality versus perception and the reconciliation of the loss of a loved one in order to save his sanity). There's also the extremely talented Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard in impressive key supporting roles (as well as Nolan regulars Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine). The editing, cinematography, art direction, makeup, etc. are all top notch as well but the most memorable and impressive thing for me about the film (other than maybe the writing and directing) is the score; Hans Zimmer (who also recently co-scored Nolan's 'THE DARK KNIGHT' and 'BATMAN BEGINS') has outdone himself here with music that embodies almost the entire film and empowers it. It's almost as if he's created an entire new genre of score music and it's the best I've heard in quite some time (If Zimmer doesn't win an Oscar for this there's no justice in Hollywood).In 'INCEPTION' Nolan creates a very realistic and believable alternate reality in which dreams can be shared and controlled and business's as well as of course government's have created technology in which they can infiltrate someone's dreams and steal key valuable information from someone's subconscious, which they call 'extracting', at the time when it's most vulnerable (when it's in the dream state). This is a very dangerous and complex act though considering it requires a very strong sedative to keep everyone involved in the dream asleep and therefore if you die in your dream and cant wake up your mind goes into a deep limbo which can seem like an eternity and drive you to insanity. This is made even more difficult and frightening by the fact that the most at risk minds have been trained to militarize their brains and established dream defense units to ward off any intruders. DiCaprio plays Cobb the most experienced and wanted dream expert the world has ever seen. He leads a special unit of dream con-artists in routine 'extraction' assignments for various employers. His one flaw is that he's haunted by the loss of his wife (The very memorable Cotillard) on a dream adventure they concocted together. Due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his wife Cobb is wanted for her murder and can't return home to see his two young children. One big seemingly impossible assignment involving the act of 'inception' (implanting an idea in a mind's dream rather than 'extracting' it) could change all that, by clearing his name, and finally be his ticket home.The movie is extremely fast paced and complicated which does make it very hard to follow upon first viewing but every detail of it's fantasy world is so well explained that this makes the movie so much more enjoyable the second time around. The characters also feel somewhat underdeveloped, all except for DiCaprio's Cobb and his assignment; the mark (Murphy), at least the first time around. There's a lot of screen time given to people like Page and Gordon-Levitt but all we really know about them is what they know and think about the dream world and Cobb. It kind of feels like a 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE' film in which players are only put into motion to perform their skill in supporting the Ethan Hunt character 'Cobb' on his mission and character development. This make's the film some what frustrating and not relate-able considering the fact that Cobb is a mystery most of the film and is only fully understood and loved at the film's end, which is a very emotionally powerful climax. This all changes upon a second viewing though. Only after you fully understand the dream world and what's going on from the very beginning can you fully appreciate every detail of every second of the film and it's characters. No longer are you head-ached by trying to figure out what is going on and you pick up so much more of the film in every way. These are the best films in my opinion; movies which require multiple viewings to fully understand and love them. I can't wait to see this movie a third time and it's by far the best movie I've seen so far this year!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VybzU5X_-Ww",10,2,7,14 October 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Nothing that will stay with me for very long.
","'MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A new cinematic version of Agatha Christie's classic 1934 murder mystery novel, which has been adapted into films three times before. Kenneth Branagh directed, produced and stars in the movie; as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Poirot is in charge of investigating a murder on the famous Orient Express. It was written by Michael Green, who's recent writing credits include co-scripting 'BLADE RUNNER 2049', 'LOGAN' and 'ALIEN COVENANT'. The film also features an all-star supporting cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad and Johnny Depp. Ridley Scott also served as a producer on the flick, and it was shot on 65mm film. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (although none are really raving about it), and it's also done modestly well at the Box Office too. I found it to be well made, and mostly (at least mildly) entertaining, but I'm definitely not raving about it either. The story begins in 1930s Jerusalem, where the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) is solving a case. He's then expecting to go on a highly anticipated vacation. Before he can go on it though, he's given a telegram asking for his assistance on another case. His friend Buoc (Tom Bateman), who now directs the famous 'Orient Express', offers him a three day ride to his destination. Poirot meets a variety of different characters on his trip, including an American criminal named Samuel Ratchett (Depp). Ratchett asks the detective for his help, in acting as his personal bodyguard, but Poirot declines (stating that he doesn't aide criminals, he only catches them). Later Ratchett is killed, and the train is derailed by an avalanche. While the passengers are all stranded there, Poirot conducts an investigation to find out who killed Ratchett, and of course it has to be someone who's still on the train. The movie is beautiful to look at; it looks like a classic big screen epic at almost all times. Branagh is of course a very talented filmmaker, and actor too, and he doesn't disappoint here. Most of the rest of the celebrities have little to do though; with the exception of Pfeiffer, who's always good in almost everything she does (it seems like). The story is a classic mystery as well, but (as I already said) it's been done multiple times before, and there's nothing really new here. I did have a mostly good time watching it though, but it's also nothing that will stay with me for very long.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",7,0,5,1 December 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," There is an important message in there, that kind of gets lost.
","'THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A computer-animated kids' movie; about a spoiled terrier, that has to deal with another dog his owner suddenly brings home. The two canines go on an adventure together, in Brooklyn. The film was directed by Chris Renaud (who also co-directed 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2), and it was co-directed by Yarrow Cheney (who served as a production designer on 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2). It was written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (the two also co-wrote 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2), as well as Brian Lynch (who also wrote 'MINIONS'). The movie stars the voice talents of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Lake Bell, Bobby Moynihan, Steve Coogan, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress and Albert Brooks. It's received decent reviews from critics, and it's also been a blockbuster at the Box Office (making over $100 million, domestically, in it's first weekend). I thought it was OK.The movie tells the story of a very happy terrier, named Max (C.K.). Max lives very contently, with his owner Katie (Kemper), in a Manhattan apartment building. He loves his pampered life, with Katie, and while she's gone (his least favorite time of the day) he hangs out with other pets from the building. Then Katie brings home a very large (and messy) dog, named Duke (Stonestreet); that she rescued from the pound. Max is very unhappy, at Duke's sudden presence in his home, and the two don't get along. When Duke tricks Max, into running into the city with him, the two must team together (and work out their differences) to find their way back home. The animation is decent, and it's a mildly funny movie. I definitely didn't find it to be too boring, or overly stupid, but there is an important message in there (about not abandoning animals) that kind of gets lost. It's like the filmmakers wanted to make a more insightful (and educational) movie, about taking good care of your pets, but then they decided to desert the idea; for cheap laughs and cheesy drama, instead. Still, it's not a bad film, it just could have been a lot better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",6,1,3,13 July 2016
Finding Dory," I don't think it's as good a film as the original; or nearly as great as the best of Pixar.
","'FINDING DORY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The sequel to the blockbuster Pixar hit 'FINDING NEMO'. It once again stars the voice talents of Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks. It was directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane; and it was written by Stanton, Bob Peterson and Victoria Strouse (Stanton also co-directed and co-wrote the original movie). The story, this time, revolves around the amnesiac Dory, as she goes on a quest to find her parents. I don't think it's as good a film as the original; or nearly as great as the best of Pixar. The film picks up shortly after the events of the original movie. Nemo (Hayden Rolence) is now safely, and happily, living with his father, Marlin (Brooks). Dory (DeGeneres) still lives with them as well, but she also still longs to reunite with her parents. After a sudden flashback, Dory decides to go on a quest to find them. Nemo and Marlin go with her.I think it's a little odd for the filmmakers to have made a sequel, to 'FINDING NEMO', that has such a little amount of Nemo in it. He's also voiced by a different actor (due to the fact that the original actor matured so much). Dory is an interesting, and entertaining, character though; and DeGeneres is the biggest star, of the original movie, to market the film as your lead with. So I understand Disney's (and Pixar's) financial motives. Even with these doubts, I still had high hopes. I was sadly disappointed. It is still a visually stunning, and funny, film though. But the story (and adventure of it) didn't intrigue me that much. I also was expecting a lot more heart.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_3w7EWxV5vg",7,8,22,22 June 2016
Arrival," Reminds me a lot of the 1997 sci-fi hit 'CONTACT'.
","'ARRIVAL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new critically acclaimed science fiction drama, about an expert linguist that leads a US military team in trying to communicate with alien invaders. The film was directed by Denis Villeneuve (who's helmed such other critically acclaimed hits as 'SICARIO', 'PRISONERS' and 'ENEMY'), and it was written by Eric Heisserer (a veteran horror flick writer of movies like 'LIGHTS OUT', 'FINAL DESTINATION 5' and the 2010 'A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET' and 2011 'THE THING' remakes). The script is based on a 1998 short story, by Ted Chiang, called 'STORY OF YOUR LIFE'. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg and Tzi Ma. The film has received rave reviews from critics, and it's been a big hit at the Box Office. I think it's a sci-fi masterpiece. 12 alien spacecrafts touchdown around the globe, alarming the entire world population. Louise Banks (Adams) is an expert linguist, that's selected to lead a special U.S. military team in trying to communicate with the extraterrestrials. She's joined by a theoretical physicist, named Ian Donnelly (Renner), and a US Army Colonel, named Weber (Whitaker). The team engages in a desperate race against time, to find out why the aliens are here, before violence erupts around the world. The film reminds me a lot of the 1997 sci-fi hit 'CONTACT' (which was one of my favorite films released that year); it tells a similar story about alien invaders, with a similar strong lead heroine character that's trying to make 'contact' with them. Adams is amazing in the lead role, and Villeneuve's direction is superb. The movie is a little long, and slow-paced in places; but for the most part it's very engaging, and intense, and the ending is absolutely breathtaking (I cried). It's definitely a sci-fi masterpiece, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/191482784",9,1,6,16 November 2016
Rango," Definitely a kids film at heart and a good one at that.
","'RANGO': Four Stars (Out of Five) Industrial Light & Magic's first animated feature film and it's a beauty. I think it's the best looking animated film to date, the CGI animation is breathtaking! The film also marks the re-teaming of director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp (after making three 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' films together). In the film Depp voices a chameleon who falls out of his owners' car and becomes lost in the Mojave Desert. He then finds a town of assorted animals living out in the Wild West in need of a sheriff. The film is written by John Logan, James Ward Byrkit and Verbinski. It's a pretty dark and somewhat mature animated film that some have argued is not a kids film. I think while it does have plenty of appeal for adults as well it's still a kids film at heart and a very good one at that.The film's title character is in fact a chameleon named Lars. Lars had always dreamed of adventure outside of the terrarium where he lives and when it falls off his owners' car on the highway he's forced into one. He first meets an armadillo named Roadkill (Alfred Molina) with mysterious healing abilities and tales of a 'Spirit of the West'. Roadkill encourages Lars to venture out into the desert so Lars does and is almost eaten by a hawk. He then finds the town of Dirt and lies to the locals telling them of adventurous duels he's been in. He also tells them his name is Rango. After he kills the deadly hawk with luck the town looks up to him and makes him their sheriff. He's then tasked with the responsibility of solving the town's water shortage, which is like gold to the animals living in the desert.The film, like I said, is very dark and filled with ugly looking characters, mature jokes and references as well as a fair amount of violence. It also has plenty of kids humor as well though and a heart and uplifting message too. A good kids film should appeal to adults as well and this one definitely does. It's got elements of western, comedy and a little spiritual drama (it's very psychedelic at times which is fitting for a Johnny Depp film). The movie doesn't talk down to kids and most of the jokes are not too cheesy or silly (although there are a few). It's a little slow in places but never for too long. The animation like I said is the best I've ever seen in a feature length animated film and the movie as a whole rivals the best of Pixar and DreamWorks. It's not the best animated film I've ever seen but it's definitely among them.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk",8,0,1,3 April 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Not quite as good as all of it's hype.
","'BIRDMAN: OR (THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE)': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed indie black comedy flick starring Michael Keaton as a has-been movie star, who puts everything he has into a Broadway play; in hopes of recapturing his past glory. The film costars Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan. It was directed, produced and co- written (with Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. and Armando Bo) by Alejandro González Iñárritu. The movie is a Oscar hopeful in many categories; likely including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (for Michael Keaton). I found it to be a really interesting and well made film but not quite as good as all of it's hype.Riggan Thomson (Keaton) was once a huge movie star that starred in three blockbuster superhero movies (as the popular character Birdman). He hasn't made a hit movie in the 20 years since and hungers for that fame, and relevance, again. So he's writing, directing and starring in a play adaptation of Raymond Carver's classic short story 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. He's invested all of his money in the production; including refinancing a house he promised to his daughter Sam (Stone), who's also a production assistant on the play. While trying to make the upcoming premier a success, Riggan struggles to get along with the cast and crew; especially Sam, his girlfriend Laura (Riseborough) and a self absorbed actor named Mike Shiner (Norton). He also hallucinates that he has telekinetic abilities and often talks to himself in the voice of his former character Birdman.The movie is pretty funny, it's also a great psychological character study and fascinating look at showbiz. The directing is always interesting to watch and it's pretty cool how Iñárritu manipulates the camera-work, and editing, to make the movie feel like it's all one continuous shot. The score, that's highlighted largely by drumming, works very well at setting the tone and mood for the film as well. The acting is all excellent too; especially Keaton. Experts say he'll likely win the Oscar this year because (like the play is for his character) this movie is redemption for him (having starred in two blockbuster 'BATMAN' films, just over 20 years ago, and not having made a hit movie since). I like and admire the film quite a bit, but it's not one of the best movies of the year.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/g8YMJ5tBLQ8",9,2,13,19 November 2014
Centurion," A 'Splat Pack' take on Roman history!
","'CENTURION': Three Stars (Out of Five) Neil Marshall (writer and director of 'DOOMSDAY', 'THE DESCENT' and 'DOG SOLDIERS') writes and directs this historical adventure film about Roman soldiers under attack behind enemy lines in Northern Britain. Marshall is a horror and gore master and a member of the 'Splat Pack', an unofficial grouping of named modern horror filmmakers. This film is more of an adventure / war film but it still has a surprising amount of gratuitous violence. The film, like Marshall's others, was filmed in the UK and features actors like Michael Fassbender, Dominic West, David Morrissey and Olga Kurylenko (the most recent 'Bond' girl).The film revolves around Roman soldier Quintus Dias (Fassbender) who is the lone survivor of a Pictish attack on a Roman frontier fort. He's taken captive by the Picts and later escapes. He then is enlisted in the Ninth Legion and returns for vengeance on the Picts alongside General Virilus (West). The legion is ambushed, Virilus is taken prisoner and the remaining, living group, of Roman soldiers is left to fend for their own behind enemy lines. The Picts are led by the vengeful Etain (Kurylenko) who led the legion into the ambush and double crossed them.The film is mildly entertaining but for me it just doesn't live up to Marshall's other films. I really liked 'DOOMSDAY' and I enjoyed 'THE DESCENT' and 'DOG SOLDIERS'. The action scenes were cool but a little too violent, in a way that didn't seem necessary (although I'm one of the last people to complain about film violence). The main thing I felt was lacking in the film is that the characters aren't very interesting or likable (maybe partially due to lackluster performances). I also felt kind of strange being forced into rooting for the Roman soldiers when they really were the bad guys of the film; the narrative was all wrong. Overall the movie is a slightly above average adventure film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPqFKAK3fro",6,3,6,18 November 2010
The Big Short," It almost has you rooting for the U.S. economy to fail!
","'THE BIG SHORT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed comedy-drama flick; about the financial crisis, of 2007 to 2010, and the clever businessmen who were able to profit from it. The film was directed by Adam McKay (who's helmed such other comedy classics as 'ANCHORMAN', 'STEP BROTHERS' and 'THE OTHER GUYS'), and it was written by McKay and Charles Randolph. The movie stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, John Magaro, Finn Wittrock, Jeremy Strong, Hamish Linklater, Rafe Spall and Brad Pitt. Along with it being impressively critically rated, the film is also expected to be nominated for multiple Academy Awards (including Best Picture). I found it to be a very insightful, and highly entertaining, movie.The story begins in 2005, when Michael Burry (Bale), a socially awkward hedge fund manager, predicts the upcoming financial crisis (due to the unstable housing market) and decides to bet against it. Burry creates a 'credit default swap market', much to the dismay of many of his investors. Multiple other businessmen catch wind of Burry's plan, and decide to pursue similar financial ventures. They include trader Jared Vennett (Gosling), hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Carell) and retired banker Ben Rickert (Pitt). The true story follows three different groups of people; as they follow their American dream, of becoming rich (while everyone else's dreams collapse). The movie is very informative, about what caused the economy to fail (in 2007). It's also very detailed, and educational (in it's explanations), while trying to remain entertaining; at the same time. I still got lost, multiple times, but I also learned a lot too. Besides being politically fascinating, the movie is hilarious, and full of complex characters. It's a lot more insightful, than anything McKay has done before. What's really odd about the film, is that it almost has you rooting for the U.S. economy to fail; just to prove it's likable characters right (I especially like Bale's character, Michael Burry). The film is a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/dWmLQGusjEk",9,13,16,5 January 2016
The Conjuring," James Wan has now proved himself to be a master of the horror genre!
","'THE CONJURING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director James Wan (who first burst onto the movie scene with 2004's immensely popular 'torture porn' slasher film 'SAW') has now proved himself to be a master of the horror genre. He suffered a mild setback (and the sophomore jinx) with the film 'DEAD SILENCE' in 2007 but returned to good form with the revenge action film 'DEATH SENTENCE' that same year. He's now proved himself to be one of the masters of the horror genre with 2010's 'INSIDIOUS' and his newest offering 'THE CONJURING'. Both are the purest examples of what makes scary movies so powerful and a film lover's delight!The film was written by Chad and Carey Hayes (who also co-scripted the horror films 'THE REAPING' and the 2005 'HOUSE OF WAX' remake) and it's loosely based on true events in the lives of Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in the film, Wilson also starred in Wan's 'INSIDIOUS'). The Warrens were respected paranormal investigators in the 1970s and this film revolves around them helping the Perron family with a spooky disturbance in their home. The Perrons (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) were a married couple who moved into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island, with their five daughters, in 1971. They were haunted by an unseen entity from the moment they moved into the house. The case was the most disturbing and frightening one of the Warrens' careers.The film is a classic throwback to the great spook fests of the 1970s (like 'THE EXORCIST'). It uses minimal special effects and was made on a budget of just $13 million. It's highlighted by Wan's creative directing and an excellently freaky score by Joseph Bishara (who also did the music for 'INSIDIOUS' as well as a number of other recent horror films). The movie represents everything I love about horror films and why it's the most successful genre in cinema today (this film made $41 million in it's opening weekend; that's more than three times it's budget and the biggest opening ever for an R rated horror film). James Wan is one of the elite directors that helped pave the way.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFfGQiMGk-4",9,0,2,24 July 2013
Prometheus," A masterpiece that will be examined and analyzed as classic science fiction always should be for many decades to come!
","'PROMETHEUS': Five Stars (Out of Five)Director Ridley Scott's long awaited prequel to his classic 1979 sci-fi horror film 'ALIEN'. The film is not a traditional prequel as it takes the popular franchise in an entirely new direction and actually does very little towards building towards the first 'ALIEN' film. It does set up a possible new prequel trilogy (if the films continue to do well financially) and I think this prequel series will be a lot more interesting and fan pleasing than George Lucas's. The film was written by Damon Lindelof (head writer and co-creator of 'LOST') and Jon Spaihts and stars Noomi Rapace (the original 'GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO'), Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron (in another deliciously villainous role, following 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN' just last week), Idris Elba and Logan Marshall-Green. The movie is nothing like what I was expecting and is an incredibly lot to digest but I can say it's without a doubt a masterpiece that will be examined and analyzed as classic science fiction always should be for many decades to come. Rapace stars as Shaw and Marshall-Green co-stars as her lover Charlie Holloway, a team of archaeologists who find a 'star map', in a cave on Earth in 2089, that they see as an invitation to meet mankind's makers. They find funding for an expedition, from the elder CEO of Weyland Corp. (Guy Pearce), and begin a mission to a far away moon named LV-223 (where they believe the map is taking them). They travel in cryofreeze aboard a spaceship called Prometheus, while being watched over by an android named David (Fassbender), and arrive at their destination in 2093. The crew is awakened and Shaw and Holloway inform them of their goal, to an uneasy response of course. They then enter a large structure they land next to on the moon and what they find inside changes the world and life as we know it forever more. The movie is full of biblical references and high concept philosophical ideas. I found it to be quite a new and original take on the 'where do we come from' story premise; kind of like a science fiction version of last year's 'THE TREE OF LIFE'. It asks a lot of questions that it doesn't answer but that's in large part because it's waiting for the sequels to do that. I look forward to them and really hope James Cameron writes and directs the next one (or maybe co-writes it with Lindelof). Cameron had a strong interest in doing the original prequel several years ago but when the studio opted to do an 'ALIEN VS. PREDATOR' film instead he thought it would forever kill the validity of the series and gave up hope. The script is brilliant, thanks in large part to Lindelof's rewrite. Originally it was written as just a straightforward prequel but then Scott and Lindelof decided to do something different with it, which ultimately disappointed a lot of the die-hard horror monster movie fans. Classic 'thinking man' sci-fi fans will love it though. Scott's directing is superb and the visuals are astonishing (the 3D works beautifully as well). It's a little too serious and cold but characters like Elba's 'Janek' do liven the film up. Fassbender probably gives the best performance of the movie in the most interesting role but Rapace does rival Sigourney Weaver as the action heroine lead. Of course Theron is beautiful and superb once again as well. The characters aren't quite as developed or likable as Cameron's 'ALIENS', which is one of the reasons that film is my favorite of the franchise. I'd put this one right up there with the original though. It's one of those movies that creates a ton of conversation and leaves a lot for the viewer to think about (you always have to give a film a lot of credit for that!). Scott's return to sci-fi should please any true fan as well as fan's of the franchise. Let's hope they do something equally impressive for the next installment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OntHz3aWug",10,19,41,12 June 2012
The Water Diviner," Definitely not a very impressive directorial debut for Crowe.
","'THE WATER DIVINER': Three Stars (Out of Five)Russell Crowe makes his directorial debut, with this war drama film; about a farmer searching for his missing sons, who never returned home from the Battle of Gallipoli, four years earlier. Crowe also stars in the movie, as the farmer, and it costars Olga Kurylenko, Yilmaz Erdogan, Cem Yilmaz, Dylan Georgiades, Ryan Corr (of 'WOLF CREEK 2' fame), Jaqueline McKenzie and Jai Courtney. It was written by Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight; and it's based on the book, of the same name, by Anastasios and his wife, Dr. Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios. I found it to be pretty slow-paced, and clichéd (at times), but it comes to a pretty rewarding conclusion; that almost redeems the rest of the film.The story begins in Australia, in 1919 (four years after the end of World War I). Joshua Connor (Crowe) is a farmer, and water diviner, that's still obsessing over his three missing sons; who never returned home from the Battle of Gallipoli. His wife, Eliza (McKenzie), commits suicide; due to the presumed death of their boys. After the loss of Eliza, as well, Joshua decides to travel to Turkey; and bring back his sons.The film starts out promising, while setting up it's story (and characters), then it becomes really slow-moving (and dull). The movie really takes a turn for the worse, when a war-widowed love interest is introduced, for Crowe (played by Kurylenko). That's when the film gets really clichéd (and corny). It does come to an exciting, and pretty emotionally charged, conclusion though; that almost makes it all worthwhile. Crowe is good in the lead performance, but his directing skills can definitely use some work. I've also read that the movie is incredibly historically inaccurate, and insulting to some (many it appears, actually). The film is definitely not a very impressive directorial debut for Crowe; to say the least.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/uU2Z04j5ZzE",6,10,18,8 October 2015
Wonder Woman," Really happy with the progress it's helped advance for women in film!
","'WONDER WOMAN': Five Stars (Out of Five) The new superhero film based on the classic DC Comics character (of the same name), and the fourth movie in the DC Extended Universe. It's an origin story starring Gal Gadot as the titular character (a role she previously played in last year's 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE'). In this film she's an Amazon princess (in the year 1918) that aids an American pilot who crash lands on her home island of Themyscira (a place only inhabited by Amazonian women). She helps him try to stop the German Empire, from conquering the world during World War I, and she must leave her home for the first time in order to do so; by traveling with the pilot to London (where she becomes Wonder Woman for the first time). The film costars Chris Pine, Connie Nielson, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston and Elena Anaya. It was directed by Patty Jenkins (who also helmed the 2003 critically acclaimed female serial killer flick 'MONSTER') and it was written by Allan Heinberg, Zack Snyder (who also co-produced the movie) and Jason Fuchs. The blockbuster was made on a budget of $149 million, and it's the first summer tent pole superhero film directed by a woman. It's also received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, it was voted the most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2017 as well (in a recent pole), and it's exceeded all expectations at the Box Office (including becoming the biggest opening weekend ever for a film directed by a woman). I think it's one of the best superhero movies ever made.The story begins in modern day, with Wonder Woman (Gadot) recollecting on her past as a young Amazonian princess named Diana (Emily Carey). Diana is taught to be a powerful warrior, in case the God of War ever returns to the hidden island they live on. A United States Army Air Service Captain, named Steve Trevor (Pine), crash lands on their island and is being pursued by German military forces. After stopping the attacking soldiers, the Amazonian people interrogate Steve. They then learn about the war, and the threat it poses to the entire planet. Diana feels that it's her duty to go with Steve, and defeat the God of War (if she can find him).The film is a heck of a lot of fun; it's action-packed and the 'fish out of water' comedy scenes are hilariously classic (they're really well done). The movie is also surprisingly emotional, I even cried a little towards the end of the film. They couldn't have found a better director than Jenkins to direct this movie too. She really knows the character well, and she has a lot of passion for telling her story obviously. They couldn't have cast a better actress than Gadot in the title role either. She's perfect as Wonder Woman, and I think she gives the best performance of the year (so far). She's definitely a huge movie star waiting to happen; she's breathtakingly gorgeous and amazingly talented as well. I'm amazed at how much I actually love this film (I wasn't even excited to see it until recently too). It really blew me away, and I'm really happy with the progress it's helped advance for women in film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/221789603",10,6,17,6 June 2017
Despicable Me," 'Despicable Blockbuster'!
","'DESPICABLE ME': Three Stars (Out of Five) Comedians Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Will Arnett and Kristen Wiig all lend their voices to this popular animated blockbuster. Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud direct the CGI animated film, a first from Universal Pictures and it's Illumination Entertainment division. The script is written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (the same team behind the 'HORTON HEARS A WHO!' film, also featuring Carell's vocal talents in a leading role) from a story by long time animator and first time writer Sergio Pablos. The film is one of two popular CGI animated features this year revolving around a 'bad guy' who's not so bad at heart and learns to be good through love and appreciation (the other being the DreamWorks Animation blockbuster 'MEGAMIND', which I watched the same day).The film is set in a fictitious suburban town where evil criminal mastermind Gru (Carell) lives in a black dreary house. Underneath the house is a hidden workshop where dozens of little creatures, his minions, work on new gadgets like freezing and shrinking ray guns. Gru has been a genius since childhood but never been able to impress his overbearing mother (Julie Andrews). So he's turned to a life of crime and all things 'despicable'. When another evil villain known as Vector (unrecognizably voiced by Segel) steals the Egyptian pyramid and therefor tops Gru as the world's number one villain Gru devises a plan to shrink and steal the moon in order to win back his notoriety. After he steals the shrink gun necessary to pull off the heist Vector steals it from him and Gru will stop at nothing to get it back. He devises a plan that involves three orphan children sneaking into the young villains house with robot cookies and adopts the kids from a local orphanage in order to pull it off. While first quickly becoming annoyed and frustrated with the kids he of course learns to love them and this obviously gets in the way of his plans.The movie has a classic somewhat older style cartoon feel to it and the animation is interesting. While it is extremely silly, cheesy and ridiculous it's also very funny at times. The cast of voices are all excellent and humorous (although Carell obviously borrows a lot from Mike Myers' 'Dr. Evil'). There's definitely nothing new or unique to it and what little emotion there is to it is forced and over done but it's obviously intended for kids, and on that level it succeeds (I watched the movie with two of my nephews and they loved it). A good kids movie should be able to entertain adults as well as kids I always say and this move has enough funny and amusing moments to keep an older crowd interested as well. The film overall is a slightly above average animated comedy.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso",6,1,3,10 January 2011
Taken 2," About what you'd expect from a routine sequel with the number 2 in the title.
","'TAKEN 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The now iconic Liam Neeson returns to the role that made him an action star in this sequel to the 2008 surprise hit. The film is once again produced and co-written by action master Luc Besson. It's also co-written by Besson's usual writing partner Robert Mark Kamen (who also co-wrote the original). It was directed this time around by Olivier Megaton, who also directed the Besson and Kamen scripted action films 'TRANSPORTER 3' and 'COLOMBIANA'. Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser and Jon Gries reprise their roles from the first film and Rade Serbedzija joins the cast as the movie's main villain. If you liked the first film and just enjoy watching Liam Neeson kick some major ass you should enjoy this sequel but it has absolutely nothing fresh or new to offer.Neeson reprises his role as Bryan Mills, the unstoppable CIA badass. This time he's on assignment in Istanbul and has invited his ex-wife Lenore (Janssen) and daughter Kim (Grace) along with him. Just as Kim is starting a relationship with a young man (Luke Grimes), Bryan is suspicious of, Lenore is now having relationship troubles with her second husband. The trip gives Bryan a chance to rekindle his lost romance with his ex-wife, much to the delight of his daughter. Bad guys of course have to interrupt things though. The family of the men Bryan killed in the first film (while rescuing his kidnapped daughter) now want revenge and have tracked Mills to Istanbul. They're lead by Murad Krasniqi (Serbedzija), who especially wants revenge for the death of his son (who Mills electrocuted to death in the original film). They kidnap Bryan and Lenore but Bryan is able to warn his daughter in time for her to flee her captors. Kim then aids in the rescue of her parents this time around, by following the advice of her knowledgeable father.The movie is extremely fast paced and the bulk of it's action takes place over a matter of hours. The action is stylishly directed and exhilarating with Neeson once again showing what a cool badass he can be. Neeson has reached legendary status in film now and rivals any Hollywood tough guy (even at age 60). Janssen and Grace are beautiful but no acting is really required and Grace is getting way too old to play the sweet young daughter role. The movie, like all of Besson's films, is weak on dialogue and cheesy when it's mellow but when the action is roaring it's one hell of a ride. Nothing new or original at all but about what you'd expect from a routine sequel with the number 2 in the title.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo",7,0,1,17 October 2012
Straight Outta Compton," What's more beautiful than watching talented rebel artists change the world?!
","'STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Music biopic about the popular 80s/90s hip hop band N.W.A. (an abbreviation for Niggaz wit' Attitude), from Compton, California. The film focuses on rappers Ice Cube, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, MC Ren and DJ Yella. It was directed by F. Gary Gray; who also directed the 90s' comedy classic 'FRIDAY' (which was co-written by and starring Ice Cube). The movie stars O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (Ice Cube's son), Jason Mitchell, Corey Hawkins, Aldis Hodge, Neil Brown Jr. and Paul Giamatti. It was written by Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff, S. Leigh Savidge and Alan Wenkus; Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Gray were all producers on the film as well. I really enjoyed the movie and found it educational (and inspiring) too.The movie begins in 1986; when friends Easy-E (Mitchell), Ice Cube (Jackson, Jr.) and Dr. Dre (Hawkins) formed the rap band N.W.A.. MC Ren (Hodge) and DJ Yella (Brown Jr.) later joined the group; although this is not covered in the film (as their parts are not fully developed). Easy-E first bankrolled their project; and formed his own record label, with producer Jerry Heller (Giamatti), called Ruthless Records. After releasing a hit single, 'Boyz-n-the-Hood', and doing a successful show; the band was later picked up by Priority Records. The movie covers their entire rise and fall from fame, as they caused a music (and social) revolution. I've never been a huge rap or hip hop music fan, and I never followed (or listened) to the group N.W.A., but I did enjoy learning all about them in this film (and I do now like their music). For me the movie was very informative, and I also really liked the style (and look) of the film (thanks to Gray's excellent direction). The performances are decent enough, and the social commentary couldn't be more fitting to the times today; the film largely deals with race relations and police brutality (and it doesn't seem like much has changed, between then and now). The movie's a little long, and slow paced in places, but for the most part it's very entertaining and inspiring; what's more beautiful than watching talented rebel artists change the world?!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/iHtyjLDJ1Ko",9,9,40,27 August 2015
The Woman in Black," It is good to see Radcliffe trying other things post 'Harry Potter'!
","'THE WOMAN IN BLACK': Three Stars (Out of Five) Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) stars in this supernatural thriller about a lawyer who goes up against an evil spirit at a remote village in early 1900's England. The film is based on the book of the same name by Susan Hill. It was written by Jane Goldman and directed by James Watkins. The film is slow paced and light on thrills but effectively moody and Radcliffe is decent doing something other than Potter.Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer dealing with the death of his wife. He travels to a remote village for work in order to settle the estate of an English manor owned by a recently deceased woman. The locals want him to leave but he refuses and he soon finds out the reason why. The manor is haunted by the ghost of a woman in black, who preys on children.The movie is extremely slow paced and I found it very hard to stay interested in what was going on. The mood and look of the film is sufficiently spooky though and when something does happen it's somewhat creepy and frightening. It is good to see Radcliffe trying other things post 'Harry Potter' and he's adequate here. Hopefully his star won't die with the end of his popular franchise because he does have talent and hopefully he'll show it off in better projects than this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fii0IC2l7o",6,0,0,15 May 2012
X-Men: First Class," The hardcore nerds of course will never be pleased but most fans should be thrilled!
","'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Prequel to the other four 'X-MEN' films detailing the origins of the first 'X-Men' team (in 1962) and focusing primarily on the friendship, that later turned to rivalry, between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (who later became known as Professor X and Magneto).  The film was directed and co-written by Matthew Vaughn (also well known for adapting another popular comic book to film, 'KICK-ASS').  The script was also worked on by five other writers including Bryan Singer (the filmmaker behind the first two, much more loved, 'X-MEN' films), who was also set to direct this film before taking a producing seat instead in order to helm another project.  The movie stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne, January Jones and Nicholas Hoult.  It's not quite as good as the first two installments but it is far superior to the last two.  Despite a somewhat rocky start it's an extremely satisfying and entertaining thrill ride that is sure to please most die-hard fans of the comics and movie series.The film opens with a scene from the first 'X-MEN' movie in which Erik is a child in a German concentration camp in 1944 and bends a metal gate, using his mutant ability to control metals, in an attempt to free his parents.  A scientist named Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) witnesses this and while trying to provoke the boy's power murders his mother.  Several years later Erik (Fassbender) is now obsessed with revenge.  While trying to murder Shaw he teams up with Xavier (McAvoy), the worlds most powerful telepath, who teaches him to harness his inner rage and better control his powers.  The two lead a team of young gifted mutants such as themselves in conjunction with the CIA.  Their ideas on what's best for their kind of course clashes and eventually challenges their friendship.The film is not as fun as the other installments, it's slower paced and extremely moody, but it is more serious and in many ways more faithful to it's source material. There are several inconsistency flaws with the other film chapters (if you thought the 'STAR WARS' prequels were bad, they're nothing compared to this) which is why many fans thought the filmmakers should have done a completely new reboot rather than a prequel. The inconsistencies don't really effect the overall quality of the film though. Once again they tried to pack too many characters and too many major events into one film and it's far too convoluted at times, early on, but it does pick up and get better as the film goes along.  The major characters are well thought out and relatable. The film, as with the entire series, grapples with the difficult society challenges faced with being an individual and different than the norm. This is where the movie is the strongest in many ways (as with the early two films), battling discrimination is a very emotional and serious topic for many and this chapter once again does an admirable job relating the issue. The action is of course stellar as well and Vaughn is once again in top form behind the camera. The performances are impressive all around once again as well, especially Fassbender, who's a star to watch out for. I'm becoming a big fan of Lawrence and she's good in this movie but it's hardly comparable to her Oscar nominated work from last year (in 'WINTER'S BONE'). Still it's nice to see her giving any of her talents to a comic book fanboy film like this. There's some nice surprise cameos as well. The film is pretty much grade A material all around. The hardcore nerds of course will never be pleased with anything that isn't the page reincarnated panel by panel on the big screen but most fans should be thrilled.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1S3pjephF8",10,4,10,7 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that!
","'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY': One Star (Out of Five)The blockbuster film adaptation of the best-selling book, of the same name, about a 21-year-old virgin college student, who engages in an increasingly disturbing relationship with a sadomasochist industrialist. It was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and written by Kelly Marcel. The novel was written by E.L. James and was first published as 'Twilight' fan fiction, on different fan websites. The movie stars young newcomers Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, as it's two leads. Both the book and it's film adaptation have been heavily criticized for promoting sexual abuse and violence against women (by The National Center on Sexual Exploitation and various other people and groups); although the movie is supposedly extremely toned down from the novel it's adapted from (including the elimination of a scene of questionable rape). I found the film to be very disturbing, as well as laughably bad and pretty poorly made. Critics, and a majority of viewers, have mostly found the film adaptation to be better made than the book though (even though it maintains an average rating of 4.2, out of 10, on both the rottentomatoes and IMDb websites).Johnson stars as Anastasia Steele; a 21-year-old undergraduate at Washington State University. When her roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford), becomes sick and is unable to interview a rich Seattle businessman, named Christian Grey (Dornan), for the college paper, she asks Anastasia to fill in for her. When she meets Christian, Anastasia is clumsy, awkward and very shy. He's immediately drawn to her for these reasons. Grey then proceeds to stalk her; at the hardware store where she works and then at a bar, she calls him drunk from. He takes her home to his place, when she passes out wasted. Despite all the entrepreneur's illegal, and extremely creepy, behavior towards her, Anastasia also finds herself drawn to him and the two begin a sexual relationship. Christian explains that he's a dominant and he wants Anastasia to be his submissive. When she's initially repelled by the idea, he continues to harass her into signing a legal contract; to become his sex slave. First of all the movie is really poorly written and badly acted; but I've heard the book is even worse. It's also shockingly dull and feels drastically unemotional, and very dry, for most of it's 2 hour running length. I found parts of it amusing, and I do like the way it ends, but mostly I found this film to be a complete waste of time; for anyone looking for quality entertainment at all. I also agree with the criticisms that it does promote abusive relationships and violence against women. The central relationship depicted in the movie is definitely not a healthy one, in the slightest, and the Christian Grey character is very much an abusive sexual predator. The fact that the film pretends to be some kind of a romance, as well, is really insulting (to everyone). I've always been attracted to domineering women (mostly as fantasy) but not in any way similar to this. I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbh5F6Mfw",2,1,4,6 March 2015
The Wolverine," Still not the perfectly ideal 'Wolverine' film but it's a damn good one!
","'THE WOLVERINE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sixth 'X-MEN' film and second revolving around the popular Marvel superhero Wolverine. Hugh Jackman launched his movie star career playing the character (and is now the third highest paid actor in Hollywood), here he plays the role for the sixth time (counting a cameo in 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'). The movie takes place multiple years after all the other 'X-MEN' films and revolves around Wolverine traveling to Japan to meet a former soldier he saved from a nuclear blast, during World War II, who's now on his deathbed. He finds his healing powers severely suppressed as he must battle well trained samurai and a sexy mutant femme fatale with an immunity to poisons. The film is not only vastly superior to the last 'WOLVERINE' film, 'X-MEN ORIGINS', but it's also an extremely impressive superhero action film given it's the sixth installment in it's franchise. The film begins in a flashback of 1945 when Wolverine (Jackman), also known as Logan, is being held in a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki, as it suffers an atomic bombing. He rescues a Japanese officer named Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) who several decades later (during present day) calls on Wolverine for help (at his deathbed). Logan is living alone in the Yukon where he's haunted by nightmares of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen reprising her role), who he had to kill at the end of the film 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND', when a mutant working for Yashida, named Yukio (Rila Fukushima), comes looking for him. She convinces him to come with her to Japan to say goodbye to Yashida before he passes on. Once there Yashida tries to convince Logan to give him his healing powers and live the normal life he always wanted to (as he explains he knows how to transfer his special abilities from one body to another). Logan refuses but finds his powers weakened the next day anyway. He then must battle ruthless samurai and a seductive poisonous mutant who spits poison, called Viper (played by the gorgeous Svetlana Khodchenkova), as he struggles to protect Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), from their attack.The film is based on the 1982 limited comic series 'Wolverine' by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. It was scripted by Mark Bomback, Scott Frank and Christopher McQuarrie and directed by James Mangold. Mangold also directed the hit films 'WALK THE LINE', '3:10 TO YUMA' and 'KATE & LEOPOLD' (also starring Jackman). The movie is action packed, intense and always involving. Jackman is the perfect Wolverine once again and Khodchenkova makes the perfect seductive villain (she's one of my favorite parts of the movie). It's surprisingly dark and somewhat disturbing for a superhero comic book movie. Mangold did an excellent job with the atmosphere and the screenplay was definitely well written. From what I understand it's pretty faithful to the comics (with a few minor changes here and there) and ultimately lives up to what fans want to see for once. While it's not as good as the first two 'X-MEN' films (which are two of my all time favorite movies) or the last installment, 'FIRST CLASS', it is greatly superior to 'X-MEN ORIGINS' and 'THE LAST STAND'. It's still not the perfectly ideal 'Wolverine' film but it's a damn good one!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxMJBjPRxAc",9,4,10,14 August 2013
Win Win," 'WIN WIN' is definitely a win for writer/director Thomas McCarthy!
","'WIN WIN': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another sweet hearted character study from actor turned writer/director Thomas McCarthy (who also performed the same duties on the popular indie films 'THE STATION AGENT' and 'THE VISITOR'). This film focuses on a down on his luck attorney/high school wrestling coach who finds new hope when a promising young wrestler shows up in town. Paul Giamatti stars as the attorney / coach and ex high school wrestler Alex Shaffer makes his film debut as the hopeful talent. The film co-stars Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Burt Young and Melanie Lynskey. It's a very humorous and sincere drama that succeeds on almost every level.Giamatti plays Mike Flaherty who's recently been suffering panic attacks due to very slow business at his independent New Jersey law firm. He's been severely struggling to make enough money to provide for his wife Jackie (Ryan) and two young daughters even though he holds a second job coaching wrestling at the New Providence High School, who are also on a losing streak. He sees an opportunity to make some easy extra money when a client suffering from dementia named Leo (Young) finds himself in need of a caretaker. He takes on the extra task in a somewhat morally questionable way. Then when Leo's grandson Kyle shows up at Leo's door, on the run from his drug addicted mother (Lynskey) and her abusive boyfriend, he sees an inspiring new addition to his wrestling team, due to Kyle's former championship experience at his old school.The film is very funny at times but it never seems forced, it feels like real humor coming from real people. It's also very touching and emotionally involving but never overly sappy, as with the comedy, the drama of the film just feels very natural as well. This is probably largely due to McCarthy's simplistic but fitting directing and wonderful screenplay, which is adapted from a story co-written by McCarthy and Joe Tiboni (a first time film writer). The acting is all more than adequate as well, especially Giamatti (who can basically do no wrong) and newcomer Shaffer. The film is an all around satisfying and entertaining comedy-drama that just seems to hit all the right notes.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr4LOQxrmg",8,1,3,3 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," If the film has one flaw it is just that it's too ambitious!
","'THE DARK KNIGHT RISES': Five Stars (Out of Five)The third and final chapter in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy! This film has Bruce Wayne coming out of retirement and dawning the bat cape once again in order to defend Gotham City from an evil terrorist named Bane. Batman also has to deal with the master cat burglar Catwoman who definitely complicates things for Bruce Wayne. Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy all reprise their roles from the other films. They're joined this time around by Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard (who all take on key roles in the new film). Nolan directed and co-wrote the film with his brother Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer. The film is extremely grand in scale and does a good job of bringing the Batman saga to an epic conclusion.The film picks up eight years after the events of 'THE DARK KNIGHT' with Gotham City in peace and most of the criminals off the streets due to the Dent Act. Commissioner Gordon (Oldman) has managed to keep Harvey Dent's reputation intact by keeping to he and Batman's (Bale) plan of letting the Caped Crusader take the blame for Dent's crimes. Due to this the Batman hasn't been seen or heard from in eight years and Bruce Wayne has disappeared as well, a crippled hollow shell of the man he once was. His loyal companion Alfred (Caine) urges him to move on with his life but Bruce feels he is still needed and when he hears of a new terrorist plan to take over Gotham by a brute calling himself Bane (Hardy) Batman returns to action once again. Things are also complicated by a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Hathaway) who enables Bane and his partners to strip Wayne of his fortune. Gordon takes a new hot headed young detective (Gordon-Levitt) under his wing as well, going by the name of John Blake. Blake has had past experiences with Batman and Bruce Wayne and manages to figure out the two are one in the same. The movie (like most Batman films) has a lot of characters and way too much going on for one film. It stretches to a nearly exhausting running time of 2 hours and 45 minutes but the epic story does deserve such grand treatment in my opinion. Like Nolan's other Batman films it's rich in character development, clever dialogue, stunning visuals and spectacular action scenes. Nolan's directing is superb and Hans Zimmer's score is breathtaking. The acting is all exceptional. I wasn't entirely sold with Hathaway as the femme fatale Catwoman because I don't think she's that beautiful or sexy. She is a decent actress though and does what she can with the role, making it work for the most part. Gordon-Levitt is a great addition to the series and the twist involving his character is rewarding (one I saw coming from the first trailer he was included in). Bale is a little underused in the lead role this time around as the film tends to seem more like an ensemble piece than a movie primarily about Batman. Hardy steals the show though in the film's biggest role (both by screen time as well as the massive size of the character). He has become my favorite actor recently, with his incomparable ability to blend into each role he takes on seamlessly. For this role he did put on over 30 lbs of muscle and fat making him almost unrecognizable (while dawning the mask the character wears as well). His voice is a little too cartoonish and strange but Hardy's presence and passionate performance steal the show once again. Not quite as memorable as Heath Ledger's Joker but still a very memorable villain. If the film has one flaw it is just that it's too ambitious, perhaps it would have been better broken in to multiple films, but it does give the viewer much more than they pay for. While it's not quite as good as it's predecessor it's still a masterpiece that will please fans of the characters for many years to come!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKNLyy6lGng",10,1,5,23 July 2012
The Croods," Really reminded me of 'THE FLINTSTONES'.
","'THE CROODS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Blockbuster DreamWorks Animation film about a family of cavemen venturing outside their cave for the first time. It stars the voices of Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds, Emma Stone, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman. It was directed and co-written (with actor John Cleese) by Chris Sanders (who also does a voice in the film) and Kirk De Micco. Sanders is also famous for co-directing such animated blockbusters as 'HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON' and 'LILO & STITCH' (which he also voiced the title character Stitch in). He also co-wrote those films as well as 'THE LION KING', 'ALADDIN', 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST', 'MULAN' and others. This film doesn't quite live up to most others on Sanders' resume but it is a decent animated kids' film.The movie follows a family (the 'Croods') living in the fictional prehistoric time known as the 'Croodaceous' period. The time was populated by a lot of fantastical creatures and a very small amount of humans. The Croods were lead by the father, Grug (Cage), who was obsessed with never letting his family do anything dangerous or try anything new (and kept them mostly hidden in a cave). This drove his teenage daughter Eep (Stone) crazy, who constantly dreamt of adventures. One day Eep does venture outside the cave and meets a very intelligent young man named Guy (Reynolds). The rest of the family goes out looking for her when their cave is destroyed. The Croods then must travel across the land, with Guy as a guide, in search of a new home and safety.The film is colorful and visually pleasant. It's also funny and adventurous at times. All of the cast is more than adequate in the film (especially Cage in the lead). What it really reminded me of was 'THE FLINTSTONES', with Cage playing a character very similar to 'Fred Flintstone'. I grew up on that show so the movie is mildly entertaining to me. If you enjoyed that cartoon you'll probably enjoy this movie as well (and kids will probably love it). It's nothing spectacular but it is decent family entertainment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",5,2,4,9 August 2013
Black Panther," One of Marvel Cinema's best movies.
","'BLACK PANTHER': Five Stars (Out of Five)The eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, based on the Marvel Comics character Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman reprises the title role (who first appeared in 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and the movie costars Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker. It was directed by Ryan Coogler, who also helmed the critically acclaimed hits 'FRUITVALE STATION' and 'CREED' (which also both starred Jordan), and it was written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (based on characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby). The story revolves around the African superhero returning home to the nation of Wakanda, where he is now king, but his leadership is challenged by a new enemy. The film has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's being called (by some) a revolutionary cultural movement (in much the same way that 'WONDER WOMAN' was last year). It's also projected to break records at the Box Office, and become Marvel Cinema's biggest hit to date. I really enjoyed it as well. The story begins right after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', with T'Challa (Boseman) returning home to the African nation of Wakanda. Since his father was killed, T'Challa is named the new king of Wakanda. At the same time a Wakandan exile, going by the name of Killmonger (Jordan), has aligned himself with a South African black-market arms dealer, named Ulysses Klaue (Serkis), and is plotting to overthrow T'Challa. T'Challa, as the superhero Black Panther, attempts to stop Klaue from stealing more vibranium (while unaware of Killmonger's involvement). Two female special forces agents (Nyong'o and Gurira), CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Freeman), and T'Challa's teenage sister Shuri (Wright), all end up aiding him on this mission.I have to agree that this is one of Marvel Cinema's best movies, and I think it's cultural significance (and popularity) is really inspiring too. While I don't think it's quite as good a film as 'WONDER WOMAN' is, it's still a masterpiece in it's own right. It's great that superhero movies (in general) are becoming such a respected, and revolutionary art form too. Haters will of course still hate the film (as they did 'WONDER WOMAN' as well, and anything that creates such powerful progress like this), but everyone else should definitely enjoy it (unless you just really hate superhero movies). The action scenes are spectacular, the performances are all good, the humor is clever and witty, and the dramatic scenes are moving (and briefly touching too). Coogler once again proves what a talented director he is, and he appears to be the perfect filmmaker for this important movie.",10,10,36,16 February 2018
Mother!," Like all of Aronofsky's movies, the film is completely bizarre and unpleasant to sit through!
","'MOTHER!': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new psychological horror flick from writer/director Darren Aronofsky, and starring Jennifer Lawrence (the two are now a couple as well). The story revolves around a woman who's quaint life, living with her poet husband in a quiet country home, is severely disrupted when a mysterious couple shows up wanting to stay at their house. The movie costars Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. It's gotten polarized reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it disappointed at the Box Office as well. I found it to be really weird, creepy and hard to watch, but at the same time it's also extremely interesting and quite memorable. The story begins with a woman, called Mother (Lawrence), materializing in a bed and waking up from her sleep. She begins searching her quiet country house, for her husband, Him (Bardem). Him is a poet with writer's block, and his creative struggles have caused distress among their once happy home. Then two strangers unexpectedly show up (Harris and Pfeiffer). Him welcomes them into their house without questions, while Mother fears what damage the mysterious couple could possibly do. Things become even more complicated, and distressful for Mother, from there. Like all of Aronofsky's movies, the film is completely bizarre and unpleasant to sit through. Also like his films 'NOAH' and 'THE FOUNTAIN', this movie is another biblical analogy about creation, life and God. As dark and weird as it all is, the film does have some very insightful things to say about people's belief in Jesus Christ, and the Christian Lord. I think the movie is very effective in this way. I can definitely see why so many viewers have hated the film so far (it's gotten an F rating from theatergoers), but I think the right audience should definitely still enjoy it. Lawrence gives another amazing performance in the movie, and the story will leave you thinking about things in it for days (weeks, months and perhaps years). It's another unique 'near masterpiece' from Darren Aronofsky (in my opinion).Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234",9,3,10,20 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Definitely not one for the kids!
","'BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The second movie in the 'DC Extended Universe'; following 2013's 'MAN OF STEEL', and leading up to the upcoming 'JUSTICE LEAGUE' films. This superhero flick finds Superman taking on Batman, as well as his archenemy Lex Luthor. Zack Snyder (who also helmed 'MAN OF STEEL') returned to direct the movie, and Henry Cavill also returned to star as Superman (and his alter ego Clark Kent). The film was once again co-written by David S. Goyer (who also co-scripted 'MAN OF STEEL', 'BATMAN BEGINS', 'THE DARK KNIGHT' and 'THE DARK KNIGHT RISES'; all with filmmaker Christopher Nolan, and his brother Jonathan) and Chris Terrio (who won an Oscar for writing the Ben Affleck helmed 'ARGO', which also starred Affleck). The movie also costars Ben Affleck (as Batman), Gal Gadot (as Wonder Woman; in the character's live-action theatrical film debut), Jesse Eisenberg (as Lex Luthor), Jeremy Irons (as Alfred); and Amy Adams, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne (all reprising their roles from 'MAN OF STEEL'). The film also (briefly) debuts the characters Aquaman, Flash and Cyborb (in their live- action theatrical film debuts as well). I absolutely love this movie! The story revolves around Bruce Wayne (Affleck), who's now a veteran vigilante (called Batman), becoming increasingly concerned about the possible dangers of Superman (Cavill); an extremely powerful alien. He travels to Metropolis, from Gotham City, to fight him. At the same time, Superman (also known as Clark Kent, in his civilian disguise) is forced to take on a new dangerous opponent; a young businessman named Lex Luthor (Eisenberg). Wonder Woman (Gadot) also joins the mix!The film is extremely dark, and very grim; and it'll be interesting to see what the R-rated video release cut is like. It's definitely not a kids' movie, that's for sure, but neither are Snyder's earlier comic book flicks (like 'WATCHMEN' and '300'). It's brilliantly structured and paced (at 2.5 hours, the film nearly flies by). I was really happy to see the movie not get bogged down in overblown (mindless) action scenes, like so many other big-budget superhero flicks do; most notably (recently) 'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON' and 'MAN OF STEEL' (actually). This film has well developed characters, and an extremely involving storyline (even though it's excessively dark). The action scenes are spectacular as well, when they do come, but they're actually an important part of the story (and not just pointless stupidity). The performances are all great, especially Eisenberg and Affleck; and I remember when nearly everyone thought he'd be a horrible Batman (don't hear any complaints now). Cal Gadot is also 'drop dead gorgeous' in her role (she's absolutely stunning)! It's an all around awesome superhero flick; but definitely not one for the kids!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U",10,11,20,25 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," Entertaining musical, if you like musicals.
","'THE GREATEST SHOWMAN': Three Stars (Out of Five)A period musical about how P.T. Barnum started the Barnum and Bailey Circus. The movie stars Hugh Jackman as Barnum, and it costars Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson. It was directed by debut feature filmmaker Michael Gracey, and it was scripted by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon (Condon is also well known for his writing on musicals like 'DREAMGIRLS', 'CHICAGO' and the 81st Annual Academy Awards). The film has performed modestly at the Box Office, and it's only gotten mixed to negative reviews from critics, but it was nominated for three major Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Actor - Comedy or Musical, and Best Original Song). I like how the movie deals with making outcasts into heroes (of course), but I always take offense to animal cruelty (like a circus is obviously guilty of). The film as a whole is a decently made musical, but nothing more. The story revolves around the immensely ambitious entertainer, and showman, P.T. Barnum (Jackman), and how he convinced a bunch of outcasts to be a part of his show. Which famously became the first circus (later becoming the traveling 'Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus'). The movie of course deals with all of the hardships he faced, and opposition from society. It also deals with Barnum's romantic and family issues at the time. The film is an entertaining musical, if you like musicals, and it's packed with colorful musical performances. Jackman, Efron, and others, are of course talented entertainers, and musical performers as well, so you can't argue that they weren't well cast in the movie. I also (of course) always find stories about making outcasts into heroes inspiring. The film doesn't introduce animals into the circus act, until the very end of the movie, but I (of course) have issues with that, and circuses in general too. The movie as a whole is decently made, and a mildly amusing musical.",6,1,3,4 January 2018
Monsters University," I liked it but I expect a little more from Pixar films.
","'MONSTERS UNIVERSITY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Pixar's animated prequel to their 2001 monster hit 'MONSTERS, INC.' reunites stars Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the voices of monsters Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan. The film tells of how the two met in college and sought after their dreams of becoming 'scarers', while constantly trying to outdo each other. It's a buddy film, like the first, and also Pixar's first campus college flick (in the same tradition as 'ANIMAL HOUSE'). It was directed by Dan Scanlon and written by Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird and Scanlon. It features supporting voice cast members like Steve Buscemi, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, Nathan Fillion, Aubrey Plaza, John Krasinski, Bonnie Hunt, Bill Hader, Tyler Labine, Helen Mirren and John Ratzenberger (of course). I was not a huge fan of the original, despite the fact that I'm a big monster movie fan, and have always thought it to be one of Pixar's lesser films. I'd rank this prequel about the same, although it is quite a bit more impressive than Pixar's last animated sequel (2011's 'CARS 2'). Crystal reprises his role as Mike Wazowski and Goodman once again plays James P. Sullivan. The two are best friends in the original film and work as scarers, scaring children in order to provide enough electricity to keep their city's power running. In this prequel they meet in college at 'Monsters University' (despite the fact that it's mentioned, in the original film, that they've known each other since the fourth grade). They're immediately rivals as Sullivan has always gotten by on his size and natural scary looks while Wazowski has had to work hard to be a scarer (despite the fact that he's not naturally scary at all). The film explores how they learn to overcome their differences and work together and respect one another. The movie is beautifully animated and full of great visuals (but it did reportedly cost over $270 million to make, making it one of the most expensive films ever made). It's funny in places but what I most like about it is it's creativeness with different creature characters (like the original). I hate animated films that are full of dumbed down kids humor but the Pixar films are usually better in this way (than most). This film is clever and full of good message for kids and it's creative but it's also full of college and buddy movie clichés and doesn't have a lot of new ideas to offer (other than the creative creatures). I liked it but I expect a little more from Pixar films. Having not liked the original and really disliking Pixar's last sequel I didn't have too high of expectations for this. It's a good film but not a great one I'd say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAefz9rzS5w",7,1,2,17 July 2013
Toy Story 3," You've got to admire the heart that goes into making these movies and it's especially obvious in films like this!
","'TOY STORY 3': Four Stars (Out of Five) Woody (once again voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and all of the rest of the gang are back for this third 'TOY STORY' adventure, eleven years after the last film. It once again rehashes the story of Woody and the others feeling threatened and unwanted by their owner Andy (once again voiced by John Morris) as he turns 17 and leaves for college. They're mistakenly dropped off at a daycare where tired older toys want them to be the sole victims of the wild and obnoxious children there. Only Woody knows they're truly wanted back home and does his best to rescue them and get them back to Andy.The film is only co-written by the original two films' creator John Lasseter and is directed by Lee Unkrich, who served as a co-director on 'TOY STORY 2'. It does seem a little old and drawn out at times, early on, but then it really builds to a somewhat seriously suspenseful and emotional conclusion. Some of the drama and humor seems forced but some of it feels really genuine and funny as well, especially as the film goes on. I don't agree that this is the masterpiece that some are describing it but it's definitely a lot better than most other kids' films out there (as most Pixar films are).The 'TOY STORY' movies aren't my favorites of the Pixar films; I really like 'THE INCREDIBLES' and 'WALL-E' the best, but they're definitely better than stuff like 'MONSTERS, INC.' and 'A BUG'S LIFE'. The thing you have to really admire about all of the Pixar films though is the effort and passion of the entire team of filmmakers that went into making them; this is definitely obvious on the screen. The greatest example of this is 'AVATAR' but all film really is the most collaborative art form there is and therefor, in my opinion, the most impressive one.

Pitch Perfect 3," I really wish they would have stopped after 2!
","'PITCH PERFECT 3': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third film in the comedy/musical trilogy about a young women a cappella group, called the Barden Bellas (from Barden University). In this (supposedly) final installment, the girls reunite (years after they graduated) for one final singing competition, at a USO tour overseas. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Hailee Steinfeld, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins all reprise their roles from earlier films. While Ruby Rose, John Lithgow, Andy Allo, Matt Lanter and DJ Khaled join the cast. It was directed by Trish Sie (who also helmed the 2014 musical/dance flick 'STEP UP ALL IN'), and it was written by Kay Cannon (who also wrote the first two movies) and Mike White (who also wrote the 2003 musical/comedy flick 'SCHOOL OF ROCK'). The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office. I found it to be mostly a bore, and unamusing, but I did highly enjoy the first two movies. Years after graduating from Barden University, and winning the world championship, the Bellas get back together at their friend's, and former Bella (Steinfeld), show. There they reminisce, and talk about how they miss singing, and that each of their lives have not turned out the way they had hoped. The girls then decide to accept an invite to perform at the USO tour overseas, with other musical groups. Once there they find out that the show is also a competition, and the Bellas get very intensely involved in this competition once again. Every time a 'PITCH PERFECT' movie comes out, I'm never eager to see it, because I don't think I'll really like it that much. I was pleasantly surprised with the first two movies, and I actually gave them each 4.5 star ratings (because they're great 'feel-good' musicals actually). So I had higher hopes for this one, but the trailers still didn't sell me on it, and I was definitely not pleasantly surprised with it (when I did see it, on opening night). I really wish they would have stopped after 2!",5,12,23,25 December 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," Doesn't deserve the Oscar hype!
","'SAVING MR. BANKS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Disney's Oscar hopeful about the production of their 1964 classic 'MARRY POPPINS'. The title 'SAVING MR. BANKS' refers to the father in that film (and the book it's based on). It centers around the novel's author, P. L. Travers, and Walt Disney's struggles to adapt her popular work into a movie. Emma Thompson stars as Travers and Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney. The film also features Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzman, B. J. Novak and Kathy Baker in supporting roles. It's overly sappy and doesn't deserve awards attention but it is a decent family drama film.Thompson plays Pamela 'P. L.' Travers (as an adult) in the movie, which is set in 1961 and also has flashbacks to 1907 (when Pamela was just a young girl growing up in Australia). The film revolves around Walt Disney's (Hanks) attempts to convince Travers to let him turn her popular kids' book, 'Marry Poppins', into a Disney movie. Travers was very reluctant to do so and didn't trust Disney. She also didn't want any changes made to her story. The film focuses on Disney's long fight to win over Travers and also pays a lot of attention to Travers' inner struggles with letting go of her past. Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic but loving father (in the 1907 flashbacks).The film is entertaining but it's drama and sentimentality seems really forced. I like a good emotional and touching movie but not when it's forced down my throat (like Disney often does with their films). I enjoyed Hanks and Thompson's performances but the P.L. Travers character is just a little too unlikeable (to relate to at all). It is funny though and the supporting cast is all good as well. It just feels way too much like a Disney movie (in a modern 'bad' way; not like the good old classics). Other than the forced drama it definitely isn't a bad film though (it just doesn't deserve the Oscar hype).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAefz9rzS5w",7,0,2,27 December 2013
Son of Saul," World War II flicks are always good Oscar bait; at least this one offers something fresh!
","'SON OF SAUL': Four Stars (Out of Five)This year's Oscar winning Best Foreign Language film, is this World War II drama flick. It's about a concentration camp prisoner, who's forced to burn the bodies of his own people, that goes on an obsessive mission to give a deceased boy a proper burial. The movie was directed by first time feature filmmaker Laszlo Nemes; and it was written by Nemes and Clara Royer. The film stars Geza Rohrig; a New York City-based Hungarian poet (that hadn't acted since the 1980s!). It's received mostly rave reviews from critics, and I mostly agree with them.The story takes place in a 1944 Auschwitz concentration camp. Saul Auslander (Rohrig) is a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner there, that's forced to help cremate fellow Jews. One day he notices that a young boy is still breathing; after being gassed in a Nazi gas chamber. The boy is killed, by a prison doctor, and an autopsy is ordered. Saul makes it his mission to rescue the corpse; and give it a proper burial. He spends the next day-and-a-half trying to locate a rabbi to help him. The movie is oddly filmed in the 'found footage' format; which isn't possible (given the time period it's set in) but it's still an interesting directing tool. It makes the film seem more claustrophobic, but it also makes it seem much slower-paced (which can be very frustrating at times). Overall I found the movie to be very creative, interesting and horrific; and (like other films of it's type) it seems just as much like a horror movie as a drama. World War II flicks are always good Oscar bait; at least this one offers something fresh, and original, as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/EuKmXpjFt-k",8,0,4,11 March 2016
Thor: The Dark World," About as good as the original.
","'THOR: THE DARK WORLD': Four Stars (Out of Five)Chris Hemsworth returns as the titular superhero in this sequel to 2011's hit Marvel Comics adaptation film 'THOR'. It's also the eighth movie in 'The Avengers' Marvel film franchise universe. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Thor's villainous brother Loki, Anthony Hopkins once again plays his father Odin and Natalie Portman returns as his earthling love interest Jane Foster. Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Rene Russo all reprise their roles from the original film with newcomers Christopher Eccleston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jonathan Howard, Chris O'Dowd and Zachary Levi (now playing Fandral) all joining the cast. In this installment Thor must battle 'Dark Elves' trying to gain control of a powerful weapon known as the Aether, which would send the universe into total darkness. The story is irrelevant; the epic action, visuals and superhero spectacle (that fans expect from a Marvel's 'Avengers' film) is all there! Fans of the original won't be disappointed.Many years ago Odin's father Bor (Tony Curran) defeated the Dark Elves, as they tried to gain control of the Aether and destroy the universe. Bor hid the powerful weapon in a stone column but unknown to him the Dark Elves' leader Malekith (Eccleston), and his surviving followers, hid themselves in suspended animation. In present day Jane Foster (Portman) finds the Aether and is infected by it. When she disappears, for several hours, Thor (Hemsworth) returns to Earth to find her. He brings her back to Asgard with him, so his people can find out what happened to her, but Malekith and his Dark Elves army have awakened and soon attack Asgard looking for Jane and the Aether (once again). Thor must turn to his brother Loki (Hiddleston), who's now locked up for his crimes on Earth, for help. Like with a lot of big action movies (especially superhero films) the plot line is confusing and uninvolving but it doesn't really matter in a film like this. People come to see the characters and action and as long as a film like this is visually stunning and well cast (and some decent dialogue helps as well) then fans will be pleased. I think 'Thor' fans will definitely be pleased with this movie (I was). I'd say the movie is about as good as the original; it's grander in scale and a bit more epic but it also lacks some of the awe that made the first film so entertaining. Fans of the comic book will probably get more of a kick out of it (as they're more likely to follow what's going on and pick up on easter eggs); I have friends that read the 'Thor' comics that have really enjoyed both movies. I don't think it quite lives up to the best comic book films but it is better than most. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are once again both outstanding in their roles and Alan Taylor (the film's new director) does a decent job directing. Portman is once again underused (and she's really above roles like this) and the script (by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) is pretty routine but the movie still has plenty of what fans are looking for!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",8,1,5,12 November 2013
Lucy," Much more fantastical than intelligent science fiction.
","'LUCY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sci-Fi action flick written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Scarlett Johansson as an American woman, living in Taiwan, who's forced into transferring a powerful drug, hidden in her abdomen. When the drug starts leaking it allows the woman to use her brain's full functioning capacity, which in turn gives her super powers. The film costars Morgan Freeman, Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked. The film deals with some interesting theories but it's much more fantastical than intelligent science fiction. Still it's action-packed and pretty entertaining.Johansson plays Lucy, a young American woman who's living in Taipei, Taiwan. She just began dating a drug mule there, named Richard (Pilou Asbaek). After Richard makes Lucy do his job for him, and he's killed, the Korean gangster he was working for, Mr. Jang (Min-sik), forces Lucy to take his place. A powerful synthetic drug, called CPH4, is sewn into her stomach and she, and three others, are forced into transferring the drugs into Europe. After being beaten, by one of Jang's men, the drug begins to leak inside her. This makes her increasingly smarter; which gives her special abilities. Freeman plays a Professor that Lucy goes to for help.The theory that we only use 10% of our brain's capacity is heavily explored in this film (although most scientists say it's just a myth). In this movie when Lucy begins using 20% of her brain, and increasingly higher amounts, she develops super human abilities; like telekinesis and mental time travel. She keeps getting more and more powerful, self aware and also increasingly emotionless. This makes her character seem extremely unrelatable; she's still an awesome action heroine though. Besson is well known for doing action flicks with really strong female characters (like 'LA FEMME NIKITA', 'THE FIFTH ELEMENT' and 'THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC'). Johansson's character here continues that tradition. As an action flick it works but it's definitely not full of intelligent big ideas. It does try to do something different but it's still highly reminiscent of other recent sci-fi flicks like 'TRANSCENDENCE' and even 'HER' (which also featured Johansson). It's definitely entertaining enough for 90 minutes though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/3AK4roDokJo",7,5,18,30 July 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson brings us another odd and quirky comedy masterpiece.
","'MOONRISE KINGDOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Wes Anderson brings us another odd and quirky comedy masterpiece, this one is sort of a 'Romeo & Juliet' style love story. It tells the tale of two twelve-year-old outcasts in love who run away from their New England town and cause a search party. Anderson directed the film as well as co-wrote it with Roman Coppola (who also wrote 'THE DARJEELING LIMITED' with him). It stars two impressive young newcomers as well as vets Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel. The movie has all of Anderson's usual touches and flavor and I thought this was actually one of his better works.The film is set on a New England island in 1965 and revolves around two young lovers named Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward). Both are misfits: Sam is an orphan who was the least popular member of his scout camp and Suzy despises her dysfunctional family. The two met at a church play the previous summer and had remained pen pals for an entire year before deciding to run away together the following summer. They run in to the forest in search of a special cove where they plan to spend the rest of their days together. Suzy's parents (Murray and McDormand), along with the Scout Ward (Norton) and local police Captain (Willis), begin a search party for them.The movie is all about the innocence of youth and what despair it sometimes causes them to look forward to the adult lives their parents and other influences represent for them (often kids have their acts together much better than adults do, as age often corrupts). It's also about love and adoration as well as being a social outcast, especially at a young age. Anderson delivers these messages beautifully (with his quirky touch) and the music by Alexandre Desplat is breathtakingly fitting. Often I find Anderson's work just a little too abstract for me to fully relate to but other than that his pictures are nearly perfect. I see this film the same way, although I'd place it a little higher than his previous few efforts. Still it doesn't live up to 'BOTTLE ROCKET' or 'ROYAL TENENBAUMS', which are my favorites of his.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOMEqlGt6m4",9,3,5,2 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese!
","'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS': Five Stars (Out of Five)The seventh installment in the immensely popular space opera film series; and the first chapter in over ten years. It takes place 30 years after the events of 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'; when the Galactic Empire has now become 'The First Order', and the rebel alliance has now become the 'Resistance'. The story deals with a First Order stormtrooper, named Finn, who's looking for redemption; after gaining possession of a map, to Luke Skywaler's whereabouts. The film was directed by J.J. Abrams; and it was written by Abrams, Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who also co-wrote 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' and 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'). Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker all reprise their roles, from the original trilogy; and they're joined by newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac. The series creator, George Lucas, returned as a creative consultant; and John Williams once again scored the music (as he did all six previous chapters, in the franchise). I think it's the most entertaining movie, I've seen, in 35 years!We first learn that Luke Skywalker (Hamill) has gone missing; and due to his absence, the ruthless First Order has gained power, and control, over the galaxy. Princess Leia Organa (Fisher) is now a general, of the Resistance, and she believes finding Luke is humanity's only hope. She sends her best X-wing fighter pilot, named Poe Dameron (Isaac), to the desert planet of Jakku; in order to locate a map, which can lead to her brother's whereabouts. On his mission Poe meets a stormtrooper, looking for redemption, named Finn (Boyega). Finn joins Poe in his adventure; he also later teams up with a scavenger, named Rey (Ridley), and a veteran war hero, named Han Solo (Ford).The film is definitely the best written, of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time, in the series). It also has the most humanity, and thoughtful drama (I cried multiple times). It's surreal seeing Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and other original cast members, on the big screen again (in a new movie); and I think it was justifiable asking Fisher and Hamill to lose weight, for their parts (it's necessary to the roles they're playing). The new characters are also extremely likable, and soon to be classic, as well. Ridley is a revelation, and I think she rivals Jennifer Lawrence; for one of the best performances of the year! Driver, Boyega and Isaac are all fantastic as well; and Ford is, once again, classic! The movie (without question) deserves several Oscar nominations; for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, acting and more. The approach Abrams takes, to the material, is exactly right (it's traditional, old fashioned filmmaking). The film is everything you could possibly expect (or want) from a 'STAR WARS' movie; it's funny, heartfelt, touching and action-packed. All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese! It's at least the best in the series since 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/149466777",10,18,55,18 December 2015
RED," Retread and Extremely Disappointing!
","'RED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A cast of high caliber veteran celebrities highlights this DC comic's graphic novel adaptation. Robert Schwentke (who's directing credits include 'FLIGHTPLAN' and 'THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE') directs this tale of a team of 'retired and extremely dangerous' (which is what the acronym stands for) CIA agents called back into action after being framed and setup for assassination. The film stars John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and sadly Bruce Willis (but I guess he's beginning to get that age where he fits in with a cast of old timers) as the team. The film also co-stars Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine. The cast is pretty impressive, the rest of the film not so much.Willis plays the leader of the team Frank Moses. As the movie opens he spends his time flirting with a federal clerk named Sarah Ross (Parker) on the phone, falsely reporting lost retirement checks. He's attacked at his home one day and of course being Bruce Willis he manages to overcome the team of assassins sent to kill him and immediately flees to aide Ross knowing they'll come after her next due to his romantic interest in her. He takes her against her will and rounds up his old team (Freeman, Malkovich and Mirren) and alerts them of their danger. The team once again reunites in order to use their collective skills and resources to find out why they've been framed and staged for assassination and save themselves from extermination. Urban plays the lead CIA agent hot on their trail.The movie looks and sounds like a lot of fun but the fun is slammed down the viewers throat to the point where it's not really fun anymore. The actors are all good in their roles and fittingly cast (except for Freeman who is shamefully underused and the way he's written in and out of the film is embarrassing, for an actor of his stature) but the material they have to work with is weak and the direction is routine and uninspiring. Every joke is forced and every action scene is by the numbers and somewhat boring (mostly, there are a few exceptions). The movie is extremely cheesy in the way it pauses for each actor to have their moment, in the middle of what should be an intense action scene. It's just a huge gimmick and at no time feels like a genuine action / comedy. I'm amazed at the number of critics that sold out and gave this film a good review. That's why you never trust a critic. This movie is mediocre at best and entirely disappointing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c",5,5,12,16 October 2010
Flight," Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances to date!
","'FLIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances to date in this dark and disturbing drama about an alcoholic airline pilot who saves nearly a hundred people from dying in a plane crash but then faces possible charges of negligence due to substance abuse. It was directed by none other than Robert Zemeckis (who hasn't directed a live action film in 12 years or an R-rated one in 32 years) and written by John Gatins. It co-stars Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, Kelly Reilly and John Goodman. The music was scored by Alan Silvestri (who is a constant partner of Zemeckis). The film is intense, frustrating and extremely depressing at times but it's also inspiring in important moments as well. Washington's performance is definitely the highlight of the film. Washington plays Whip Whitaker, an extremely skilled veteran airline pilot who also has a substance abuse problem. The night before a big flight to Atlanta Whitaker stays up most of the night having sex with a flight attendant from his plane (Nadine Velazquez) and drinking an excessive amount of alcohol. He does a line of cocaine to wake himself up and then has a couple more shots of vodka while in flight. The plane suffers from turbulence upon takeoff and then has a mechanical malfunction towards the end of the flight. Whitaker manages to keep the plane from crashing (through some amazing piloting maneuvers) and saves all but six lives on board. A toxicology screen finds the alcohol and cocaine in his system and an attorney, named Hugh Lang (Cheadle), makes it his mission to keep the blame of the crash off Whitaker. The stress only drives Whitaker into drinking more though as his life spirals out of control. His new romance with a fellow drug addict (Reilly) is the only thing which keeps him sane. The movie is extremely hard to watch. It really drives home it's message about what it's like to be depressed and suffering from addiction. It's frustrating to watch Whitaker dig a deeper and deeper hole for himself while still rooting for him (despite his shortcomings). It's interesting to see Washington play a somewhat unlikeable and extremely flawed character again and still manage to make the audience care for him so deeply. Zemeckis's directing is once again topnotch, Gatins screenplay is brilliant, the supporting cast is all effective and Silvestri's music works magic once again as well but it's Washington's performance that really makes the movie work. He commands every scene he's in and makes the movie a near perfect dark but thoughtful character study. He definitely deserves all the critical praise and award recognition thrown at him.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A",9,2,4,5 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Least involving of the series.
","'HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HOLLOWS: PART 2: Four Stars (Out of Five)The eighth and final chapter of the immensely popular 'HARRY POTTER' film series.  This one is based on the second half of the seventh (and final) book of writer J.K. Rowling's classic series.  The script was once again written by Steve Kloves who has written every film in the series except for 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX' (which is arguably the worst one, possibly as a result).  David Yates returned to direct the film (he also directed the last three installments) and of course Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all reprise their beloved roles.  The film is sure to please die-hard fanatics of the series but will definitely not win over any new fans as well.The film begins exactly where the last chapter left off with Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Watson) and Ron (Grint) burying their fallen friend Dobby.  They then set out to find the next of the three remaining Horcruxes (the items of magic which give Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) his immortality).  At the same time Voldermort finds the 'Elder Wand' and learns of their plans.  The entire magical kingdom is soon set for the biggest war their world has ever seen and Harry, Hermoine and Ron are once again caught up right in the middle of it.I've never been a big fan of the 'HARRY POTTER' series, I've never found it incredibly interesting or involving, but I have always admired the craftsmanship of most of the films. The film producers have always been able to find high quality directors and crew for most of the installments (minus maybe the first couple). The acting has always been rather decent and for the most part (except for maybe really early on) the movies have seemed to live up to fans of the book's high expectations. You definitely have to give the films credit for that. What they have failed to do is involve or interest most other movie goers who are not familiar with the source material (like myself). The greatest book to film adaptations should be able to do that as well. With that said I have found most of the movies at least slightly entertaining and again being a fan of film I can definitely admire the skill that went into making them. I did find this last chapter the least interesting or involving of the series though (that's not to say it's the worst film of the bunch). Despite all the action I had no real emotional involvement with any of the characters or what was going on with them. I think this is due to the fact that, not being a fanatic of the series, I haven't seen each film more than once and have not kept up with the mythology for the most part. So not knowing what was really going on a lot of the time did make it hard to follow and keep interest in. All of the other chapters have been able to pull off a certain amount of stand alone storytelling as well as keep up the continuing saga whereas this one spent most of it's time tying all the other films together and wrapping things up. So for that reason I found it the least involving of the series. Still there are a lot of spectacular visuals going on and big fans of the series will eat it up. Everyone else might be a little bored.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN5KZOE7p28",8,1,2,22 July 2011
Unbroken," Certainly not a great film.
","'UNBROKEN': Four Stars (Out of Five)World War II flick directed by Angelina Jolie and co-written by the Coen brothers. It's based on the book 'Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption', by Laura Hillenbrand, and tells the story of USA Olympian Louis Zamperini. The film details how he survived 47 days on a raft, after his bomber crashed in the ocean, and many more days of torture and harassment at multiple POW camps, during the war. It stars Jack O'Connell, Domhnall Gleeson, Miyavi, Garrett Hedlund, Finn Wittrock and Jai Courtney. It was adapted for the screen by Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson and it's Jolie's third directorial effort (to date). The film has done well at the Box Office (thus far) but it's also gotten mostly negative reviews from critics. So it's possible upcoming award recognition has become uncertain. I enjoyed the movie but it's certainly not a great film and it's definitely not one of the best of the year, either.O'Connell stars as Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete who also served as a bomber pilot during World War II. His plane crashed in the Pacific Ocean, where he (and two other crew members) lived on a raft for 47 days. Zamperini was then caught by the Japanese navy and sent to multiple prisoner-of-war camps. He went on to survive years of grueling physical, and mental, torture while being abused by a sadistic Japanese corporal (Miyavi), who was jealous of his athletic accomplishments. The film shows how Zamperini used his athletic abilities, and Olympic training, to push on and survive. The film is well made, from a technical standpoint, and Jolie definitely shows some skill, and talent, as a director. The acting is all decent enough and the story is interesting and somewhat inspiring. It just seems like it should have been more involving (and moving). I definitely never felt that emotionally interested, in anything going on in the movie. While it is entertaining, it also doesn't leave the viewer with much to think about (or even look back on and admire) after it's over. It's a good war film, especially for those who love the genre, but it's certainly not a great one; or an Oscar worthy film by any means.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/XBTsoCDCJpU",8,1,4,6 January 2015
The Purge," Turns from horror to society message to full blown action 'home invasion film' starring Ethan Hawke!
","'THE PURGE': Four Stars (Out of Five)Low budget horror film that killed at the box office it's opening weekend (making $36 million, for a #1 debut, on a $3 million budget). Horror is always the most profitable genre though. They're immensely popular films because everyone loves to be scared and feel disturbed at times. They also can be made on a shoestring budget, which doesn't mean much to the viewer but as a filmmaker being forced to work on a low budget forces creativity. Horror is the best genre to do this with because it lends itself to that kind of filmmaking. Coming up with cool and unique ways to scare and startle people doesn't cost a lot of money and that's what this genre is all about. 'THE PURGE' is a great example of this; it's horror done right. The film was written and directed by James DeMonaco and produced by Michael Bay. It stars Ethan Hawke (who has been doing a lot of horror films these days, like last year's 'SINISTER', when he's not doing 'BEFORE SUNRISE' sequels that is). Hawke and Lena Headey play a married couple (named James and Mary Sandin) with two children. They have a son, named Charlie (Max Burkholder), and a teenage daughter, named Zoey (Adelaide Kane). The family is very well off as James sells security systems, in the year 2022. It's a single-party future where crime and poverty in America are almost non existent because the Government allows a 12-hour period, once a year, where all crime (including murder) is legal and emergency aid is suspended. The only laws are that high ranking government officials are not to be harmed and certain weaponry is forbidden (I'm assuming high powered explosives probably). The film all takes place at the home of the Sandins one night during 'the Purge', which is what the 12-hour period of lawlessness is called. When Charlie lets a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) into their secured home to protect him from a viscous gang of rich kids, led by a masked man (Rhys Wakefield, in a very creepy performance), it attracts the gang to their house. The leader threatens to kill everyone inside the house if the Sandins don't hand over the man. James knows that his security system is not without it's flaws, and the gang can break in, so he decides he must find and catch the stranger roaming around their house and hand him over. His morals, as well as his family's, are put to the test. The story is reminiscent (and perhaps inspired by) an episode of the original 'STAR TREK' TV series 'The Return of the Archons', from 1967. It revolves around a world, that Kirk and crew visit, which allows a similar annual 12-hour period of lawlessness in order to keep the peace the rest of the year. This idea of purging yourself of violence so you can remain peaceful the rest of the time is an interesting psychological concept and a disturbing one to me. This 12-hour period of violence seems like too great a cost, in my opinion, even if it lowers violence overall. The premise of course is a great social allegory and like all great horror the movie is full of good social commentary. It's of course also, mainly, about 'the haves vs. the have-nots' in society; how those with less money always get screwed over. In this way the film is outstanding. Hawke and Headey are great and so is Burkholder and the scene stealing Wakefield. The directing is decent for a movie like this and the writing is probably the film's highlight. It's a great idea for a horror film (despite it's many holes). The film also offers many different genre fans something. It turns from horror to society message (which most great horror does though) to full blown action 'home invasion film', starring Ethan Hawke as it's action hero. I enjoyed it and I think most horror fans will as well. There is a psychological theory that people who watch a lot of violent films 'purge' themselves of violent thoughts as well; that the more violent films one watches the less likely they are to be violent in life. I don't know if I 100% believe that but it's an interesting idea, kind of like the one presented in this film just less much drastic.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFfGQiMGk-4",8,6,11,10 June 2013
Pitch Perfect," Filled with good and likable performances highlighted by Kendrick's soulful lead.
","'PITCH PERFECT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Anna Kendrick shines in this comedy-musical about an all-girls college singing group competing against their male rivals who always best them. Kendrick plays a freshman named Beca who reluctantly joins the team, giving them the talent and energy they need to put on a good show once again. The film also features Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Skylar Astin, Ben Platt and Adam DeVine. It was directed by Jason Moore and written by Kay Cannon (two former TV filmmakers). It's based on the book of the same name by Mickey Rapkin. I usually stay away from films like this and when I do give one a try I usually find them painfully unfunny and boring. I gave this one a chance because of it's good reviews and solid box-office and was pleasantly surprised. It's very funny and full of likable characters. Nothing spectacular but a decent comedy-musical that's definitely entertaining. Kendrick plays Beca, a new freshman at Barden University who attends the school only at the wishes of her father (John Benjamin Hickey), who is a professor at the university. She dreams of moving to Los Angeles and pursuing a music career so she takes an internship at the school's radio station. There she meets another music lover named Jesse (Astin) who develops a crush on her. Beca doesn't have time for boys though and wants to get to LA as soon as possible. Her father makes an agreement with her that he'll help pay for her to move to Los Angeles if she tries harder at school for one year and joins a club. When the local all girl a cappella group discovers how talented a singer she is they talk her into joining their team. Beca, plus a few other misfit girls (that aren't usually given a chance to sing with the popular girls), give the group just what it needs to finally compete with their male rivals (the Treblemakers), who always win the local competition. The movie is surprisingly witty and fast paced. It's filled with good and likable performances highlighted by Kendrick's soulful lead. Rebel Wilson has been receiving a lot of critical praise for her comedic turn but I think Anna Camp is even funnier as the film's leading female antagonist and Adam DeVine is also a scene stealer as the film's male bad guy. There's plenty of pretty girls to look at; especially Camp, Snow, Kendrick, Alexis Knapp and Elizabeth Banks as a commentator (Banks was also a producer of the film). The performances are equally as likable though. Most of all the movie is just funny. It's been compared to similar films like 'BRING IT ON' and I'd say it's at least as good as that. I'd also put it in the same league as something like 'MEAN GIRLS' or 'CLUELESS'. For it's type it definitely works.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ4Gr6CX0-g",8,2,5,19 February 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Very much feels like 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' of the series!
","'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2012 blockbuster, based on the book of the same name by Suzanne Collins, about a dystopian future where kids are selected (by a lottery) to compete to the death in a bloody arena, as part of a reality TV show aired for the public to see. Jennifer Lawrence once again stars as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta Mellark, the two survivors of the games in the first film. They've now inspired the beginnings of a rebellion, which scares the powers that be and in retaliation they're once again selected to compete in the 'hunger games', along with other winners from previous years. The film also once again stars Woody Harrelson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland. They're joined by newcomers like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Claflin, Jeffrey Wright and Jenna Malone. Francis Lawrence (who's previous directing credits include films like 'I AM LEGEND' and 'CONSTANTINE') directed this installment and Simon Beaufoy (who's previous writing credits include movies like 'THE FULL MONTY' and 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE') and Michael Arndt (who also wrote 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' and co-wrote films like 'TOY STORY 3', 'BRAVE' and 'OBLIVION') wrote the screenplay. I loved the first movie (it was my second favorite film of last year) and found this installment to be nearly as good. It's also my favorite movie of this year!Katniss (Lawrence) has now become a symbol of hope to the masses and is inspiring rebellions around the world. President Snow (Sutherland) is extremely threatened by this and devises a plan, along with the new head gamemaker (Hoffman), to have the contestants for the 75th Annual Hunger Games selected from previous winners, forcing Katniss and Peeta to reenter the games. Things aren't completely as they seem though as the film builds to a shocking conclusion and cliffhanger. This chapter very much feels like 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' of the series in that way. It's also much darker than the original film and revolves around an evil government retaliating against rebellious forces that caused some damage in the first movie (like 'EMPIRE' as well).Like the first film (and all great science fiction) the movie has a lot of great social commentary with parallels to modern life in the real world. This is one of the areas these films are the strongest at. This one, like the first, also has a lot of great action and spectacular visuals. It wasn't quite as moving as the original movie for me (although it has it's tearful moments) and is a little slower paced (for much of the first half of the film) but the last hour (containing all the scenes in the arena) is action packed and the ending is breathtaking. I thought the romance between Katniss and Peeta, and the love triangle involving Gale (Hemsworth) as well, really worked again and found myself once again really relating to Peeta (as he is the heart of these films). Lawrence is the action hero of the series though and now a full blown movie star. She totally shines in this movie (and has never looked better) and really makes it something worth watching. Like I said I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as the original but it's pretty damn close!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSU_hwOQSWQ",10,3,23,27 November 2013
Godzilla," Doesn't even come close to the best monster flicks!
","'GODZILLA': Four Stars (Out of Five) Modern American reboot to the immensely popular Japanese monster flick franchise. It's the first 'Godzilla' film in ten years (following 2004's 'GODZILLA: FINAL WARS', which marked the character's 50th anniversary) and only the second 'Godzilla' movie filmed entirely by an American studio (following director Roland Emmerich's 1998 remake). It was directed by Gareth Edwards (who previously directed and wrote the 2010 ultra-low-budget monster flick 'MONSTERS') and written by Max Borenstein and David Callaham (co-writer of 'THE EXPENDABLES'); three other film writers did rewrites but were uncredited (David S. Goyer, Drew Pearce and Frank Darabont). The movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche and David Strathairn. It's another origins tale and it also has Godzilla taking on other gigantic creatures. The visuals are great and the kaiju fight scenes are spectacular but the film as a whole is disappointing and mostly a bore! The story begins in 1999 when two scientists, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Hawkins), discover two pods in the Philippines (one of which has hatched). We then meet a nuclear physicist, named Joe Brody (Cranston), and his wife Sandra (Binoche), a nuclear regulations consultant, who work at the Janjira Nuclear Plant (near Tokyo). The plant has a meltdown, which kills Sandra, and the disaster is witnessed by their son Ford (CJ Adams) from his school nearby. Everyone in the area is evacuated, while it's quarantined, and fifteen years go by with Joe obsessing over what caused the meltdown. Ford (now played by Taylor-Johnson) is a lieutenant in the United States Navy (and bomb disposal expert). He also now has a wife (Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde) of his own. Joe is constantly being arrested, for investigating his conspiracy theories, and Ford travels to Japan to help him. Once there he reluctantly returns to his old home, with his father, where the two discover a government cover-up (proving Joe was right). They meet Dr. Serizawa and learn that giant monsters (which feed on radiation) have been wrecking havoc all over the world (for many years). A Muto (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) is currently on the loose and Serizawa believes that a monster he's been studying for years, called Godzilla, is the only thing that can stop it.Monster movie fans often say these movies would be better without any humans in them; I usually disagree but in this case I'd say they're right. None of the people are likable in this film, except for Dr. Serizawa (he has all the best lines and Watanabe gives the only decent performance). Cranston overacts, Taylor-Johnson underacts and everyone else seems almost nonexistent. If you cut all the humans out of the movie it would only be like 25 to 30 minutes long though and having an entire feature length film full of just monsters fighting would be pretty boring as well. The visuals are cool but the tease of never fully showing the fights (or monsters) in their entirety, until the end, really doesn't work. It works in movies like 'MONSTERS' and 'CLOVERFIELD' because in those films the humans are interesting and fun to watch; this is just way too dry, overly long and slowly paced. I think Edwards is a talented director but with all those experienced writers you should be able to expect a much better film than this (a twelve-year-old seriously could have wrote it)! The fight scenes are cool though and the ending is a blast; it's great seeing Godzilla on the big screen and it is better than Emmerich's version. It doesn't even come close to the best monster flicks though (and I'm a huge monster movie fan); Peter Jackson's 'KING KONG' remake and Guillermo del Toro's 'PACIFIC RIM' (from last year) are so much better than this. Del Toro wants to do a crossover though (of this and 'PACIFIC RIM'); now that would be really cool!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PJuAEBeRQ",8,3,8,16 May 2014
Looper," If you like these types of movies you'll eat it up!
","'LOOPER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis star in this time travel Sci-Fi action film written and directed by Rian Johnson (who also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed crime films 'BRICK', also starring Gordon-Levitt, and 'THE BROTHERS BLOOM'). The story revolves around a future where the mob uses time travel to dispose of bodies and the hit men assigned to do the disposing are called 'loopers'. Gordon-Levitt stars as one such 'looper' and Willis plays his older self, who's sent back for his younger self to get rid of. The film is a pretty fresh and interesting take on the time travel genre and it's excellently crafted by Johnson.The film is set in the year 2044 when the world has fallen in to another economic recession and organized crime has escalated. Mutations causing telekinetic abilities have also appeared in about 10% of the population as well and crime lords have learned that thirty years in the future time travel will be developed and immediately outlawed. This doesn't stop crime rings from taking advantage of it though and they use it to get rid of bodies, by sending victims back in time to be killed (due to new tracking technology making it impossible to secretly dispose of a body). The men hired to do the disposing are called 'loopers' and when their contracts are up their future self is sent back in time for them to kill, leaving them a limited future of only thirty years but also a hefty paycheck to spend living it. When one such looper, Joe (Gordon-Levitt), fails to kill his future self (Willis) and lets him escape he finds himself in a world of trouble and on the run from the mob. He desperately tries to track his older self down while the 'Old Joe' has a plan of his own in extending his life and future happiness.The movie is a lot of fun if you like these types of movies. The directing and visuals are topnotch and the story is unique and clever. If you think about certain plot points for too long though (like every time travel movie) you'll start to see a lot of possible plot holes but they're not important to the enjoyment of the film (if you don't let yourself get caught up in them). Willis and Gordon-Levitt are perfectly cast as older and younger versions of each other and it appears as though there's some great CGI and makeup to make Gordon-Levitt look uncannily like a young Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt also has a nice supporting role as the mother of an especially gifted telekinetic mutant (played eerily by Pierce Gagnon). I also really liked how the film kind of makes the viewer surprisingly shift who their rooting for as who appears to be the good guy and who appears to be somewhat of a bad guy changes unexpectedly. The film is most of all highly entertaining. It's dark and violent and definitely not the most uplifting Sci-Fi film but it's still a lot of fun. If you like these types of movies you'll eat it up!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo",9,1,10,3 October 2012
Life," Reminiscent of classic space set sci-fi horror flicks, like 'ALIEN' and 'ALIENS'!
","'LIFE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new sci-fi horror movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Ryan Reynolds. It was directed by Daniel Espinoza (who also worked with Reynolds on the 2012 action flick 'SAFE HOUSE'), and it was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (who also co- wrote 'DEADPOOL', also starring Reynolds, and 'ZOMBIELAND'). It tells the story of a six member space crew, working on an International Space Station, that thinks it's discovered evidence of life on Mars, but they actually later learn that they've discovered something much more horrifying. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it's also underperformed at the Box Office (and gotten mostly mediocre reviews from audience members). I enjoyed it immensely.The film begins with a space probe returning from Mars, that contains a soil sample from that planet. The crew of the International Space Station, containing six members, is able to catch the probe as it passes by them. A biologist among the crew, named Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), studies the sample, and he's able to revive a dormant organism inside it. The crew is excited to learn that they've discovered the first evidence of extraterrestrial life, and so is everyone else back home on Earth; where the organism is named Calvin by school children. After further studying Calvin, the space crew soon learns that they've awaken something very hostile and deadly.The movie is reminiscent of classic space set sci-fi horror flicks, like 'ALIEN' and 'ALIENS', and it's almost as good as those. It's very dark, gruesome, suspenseful and surprisingly well paced (compared to a lot of movies these days). The story is also really interesting, and the performances are all topnotch (you could hardly ask for a better cast). My only problem with the film is that the characters aren't quite developed well enough, and the alien isn't quite frightening or memorable enough either. Those two things aren't huge flaws though, as they're still done well, they're just not done well enough for the movie to be another 'ALIENS' type classic.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/208412653",9,3,9,30 March 2017
Footloose," I really enjoyed it a lot because I was expecting so little from it!
","'FOOTLOOSE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This is one of those movies I really enjoyed a lot because I was expecting so little from it. I never saw the original 1984 Kevin Bacon cult classic in it's entirety (although now I'd really like to) so I'm obviously not a big fan of it and had no unreasonable expectations in that way. I just expected the movie to be light pop teen fare, appealing only to an MTV ADD audience but I was pleasantly surprised. I've read this updated remake is extremely faithful to the original (many critics say too faithful). It was co-written by the original film's writer (Dean Pitchford, who also wrote most of the songs) and Craig Brewer who also directed the film (Brewer also wrote and directed such popular edgy films as 'HUSTLE & FLOW' and 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN'). I can't compare it to the original (nor should I) but this film is definitely a well made crowd pleaser.Professional dancers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough were cast as the two leads in the film, rather than actors, and they turn in better performances than most any other young popular stars could in their place (especially the likes of Zac Effron and Chace Crawford, who were originally considered for the leading male role). Wormald plays Ren McCormack, a teen from Boston who recently lost his mother to cancer and moves in with his Aunt (Kim Dickens) and Uncle (Ray McKinnon) in the small town of Bomont Georgia. Ren, being a free spirit, clashes with the ultra-conservative town where several absurd Christian paternalistic laws were put in place three years earlier when the town's popular reverend, Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid), lost his son (along with four of his friends) to a drunk driving accident. The harsh laws include a teen curfew as well as laws against playing rock music too loud and dancing. Shaw's daughter Ariel (Hough) is also a rebellious free spirit who's been sinking further and further into depression since the loss of her brother and absence of her father (on an emotional level). Ren and Ariel hit it off but Ren is of course seen as a virus to the town which begins a moral war.The movie is very inspiring as well as surprisingly emotionally moving in places. It's also just a great feel good movie thanks in large part to the overall craftsmanship of the film as well as the performances and crowd pleasing soundtrack. Wormald makes an impressive leading man debut and Hough is great eye candy, turning in one of the hottest performances of the year. I know it's missing the Bacon but I think Wormald could be every bit as talented an actor as Kevin (although it's way too early to really tell). Like I said I don't know how good the original was to compare it to (hopefully I soon will though) but every remake should be based solely on it's own merits anyway. This is a good film, it does everything it sets out to do in a quality way. Should please everyone but the die-hard fans of the original.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30",7,1,7,3 March 2012
50_50," A cancer film that's actually fifty percent drama and fifty percent comedy!
","'50/50': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A cancer film that's actually fifty percent drama and fifty percent comedy. The film deals with the very serious subject matter of a 27 year old who is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, which he has about a fifty percent chance of beating. The movie takes a very honest and brutal look at his struggles to fight the illness as well as taking a lighter look at his best friend's attempts to help him overcome depression through positive thinking and having fun. The best friend is played by Seth Rogen and the movie is in fact based on one of his best friend's, a writing buddy named Will Reiser (who wrote the script), and his actual experiences overcoming cancer. Seth Rogen basically plays himself in the film and Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the Reiser character. The film is directed by Jonathan Levine and Levine does an outstanding job of balancing the depressing drama with light hearted comedy. Something really special results from it. The movie does a very impressive job of balancing several different elements and angles to it's story. The biggest of which is the buddy story involving the two leads (Adam and Kyle). Rogen (Kyle) really shines here by showing how important it is to have a good friend like him in a time like that. There's also a bitter relationship story involving Adam and his self centered morally deprived girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). Howard shows how important it is to make sure you have a good romantic companion by your side not like her character in a time like that. There's a blooming relationship story between Adam and a possible romantic interest he finds in his psychologist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick). Kendrick plays her usual type of role here and continues to do an adequate job with it. She of course shows the importance of the possibilities of real love. There's also the friendships Adam forms with other cancer patients at the hospital with him, specifically Mitch (Matt Frewer) and Alan (Philip Baker Hall), which shows how important it is to have people close that know (and can relate to) what you're going through. And there's the relationship Adam has with his overbearing mother (Anjelica Huston) and Alzheimer's stricken father (Serge Houde). They of course show the importance of family. All of these elements and performances are well played out but it's Gordon-Levitt that knocks it out of the park with his Oscar nomination worthy performance.Like all really good movies the film has a lot to offer and there's very little to complain about. Some have shown disgust in the idea of a film that would try to take a comedic slapstick approach to such serious and dreary subject matter but there really isn't any slapstick here. The comedy depicted in the film all feels pretty real and genuine and being that it's based on the lives of the writer and actor I'd say it's probably pretty honest and heartfelt too. There's true passion in this film and I don't think anyone involved thought of it as a joke. I think the best way to deal with any of life's ugliness is to look at the good that comes with it as well. I don't think the dozens of sappy tearjerkers we've seen about cancer in the past have done an adequate job of really dealing with the subject matter. This film actually deals with it and life through all of it's ups and downs. It is an emotional roller coaster and a tearjerker as well. It definitely got to me in a couple places. I think this is the best type of cancer film and I applaud it's courage and originality.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s7ci6l5gkI",9,0,2,6 October 2011
What We Do in the Shadows," Both horrendously grotesque and brilliantly hilarious!
","'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A mockumentary about four centuries-old vampires, living in a flat together and trying to adapt to modern life (in New Zealand). It was written and directed by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (of 'FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS' fame). Waititi and Clement also star in the movie; along with Jonathan Brugh, Ben Fransham, Cori Gonzalez- Macuer, Stu Rutherford and Rhys Darby. It's both horrendously grotesque and brilliantly hilarious!Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Brugh) and Petyr (Fransham) are four vampires, who have been around for centuries, that all share a flat together; in Wellington. They've decided to allow a film crew to film them, for a documentary, and have promised not to kill any of them. They go out clubbing at night, to hunt down humans for food (and party), and stay in their flat during the day (to avoid the deadly sunlight). Viago narrates the documentary and explains how the four vampires have attempted to adapt to modern life. The movie is a very dark comedy; the vampires do kill innocent humans (for food) and make others be their slaves (while promising to turn them into vampires, one day). It's gory and pretty true to most vampire mythology. I was really impressed with how the filmmakers were able to do this, while still making an extremely funny movie (it's hilarious)! The mockumentary format is perfect for delivering the jokes with; and the acting and directing are brilliant. I look forward to seeing more from Waititi and Clement, in the future.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/vvaTQ0fcFUQ",9,1,4,1 May 2015
Deadpool," The perfect combination of action and comedy!
","'DEADPOOL': Five Stars (Out of Five)A raunchy, and excessively violent, superhero comedy flick; based on the Marvel Comics character (of the same name). The film stars Ryan Reynolds; playing a very different version of the role, than he previously did (in 2009's 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE'). Reynolds plays a mercenary, named Wade Wilson, who's subjected to a secret experiment (to cure his cancer); which gives him superhuman healing powers, but it also leaves him severely scarred. The movie also stars Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Gina Carano, Brianna Hildebrand and the voice of Stefan Kapicic (as Colossus). It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Tim Miller; and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (based on the comic book character, created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza). The film scored the biggest R-rated opening of all-time, at the Box-Office (grossing $150 million, in 4 days); making it (also) one of the largest superhero film debuts, ever (beating the likes of 'SPIDER-MAN', 'BATMAN', 'SUPERMAN', 'IRON MAN' and more)!Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative, turned mercenary for hire, who suddenly falls in love with a beautiful escort, named Vanessa Carlysle (Baccarin); after meeting her at a local New York City bar. Then he's tragically diagnosed with terminal cancer. A mysterious recruiter (Jed Rees), for a special program, approaches Wade (at the bar he frequents); and offers him a cure for cancer (in exchange for his involvement in the program). Wislon reluctantly accepts his proposal; but the program not only cures him of his deadly disease, but it mutates him into a scarred, and somewhat psychotic, superhero, as well (with the nickname Deadpool). Deadpool will stop at nothing to get revenge, on the people that mutated him, and (hopefully) fix his disfigured face; so he can go home to Vanessa, again.The movie is the perfect combination of action and comedy; It's a hilarious (fourth wall breaking) spoof, and the action scenes are spectacular (and thrilling) as well. The special effects aren't bad either. I'd give it 5 stars, in both genres; which I never really thought was possible, before now. Reynolds is perfect, as the popular antihero; and it's such a redeeming, faithful adaptation (this time around). The writing is brilliant, and the directing is equally impressive (from a debut filmmaker even). The movie also has great social commentary, on most people's obsession with looks, in our society (Deadpool is insanely driven by this motivation). The film is also one of my new all-time favorite superhero flicks; and I hope they make a lot more R-rated comic book movies, like it, due to it's success!

Get Him to the Greek," The humor is pretty original and you definitely have no idea where the film is going at any time!
","'GET HIM TO THE Greek': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Nicholas Stoller writes and directs this sequel / spin-off to his surprise 2008 hit 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL', which he directed and actor Jason Segel wrote. This film centers around only the outrageous British rock star Aldous Snow (played once again, hilariously, by Russell Brand) and a record company intern (played by returning actor Jonah Hill, but weirdly not as the same character 'Matthew the Waiter'). This film tells the story of Aaron Green (Hill) trying to get Snow to a reunion concert at L.A.'s Greek Theater from London in something like three days. The concert was his idea and his chance to prove himself to his boss (played humorously by Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs) but Snow is suffering through a midlife crisis and turns out to be impossible to control. All kinds of hijinks ensue as Green desperately tries to get Snow to the concert in time.The movie is just one witty and hilariously outrageous joke after another but then it surprisingly turns dramatic and at times serious as we get to know the characters more and it actually builds to a pretty emotional climax. This is my favorite type of comedy. Not only is it nonstop hilarious but it has heart and real emotion as well because the characters feel real and we actually get to see their problems.The film is not quite as classic as 'MARSHALL' and it definitely doesn't benefit from the stunningly graceful beauty of Kristin Bell, although she does make a cameo appearance, but it's about as good as you could expect from a followup to that film, which is one of my favorites. The humor is all pretty original and you definitely have no idea where the film is going at any time. It's brilliantly written and directed by Stoller and both Brand and Hill are classic in the film. They're both comedic genius in my mind! Probably one of the funniest films you're likely to see this summer.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pmr_F8e44c",9,1,5,28 September 2010
Cloud Atlas," It keeps building and building until by film's end I was totally in love with it!
","'CLOUD ATLAS': Five Stars (Out of Five)This enormously ambitious epic Sci-Fi masterpiece is the type of life changing experience that's so inspirational and emotionally moving that it will forever change the lives of anyone who views it. That's my opinion but that's how I feel about all of my favorite films. This movie, like a lot of great films, is adapted from a book (of the same name). The book was written by David Mitchell and released in 2004 to high critical praise. It was admired greatly by Natalie Portman and brought to the attention of directors Andy and Lana Wachowski on the set of 'V FOR VENDETTA', a film the three were working on together in 2005. The Wachowski siblings loved it so much that they bought the rights to the film adaptation and promised Portman a lead role as a character named Sonmi-451. Portman had to give up the role, to actress Doona Bae, at the last second due to her pregnancy. An all star cast including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Keith David, Susan Sarandon and Hugo Weaving (a Wachowski regular) joined Bae in the cast (all playing multiple characters of different races and sexes). The Wachowskis teamed with German director Tom Tykwer (of 'RUN LOLA RUN' fame) to both write and direct the film. It consists of six interwoven stories that span from the 1849 Chatham Islands all the way to a future post-apocalyptic Earth. The Wachowskis directed three stories and Tykwer directed the other three (from a co-written script) using entirely different crews on different sets but with the same actors. The stories play out simultaneously in the film jumping back and forth constantly while only developing each one for minutes at a time (if that).In the earliest story Sturgess plays Adam Ewing, an American lawyer who travels to the Chatham Islands in 1849 (from San Francisco) to finish a business deal for his father-in-law (Weaving). While there his heart goes out to a tribe of slaves, especially one who stows away on his ship (David Gyasi). The second story focuses on Robert Frobisher (Whishaw), a poor English musician in love with another man (D'Arcy) who's hired by a famous composer (Broadbent), in Scotland in 1936, to serve as his amanuensis. While working for the composer he develops his own musical masterpiece he calls 'The Cloud Atlas Sextet'. The third story tells the story of a journalist named Luisa Rey (Berry) who's assigned a story on a nuclear power plant in San Francisco in 1975. With the help of a nuclear physicist (D'Arcy playing the same role from the prior story, when he's much older) she uncovers a conspiracy plot involving the power plant and is marked for murder. The fourth story stars Broadbent once again, this time as a publicist named Timothy Cavendish (in 2012 United Kingdom) who's on the run from the mob friends of an author he published (Hanks), recently incarcerated for murder. He flees to his brother (Grant) for help and ends up locked up in a nursing home against his will, which he's bent on escaping from. The fifth story is set in future Korea in 2144 focusing on a clone named Sonmi-451 (Bae). Clones like her are slaves genetically engineered to serve in fast-food restaurants until they're no longer needed and killed. With the help of a young rebel (Sturgess playing an Asian, which has drew controversy) she escapes and brings about a revolution. The last story has Hanks starring as a tribesman named Zachry living in a primitive post-apocalyptic future, on an island in Hawaii, after most life has been wiped out. One of the last of the technologically advanced past, named Meronym (Berry), visits his tribe and saves his niece from dying (of illness). He agrees to guide her through the mountains to a post known as Cloud Atlas, where she can communicate with others who have left the planet. I at first did not like the way the stories jumped around so quickly. I didn't think it left the viewer enough time to get to know the characters and storyline of one story before jumping to another, making it much more confusing (than if it had been told in a more linear fashion). By the films end though the non-linear style was much more of an advantage to the movie in pacing, excitement as well as emotional involvement. For a good half of the movie I was disappointed in it because it was impossible to follow and a little boring. As it kept moving along though it got more and more interesting and exciting and kept building and building until by film's end I was totally in love with it. The conclusion is such an emotionally drenched and inspiring finish that it makes the entire, nearly three hour movie, pay off. You also understand the film a lot more, from beginning to end, once it's finished. It still requires multiple viewings and I'll probably see it at least a couple more times. I'm sure upon repeat viewing I'll appreciate the earlier, slower paced, scenes much more (that's the sign of a great movie). The acting, cinematography, makeup, set design, effects, directing and writing are all top notch. The score is also amazing (by one of the directors, Tykwer, as well as Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil) and probably the best I've heard all year. For me movies are all about moments (just like life is). I go to movies in search of great moments and that's what makes it stand out or not. Those moments also make everything else in between that much more important (just like life as well). This movie is full of many great and beautiful moments and that's why it's such a beautiful and important film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QlrJnwsHOM",10,37,71,2 November 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed!
","'KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Matthew Vaughn directs yet another action comic book movie (following 'KICK-ASS' and 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'), which is again adapted from material written by Mark Millar (the creator of the 'Kick-Ass' comics; as well as other popular titles like 'Wanted', 'Civil War' and 'The Ultimates'). It was written by Vaughn and his usual writing partner Jane Goldman. It stars Colin Firth as a highly skilled secret agent who recruits a street-smart young man into an elite secret agency force. They must do battle with a brilliant billionaire eco-terrorist, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie also costars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson, Sofia Boutella, Mark Hamill, Jack Davenport and Michael Caine. Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed.The Kingsmen are a special spy organization, in London, that recently lost one of their best agents. They begin a very tough, and highly competitive, recruitment process; to find his replacement. Agent Galahad (Firth) decides to give a young street-smart criminal a chance, named Eggsy (Egerton). Eggsy is the son of an old Kingsmen agent, who was killed on an assignment, with Galahad, in the Middle East; 17 years earlier. Galahad made a promise to help out the deceased agent's family. The agency is also preparing for a dangerous mission; to do battle with a rich tech genius, named Valentine (Jackson), who's threatening to kill millions in an insane population control plan.The movie is everything I expected it to be; it's full of witty characters, spouting off clever dialogue, in cool and very stylistic action scenes. It's also got a lot of excessive, and very over-the- top, violence and it's even more gory than Vaughn's, and Miller's, own ultra-violent 'KICK-ASS' films (I'd say). Firth is great in the movie and it's also a pretty funny British spy spoof too. The only real flaw (I can see), in the film, is that the main young hero isn't that likable; sure he's relatable, and a believable British punk, but he doesn't have a heck of a lot of character or charm. Firth make's up for what Egerton's character is lacking though and it's still a pretty awesome action flick; as a whole. I'm sure it'll become another beloved cult classic, for Matthew Vaughn and Mark Miller lovers!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o",9,6,14,4 March 2015
The Hangover Part III," Not completely devoid of laughs but a severe disappointment once again.
","'THE HANGOVER PART III': Three Stars (Out of Five)The third, and supposedly final, chapter in the blockbuster comedy series that began in 2009 with the surprise sleeper hit 'THE HANGOVER'. That film launched the movie star careers of it's three leads Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis. They all reprise their roles in this film (for the third time) and Todd Phillips once again directs. Phillips and Craig Mazin took over writing duties from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore in the second and third films (along with Scott Armstrong for 'PART II'). This time around the three buddies (along with Justin Bartha, reprising his role again for the third time) are taking Alan to rehab when their attacked by gangsters and Doug is kidnapped. It's a different formula than the first and second films (which we're almost identical) this time around and not nearly as funny. Like the second film it's a major disappointment from the classic original. The story focuses around Alan (Galifianakis) who's been off his meds for several months and keeps getting into lots of trouble. His father, Sid (Jeffrey Tambor reprising his role), dies as a result of the stress from Alan's actions. Alan's buddies Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Bartha) decide to take him to get the treatment he needs for his mental issues when they're attacked by a gangster named Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall wants revenge on the drug dealer, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong reprising his role), who recently escaped from prison. He kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the other three friends bring Mr. Chow to him. Sid, Stu and Doug come up with a plan to drug Chow and take him to Marshall but things go horribly wrong. The original 'HANGOVER' is one of my all time favorite comedies! I was so disappointed with 'THE HANGOVER PART II' for merely imitating the original film (almost exactly) and not coming up with any new laughs of it's own (a lot of the old jokes felt forced the second time as well). Here the filmmakers came up with a new formula and adventure to get their popular characters into but failed to deliver the laughs once again. For one thing the three leads are sober the whole film; how can you do a 'HANGOVER' film without getting the characters hung-over?! The actors give it their all and Phillips is always a decent director but the main problem with both sequels is Phillips thought he could replace the excellent two writers of the original film. He and Mazin don't know how to deliver the humor and fun that Lucas and Moore did (and the main reason this film isn't funny is it's lacking the fun). It's extremely dark, violent and just bizarre. It's hardly even a comedy film. Not completely devoid of laughs but a severe disappointment once again.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ucjLaVv_8",Null,2,5,30 May 2013
Easy A," A great throwback to the 80's when teen comedies ruled!
","'EASY A': Four Stars (Out of Five) Emma Stone (of 'ZOMBIELAND' and 'SUPERBAD' fame) stars in this surprisingly well made teen film that's sort of an homage to the great ones, like those of John Hughes (which the film references several times). It's directed by Will Gluck (an experienced television writer / producer who also directed the awful 'FIRED UP!') and written by first time writer Bert V. Royal. The film co-stars Penn Badgley, Cam Gigandet, Alison Michalka and Amanda Bynes (in what was supposed to be her last role but she changed her mind and un-retired). It also has several older experienced stars in impressive supporting roles like Thomas Haden Church, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm McDowell.Stone stars as Olive, a good girl who feels almost completely unnoticed at school. That all changes when she's coerced into fibbing to her best friend Rhiannon (Michalka) about losing her virginity to a guy she made up. That's overheard by stuck-up Christian gossip queen Marianne (Bynes) who blabs it all around school. Although despised by many she likes the sudden attention. So when bullied gay classmate Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks her to do him a favor and help spread a false rumor that she slept with him she feels morally obligated to do so (which furthers the rumors about her). More outcasts come to Olive for help and with a little cash incentive as well as pity she keeps helping them. Her life begins to imitate that of the character in the book 'The Scarlet Letter' which she's reading in school and things quickly spiral out of control.I didn't have any desire to see this movie after seeing the trailer and TV commercials, which sell it as a typical clichéd teen comedy, but after reading so many surprisingly positive reviews and witnessing it's equally impressive box-office earnings I felt compelled to do so (on video last week when it came out, through a dollar rental). I was surprised to learn all the hype is true; it is a surprisingly clever and entertaining teen comedy. The dialog is all witty, especially coming from the parents (Tucci and Clarkson, who play about the coolest parents ever depicted on screen) and Church (who plays one of the coolest teachers). The directing is effective and Stone's transition to leading lady is an impressive one as well (there's already a project re-teaming Stone with Gluck in the works). All of the supporting players are more than adequate, especially Bynes who makes a great bitchy religious nut. The film is funny, inspiring and a great throwback to the 80's (when teen comedies ruled).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw",8,0,0,29 December 2010
Fast Five," 'FAST FIVE' gets 3.5 out of 5.
","'FAST FIVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) I was never a big fan of the original 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' and thought it was severely over-hyped. With each sequel though I think the franchise has gotten better (although I never saw the third chapter: 'TOKYO DRIFT'). This one (for the first time) brings together key cast members from all of the other films including Vin Diesel (who sat out the second film and only did a cameo in the third), Paul Walker (who was absent from the third film), Jordana Brewster (who missed the second and third films) as well as Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Cal Gadot and Tego Calderon (who all co-starred in one or two of the other films). It also adds Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to the cast and fans finally get to see a long anticipated fight scene between he and Vin Diesel. The film is directed by Justin Lin (who also directed the last two films) and written by Chris Morgan (who wrote the last two films as well). It all adds up to a pretty entertaining action film that should definitely please most fans of the genre as well as fans of the franchise.The film opens directly where the last one left off with former FBI agent turned outlaw Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia (Brewster) breaking Mia's brother and Brian's buddy and partner in crime Dominic Toretto (Diesel) out of prison, by attacking the prison bus he's on. They then flee to Brazil and due to a botched car heist (where DEA agents are murdered) they're moved to the top of America's most wanted list. The baddest federal agent around, Lucas Hobbs (Johnson), is then put on assignment to track them down. O'Conner and Toretto then decide to pull one last big job on the crooked businessman, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who framed them by stealing $100 million of his laundered money. They bring in a team of former associates to help them pull off the heist.The movie is really predictable and the story and character development pretty routine but the action scenes are amazing. The film does drag a little in the middle, during the overlong heist setup part of the film but for the most part it's really fast paced and thrilling. The stunts are some of the best ever performed (probably) and the amount of sheer destruction in the film is astonishing. There are several scenes that seriously push the realm of logic and reality but it's all in good senseless fun. The Rock makes a cool addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Diesel doesn't disappoint. The film is most likely everything you think it's going to be and it delivers exactly what it promises. In that sense it's definitely a success and in my opinion at least a little better than all the others in the franchise (just adding the Rock makes it that much better).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_pFXcDSfo",7,5,10,30 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Contributing to the raping of the imagination?
","'THE TWILIGHT SAGE: ECLIPSE': Two Stars (Out of Five) I've never been one to jump on the band wagon and hate something just because it's popular to hate; I disliked the first 'TWILIGHT' movie the first time I saw it on opening weekend even before I had any idea it would be so infamously loathed by so many (and yet loved by an equal number, which is always the case). I was actually expecting a good movie since it was directed by a good director (Catherine Hardwick, who helm-ed such well respected movies as 'THIRTEEN', which she also co-wrote, and 'LORDS OF DOGTOWN') and starring the very talented Kristen Stewart, not to mention the fact that it was based on an immensely popular book about vampires and werewolves (but popular books can be just as trashy and poorly made as popular movies and I've heard from people that have read the books, as well, that they're just as bad as the movies based on them). So I was somewhat surprised to find out how awful the movie actually was and then later learned that many others agreed. I thought the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, was about the worst actor I had ever seen in a major motion picture and the dialog and drama was so cheesy and ridiculous that it wasn't even so bad it was good, it was just nauseating. The sequels have gotten a little better with each one though through well executed business tactics. Experts take note on everything that doesn't work about a film and attempt to somewhat fix it with the next installment.With this chapter they've really tried to draw in at-least a small number of males with their almost solely female audience by making it slightly more of an action / horror film. To do this they hired yet another impressive director David Slade (the man who brought us '30 DAYS OF NIGHT' and 'HARD CANDY'). He does manage to deliver some somewhat impressive thrilling and horrendous action scenes but they're few and far between. What he also does well is attempt to cut all the boring crap down; he only lets Pattinson speak as long as he needs to for plot development and edits camera shots of him to make his acting appear not quite as atrocious. There are a few good scenes between Stewart and the only other good actor in the series Billy Burke, playing her father, but then Slade also allows Taylor Lautner to yap for way too long which is a fatal mistake. The only actor that should be allowed to speak at any extended amount of time in this series is Kristen Stewart. Lautner managed to suck so badly that in this installment he made himself look like a worse actor than Pattinson! The film tells of the continuing romance between Bella (Stewart) and the vampire 'like' creature known as Edward (played by Pattinson, and he's not really a vampire considering the fact that he can survive in the sunlight but the movies still shits on the vampire mythology by calling him one) and her struggle to fight off the sexual advances of her werewolf stalker buddy Jacob (played by Lautner). This time around there's a female blood sucking creature (now played by Bryce Dallas Howard) building an army of freshly born blood suckers in order to kill Bella and get revenge for the death of her brother (from film one). The only way this series could possibly come to a somewhat satisfying conclusion is if it's revealed that Bella is actually a more deadly and vicious creature than them all and is manipulating everyone to her will. That would be pretty cool.I saw this movie at the drive-in which is probably the best way to see it considering it's really just a glorified 'B' monster movie and trashy 'B' romance. If you really respect film you have to acknowledge what's good about a movie even if parts of it are repulsive. A movie like this isn't all bad; you can't just say it's a zero star movie because parts of it are atrocious. The director and crew pretty effectively deliver exactly what it's core fan following wants to see. You can argue that that's contributing to the raping of their imagination though. I know the books were intended for ten to thirteen year old girls which it does make sense why they would like them but it doesn't make sense why anyone older than that would actually enjoy these movies and consider them well made in any way. I think the only reason grown women like these movies is because they think the two lead guys are hot which proves that women are generally more superficial than men. You don't see guys becoming obsessed with movies that some hot actress like Megan Fox is in just because she looks good in it and actually trick themselves into thinking they're well made movies. Women act like they're less superficial than they are and men act like they're more superficial than they are but things are actually reversed; women are a lot less likely to settle in the looks department than men on average, they're obsessed with appearance as these movies show.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8",4,5,8,14 September 2010
John Wick: Chapter 2," Classic badass action hero!
","'JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2014 action hit 'JOHN WICK', starring Keanu Reeves (once again) as the title character. The story revolves around Wick, a retired hit-man, who's once again forced to go back into his former world of violence, when a bounty is placed on his head. The movie is also once again directed by Chad Stahelski, and it's once again written by Derek Kolstad as well. Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Lance Reddick and Bridget Moynahan (briefly) also all reprise their roles from the first film; while Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose, Common and Laurence Fishburne (Reeves' former 'MATRIX' trilogy costar) also play supporting roles in this sequel. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and fans alike, and it's also a hit at the Box Office too. I also really enjoyed it (just like I did the first film).The movie begins right where the first one left off, with John Wick (Reeves) tracking down his stolen car, at a chop shop, and getting revenge on those that stole it. He's then approached, at his home, by a crime lord named Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio). The crime boss wants him to assassinate his sister (Claudia Gerini), so he can take her place at a council for crime lords. Wick initially rejects the assignment, but he soon learns that the bloody crime world, which he so desperately wants to leave, won't let him retire.The film is once again nonstop action, and very bloody (and excessively violent) action as well. If you're a fan of the first movie, I'm sure you'll love it; especially if you're a fan of Keanu Reeves. I'm a big fan of Reeves as a person, and I like him as an actor, in certain roles too; but he sucks in a lot of roles as well. John Wick is definitely one of his best parts. The character is becoming a classic badass action hero, and the series is now becoming a classic action movie franchise. I can't wait to see what the third movie brings!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",9,8,16,15 February 2017
Annihilation," Very dark and bizarrely beautiful sci-fi masterpiece, but I can also see why some don't like it.
","'ANNIHILATION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new science fiction horror flick from writer/director Alex Garland (who also performed both duties on 2014's 'EX MACHINA'). It's about a biologist who volunteers to lead an expedition into a dangerous environmental zone, after her husband comes out of the zone seriously injured, and the sole survivor of his expedition. It's based on the novel, of the same name, by Jeff VanderMeer. The film stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. It's gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but it also performed really poorly at a test screening (which prompted a Netflix release overseas, instead of a theatrical one). I think the film is a very dark and bizarrely beautiful sci-fi masterpiece, and I can also see why a lot of people won't like it. A year has passed since a team of soldiers entered an environmental disaster zone, and never returned. One soldier, named Kane (Isaac), suddenly reappears, much to the desperate relief of his biologist wife Lena (Portman), but he doesn't remember where he's been or how he got home. Then he has a sudden medical emergency, and is rushed to a hospital. In an attempt to help him, Lena decides to join a team of all female scientists, on an expedition back into the environmental zone. Things of course don't go as planned.The movie is very hauntingly beautiful, and it's especially highlighted by an awesomely haunting score, and some breathtaking visuals. The story is interesting, but it's definitely slow-paced, and the climax is much more of an intellectual payoff than a spectacular action scene (which many viewers might be hoping for). So I can definitely see why some people would hate this film, but I loved it. It's one I definitely won't forget anytime soon too, and it's great to see Natalie Portman (my old favorite actress) back in top form!",9,599,1107,23 February 2018
Minions," It's probably an OK kids' film.
","'MINIONS': Two Stars (Out of Five)A prequel/spin-off to the popular 'DESPICABLE ME' animated film series. It tells the origin story of the super-villain Gru's little minion helpers. The film was directed by Pierre Coffin (who also co- directed the two 'DESPICABLE ME' movies) and Kyle Balda; Coffin also voices all of the minions, in the film. It was written by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy and costars the voice talents of Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan and Geoffrey Rush. The film is pretty silly, and rarely funny, but it's probably an OK kids' film.The story starts at the beginning of time, when the minions were first born; as single-celled yellow organisms. They evolved into little naive creatures, with just one passion; to serve the most despicable master they could find. After killing every villain they've ever met, they go into hiding in Antarctica. But after years of depression, three minions (Kevin, Stuart and Bob; all voiced by Coffin) decide to venture out into the world, to find a new master. They meet Scarlet Overkill (Bullock), in Orlando, and find a purpose to live again. The movie is probably the kind of stupid cartoon I would have liked as a kid, but it's painful to watch as an adult. Most of the jokes are really stupid and there's no really likable characters to root for (just the minions). A few moments are funny, but it's definitely not as good as either 'DESPICABLE ME' film (which I'm not a big fan of either). Kids will like it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/uINe8REiZw0",4,1,3,7 August 2015
Incredibles 2," Didn't live up to my very high expectations.
","'INCREDIBLES 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)Pixar and Disney's long anticipated sequel to their 2004 animated superhero blockbuster 'THE INCREDIBLES'. The plot follows the Parr family once again, as they battle a new enemy, who wants to turn the public against all 'supers', while they also try to deal with normal family life as well. The film was once again written and directed by Brad Bird, and it features returning voice cast members including Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson. Huck Milner, Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush and Bill Wise also join the cast this time. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like it's predecessor), and it's also expected to be a huge hit at the Box Office once again as well. I enjoyed it, but definitely not as much as the original. The Parr family is still acting as the superhero team known as 'The Incredibles' when the authorities become too concerned about the damage being done during their battles with supervillains, and the team is ordered to halt their actions. Then they're contacted by a superhero fan named Winston Deavor (Odenkirk), and invited to his house for a proposition, along with their friend Frozone (Jackson). There Winston and his sister Evelyn (Keener) offer Helen Parr (Hunter) a superhero job fighting crime, in order to win back the support of the public. Helen accepts the job offer, and Bob Parr stays home to watch the kids while she works. Helen has to battle a new supervillain in the process, and Hank finds parenting even harder than crime fighting, especially when he learns their baby Jack-Jack has even greater superhero powers than they all do. The movie is really well made once again, and always beautiful to watch. The action scenes are mostly exciting too, and the humor is clever and witty (all once again). It's also great how progressive these films are, especially this time having the wife superhero be the one fighting crime, while the husband stays home to watch the kids. Of course he also finds parenting to be even harder than crime fighting too. That's all great about this movie, but it still didn't live up to my very high expectations of matching the original (or even coming close to it). It doesn't capture the same magic, and after the original film was so refreshing and somewhat groundbreaking at the time of it's release, there wasn't much this sequel could do to live up to it of course. It's still really well made though, and entertaining enough.",8,17,55,15 June 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," The jokes are forced and the action is chaotic, should please kids though.
","'MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPE'S MOST WANTED': Two Stars (Out of Five) The second sequel to the popular DreamWorks animated movie finds the animal characters from the first two films once again trying to make their way home to New York Central Zoo, where they originally escaped from. This time they join a traveling circus in Europe and have an evil Animal Control Captain hot on their trail. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Andy Richter and Tom McGrath all reprise their voice roles and are joined this time by Jessica Chastain, Frances McDormand, Bryan Cranston and Martin Short. The film is just more of the same and I was never a fan of the series to begin with (although I don't think I ever saw the second installment). The jokes are forced and the action is chaotic. Should please kids though.Alex the lion (Stiller), Marty the zebra (Rock), Melman the giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Smith) are still trying to make their way home to the New York Central Zoo, which they escaped from in the original film and traveled to Madagascar (with the help of four penguins). In this film they first journey to Monte Carlo, in order to find the penguins once again. There they find trouble once again as well and have Animal Control called on them. The Captain of Animal Control (McDormand) wants nothing more than to kill Alex and relentlessly pursues him and the other animals. They join a traveling circus, as cover, and find a new family of struggling friends there. They're soon, of course, not sure if they even want to go back to the zoo in New York or not.The film was directed by Eric Darnell, Conrad Vernon and Tom McGrath (Darnell and McGrath also co-directed and co-wrote the first two films as well). Noah Baumbach (who directed and wrote such critically acclaimed hits as 'GREENBERG' and 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE') also co-wrote the screenplay for this. Considering all the talent involved (in acting, writing and directing) I just expect a lot more. I know the movie is made for kids, and on that level it succeeds, but kids' movies don't have to be so dumbed down and pointless. They can actually be smart, clever and have a well thought out message. This movie is just a mess. A mess that kids will enjoy but probably no one else.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ",4,16,28,21 February 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," The songs are absolutely beautiful and make up one of the year's best soundtracks!
","'INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The Coen brothers' newest film is yet another of 2013's biggest Oscar contenders, as well as one of the best reviewed movies (of last year) and the Coens' careers! It's about a broke folk singer trying to make a living, by following his dreams, in New York City's Greenwich Village (during a week in 1961). It stars Oscar Isaac as the title character and co-stars Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Adam Driver, Garrett Hedlund, F. Murray Abraham and John Goodman (who appears in almost every Coen brothers' movie). I found the film to be interesting and entertaining enough (despite an overly depressing nature and lack of story) but most of all I loved the movie's music.The film takes place during one week in New York City's Greenwich Village, during February of 1961. There's no plot at all but it does have a decent amount of interesting character development. The movie tells the story of Llewyn Davis (Isaac), a struggling musician and ex-merchant marine. He was a part of a mildly popular folk singing duo but his partner committed suicide. He's now trying to make it on his own but his solo album 'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't selling. He's broke but makes a little bit of money playing clubs while sleeping on friends' couches and waiting for his manager to get his record distributed. He also has to deal with a bitter ex-lover (Mulligan), who thinks she's pregnant with his baby, and take care of a friend's cat (he locked out of it's apartment by accident).The movie is funny in places (in the Coens' usual style) but mostly it's a pretty serious character driven drama about the struggles of a gifted small-time musician. In that way it reminded me a lot of the 2009 film 'CRAZY HEART'. T-Bone Burnett did a lot of the music for that movie as he does this one (and a couple of other Coen brothers' films as well; 'O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?' and 'THE LADYKILLERS'). The songs in this film were mostly recorded live and played in their entirety. I think they're absolutely beautiful and make up one of the year's best soundtracks (without a doubt). Because of the music I give the movie an especially high rating but the dark negative subject matter and lack of plot certainly don't make the film one of the funnest movies of the year (or the Coens' careers). It does seem very true to life though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",9,0,0,16 January 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," A horror fan's wet dream!
","'THE CABIN IN THE WOODS': Five Stars (Out of Five) The best reviewed movie of the year, so far, is this B slasher film from 'Nerd God' Joss Whedon! Whedon co-wrote and produced the film and his buddy, a usual partner in crime of his, Drew Goddard directed the film. The cast features new Whedon 'Go-To Man' Chris Hemsworth (who also plays 'Thor' in Whedon's upcoming 'AVENGERS' film). The film is a meta slasher flick spoof and the best of it's type since 'SCREAM' or possibly even 'EVIL DEAD II'! The story revolves around five friends going on vacation at a remote cabin in the middle of the woods owned by Curt's (Hemsworth) cousin. Despite being warned of danger by a creepy gas station attendant (Tim De Zarn) they continue to the cabin and also investigate it's mysterious basement, which is full of strange artifacts. Meanwhile they're being watched by technicians at a government facility and we learn they're guinea pigs in some kind of experiment. The film constantly winks it's eye at the viewer as it runs through every horror cliché imaginable.The movie is brilliantly tongue in cheek and the perfect homage to B horror films. The script is clever and the directing is perfectly fitting. The cast is all perfect in their roles (especially memorable turns from Fran Kranz, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford). It's hilarious as well as perfectly gruesome (a horror fan's wet dream) and the climax is more than any monster movie fan could ask for. Classic Joss Whedon!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGSyQ_obeNo",10,4,18,22 April 2012
Spectre," Not quite as good as 'SKYFALL' or 'CASINO ROYALE', but it is one of the better Bond films.
","'SPECTRE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The 24th James Bond movie; and the 4th installment starring Daniel Craig. This one has Bond battling an evil organization, known as SPECTRE, as well as corrupt political forces. It was directed by Sam Mendes (who also helmed the last Bond flick, 'SKYFALL') and it was written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterwort. The movie costars Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott and Monica Bellucci. It's not quite as good as 'SKYFALL' or 'CASINO ROYALE', but it is one of the better Bond films (throughout the franchise's history).James Bond (Craig) is on a special mission, given to him by the deceased M (Judi Dench), before she died, to track down a ruthless organization known as SPECTRE. He's relieved from duty, by his new superior, the new M (Fiennes), but travels to Rome anyway; in pursuit of the terrorist organization. Bond finds aid from former allies, Q (Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Harris), while also falling for the daughter of a previous enemy, named Dr. Madeline Swann (Seydoux). Bond also finds lethal opposition, from the head of SPECTRE, Franz Oberhauser (Waltz), and his deadly henchman, Mr. Hinx (Bautista). At the same time there's a political struggle, between the new M and the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service, called C (Scott); who wants to eliminate the '00' program.The movie cost between $245 and $300 million to make, and it's reportedly one of the most expensive films ever made; you can see nearly every dollar of it up on screen though! The action scenes are breathless and geniuslly done. I really like Bautista as Mr. Hinx; I think he's probably the best Bond goon since Richard Kiel, as Jaws. At times the film even feels a lot like 'THE SPY WHO LOVED ME'. The romance, of the film, is completely unbelievable though (even for a Bond movie) and Seydoux was severely miscast as a Bond girl (her and Craig have absolutely no chemistry together). I wish Bellucci (the oldest actress ever cast as a Bond girl, at 51) didn't have such a small part. Like all James Bond movies, the film is too long, and slow-paced (at times), but it's still well worth seeing!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/kdQGbNrUAnk",9,10,25,6 November 2015
Joy," A classic female empowerment tale!
","'JOY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new comedy-drama flick from writer/director David O. Russell, starring Jennifer Lawrence (it's their third time working together). The film also reunites Lawrence, and O. Russell, with actors Robert De Niro (for the third time) and Bradley Cooper (marking Lawrence and Cooper's forth pairing together, in a film, and O. Russell's third time working with Cooper). The movie tells the true story of Joy Mangano; a self-made millionaire, who started a business empire, selling her invention 'the Miracle Mop'. O. Russell directed and co-wrote the film, with Annie Mumolo; it also costars Edgar Ramirez, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Isabella Rossellini. I absolutely loved the movie; and found it to be yet another masterpiece, from David O. Russell (one of my favorite filmmakers). The story begins in 1992; when Joy Mangano (Lawrence) was already divorced, with two kids, and working for United Airlines. Her mother (Madsen), grandmother (Ladd) and ex-husband (Ramirez) were all living with her, and her kids, in Quogue, New York. Her father, Rudy (De Niro), moves back in with Joy; after breaking up with his second wife. Rudy then begins dating a rich Italian widower, named Trudy (Rossellini). While spending the day with Rudy and Trudy, on Trudy's boat, Joy breaks a wine glass. When she cleans up the broken glass, she comes up with the brilliant idea of a 'Miracle Mop'. Joy then becomes obsessed with following her dream; of becoming a successful businesswoman, by selling her new idea. The movie is classic David O. Russell; it's filled with crazy oddball characters, and extremely bizarre comedic situations (involving them). The film also has powerful, and very inspiring, dramatic moments. All of the performances in the film are impressive, but it's Lawrence who really powers the story (once again). The film is a classic female empowerment tale; Lawrence's 'Joy' character makes her dreams come true, almost entirely on her own, despite interference from multiple loved ones (and other complications) around her. It's another inspiring classic from David O. Russell, and Lawrence is a the top of her form!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/CoUgbXLzKSQ",10,1,9,4 January 2016
Her," Sometimes the best movies are the hardest ones to review.
","'HER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Spike Jonze's new romantic comedy/sci-fi drama film about a writer who develops feelings for his new computer operating system. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as the writer and Scarlett Johansson as the voice of the operating system. It also features Amy Adams, Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde in supporting roles and it's the first time Jonze has written a screenplay solo. The film is one of the best reviewed movies of the year and it's racking up several awards and award nominations (including likely Oscar nods). I found it to be a very involving and subtly beautiful sci-fi love story.Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, an introvert who works as a writer; writing letters for those that need help communicating personal messages of love and emotional feelings. He's extremely lonely and spends most of his free time playing video games, while struggling through a divorce with his longtime partner Catherine (Mara). To help himself cope Twombly purchases a computer operating system that's designed to develop feelings and learn things just like a human does. He gives it a female voice (Johansson) and it names itself Samantha. Theodore is amazed by how lifelike Samantha is and quickly develops feelings for her, which leads to a complicated romantic relationship.The movie deals with broad concepts like 'evolved consciousness' and 'technological singularity', it's also a great commentary on the internet and technological age we live in now (most of the things and ways of life in the film seem like they could be right around the corner). I think it's best at dealing with life's most personal and relatable issues though. For me the most moving and memorable scenes were the one's that dealt with such basic but complicated issues as a first date (and having it turn terribly awkward, while receiving a somewhat hostile reaction from your date because of it). It is a very touching and beautiful movie about learning what love really means and how to relate to others (in the modern technological age). I think it's Spike Jonze's best directorial effort yet and his most brilliant screenplay. Phoenix is once again outstanding and very likable in the lead and although I don't quite think Johansson deserves an Oscar nomination she is great as well. The film is a masterpiece that demands repeat viewings and it's really hard to explain how I totally feel about it, in written or verbal words (perhaps I need to hire a writer like Twombly), but sometimes the best movies are the hardest ones to review. This might not be very useful at all (and is probably pretty poorly written) but it should get my main message across (at least) that it's a movie that's definitely worth seeing and a highly enjoyable and thought provoking filmgoing experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x-FDEJ5nhQ",10,0,2,17 January 2014
The Nice Guys," A great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of)!
","'THE NICE GUYS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Action-buddy flick from filmmaker Shane Black. Black previously wrote (or co-wrote) such popular (and classic) action-buddy movies as 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'LETHAL WEAPON 2', 'THE LAST BOY SCOUT', 'LAST ACTION HERO', 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT', 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' and 'IRON MAN 3' (he also directed the latter two). The film hearkens back to the glory days, of his greatest work ('LETHAL WEAPON' and 'KISS KISS BANG BANG'). The movie was directed and co-written by Black, with first time film writer Anthony Bagarozzi (it was also produced by Joel Silver). It stars Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling; as two mismatched private investigators, trying to solve the disappearance of a missing girl (in 1970's Los Angeles). The film also costars Angourie Rice, Margaret Qualley, Matt Bomer, Keith David, Beau Knapp and Kim Basinger. I loved it!Gosling plays Holland March; a private detective, in 1970's Los Angeles, and single father. He's good at his job, but he also takes advantage of people; and he's also a bumbling alcoholic (due to the fact that his wife recently passed away). His daughter, Holly (Rice), takes care of him, more than he looks out for her. Crowe plays an enforcer named Jack Healey. Healey is also very good at his job, but he's also only motivated monetarily. March and Healey's paths cross, when they're both involved in the same missing girl case. They reluctantly team up, in order to solve it.The movie is hilarious; due to some really cleverly written dialogue, and some insanely odd comic scenarios. It's also a great action flick; with some highly entertaining, and extremely well- executed, action scenes. The characters are really well written, and acted, and there's even some really touching drama (involving them). The movie exceeds on all fronts, and there's never a dull moment. Besides all that, it's just a great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of).

Mad Max: Fury Road," Believe all the hype; it's a pure cinematic masterpiece!
","'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)George Miller's big-budget reboot to his immensely popular post-apocalyptic 'MAD MAX' trilogy (from the 70s and 80s). This one stars Tom Hardy, in the title role, replacing Mel Gibson (who played the role in all three previous films). It also stars Charlize Theron and costars Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne (who also played the villain in the original movie), Nathan Jones, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Josh Helman. Miller directed and co-produced the film, as well as co- wrote the screenplay; with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris (two first time film writers). The story revolves around Max teaming up with another rebellious survivor, named Furiosa, as they try to outrun a crazed cult leader, and his army, and make it across the desert to Furiosa's homeland, with the cult leader's five wives. It was made on a budget of $100 to $150 million, but it's full of impressive practical effects and old school stunts (and a small amount of CGI). It's the first installment in 30 years and although it takes place after the events of the original trilogy, it also reintroduces us to Max; and goes back over his origins, as well as the origins of the world he now lives in. The film has gotten nothing but rave reviews from critics, at an unprecedented level (for a genre action flick like this), and it could be a possible 'Best Picture' contender, come awards time (it should be). I absolutely love this movie!The setting is, once again, that of a distant, chaotic future; after normal civilization has collapsed, and just about everyone has gone crazy. Max Rockatansky (Hardy) is still a loner survivalist, on the run from his past (and the ghosts of his dead family). He's kidnapped by cultists, called War Boys; an army under the leadership of a fascist dictator named Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne). When a beloved cultist commander, of Joe's, named Furiosa (Theron), goes rogue, and steals his five enslaved wives, Joe leads his whole army after them in pursuit. Furiosa is trying to lead the women to the place where she grew up, in hopes of a better life. She reluctantly teams up with Max, in order to do so.I think seeing this film in the theater, was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life (and I plan on doing it again, really soon); I recommend to all true cinephiles, that they see it the same way! The visuals are breathtaking and the action is absolutely glorious, and non-stop; it also has an awesome score (by Junkie XL). It's full of extremely bizarre, and memorably quirky, characters too; and it even has a little heart, thrown in, as well. The movie feels like a throwback to the 80s; but it's also a groundbreaking milestone, in film and art (in general), in it's own right. Miller created an amazingly artistic, and disturbingly beautiful, world; of crazy characters and totally insane, and admirably captivating, chaos (as he did with 'THE ROAD WARRIOR', and to a lesser extent 'MAD MAX' and 'MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME'). The film is like 'THE ROAD WARRIOR' times ten though, and I'd rank it among the all-time greatest action movies ever (like 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'THE DARK KNIGHT' and 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'). It's more than an action film though; people call it a 'punk western (on wheels)', which I agree with, but it also celebrates uniqueness and being different (as well as not conforming to popular society). It shows how mental illness can be a good thing; how some of the biggest heroes, among us, are totally mad! Believe all the hype; it's a pure cinematic masterpiece!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP0y3MxfaMM",10,10,20,15 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Best war film since 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'!
","'HACKSAW RIDGE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new war biopic set during WWII, and based on the life of Desmond Doss; the first conscientious objector, and American pacifist, to be awarded the Medal of Honor. The film was directed by Mel Gibson, and it's the first movie he's directed since 2006's 'APOCALYPTO'. It was written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Rachel Griffiths and Hugo Weaving. It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's also been a modest hit at the Box Office (costing just $45 million to make). I think it's one of the best war films I've ever seen!Desmond T. Doss (Garfield) was raised in Lynchburg, Virginia, by a very religious mother (Griffiths). His father (Weaving) was an alcoholic, due to his negative experiences in the Great War. After almost killing his brother, Hal (Roman Guerriero), while fighting when they were kids, Desmond becomes a very passionate believer in the Sixth Commandment. This becomes a severe problem when Desmond feels the need to serve his country, during World War II. After a great deal of harassment, and several obsessive attempts by his commanding officers (Worthington and Vaughn) to have him thrown out of the Army, Desmond goes on to save the lives of 75 fellow soldiers, as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa, and win the Medal of Honor.The movie has been praised by many critics as being the best war film since 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN', and I would agree; it's every bit as horrifically realistic, and violent, and it's also just as well made. I'm a big fan of Mel Gibson; as an actor and a director, but especially a director (and I've missed him over the last ten years). This film stands as one of his greatest; it's at least in the same league as 'BRAVEHEART' and 'THE PASSION OF THE Christ'. I'm also a fan of Andrew Garfield; he's my favorite Spider-Man, and I think he's a very talented and passionate actor. He's good in the lead, and Worthington, Vaughn and Weaving are all outstanding in supporting roles as well. What I most like about the film is it's message; it deals with a very passionate rebel outcast, who must do battle with nearly everyone else, and take on a lot of harassment, in order to stick up for his beliefs; and he does it beautifully. The movie is extremely moving, and breathtakingly beautiful; it's one of the year's very best!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30",10,4,8,16 November 2016
Warcraft," I probably would have liked the film much more, when I was a kid.
","'WARCRAFT: THE BEGINNING': Four Stars (Out of Five)Fantasy-action flick; based on the immensely popular video game franchise, and novel series (of the same name). This movie tells the origin story, of how an army of orcs invaded the world of Azeroth; to take it for their own. It was directed by Duncan Jones (who also helmed such other popular sci-fi flicks, as 'MOON' and 'SOURCE CODE'); it was also written by Jones and Charles Leavitt (based on a story, and characters, created by Chris Metzen). The film stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Daniel Wu and Ben Schnetzer. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, but it's also been a hugely profitable blockbuster overseas (breaking many records, all around the world). I really wanted to like this movie, and I did love it's visuals, but the story and characters are a little disappointing. The film tells the story of a world of orcs, called Draenor, that's quickly dying. They've discovered a portal, using a powerful magic force called the fel, that will lead them to another world (known as Azeroth). The army of orcs, known as the Horde, is lead by a sinister orc, named Gul'dan (Wu); who uses the fel to drain the life force of other species (in order to fuel the portal). One noble orc chieftan, named Durotan (Kebbell), doesn't want to enslave the people of Azeroth (for this purpose). So Durotan, and a half-breed (orc-human) named Garona (Patton), attempt to form an alliance with the humans there. The humans are lead by a king, named Llane (Cooper), and a knight, named Lothar (Fimmel).I've never played the game, or read any of the books (or comics), so I didn't have any real high expectations for this movie. I did love the trailer though, because of it's visuals; and I have to say, the special effects (in this movie) are some of the best I've ever seen. I also love epic sc-fi fantasy flicks, like this. I'm just disappointed that the story, and characters, don't live up to the film's spectacular visuals. Duncan Jones is a very talented director; but his wife did get cancer during the production of this movie (and his father, David Bowie, died of it). Still, I think he delivered. I think the movie's main problems are due to it's script (which Jones did help write though). I think it was probably too faithful to the video game series, and novels. The story might have worked really well in those formats, but translating it to other art forms (like film) doesn't always work. I hope the sequels are much better (I did absolutely love this movie's visuals though). I probably would have liked the film much more, when I was a kid.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",8,2,3,16 June 2016
Me Before You," Will Traynor definitely has the wrong outlook on life,
","'ME BEFORE YOU': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A rom-com/drama about a paralyzed former banker, that's planning to kill himself, who falls for his new caregiver. The movie stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin (as the two leads), and it costars Charles Dance, Janet McTeer, Steve Peacocke, Matthew Lewis, Brendan Coyle and Jenna Coleman. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Thea Sharrock, and it was written by Jojo Moyes; adapted from her 2012 novel, of the same name. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and some negative backlash from the disability rights movement (over what they perceive to be a very negative message about people with disabilities). Despite the negative controversy, the movie was a huge hit at the Box Office (making over $200 million worldwide). I do understand how some people could be offended by this film, but I also think it's a well made, and sometimes very touching, movie.Louisa Clark (Clarke) had worked for a local café, for six years, when she's unexpectedly laid off from it. Desperate to find work, she responds to a caregiver job opening; working for a wealthy family named the Traynors. Will Traynor (Claflin) was a successful banker, before he was paralyzed (two years earlier) in a motorcycle accident. He's now very cynical, and he's not very welcoming of Louisa's assistance. After some time though, the two begin to get along quite well; despite the fact that Louisa has a boyfriend (Lewis). When Louisa learns that Will is planning to kill himself, she tries to come up with a list of things for him to do; in order to make him love life again. Will feels like he's too much of a burden on others though, to keep on living, despite his strong feelings for Louisa. I definitely think that the Will Traynor character (in this film) has the wrong outlook on life; and his views definitely shouldn't be encouraged, or promoted (and it does seem like that's what the movie is kind of doing). So I understand why people are offended by this film; but if you look at it just as being the way that this specific character sees life though, than I think it's something that could possibly be overlooked. Despite this major flaw, the movie is very well made; the main characters (despite their flaws) are very likable, and the film is quite moving (at times). The two lead performances are both good, and it's great to see another strong female empowering role, like the one that Clarke plays, as the central character in a big movie like this. It's also nice to see both a talented woman director, as well as a gifted female screenwriter, behind a major film like this. It's just a shame that the movie has that one major flaw to it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",7,1,1,1 February 2017
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The film is once again (like all of Bay's films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face. It's also a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing!
","'TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON': Four Stars (Out of Five) The third chapter in director Michael Bay's immensely popular super robot franchise, based on the popular 80's cartoon show and Hasbro toy series. Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and most of the rest of the cast are back. With one obvious exception of course; Megan Fox. Due to conflict with the film's producers (Bay and Steven Spielberg) Fox was fired from the project. She's been replaced by popular Victoria's Secret's model Rosie Huntington Whiteley (who has worked with Bay before on a 2009 Victoria's Secret commercial). Also new to this film are John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Ken Jeong and others. Ehren Kruger (who co-wrote the last installment) returns as the sole scriptwriter this time around. The film is once again (like all of Bay's films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face. It's also a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing.This adventure begins in 1961 while the Autobot's and Deceptions still wage war on their home planet of Cybertron. An aging Autobot known as Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, who also voiced the character Galvatron in 'THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE' 1986 animated film) escapes the planet with special teleportation technology called Pillars that could end the war for good. He crash lands on the moon and has been wrecked there ever since. When Optimus Prime (once again voiced by the legendary voice actor Peter Cullen) learns that the U.S. government has known about Sentinel's whereabouts and the Pillars for some time he becomes extremely angry and makes it his mission to bring Sentinel home to Earth. The Decepticons meanwhile lay in wait, waiting for the appropriate time to strike and seize control of the Pillars. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf reprising his most famous role) at the same time is struggling with unemployment (even though he helped save the world twice and earned a medal from President Obama) and feelings of inadequacy while trying to impress his new super hot girlfriend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley).The story is once again pretty simple but things still seem to get very convoluted and hard to follow (in classic Michael Bay fashion). The film always moves at breakneck speeds regardless of what's going on (whether it's a simple dialogue scene or an elaborate action spectacle). It jumps from slapstick comedy to emotional drama to explosive action, without a moment's pause, and back again (constantly). The whole thing becomes very exhausting (like all of Bay's films) and you really need some strong caffeine or some kind of drug (whatever LaBeouf is on) to keep up with it. This kind of material can definitely leave the viewer with a severe headache if they're not in the right mindset. With that said the movie is still a heck of a lot of fun and you get far more than your money's worth (there's so much going on). The scam is that it takes you three or four times of seeing the film just to process it all. The action scenes are breathtaking, the 3D visuals are arguably the best since 'AVATAR' and the comedy for the most part is very funny. The script is a complete mess but that's not really important with this type of film. LaBeouf's shtick is getting a little old but for me it still works. The guy has so much energy and is still hilarious in the right role (and Witwicky is the perfect showcase for LaBeouf's comedic and improvisational talents). Some people hate the parent characters but in my opinion Kevin Dunn and Julie White are always scene stealers in these films. Huntington-Whitely does a good job of looking extremely glamorous and beautiful (and that's all she really has to do) but I still prefer Megan Fox (or anyone more real). Bay's directing is once again Bay's directing; you either love it or hate it. I personally love it. Seeing one of his films is a very unique experience and it is almost like being on drugs in a way. It's mind-blowing! I love creative independent films made for next to nothing but I also love big visually exploitative films (made on budgets of 2 to 300 million dollars). I think there's room for both types of film-making in the marketplace and one style doesn't hurt the other. They can co-exist! If you enjoy these types of films you'll definitely enjoy this one too.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeZHJaLfc8",8,5,10,4 July 2011
The Social Network," Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see!
","The best reviewed film (so far) this year and early Oscar front-runner 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is upon us! David Fincher (one of my all time favorite directors) directs this adaptation of the popular book 'The Accidental Billionaires: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal' by Ben Mezrich from a script written by Aaron Sorkin (who also wrote 'A FEW GOOD MEN', 'THE American PRESIDENT' and created the TV series 'THE WEST WING' to name a few of his credits). The book, if you haven't heard, is an account of how the internet social networking site 'facebook' was founded, mostly centering on the lawsuits that followed it's immediate success and the relationships of the people involved. Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mark Zuckerberg (the majority stockholder) and Andrew Garfield co-stars as co-founder Eduardo Saverin. The real Zuckerberg fought hard against this film's release (in this form) fearing it will tarnish his image and he denies it bears much factual bearing at all, to real life events, but the real Saverin was the main consultant on the book. Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see!The story is mostly set in 2003 beginning at Harvard University in the fall and then flashing back and forth between court procedures involving the litigation battles over the ownership of 'facebook'. As the film opens Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica (played by Rooney Mara, who was just cast as the lead in Fincher's upcoming remake of 'THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO'). Mark is so upset that he goes back to his dorm room, gets wasted and blogs about her and then creates a brief internet site called 'facemash' comparing Harvard girls to each other in ranking of 'hotness'. This gives him notoriety and he is approached by the Winklevoss brothers (both played by Armie Hammer, in addition to a stand-in) about programming an internet social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students, in an attempt to help get them laid. Zuckerberg leads the brothers on, as well as their business partner Divya Narendra (played by Max Minghella, son of award winning director Anthony Minghella), and tells them he's working on their project while coming up with one of his own, facebook, in an attempt to beat them out the gate. He enlists the help of his best friend Eduardo to finance and promote his venture, with the return promise of thirty percent of the profits, and later Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake), the co-founder of Napster. Zuckerberg becomes inpatient with his long time friend Eduardo and tricks him out of the majority of his stock sharing which (along with the Winklevoss dispute) leads to the core legal battle of the film and the heart and humanity of the story. I've been a fan of Fincher ever since his first feature film 'ALIEN 3' (which I'll admit doesn't match it's two predecessors but is still a very underrated sequel, much better than the 4th installment as well as the 'ALIEN VS. PREDATOR' films). He's been responsible for some of my all time favorite films ('FIGHT CLUB', 'SEVEN' and 'ZODIAC') and he's one of the most diverse big name directors working in film today. Here he demonstrates universally appealing thematic abilities (like he attempted with 'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON', my least favorite of his films) and I predict he'll finally take home a much deserved Oscar come award time early next year. I also think the film will win best picture and screenplay (Sorkin's script is so witty and brilliant it would be a crime if it doesn't win). The acting is all very impressive as well and Eisenberg, who I've always been a fan of, should finally be able to shed the 'poor man's Michael Cera' image he's been labeled with by many. I'm a big fan of Cera but Eisenberg has been around longer and done much more serious and diverse work; after this film's release the two should have no problem standing apart. The supporting players are all more than adequate and the film's score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is mesmerizing. It's still a little too early to over confidently predict but I'm guessing no film in the next three months (and definitely none already released) will be able to top it come award time. Facebook is probably the most popular and relevant invention in use by the majority of society in at least the last decade and for that reason many say they're not interested in seeing this film; they don't want to further support mankind's biggest fad. This film isn't really about facebook though, it's a dramatic character study. It's about two best friends who are torn apart by money and fame, envy, the desire to get laid and the desire to be approved and envied by others. The film could be about the invention of anything and it wouldn't change much as long as the characters remained the same. This is an intriguing, amazingly fast paced character study with plenty of litigation battle action to keep anyone from falling asleep. The movie is much more entertaining than it might sound and it has a lot of emotion and heart as well. While the Zuckerberg character is appalling and hate worthy at times he's also a well intentioned and good heart-ed person at other times. He uses his show-off smart-ass pretentious nature as a defense mechanism for his insecurities and need to feel liked. He's a flawed anti-hero but a likable one and those are the most interesting in my opinion. The character, whether true to life or not, is the relate-able heart and core of the film and makes for one of the best stories, if not the best, to come to cinematic life this year.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",10,3,6,3 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," 'GATSBY' good but not great!
","'THE GREAT GATSBY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Director Baz Luhrmann's lavish adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel about a bond salesman who finds himself captivated by the life of his millionaire neighbor during the 'Roaring Twenties'. Leonardo DiCaprio (who also starred in Luhrmann's 'ROMEO + JULIET') and Tobey Maguire star in the film and it's their first time appearing in a movie together since 2001's 'DON'S PLUM' (despite being longtime friends since childhood). Carey Mulligan also stars in the movie as the millionaire's love interest, caught in a love triangle with another millionaire (played by Joel Edgerton). The film is a visually breathtaking epic period piece (like all of Luhrmann's films). It's also a tragedy (like most of Luhrmann's films as well). I enjoyed almost every aspect of the film except it's conclusion (having never read the book or known the story), which is just too dark and depressing for me.Maguire plays Nick Carraway, an alcoholic (as the film opens) telling a man in a sanatorium his story about his times with a millionaire named Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio). Nick met Gatsby when he moved into a house next door to his mansion in New York in 1922. A Yale University graduate and World War 1 veteran, Nick was moving from the Midwest to New York to take a job as a bond salesman. He met the mysterious millionaire when he was invited to one of his huge parties, despite the fact that no one else was ever invited to his parties (they would just show up) and no one seemed to know what Gatsby really looked like. Nick soon discovered that the millionaire wanted to get to know him so he could arrange a meeting with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Mulligan), who Gatsby had a romantic affair with five years earlier. Daisy was (at the time, in 1922) married to another millionaire though, Tom (Edgerton), who was an old college buddy of Nick's. This of course caused lots of complications as Gatsby wanted to steal Daisy away from Tom, who she had fallen out of love with anyway due to his constant cheating ways.I'm a huge Baz Luhrmann fan. I've enjoyed all of his films, especially 'MOULIN ROUGE!' (which is my all time favorite musical and one of my all time favorite films). That's a tragedy, like almost all of Luhrmann's movies, but it's still a beautifully moving story that's end feels justified. Like I said I haven't read the source material for 'GATSBY' (so I don't know how well the story played out in the book) but here I was disappointed with the overall feel of the film (by it's conclusion). I loved all of the performances (especially DiCaprio, who's amazing in it), the look of the film, the music and the first two acts. I really did like the story of this mentally ill millionaire who built his fortune from nothing and is now willing to throw almost everything away for his love (and obsession) with this untrustworthy girl. Like I said I just didn't like it's conclusion. Luhrmann did write the screenplay (with his usual partner in crime Craig Pearce) so he's to blame for it's shortcomings as much as it's success. It is a visual masterpiece that's a good film but not a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOSZyJXrwyw",9,1,2,23 May 2013
13 Hours," A decently entertaining action flick (as all Michael Bay films are).
","'13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI': Four Stars (Out of Five)A war film, depicting true events (at least somewhat); of the 2012 terrorist attacks, on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi. The story focuses on the six (brave) American security contractors, who defended the compound; and then came under attack, themselves. The movie was directed by Michael Bay, and written by Chuck Hogan; it was based on the 2014 book, '13 Hours', by Mitchell Zuckoff. It's a bit too long, slow-paced at times, and not very dramatically involving (compared to what it should be); but it's still a decently entertaining action flick (as all Michael Bay films are).When an American ambassador (Matt Letscher), was visiting a U.S. compound, in 2012 Libya, an army of Islamic militants attacked him. A six-man security team, stationed in the area (made up of military veterans), tried to come to his defense; and then they were attacked themselves. The film stars James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, David Denman, Max Martini, Dominic Fumusa and Pablo Schreiber; as the team. It also costars David Costabile; as their arrogant commander Bob (also called 'The Chief'). Chaos, and very violent bloodshed, ensued. I don't have any idea how accurate, or true (to actual events) this movie is; or if it has a political agenda (or not). I can review it (simply) on it's own merits, as a movie though. I think it's a pretty entertaining action flick; but at 2 hours and 24 minutes, it's a bit too long. It's also really slow-paced, at times (despite all of it's bloody action), and sometimes it's pretty hard to follow. That might have been Bay's intent though, to better relay what the soldiers were going through (complete chaos). In some ways, Bay is perfect for this type of movie; and in other ways, he's not. He's definitely good at the action scenes, even though they're so chaotic. The film kind of reminds me of a 'TRANSFORMERS' flick (at times); in how hard it is to tell what's going on. Bay is also not that good at emotional depth, or character development; but he does deliver some good drama (especially at the end). Krasinski and Dale are both great action hero leads. It is odd to see Krasinski teamed with Denman, again though (in a serious action movie). Both actors were on 'THE OFFICE' (as Jim and Roy); I kind of wanted to watch them fight again, over Pam. The film is also not nearly as good as 'AMERICAN SNIPER' or 'LONE SURVIVOR'. Both of those movies were also released on the 'Martin Luther Day' holiday weekend (in 2014 and 2013). Hollywood definitely knows how to follow a successful business pattern!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/3D-Xa6uhK5U",8,3,12,15 January 2016
Warm Bodies," The film is not nearly as bad as 'TWILIGHT' (it's not even in the same league)!
","'WARM BODIES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A zombie romance film based on the popular 2011 book, of the same name, by Isaac Marion. The film was written for the screen and directed by Jonathan Levine (Levine also directed the exceptional 2011 comedy-drama film about cancer called '50/50'). This film stars Nicholas Hoult (who's most well known as 'Beast' in the latest 'X-MEN' films, in which he met his now ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lawrence) as a zombie who is self aware and starts to become more and more human as he falls in love with a human survivalist (played by Teresa Palmer). It co-stars Rob Corddry, Analeigh Tipton, Dave Franco and John Malkovich. It's an interesting and unique take on the classic zombie film (as well as romance and it's been compared to 'Romeo and Juliet'). Whether it works or not is debatable but I mostly enjoyed it.The film is set in a zombie apocalypse where most of the human population has been turned into the undead, either the 'classic zombie' or a more severely inhuman skeletal like zombie creature known as 'bonies'. The surviving human population lives in a walled off enclave and are led by General Grigio (Malkovich). One day the General's daughter, Julie (Palmer), leads a group of her friends, including her boyfriend Perry (Franco) and best friend Nora (Tipton), out into zombie land to find medical supplies. They're attacked by zombies and Perry is killed by one, who's later known as R (Hoult). R is self aware (and narrates the film) and is immediately drawn to Julie. When R eats Perry's brain he's able to see his memories and learn more about her. He quickly develops feelings for Julie and rescues her from the other zombies and takes her to an abandoned airplane at a nearby airport. There the two oddly get to know each other as R becomes more and more humanlike.The film has been praised and condemned for being the first zombie romance but it's not actually the first of it's kind. There's another zombie-romance-comedy film (a 25 minute short) on YouTube called 'REVENGE OF THE DEAD' (written, directed by and starring Tim Hellman) and it's a much better film. The movie has also been compared to 'TWILIGHT' for taking another classic monster film genre and turning it into a sappy romance; involving a 'hot' young girl falling for a 'hot' young monster. The film is not nearly as bad as 'TWILIGHT' (it's not even in the same league)! It's much better acted, much more cleverly written and much better directed. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. I don't like all of the liberties it takes with the genre and Malkovich and Corddry are wasted in the film (what's the point in casting Rob Corddry if he doesn't have any lines, he's only a genius comedian because of what he says and how he says it). Palmer is strikingly beautiful in the film and a nice tough heroine (much better than Kristen Stewart) and Hoult is decent as her zombie love interest (which is much more than anyone can say for Robert Pattinson or Taylor Lautner). The movie isn't a great zombie film but it's a nice change (for the most part).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP2Kjuc4BQY",7,1,7,7 February 2013
Sully," A well made crowd-pleaser, that's for sure!
","'SULLY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic based on the story of Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger; the pilots Captain who heroically landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River (in January of 2009), and saved all 155 people on board. The movie stars Tom Hanks, as Captain Sully, and it costars Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Mike O'Malley and Jamey Sheridan. It was directed by Clint Eastwood, marking his 35th theatrical film as a director, and it was written by Todd Komarnicki. The script is based on the 2009 memoir 'Highest Duty' (written by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow). The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a hit at the Box Office. I found it to be very intense, and involving!On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 hit a flock of Canada geese (shortly after departing LaGuardia airport), which disabled both it's engines. With no airports in safe landing distance, Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Hanks), and First Officer Jeffery Skiles (Eckhart), were forced to land the plane on the Hudson River. All 155 passengers on board (miraculously) survived the emergency water landing. The media and public praised the pilots as heroes; but the National Transportation Safety Board was beginning an investigation which could discredit the men, and possibly destroy Sully's career. I knew nothing about the investigation into pilot negligence, by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), so this movie was very interesting to me. I also enjoyed seeing the epic events of the 'Miracle on the Hudson', recreated for the big screen (they're intense). The film is very inspiring, and involving. I love seeing a story where the little guy takes on the establishment too; in this instance it was definitely self defense, but it's still incredibly moving! Eastwood is great at directing this type of movie, and I actually think it's one of his better films. Hanks is also spectacular in the lead.

James Franco, Noomi Rapace and Guy Pearce also have un-credited cameos in the movie (Rapace and Pearce also both reprise their roles from the previous film). It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been a hit at the Box Office so far as well (internationally). Like most of the other films in the franchise, I absolutely loved it!The story is set in the year 2014, when the crew of the Covenant is headed for a remote planet called Origae-6. There are over 2,000 colonists onboard, plus thousands of embryos. An android named Walter (Fassbender), an updated version of David (from 'PROMETHEUS'), watches over the ship and everyone onboard (while they're all in stasis). When a shockwave hits the ship, Walter wakes the crew up early. While repairing damages done by the wave, the crew receives a human radio transmission from an unknown planet. The new captain, Christopher Oram (Crudup), decides they need to investigate it; against the objections of terraforming expert Daniels Branson (Waterston). Daniels is of course right to be concerned, and unknown xenomorphs might be involved.Like 'PROMETHEUS', the film is full of very broad philosophical and religious ideas; and like all of the 'ALIEN' movies, and a lot of science fiction, it once again presents the idea that too much advancement in modern technology might lead to our downfall (the alien is never really the true enemy in any of these films). Unlike 'PROMETHEUS', and more like the other installments in the series, there's a lot of alien thrills and action though. It's kind of the perfect mix of violence and philosophy, and there's even some great Ripley-esque scenes in this one (and Waterson is fantastic in the role). I think fans of the series will be extremely pleased with this new chapter (as I am), and I'm eagerly looking forward to more new installments in the beloved series!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo",10,28,56,19 May 2017
Draft Day," Kind of like 'MONEYBALL' but not quite as good.
","'DRAFT DAY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another sports flick starring Kevin Costner. In this one he plays the general manager for the Cleveland Browns and the movie all takes place on the day of the NFL Draft, when he trades for the number one pick. It costars Jennifer Garner, Denis Leary, Frank Langella, Ellen Burstyn, Josh Pence, Tom Welling (of 'SMALLVILLE' fame) and Chadwick Boseman (who also stared in the baseball flick '42', from last year, as Jackie Robinson). It was written by first time film writers Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman and directed by Ivan Reitman. I'm not a fan of football (or sports in general) but I still found this flick to be interesting and entertaining enough.The story is set all on the day of the (fictionalized) 2014 NFL Draft. Costner plays Sonny Weaver Jr., the Cleveland Browns General Manager who's father coached the Browns (for many years) and was a legacy. Sonny Jr. is notorious for having fired his father (a year earlier) and his dad just passed away, a week before the draft. Sonny is also not popular with fans and doesn't have a good record with his team (who's been losing regularly). On top of that he just found out his girlfriend Ali Parker (Garner), who he's been seeing secretly (because she also works for the Browns), is pregnant. He's at odds with his head coach (Leary), his current quarterback (Welling) has been out of commission due to an injury and the Browns owner (Langella) threatened his job if he doesn't 'make a splash'. Under pressure he trades his team's next three years of first-round draft picks, to the Seahawks, for the number one draft choice. Everyone thinks he's going to pick the most desired college player Bo Callahan (Pence), a quarterback from the University of Wisconsin and Heisman Trophy winner, but he spends the rest of the day (all the way up to the draft) contemplating it.Like I said I don't care about sports or football so of course I knew little about how the NFL Draft works but I still found the story easy to follow and involving. That's due to adequate directing from Reitman and a clever script (these writers obviously know football). Credit is also due to the all-star cast though, especially Costner (who's having a decent year). So I'm really impressed that a movie that's all about football, in all it's boring detail, kept me that entertained. To me that's a well made film and deserves some respect for it. It's not a great sports flick but it's definitely a good one. Some of the thrill isn't there because it's all behind the scenes stuff; it's kind of like 'MONEYBALL' but not quite as good.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PJuAEBeRQ",7,1,2,16 May 2014
The Martian," A little too cheesy and pathetically crowd pleasing!
","'THE MARTIAN': Four Stars (Out of Five)The sci-fi blockbuster from director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard; based on the 2011 book, by Andy Weir. It tells the story of an astronaut, that's left behind on Mars, after mistakenly being presumed dead; that desperately struggles to stay alive, while NASA tries to save him. The movie stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Mackenzie Davis and Donald Glover. I found the film to be very well crafted, and ultimately entertaining, but it's also just a little too cheesy, and pathetically crowd pleasing.A horrible storm, on Mars (which isn't scientifically possible), wipes out astronaut Mark Watney (Damon); and he's presumed dead by his crew. The commander of the mission, Melissa Lewis (Chastain), decides to take off, and leave the planet without Watney (assuming he's dead). We soon discover that Mark survived, but his communications equipment was destroyed. Being a botanist, Watney begins growing food, in an artificial habitat his crew created. NASA later learns of Mark's survival, and plots to rescue him.The film is technically very well made; it looks great and it comes to a thrilling conclusion. It's somewhat involving, and you do learn to care about the characters, but in a mostly gimmicky way. The constant video log scenes, that Mark films of himself, seem incredibly forced and clichéd. I never believed that any of the characters, in the film, were real people, and the entire movie has a very contrived/corny feel to it. I haven't read the book but I expect a lot more from Drew Goddard. I also expect a lot more from Ridley Scott; this is the man who brought us such science fiction classics as 'ALIEN', 'BLADE RUNNER' and 'PROMETHEUS' (all much better movies than this). 'THE MARTIAN' kind of feels like a cheesy US military propaganda film, except it's made to support NASA instead.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/NdWU81GeyN4",Null,3,10,5 October 2015
The Fighter," Oscar front-runner Bale really disappears into the role!
","'THE FIGHTER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) David O. Russell directs this boxing tale based on professional boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward 's rise to stardom and his troubled brother Dicky who helped train him. Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky and Oscar front-runner (for supporting actor) Christian Bale co-stars as Dicky. Russell is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, his previous credits include 'THREE KINGS', 'I HEART HUCKABEES', 'FLIRTING WITH DISASTER' and 'SPANKING THE MONKEY'. Three of his five films have all co-starred Wahlberg, almost every director has a go to guy and for Russell it's apparently Wahlberg. I never used to think he had much talent as an actor but he's proved himself a little over the years (he was outstanding in 'I HEART HUCKABEES'). He's still not a great actor in my opinion and he's just OK in this film, although fittingly cast (he was much better this year in 'THE OTHER GUYS', in my opinion). It's Bale that really steals the movie and he definitely deserves all the award recognition. There's also some great supporting turns from Melissa Leo as the brothers' mother and Amy Adams as Micky's girlfriend (two other likely Oscar contenders. They were both nominated for Golden Globes, as well as Bale and surprisingly Wahlberg).Russell took over directing duties from Darren Aronofsky who took an executive producer position instead (I also saw Aronofsky's 'BLACK SWAN' right before this, so for me it was an Aronofsky double feature). I think Russell was the right man for the job and did an exceptional job, Aronofsky is an equally impressive director though and has a strikingly different style. It's interesting to think how the film might have turned out had he directed it. The film is written by Paul Tamsay, Eric Johnson, Keith Dorrington and Scott Silver (who also wrote '8 MILE'). The writing team did a great job as well; the movie is equally clever and funny as well as dramatically moving and inspiring. It's quite a unique film going experience.The film revolves around Micky's attempt to get his welterweight boxing career going. Out of love he allows his mother to manage him and his brother to train him. His brother is a former local boxing hero who went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and actually knocked him down (although some argue that he tripped). Now Dicky is a crack addict and has a film crew following him around making a documentary on crack addiction, although he tells people they're making a film on his boxing comeback. Dicky and his mother are keeping Micky down and he knows it but he doesn't have the heart to cut them loose. After falling for a local bartender and Dicky is sent to prison for his latest crime scheme Micky finally gains control of his life and his boxing career and sets up new management and enlists a new trainer, a local cop and friend (much to the disappointment of his over controlling mother). The film follows his inspiring rise to fame as he becomes a boxing hero and lifts his family out of despair.Bale's ability to transform himself from one role to another really shows in this role as he disappears into the character. While he will win the Oscar for supporting actor some argue he should be up for lead, as the film is just as much about him as Wahlberg's character (If they put him up for lead the studio knows he probably wont get it though so the safer bet is to promote him for supporting, that's how the business works). Although Bale makes the movie the entire cast is exceptional as well and like I said the directing and writing is outstanding too. The movie is a classic inspiring boxing film, one not like any you've ever seen before (although the outcome is predictable). It's definitely worth checking out and one that will be remembered for many years to come, like all of Russell's films.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",9,3,4,18 December 2010
Furious 7," Pleasing to action movie lovers, and not just car lovers anymore!
","'FURIOUS 7': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The seventh installment in the immensely popular 'FAST & FURIOUS' film franchise. It's also the last chapter to feature lead actor Paul Walker; who died halfway before filming was complete (his scenes were finished using CGI and his two brothers, Caleb and Cody, served as stand-ins). Actors Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock), Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges (aka Ludicrous), Jordana Brewster and others also reprise their roles from previous films; while Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey all join the cast this time around. James Wan (who's known for directing horror flicks; like 'SAW', 'INSIDIOUS' and 'THE CONJURING') took over directing duties, while Chris Morgan once again wrote the screenplay (as he did the last four installments). The story revolves around Dominic Torretto, and his crew, being recruited by a covert ops team; to stop a mercenary from obtaining a dangerous computer program. It's the first film, in the series, to take place after the events of 'TOKYO DRIFT'. I think it's the best installment of the series and a fitting tribute to Paul Walker. The story begins with criminal Deckard Shaw (Statham) breaking into the hospital where his comatose brother, Owen (Luke Evans, reprising his role from the previous chapter), is being held. He promises revenge and then proceeds to track down Dominic Torretto (Diesel), and his team, for what they did to his brother (in the previous movie). Deckard kills Han (Sung Kang) in Tokyo (an event that took place in 'TOKYO DRIFT'), which makes Torretto, Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their crew, bloodthirsty for revenge against Shaw. At the same time they're enlisted, by a secret government official called 'Mr. Nobody' (Russell), to track down a deadly computer program; and stop it from falling into the hands of a dangerous mercenary, named Jackande (Hounsou). The film is once again filled with spectacular action scenes and breathtaking stunts. It's of course completely unbelievable and almost cartoonish, almost all of the time, but it's still immensely entertaining. I wasn't a fan of the original movie, or the series; until they added The Rock, in 'FAST FIVE'. That's when the filmmakers really took the series to a whole 'nother level (almost comparable to 'THE EXPENDABLES' franchise; with all of the action stars they keep adding to every movie). I've seen every film in the series (I just recently saw 'TOKYO DRIFT' for the first time) and I'm just now becoming a fan of the franchise. It's sad to see Paul Walker go, but they do pay a great tribute to him (in the end of the film). This is definitely (by far) the best chapter in the series (despite all of it's cheesy melodrama) and I look forward to seeing future installments now (especially if they keep adding more cool action stars). The series is definitely pleasing to action movie lovers (and not just for car lovers anymore). It's still not a perfect franchise but it does keep getting better!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUT8JIkuU9Y",9,0,3,8 April 2015
