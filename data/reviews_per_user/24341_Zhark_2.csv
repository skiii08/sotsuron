Alien 3," Artistic approach and an awesome finale of a brilliant trilogy
","I'm going to be quick here: Alien = Scott and Giger's typical horror flick buried in fifteen tons of brilliant art and design. Graphically astounding, but plot-wise it leaves a lot to be desired. In the year of 1999 the cast looks unbelievably seventies, and the movie is utterly un-rewatchable (if you can say such a thing), as the initial scares are long gone. Awesome movie because its so graphically perverse. The whole alien-popping-out-of-chest thing was unwatchable, kudos to John Hurt for that. Fabulous movie in its time.Aliens = All-out americanised highly enjoyable action flick, taking the usual american sequel-recipe (make it bigger and louder) to new heights. Adds a new alien design and the whole hive-structure thing to the aliens. The queen looks bloody retarded, a caricature of Giger's original alien designs. The reason this movie seems to be the number one of the trilogy is simply because its so incredibly easy to understand. The soundtrack is simple, the plot is simple (actually), the characters are fantastically simple (and therefore easily likeable) and they packed in a lil annoying kid too (although it added a good touch to the plot) that does nothing but get into trouble and gets saved a lot. Bleargh.A cliched simple action movie sporting fat designs and a dark, brooding industrial-type sci-fi atmosphere, but still graphically nothing compared to the first movie.Alien3 = This is pure depression, despair, anger, realism. It takes the whole 'we can take them on' feeling you got after a while in Aliens and slams it through the pavement. Without our big guns and fancy technology us humans are really nothing but a bunch of treacherous gits. Apart from the first obvious plot hole (the alien egg), which was absolutely necessary anyway if there was going to be a second sequel, the plot stands out as the cleanest of the lot. Its deeper, more terrifying than Alien, and infinitely more sophisticated than Aliens. We see the new dog alien (cleaning up the question wether aliens take on their hosts physique) and we see how dark and terrible the world of Alien really is. The imagery is fantastic, sometimes almost like a painting, mostly browns and reds and fabulous camera angles. The scene where the candles along the ground get blown out is like icecubes down my spine, and the first glimpse of the alien is awe-inspiring. The religious theme, the past evil of the prisoners, the only-female-on-a-male-dominated-planet bit, the i'm-gonna-die-soon-anyway bit, the we-dont-give-a-damn-about-you-if-you-dont-help-us bit... Ahh this movie is fabulous. Alien resurrection is disowned from the series in my eyes, it shows too much. This movie is awesome, it shows just enough. 'Alien' = Stranger, new, different, unknown. Aliens managed to hide the aliens well enough, and alien3 finishes off perfectly. David Fincher is a sheer visual genius.This is a 100% good movie. Actings good, effects are brill, and on the subject of 'we dont like the characters' i have this to say: Thats the point. Youre not really supposed to like ANYONE exept from ripley. They're all filthy b*****ds.",Null,0,3,18 June 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Plonk did it again
","Alien4 - Joss 'plonk' Whedon has a sixpack of lager, reads a few albums of Dark Horse comic books, vomits in a bucket, distills it, pours it at a pile of paper, goes through it, organizes the pages and sends it off to Jeunet, who has absolutely no idea what to do with it. 'I theenk we shoud add ze human element' he says, and rips out the page of Whedons description of the newborn (a spidery male-ish queen alien) and adds a big mewling fatass idiot mongoloid baby elephant with a skull for a face. Add *crap* CG effects that show off the alien far too much for it to be scary, roaring aliens and acid spittle, plastic underwater aliens, a whining horrid Winona Ryder, a Ripley that should have stayed dead, idiot attempts at gigerisms (semi-erotic ripley vs alien imagery), 'intelligent aliens' (WHY!? WHYYY!? This is aliens, not jurassic they-can-open-doors f***in park) and you have a perfect recipe for a franchise tombstone. I sat through Alien 4 laughing at the pathetic wannabe blagh whatever nonsense and wondering wether the reason the lights in the cinema turned off was because there were dwarves sitting inside the lamps. Terrible.. terrible terrible. I disown this film as an Alien film. Its not. Its a stupid film.Alright, so lets review it as a separate movie on its own.Pretty photography. Jeunet has a way with pictures. Thing is, it all seems like a visual reprisal of City of lost children, which is also echoed in the score, coming off as a strange nursery-rhyme-horror-ha-ha. Even 2 of the same actors (Johner and DeVriess). The set designs and costumes look like something out of the dark horse aliens comic books, which may not be a bad thing. After seeing Alien Resurrection one of the few things that came to my mind other than 'oh.. my.. god that was dumb' was 'hrm, if they're going to mess up the aliens franchise, why not make a TV show. Hey, it worked allright for Stargate'. The plot in A-R is so flat anyway, it could have been told in 45 minutes no problems whatsoever. The characters are cartoony as well. A lot of them are obviously chosen to accomodate the public. mad professor, funny paraphlegic (bwahahah), 'cool' mercs, asshole militaries.. this is all straight out of the comic books. The Ripley in A-R is cartoony too, and i dont particularly care for her. She reminds me of a girl i ran into last new years eve, frightening woman that, quirky and annoying. Crud.One thing i find particularly funny about this movie is that i actually prefer Deep Blue Sea and Deep Rising. Its essentially the same plot anyway and the gags are funnier.Thats all i can say really. Its a truly mediocre film. It kind of reminds me of what happened to Starwars episode 1, how they dumbed the franchise down and niced it up for a younger public.As an alien film : 1 out of 10 As a standalone scifi flick : 5 out of 10",Null,0,0,10 February 2001
