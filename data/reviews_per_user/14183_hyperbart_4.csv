Deja Vu," great movie could've used different ending
","WOW! great movie, fine writing. after the first 30 minutes you THINK you're watching a detective or CSI stylish movie with federal agents simply trying to find a terrorist. after that, for about 20 minutes you THINK it's becoming some kind of 'Enemy of the State' rip-off with federal agents using satellites in combination with some high-tech software to the crazy extend of generating a live video feed of a few days ago. i was thinking 'wow, enemy of the state was crazy with their sat tech, but this is just preposterous. then, after that we finally get to know what's going on. and at that point, it doesn't even hint to reality (although it tries to proof the hypothetical possibility of this actually happening in reality, LOL) but it's OK that it's a bit unrealistic from there on, it's still great writing and keeps you curious.now for the end of the movie, you actually get the feeling that whatever Denzel is trying to do to fix the past, he just can't and everything will be as it was. all the links from the beginning to the end of the movie (ambulance in shed, blooded clothes, everything in the woman's house) seem to link so you really start to think that Denzel cannot change the past as he is already part of it. or will the writers surprise us? eventually they do... but for me, they could've made an alternative ending that actually let everything happen like it would've.apart from that, great movie!",8,3,5,21 June 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Worst of the 3
","At World's End has gone over the top completely, and in my opinion way too far.Curse of the Black Pearl was a great film on itself, the only thing I didn't like personally was the skeleton curse. But because of the huge success, movie makers suddenly feel like they should make 2 more movies (similar to the Matrix, in which the first movie is a stand-alone, but then suddenly we get 2 more movies) Dead Man's Chest is the greatest of the 3 in my opinion (lots disagree with me), it simply added 2 great bad guys (Lord Beckett and Davy Jones) and a nice tale. The only thing Dead Man's Chest needed was captain Barbossa.now we get part 3, which could make a great end. but instead, they throw in about 10 new characters which get underdeveloped and their true goals are a mystery to us. if they had sticked to the original cast, and only added 1 or 2 characters, it would have been fine. but now it's all getting confusing.good movie, great special effects, great cast, great humor, great make-up, great music, great atmosphere altogether. but just BAD BAD BAD writing and BAD BAD BAD character development!!! and last of all: I MISSED THE KRAKEN!",6,0,3,10 June 2007
The Dark Knight," does NOT live up to the hype
","Having had to wait for 2 weeks before I had a chance to watch The Dark Knight, I was thrilled when the time came. After the first week of IMDb votes I kinda guessed there was some hype going on. But after 200.000 votes the grade was still 9.4. Was this still a hype or was the movie genuinely good? Also reading very positive movie reviews and hearing people go on and on about how great Heath was as the Joker, this meant the movie just had to be great, right? Well it's NOT. It's a good movie, but people who compare it to history's best cinematic productions are just out of their mind.Let me get to the first point of the hype: the Joker. I read reviews of this character being the most evil, terrifying, psychotic and creepy villain they had ever seen. I must agree that Heath does a great job of playing the Joker. But this just isn't living up to what I read and heard. The biggest problem with the Joker is that this is still an action hero movie, not a thriller or horror for that matter. What the Joker does made me laugh most of the time. I mean his opening with jamming the pencil through a guys eye may sound creepy when you hear or read it, but in this movie it's just hysterical. The Joker isn't scary or creepy at any point. He is psychotic, he is unpredictable and he is played with great depth (for a character that is flat in the script). But he can never compete with the great villains like Hannibal Lecter or even Jigsaw. Those are just out of his league. I would love to have seen the Joker develop more. The screen time for Heath is just way too low for him to carry this movie (although lot's of critics claim he already caries the movie, which would be a sad conclusion if you ask me). It's a shame Heath died.With that hype out of the way, the rest of the movie is pretty plain. It has great special effects and make-up, for which it'll surely compete for awards. But the other actors really can't deliver, even great ones like Freeman. Characters are not developed. Which brings the viewer in an awkward situation when we have to feel the pain that both Dent and Wayne feel when the lose Rachel, but we just can't feel that pain. That's just a result of poor script and poor character development.Good film, entertaining, but surely not great or superb. Get real people, look past the hype!",7,9,17,7 August 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," How trailers can ruin movies!
","The strenghts of this movie are also its flaws. The problems of this movie have been mentioned in many comments. It's a nice plot but it has serious realism problems and an ending that makes you wonder how bad the alternative endings the writer came up with must've been. These are the writers that wrote the script for the Recruit. It's hard to see how they fell so deep this time.However, I want to mention something new, and that is how trailers can ruin a movie for you. The trailer of Law Abiding Citizen is what got me to the theater. Of course a trailer shows you something of the movie, but this trailer kind of blew every surprise for me there is in the movie. At the start this is not much of a problem, but if at about 2/3 of the movie I still know that the cars are going to blow up as soon as the justice people leave the prison, then that kind of spoils the movie! Didn't they think of something like that?",6,0,1,11 December 2009
