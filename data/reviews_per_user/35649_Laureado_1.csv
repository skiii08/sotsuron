Iron Man 3," A great summer movie , but that,s it!!
","It is such a Shane that mi first review is about this movie, i was expecting something out of this world, i mean Shane black as cult director and someone who i believe was not going to allow Disney to wash down the script to 'make it safer for a general audience' but that is what really happens, the tecnical side is amazing the suits are great and despite everything Robert jr handles his character as always , despite flaws in the script like going hand to hand without armor to a complex full of terrorists; taking everyone down and finally facing down 'the mandarin' without a scratch 'why' because iam iron man!! Come on , other thing is they don't allow the characters to grow more, do to a excessive need of the director to squish in a punch line every two seconds, the post traumatic disorder that tony is going through feels real the first time,but that is!! Other thing is the way iron man is investigating the origin of the explosions !! How is possible that you own a multinational empire and you just happen to have incriminating videos of your experiments on your data base waiting to be hack !! Specially now when the world has 'change and people like stark who are genius' can do this so easily, but as i said it is just a summer movie!! So go enjoy it and don't think too much about it.",6,3,7,26 April 2013
