The Rock," The best action movie in a long time
","This is definitely one of the best action movies of all time.  True, I am a bit biased because Sean Connery is my favorite actor.  I thought Nick Cage played a wonderful innocent little bio-chemist who always works in a little couped up room with his chemistry set.  So when he is actually put into a violent confrontation, you truly believe he is terrified.  One of the best scenes is when Nick was forced to shoot and kill one of the mercenaries in order to save Mason (Connery) from being killed.  The excellent blend of slow motion and music during this scene leaves the viewer excited, yet almost startled at the same time because this is the first time Cage has ever harmed anyone!  A sensational piece of filming.  Truly worthy of all the praise in the world, and it's funny too!",10,1,1,18 October 1998
The Last Samurai," What a Wonderful Film...
","I cannot express enough how fantastic I thought this film was, and I haven't seen such heart and passion since Braveheart.  Tom Cruise proves yet again that he is completely comfortable being the star in an action epic as he flawlessly moves through the film like it was made for him.There are so many points I could focus on as perfect in this movie:  The action, the wonderful direction, the costuming, acting, setting, etc.  But I would be writing for quite some time, and I don't want to bore you. 
Let me just say this, however.  I adored this film, and it easily is the best movie of the year so far.  Wow.",10,1,2,14 December 2003
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," very cool
","What a seductive and wicked movie.  I am a fan of the Anne Rice movies, and I have to admit, this is one of the more faithful book adaptations to a movie I have ever seen.  I am also a fan of the acting talents of Brad Pitt.  It is a shame that Brad is type-casted as just a Hollywood hunk, when he is a far too talented actor to be given such a label.  His performance as Louis is done with poise and precision.  As well, I am disappointed that Stephen Rea was not at least nominated for an Oscar.  What a wonderful talent she is.  Don't get me wrong, I like Antonio Banderas, but I do not think he was the right actor to cast as the role of Armand.  But overall, this is a sensational movie!",Null,2,3,14 October 1998
Braveheart," sensational
","There isn't a whole lot to actually say about this movie.  It truly is a masterpiece.  A true work of art.  There isn't a film out there that affected me the way this one did.  The acting, the plot, and the costumes were sensational.  I just wish I could personally thank Mel Gibson for making one of the best films ever.",10,5,8,14 October 1998
