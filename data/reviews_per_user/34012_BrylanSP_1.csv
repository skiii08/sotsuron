The Blair Witch Project," Realistic, unique, Scary as anything
","Blair Witch is unique in many ways. Filmed as a mockumentary, it makes the viewer believe the things he is seeing. There are no blood or  guts, or any visible villians. Its the farthest thing from hollywood that I've ever seen. And the film makers pull it off beautifully. The lowres cameras only add to the chill, and the actors are stunning in potraying their characters. it is actually the actors who designed their own dialog, and did the shooting, though the writer/directors have to be credited for the genius of the premise, and the mind-numbing, painfully plausible ending. My girlfriend bawled, she was so frightened. One note: don't go see this movie in a crowded, noisy audience-- full of high school students. someone actually turned on a gameboy while the movie was going on, and these ditsy airheads wouldn't stop talking. The movie was great. the audience gets two dumbs down, way down.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
