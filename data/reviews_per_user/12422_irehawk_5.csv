Minority Report," Scary and underrated!
","Yeah, this movie is kind of scary, but there are some scenes when innocent victims scared and screaming.But this is about a police officer, named John Anderson, trying to investigated a framing prophecy of himself accused of murder, but at the end, he tried his best to fight back and make that criminal boss commit suicide, rather than killing John on the last minute.",10,0,0,18 February 2017
The Bourne Identity," Better than its follow-ups, TBH, IMO!
","Matt Damon is perfect in this movie, but he may have grown too mature and experienced in the follow-ups of this movie.I know it is correct for a movie to be different from novels, but these changes in movie, which are different from the novel, is convincingly good enough. The follow-ups (Supremacy and Ultimatum) had too many changes that went too far and would not beat this one. But if the changes of both follow-ups are considered reasonable, then they should gotten a new good actor, who is Matt Damon, and not grown too mature and experienced like Matt Damon, TBH, IMO.",10,1,1,18 February 2017
The Imitation Game," This is the classic that we should never ignore permanently!
","This is the true story of Alan Turing who invented a Turing machine which led to the first invention of computers. This movie takes place during World War II to deal with Hitler's invention Enigma. Turing decides to decode Hitler's secrets and makes sure the secrets get revealed before it gets too late.I'm sorry that Alan is having a gay life and his relationship with Joan was never successful, unfortunately.We should never ignore watching this movie because this is permanently education for the rest of its life here on planet earth!",10,0,1,18 February 2017
The Dark Knight," Never that great!
","First of all, they are trying to make this type of violence realistic in a dark, gritty intense type and the rating of this movie is rated PG-13? I have to disagree, TBH, they overdid this type of realistic violence into a permanently fearful rated-R type and it might caused fear into real-life 13-year-olds of either killing or getting killed along the way.Next, they made Harvey Dent act like a serious loud-mouth prosecutor and also proposed marriage to Rachel Dawes. But right after the Joker tricked Gordon, which led to Gordon turning down Dent too quick, Harvey grew worse than that Godfather character Michael Corleone type.Third of all, Joker did too many tricking violent deaths and especially killing Rachel Dawes by explosion automatically. Harvey screamed like a violent victim as he was transformed into Two-Face. The worse part is that he began violently scream and kill Gordon's crew members, like Michael Corleone did in the Godfather trilogy, and also threatened Gordon's son with both coin and gun because of both his lost-love of Rachel and his job at the same time. That scene of Two-Face threatening Gordon's son with both coin and gun should have force-changed TDK rating from PG-13 to R officially. If Two-Face threatened Gordon with both coin and gun instead of his son, then we don't have to change the TDK rating from PG-13 to R officially.Finally, that too much overdone rated-R type of fear in TDK may have additionally inserted in real-life Joker actor Heath Ledger's sleeping problems, which led to his death. That death of Heath's may have really caused TDK director Chris Nolan to suffer financial mental breakdown and panicked filming TDKR in a hap hazardous way.I disagree that the TDKR isn't that bad at all, even if you think TDKR isn't that great as TDK, I prefer the TDKR rather than the TDK because the TDKR violence is also dark, gritty and intense, but not fearfully overdone as TDK violence, even if the terrorism violence in TDKR is considered rated PG-13 type. One last word, none of the TDKR cast members aren't dead at all.",1,5,14,21 January 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," I prefer this movie than the TDK
","I know the reason why some Batman/TDK fans didn't like it because it was too overloaded, but the reason why they have to make it overloaded is because they needed money in desperation due to the automatic real life death of Joker actor Heath Ledger between TDK and TDKR.Even if Bruce/Batman got his back-broken by Bane, sent back to dungeon and stabbed by Talia, which were all also considered bad, then that does not make this movie bad because Batman/Bruce is considered a bachelor superhero, unlike these other superheroes Clark/Superman, Steve/Captain America and Peter/Spiderman.But the other reason why I prefer TDKR rather than TDK is because: 1.) Real-life actor Tom Hardy, who plays Bane, is still alive now.2.) The violence in this movie is dark, gritty, intense and realistic, but not too fearfully overdone like TDK.3.) Even if there's terrorism in this movie, that does not make this type of terrorism even fearful at all.4.) At least I didn't see Bane nor Catwoman threatened to kill a single child in this movie.5.) Bane killed by Catwoman than Batman is correct enough to be convincing because Bane is more of leading henchman villain and has his own supervisor, which is his partner, Talia.6.) Batman killing Talia was also correct because we should know now that Talia is Bane's supervisor.Stop all the hating in this movie, this movie is alright and even better than TDK, TBH, IMO!",10,1,4,11 January 2017
