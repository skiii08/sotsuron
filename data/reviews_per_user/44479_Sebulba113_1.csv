Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hey-Lay off with the bad vibes, MAN!
","Alright, This movie blows.  But if you like Star Wars, You don't care.  Look at the Original.  Mmm.  Setup for the next two movies, which are more dramatic.  The first movies in the trilogies are happy, feel-good pics.  The next two will be dark and disturbed.  Then the critics will be happy.  >",Null,0,0,8 February 2000
