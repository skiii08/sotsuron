Iron Man 3," Iron Man was like a romance classic - too much dialogue
","There is no denying that the Iron Man franchise have been warmly welcomed by audiences. Thanks to Robert Downey's wit and humor, he has portrayed his character so well that anyone wants to be his on screen cast. In his latest installment, Iron Man 3, the movie had too much dialogue I almost wanted to sleep thinking I was watching a romance classic. But thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow's smoking body, great visual effects and effortless humor it can make up to it. As usual sci fi/fantasy films usually bank on on computer graphics hence they have succeeded. But despite their cinematic bonanza it was not suitable for 3 dimensional experience. 2 Dimensional viewing will suffice. And wait for the credits to end, they have something you'll look forward to.",7,0,2,13 June 2013
World War Z," Its like the Pilot Episode of the Walking Dead, magnified!
","If the world was run by zombies, are you ready to fight and live your way out? My answer is, I haven't thought about it. Encouraged by his children, Brad Pitt stars in this thriller flick, WORLD WAR Z which deals with marathon trained flesh eaters.A rabies like virus is on the loose and its rapidly affecting humanity. Think of it as a biological warfare gone haywire and as a former UN employee, your previous boss and your conscience is dictating you to save not only your family but the also the world. The plot just revolves there but the transition of the scenes, character development and denouement were well executed enough to let you go through the next hour.And since its a zombie film, the thrill factor lets you scream on your seats or curse the characters on screen. It is like watching the pilot episode of THE WALKING DEAD.Although they did not find the perfect solution and the medical aspects were quite obscure, the ending gives the audience hope that they will eventually discover a better antidote later. Now, if you'll excuse me my ginger broth is ready.",7,1,8,23 June 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Fast Paced Action, Furious Storyline
","Wouldn't it be cool to be part of a group who after a brawl is left unscathed? They're like men taking stem cell capsules. FAST AND FURIOUS 6 was indeed fast it will make your neurons hyperventilate and furious because there is no stopping them. Yes my friends there is a 7th installment. It is one movie that you forget about the plot and concentrate instead in keeping your eyeballs intact, afraid that you'll have nystagmus in the end. It's high octane energy coupled with Vin Diesel flaccid drama, Tyrese effortless comedy and bits of love stories keep you at the edge of your seats. I am not in the position to fully evaluate the chronicity of action sequences per installment and chose which is way better because I have only seen two but nonetheless it gave me joy watching posh cars gone bad and enjoyed the death defying stunts. And what more to keep the franchise alive by surprisingly casting Jason Statham in the prequel. And I thought there's a movie remix entitled: THE FURIOUS TRANSPORTER. Since Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors but not to the point of idolatry, I will watch the sequel. When are they going to end this drama? Until they'll ran out of cars and use tricycles instead? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go and inquire about their uber duper strength. Until the next fuel hike!",7,1,2,13 June 2013
Pacific Rim," PACIFIC RIM has Toys for the Big Boys
","PACIFIC RIM brought me to my childhood days when Ultraman was fighting with monsters. Story goes with aliens rising beneath our ocean floor and invading the entire earth for some reason (watch the movie). Because the aliens are huge (pre historic days and behave like a drunk King Kong), governments from across the globe united to create an elite team to combat these aliens in the form of engineered robots (Jaegers) with distinct fighting gears. The catch is its mostly a two man vessel connected to a neural bridge. Huh? Since its a large robot one person serves as the right brain while the other the left. Their memories are merged and their brains (not literally) as well to serve as one main CPU for their android. To cut the story short, they need to kill the monsters (Kaiju) to save human race. To make it long, to top that we have a melodramatic lead actor and his sidekick, a drama queen as well. Too many characters playing certain roles to extend the movie more than two hours. It has too much testosterone that it felt like watching 300. Their plot may fall short but Ill give them two thumbs up for technicalities and attention to detail. When the movie ended, I wanted to be a Jaeger because I got moves like jagger (now laugh). Overall, it's a visual effects feast and what's interesting is our annoying seatmate whose queries are due to his disconnection from the movie. If only he was not sleeping. 3 out of 5 popcorns",7,0,7,12 July 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel was a refreshing take on an established franchise. Superb, Splendid, Simply Amazing.
","5 Reasons why you should watch MAN OF STEEL (Superman)5. Henry Cavill. (a resemblance of Christopher Reeve, he's charming, emotional king and best dressed Superman suit. I have got to ask his diet scheme.) 4. Stellar Casting. (Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, Russell Crowe, Christopher Meloni, Amy Adams to name a few.) It made the movie interesting to watch. A performance worthy of applause. 3. Computer Generated Imagery - I can't help but say Wow, Amazing during the entire show. It was a visual feast. Feast is an understatement.2. Story Line. Well-established characters. The story was weaved creatively enough to bring the audience in an understanding the previous and post heroic sequence of Superman. And this is not just your ordinary Superhero movie, it has a heart. 1. Best Superman Installment PERIODA warning to exercise your eyeballs prior, for the the fighting sequences are long, enough to give you vertigo. Growing up and watching Superman movies, this sets the beginning of his story while the previous serves as a continuation of his life.",9,86,161,12 June 2013
The Great Gatsby," There's always an underlying deceit in every charm
","The things you'll do for the one you love only not to get the one in return. THE GREAT GATSBY succeeded in weaving over the top visual imagery with effective narration and superb acting to immerse the audience of its glamour, deceit and drama. A few glitches in editing(green/ blue screen scenes were noticeable and the old pictures were like a bad case of adobe fixing) still, it was worth to watch.I left the cinema with a heavy heart and wished it ended with a happy ever after. And Leonardo Di Caprio, hats off to your performance, you still have your charm. 4 out of 5 popcorns.",8,0,1,13 June 2013
