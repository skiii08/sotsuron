Angels & Demons," Harvard symbolist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) was called on an investigation of the murder of a physicist. The murder reveals a larger concern that affects the Vatican.
","I'm not really partial to riddle based films, but I did take a chance and watch this film (Angels and Demons) the title of this film is a little misleading. Without reading any reviews on this movie, I was under the assumption that this would be about violent and scary scenes of vicious demons. That was not the case. The movie is based on riddles of the Catholic Church. Tom Hanks played his role very well. He was very convincing with the knowledge of the history of the catholic religion and the Illuminati. The way he worked out the riddles and mystery of the symbols drawled you into the story. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) a well known symbolist of Harvard University, known for his work of the Da Vinci Code of the Catholic Church, is called upon by the Vatican to solve the mystery murder of Vetra the physicist who just created an anti-matter time bomb which was stolen at after his murder. Langdon was summoned to the Vatican where he met up with Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) the physicist's daughter, to solve the riddles the thief leaves behind. Langdon is introduced to the Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) who is not impressed with Langdon and his expertise of symbolism or his feeling of the Catholic Church. I could feel the tension between them two right away, which helped peak my interest in the film right away. Langdon learns that four cardinals had been kidnapped and through the riddles that the Illuminati are responsible. Ron Howard did very well as a director of this film in including an emotional and coherent plot. When I thought I had this movie figured out, another scene would thicken the plot. I was continually entertained and stumped by the turn of events. The attention to detail with the motif was excellent. I felt the film really captured a spiritual connection with the Catholic Church and the Vatican.",9,0,1,15 March 2010
