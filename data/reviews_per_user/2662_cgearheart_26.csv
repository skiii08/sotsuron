The Blair Witch Project," It's the principle of the thing
","Nowadays, millennials will not find the original Blair Witch movie to be scary. That's because they know it's fake. However, people didn't know that 20 years ago. It was less about how well done the craft of the actual film was and more about how convincing the marketing, the producing, and behind the scenes tension was. It played so heavily into the film along with the marketing that it legit convinced people that there was an actual witch who was killing people. Almost like a modern radio broadcast of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds, The Blair Witch Project is an important piece of horror movie history,strictly for it's refreshing new take on horror: found footage.A",9,2,3,17 July 2019
Requiem for a Dream," A fearless and terrifying view into addiction
","Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies that's honestly the closest thing that could be a horror movie in real life. Stuff like this happens everyday to people and they hardly ever recover. While no one dies in the film, that almost makes it worse considering the hell and terror all of the characters have been through. While it's considered a drama, Requiem has horror touches that are executed in the way you would see in real life: psychological horror (the hallucinations and paranoia), physical torture (electroshock therapy, amputation, sodomy), and even hauntings (more hallucinations).
This movie successfully inflicts the emotions of real life horror and it sticks with us.",10,0,0,18 January 2019
It," It's a coming of age film, not a horror
","It (2017) was a very thoughtful and sometimes painful film about children facing their fears. Though it technically is a horror film, this adaptation is less horror and much more of a coming of age story dealing with a barrage of heavy topics like loss, child abuse, murder, bullying, etc. Since the filmmakers took away a lot of the explicit moments from the book, it detracts from the shock factor and the scares in favor to make a film more suitable for it's audiences. While it might be scary for some, it wasn't scary for me. That didn't mean I didn't like it though.B",7,0,0,8 September 2019
Hereditary," Extremely smart and absolutely terrifying
","The carefully orchestrated plot, troubled characters, startling mythology, and small key details sprinkled throughout make for an excellent base of the film. Add intricate set design, precise cinematography, horrific imagery, a chillingly beautiful score, and explosively emotional performances (especially to Toni Collette), and you've got yourself a truly unforgettable film. Hereditary is not your typical horror film. It's not the one you watch with a bunch of your friends at a pizza party or one you take a bunch of sensitive girls to see.
It's a genuine horror movie. It's one that slams at your heart and your mind. It's a film that takes full concentration and attention to completely grasp, and if watched intentively, it's a genuinely scary movie; one that makes you feel vulnerable and shook to the core.
The faults people see in the film are out of misunderstanding of the film and not seeing the full picture of what the film was trying to portray.",10,3,8,13 November 2018
Captain Marvel," Cut it some slack, it's for kids!
","Today I saw Captain Marvel and before viewing it, I was hastily preparing myself for what I thought would be the worst superhero movie in years. While it was probably the weakest link in the long line of MCU movies, it was still a decent popcorn flick. The characters themselves were charming, but very bland. Even our cute blonde heroine came across quite dull. A lot of the story also retconned a lot of cool moments and rendered them quite silly and even disappointing. The film itself also felt less like a Marvel movie and much more like a very expensive and very long episode of Power Rangers. The good thing to note, however, is that the film had a good message, had solid entertainment, and amazing eye candy. Captain Marvel probably won't win over a ton of fans, but it will definitely impress its target audience: kids. People need to stop being butthurt and notice that this is a kids movie and it was meant to entertain kids and young teens. It's definitely not the best in Marvel's roster, but it's still fun for the most part.

Us," Good but I was expecting so much more
","Us was an incredibly original and awesome movie, but I personally thought it was going to be a lot deeper and dramatic based upon what the trailer showed. Instead, we got a wacky and weird sci-fi subplot that was fairly predictable by the second act. Yeah, it was a really cool movie with awesome twists but I was expecting a deep and disturbing film focusing specifically on the family and their doubles, and the creepy duality of it all. Unfortunately, that didn't last long and instead we were treated to an exciting yet pretty off the wall and virtually frightless genre film. It's a good film, but it was very misleading.

Forrest Gump," Extremely overrated
","While iconic and inspirational (in a way), Forrest Gump is still an absurd cheese fest with a silly performance from Hanks (he sounds like a redneck Bert from Mary Poppins) and not a whole lot of likable characters. The movie is ridiculous and also tries to embrace autism while simultaneously making fun of it. The biggest highlight of this film is its visual effects.",4,1,4,8 March 2019
Saw III," Entertaining but empty gorefest; delivers the guts
","Saw III is the exceedingly messy (both in gore and story) sequel to the two other Saw films that really should've stopped after the first film. We're treated to an array of very forgettable and purposefully expendable characters who are tortured and mutilated in a variety of very juicy and creative ways that ya horror fans have the good fortune of witnessing. All others will be left either bored out of their skulls or absolutely disgusted.

Avengers: Endgame," Amazing but it trumps any need for more films
","While it wasn't my number one favorite of the year, 'Endgame' is still definitely on my top ten list of this year (for now...) I found the film to be an extremely satisfying and immensely entertaining super epic that made 'Infinity War' look like a puppet show.With all this said, I will briefly give the highs and the lows of the film:Highs: It perfectly wraps up the storyline that's been building up for 11 years to a fitting (and tear jerking) ending. All the Avengers come back in an awesome final battle that we've all been waiting for. The time travel sequences are super fun and they add a good layer of needed humor to the sad plot. The acting was incredible and the characters were used perfectly in their roles. Overall, it was easy to say that I wasn't bored at all.Lows: There, of course, is so much going on at once. Understandably, it'd be hard to do it in any other way than the way they already did, but it's honestly just a ton going on at once and it becomes pretty ridiculous. I've recently heard people complain that the new 'Hellboy' and how ridiculously over stuffed and busy it was, but once they hear about Avengers they flock together like a bunch of monkeys because they're biased. Hulk's appearance and the fact that he could talk was very weird looking and didn't feel right. Just seeing this big green Mark Ruffalo face talking in Mark Ruffalo's voice just looked and sounded so unusual that it was kind of hard to take seriously. Last complaint, the movie was really good, it was, but why on earth is Disney making more Marvel movies at this point? Or at the very least, any more Marvel movies involving the same characters. Like, Endgame wrapped everything up so perfectly that it kinda trumps the need to make more films involving those characters. Can we just get some more new movies about characters we've never seen before (Moon Knight, anyone?) or just maybe have filmmakers adapt superhero movies that aren't from Marvel or DC (Dark Horse and Image need love too!)Just a little food for thought.",7,1,6,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Unnecessary
","A few heartfelt and emotionally manipulative moments still don't justify this movie's existence. Toy Story 3 ended perfectly and landed all the right notes. This movie decides to slog the franchise along and completely rewrite the message of all the Toy Story movies, along with making the once adorable character Bonnie a neglectful little brat.
None of the other toys get any screen time and while we're treated to this load of anti-fan service. Since it is Pixar, it wasn't without its moments, but it was a very unnecessary and unneeded film, one that made me feel very frustrated and even a little embarrassed for the filmmakers. The biggest highlight was Keanu Reeves.C-",5,4,10,27 June 2019
The Favourite," Boring and uncomfortable
","I will admit, when I started the film I really did enjoy the first 30 or so minutes.
The acting and the cinematography was really good, as was the humor and imagery.Unfortunately, after an hour or so the humor dissipated and the story took a straight faced and awkward turn full of gluttony, yelling, vomiting, excessive language, weird sexual encounters, and just a lot of filth (literally and figuratively). Admittedly, the acting was quite good but at what cost? All of the characters were very unlikable.. By the end of the film it merely felt pretentious, gross, whiny, and boring.
Weirdness and taboos don't bother me in movies at all. What bothers me is when it's handled in such an uneven way.",3,87,160,27 December 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," It's entertaining but...
","This Secret Life of Walter is kind of the epitome of a feel good movie. It's happy, entertaining, fluffy, and has a good message. However, it totally goes off the rails from the original storyline in the book. Mitty was a bumbling idiot who was taken advantage of and was only able to stick up for himself in the fantasy world. The movie draws far away from the fascinating and somewhat ambiguous pessimism delivered in the story. Instead of this, the movie is sappy, a little overly goofy for its own good, and incredibly egocentric (this is definitely not the first ego trip from the highly obnoxious Stiller). All and all, I can respect that it was all in good fun but I still found it pretty annoying.C",5,0,1,10 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Somewhat refreshingly different and original but did not feel like a Star Wars movie
","Honestly, The Last Jedi was not the worst Star Wars movie I've seen. It had a lot of refreshing and different little turns that made it feel more original (some different turns in storyline and different things in characters you wouldn't expect). At the same time, however, it felt pretty shoehorned in and did not feel completely coherent. On top of that, the film was muddled with a few plot holes and a few cringe worthy sequences (green milk fresh from the teet and the notorious 'Carrie Poppins' scene.) The film did leave me interested to what could happen in the next film, had decent acting, amazing visual effects and action, an always beautiful score, a thought provoking and meditative ending and it was fairly watchable the first time around. However, at the end of the day it was really a one trick pony, good for one time to watch and then the thrill wears off. Last Jedi is not as bad as the butthurt fans say it is, but it's certainly not great. A mixed bag.",5,1,7,12 August 2018
Cold War," I mean, it's alright
","Another case of Oscar bait, Cold War was a movie that wasn't bad, but it's really not all that great. The plot has been done a million times over, the characters are pretty flat, and the story really kind of just runs in circles. The only really entertaining parts of the movie is its music. Even then, I didn't even really think it offered a ton of commentary on the Cold War. It was just an arty and musical love story with some drama thrown in.",6,1,3,24 February 2019

Hotel Mumbai," Emotionally petrifying
","I didn't know much, if anything about the Mumbai hotel shooting until I saw this.
Once I saw it, my eyes were opened to the tragedy of terrorism and religious fanaticism. The film did an especially great job showing that Muslim religion is not evil, but it's been twisted by fanatical terrorist groups (much like the crusades). What I also realized was the irony in the phrase 'allahu akbar'. I honestly had no idea what it was translated to and I was even told by friends it was extremely offensive to say. Once I found out that it meant 'God is great', I was honestly heartbroken. Much like the defilement of the swastika by the Nazis, a beautiful and uplifting saying has become known as a calling card for terrorism. The scene that got me was when the young Muslim mother tearfully spoke about 'Allah the gentle' as she grasped her infant child at gunpoint.B+",8,8,27,30 April 2019
The Dark Knight," Quite possibly one of the best superhero (and crime) movies ever filmed.
","Christopher Nolan has both taken his own liberties to create a nihilistic and realistic view on one of DC's most popular characters.
One of the most mature and thought provoking superhero films, The Dark Knight shows the gravity of what it takes to be a 'hero' and the dangers it has along with it.
With several interesting topics like chaotic evil, choice, politics and crime watch, and succumbing to evil, The Dark Knight paints an apocalyptic and moving portrait that is simply unforgettable.",10,2,5,13 December 2018
Midsommar," 'I can't speak, I can't move'
","Wow... This film felt like I had dreamt it entirely. I had read the script before the film was released so I knew what happened for the most part, but oh my... From beginning to end I literally could not take my eyes off of the screen. This did not feel like a horror film.
It felt like something of a much higher caliber. Some sort of immensely twisted fairy tale with dramatic and humorous tones, and then completely drenched in terror at the very end. The film was like Wicker Man and Hereditary had an evil child. Some parts of the film even reminded me of the original Snow White (the wooden carving backdrop opening up, introducing the scene; Dani running scared through the forest). It was unbelievable.. and I mean that in the best way possible. It was a little tropy but my goodness, it was hard to tell because it didn't feel like a horror for most of the film until the end. It was just incredible. Also, the ambiguity and the look on who was really good or evil was amazing. This is a film that will really get the gears in your head grinding.A+",10,241,453,3 July 2019
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A lot less disturbing than I imagined
","I don't know how to feel about this movie. It didn't really rope me in, polarize me, or outrage me. In my opinion, it kind of just played out like a weirdly sexual black comedy that was full of needless, eye roll inducing violence at the very end. I didn't hate Salo, but I did find it to be disappointing and fairly overrated.C-",5,0,2,28 January 2020
The Witch," Young but very influential horror film
","A24 is a fairly new studio, but it didn't take them long to start building a fan base. The VVitch (the first film from Robert Eggers), is an extremely thrifty yet singularly terrifying period piece that scored big time at the box office and scared the bejeezus out of several film goers. The truly unique thing about this film is that it's only been out since 2015 and it's already had quite the influence on several other A24 films; most notably Hereditary and It Comes At Night. This satantic chiller is destined to get you sleeping with your lights on...",10,3,6,27 March 2019
Joker," Dark, Scary, Depressing, and Satisfying as Hell
","Everyone wants a dark comic book adaptation but once they get it, they complain about how dark and disturbing it is. That's the point. This is a movie about a man with a very severe mental illness who has been corrupted by the world around him. This is not a superhero movie, but a deep and angry meditation on loneliness, abandonment, and being bullied. It's a very scary movie, but that's what made it so damn good. I didn't have doubts about this film and others shouldn't either. It's a pure, nihilistic, and utterly cataclysmic crime epic powered by a searing performance from Phoenix.B+",8,2,5,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Gratuitous
","It Chapter 2 is a long and drawn out movie with really good performances and plenty of funny moments. The downside is that it slogs on for almost 3 hours with hardly any scares, half of the movie relies on flashbacks, and it had a pretty pitiful ending: they win by roasting Pennywise. I don't regret seeing it but yeah, it was stupid.C-",5,0,0,20 September 2019
Iron Man," The one that started it all
","In 2006-07, superhero movies were starting to go down the drain. With films like the boring Superman Returns, the absurd X-Men: The Last Stand, the cringy Spider-Man 3, and the cheesy Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer, there didn't seem to be much hope for the superhero genre. That was until 2008, when the once popular Robert Downey Jr. made a welcome return to the big screen as the smirking playboy turned superhero Tony Stark. What came after were several more films in the Marvel franchise (over 20) in a mere 10 years... the film itself is fun and awesome, but the real 'marvel' (no pun intended) is the success it started.",7,0,0,13 December 2018
Mother!," Revelation 21:6
","A hypnotic and soul wrenching epic; Mother is the kind of controversial film that I pray will live on long after its release. It's the polarizing and horrific love story about selfishness, privacy, family, love, and especially religion.
The symbolism is incredible, the visuals are mind blowing, and the performances are top notch. Mother! Is a truly unforgettable experience of a horror film.",10,4,7,20 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Chewie, we're home...
","I really don't care what anyone has to say because I personally thought this film was nearly flawless. Sure, it's hard to say that it wasn't a clone of 'A New Hope', but honestly, it's hard not to go back to old material. The Force Awakens was a thrilling and delectably exciting film that introduced us to fun and loveable new characters (BB8, I'm talking to you!), while simultaneously embracing the original characters. The film got us absolutely pumped for the next film which was an unfortunate misfire, but didn't matter at the time because of how good this one was.A+",10,11,35,16 April 2019
Annihilation," I don't understand the hate
