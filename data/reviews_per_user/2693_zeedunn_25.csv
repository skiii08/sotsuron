3:10 to Yuma," The Western Return to the Big Screen
","This was a Western well worth watching. The genre is not dead after all. The film is full of star power but still gritty enough to be appreciated by the art-house crowd. Christian Bale is Dan Evans, a husband, father, and ex-war veteran with a gimpy leg. Russell Crowe is the villain, an intelligent crook who commits crimes purely to make money he didn't earn. He's not a bad guy. Ben doesn't kill out of spite.In a purely dumb luck encounter, Dan ends up helping to capture Ben. The sheriff is going to play completely by the book. Ben won't be hung. He will given a fair trial in Yuma. But Ben's gang is sure to try and stop them. The local sheriff decides to hire 4 men to get Ben to the train on time, Dan being one of them.Dan's oldest son, William, is so enamored with Ben he can't see straight. On the side, he reads dime store novels about Ben's adventures. He is ashamed of his father and his supposed weakness. After all, his dad hasn't been able to protect the family from fires intended to drive the family out of coveted land. William ends up following Ben against his father's strict orders and joining this band of make-do deputies.Throughout the course of the journey to deliver Ben to the authorities, Dan is wary to get too close to Ben. But whenever a group of men spend time together, a bond of brotherhood is inevitably formed. Dan ends up saving Ben's life on more than one occasion and vice versa. You can't help but like Ben more than any of the 'good guys.' When he starts knocking his captors off one by one, he only goes for the annoying people. One man actually helped burn down Dan's house. This is not a guy we miss. The other casualty is Byron, a man who insults Ben's mother. And he sure knows how to woo the ladies. He talks to them and makes them feel like they are better than their lots in life.The strongest thing about this film is the two lead actors. At first glance, they appear to be two sides of one coin: the wholesome family man and the glamorous criminal. What could they possibly have in common? Ben is constantly surrounded by mindless thugs, especially Charlie Prince, a man who is apparently in love with Russell Crowe, though subconsciously. He kind of enjoys talking to the ethical, rational Dan.In an amazing set of circumstances I can't explain fully, Ben ends up aiding Dan in his attempt to get him on the train. This film is a favorite of the year and is sure to foster awards in the winter.",7,1,3,30 September 2007
Watchmen," Watchmen Explores the Soul and What it means to be a Hero
","Split open the mind of a scientist, add in superhero strength and struggles, set it in a doomsday world, sprinkle with some saucy fan service, shake, and you get 'The Watchmen, based on Alan Moore's mind-blowing graphic novel. The plot is somewhat complex, but in fact, it matters little to this film. This movie is all about characters, culture, and the mood of the film. The story is set in an alternative United States history. It's 1985, and Richard Nixon has been elected to his third term in office.The doomsday clock has been set for five minutes to midnight Â— midnight being the time when either Russia or the U.S. will launch a deadly atom bomb and the idea of world peace will forever be obliterated.The Watchmen are a group of 'superheroes,' although none of them (with one exception) have superhuman abilities. The story is laid out in a non-linear fashion: We see the past, then the present, then the more distant past. We find out bits of the story through memories, conversations, and photos on walls.The main conflict is that The Comedian, one of the former Watchmen, has been murdered. Rorschach, our narrator, is convinced that someone is targeting the Watchmen and picking them off, one by one. He sets out to discover who it is and to warn the rest of his former teammates.As usual, the others either mock him or ignore him. While he is trying to solve this mystery, Dr. Manhattan gets accused of causing his former colleagues to get cancer. He chooses to separate himself from the human race and abandon Earth, which leaves the United States feeling defenseless against Russian attack.The Watchmen pose a problem. They don't act or talk like superheroes, but that is the position they were given in society, at least for a time. Now, as retired superheroes, they live like a bunch of cast-off toys. The world has no use for them anymore. None of them seem happy, although a few tell themselves it's better this way.The potential evil of a human soul is fully explored. We see different ones of the Watchmen cheating on spouses, murdering pregnant women, and shooting civilians as a way to calm them down. The most loathed act is done by the murdered Comedian, who tries to rape one of his fellow superhero friends. Are we supposed to like them? Is there a hero in this story at all? Or is the problem the world? In our modern world, with weapons that can cause so much destruction, is it even possible to be a hero? Do the Watchmen do horrible things because they are horrible people or because they live in a horrible world? These are the types of questions this movie presents as we watch the film.The cinematography is a sight to behold. The camera gives equal love to both full-screen panoramic views, such as when Dr. Manhattan sets up his own city on Mars, and the tiniest detail, such as watching a drop of blood fall and spatter the yellow smiley face pin. Yes, the action scenes include lots of slow motion shots (Director Zack Snyder is well known for this after '300'). The tone is dark and beautiful. The soundtrack reflects the historical time periods shown, featuring artists such as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Simon and Garfunkel, and Jimi Hendrix.The acting is well done, not outstanding, with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He completely steals the show. He is our narrator, so we get to know him the best, and his character is one you won't soon forget. Whereas some of the Watchmen have gone slack or lost their passion for the work, he continues to live life with utter conviction. He never backs down, even up until the end. We might not agree with his actions, but we know what he stands for, which is more than I can say for most of the crew.I would not recommend bringing children or even younger teens to this movie. It includes graphic violence, rape, sex, profanity, and disturbing images.",7,1,4,17 March 2009
21," I Feel Dumb About Math When I Watch 21
","So, even though Ebert rated this movie low, I enjoyed it for what it was. It had all the elements of the heist movie with a little after school special mixed in. 21 is not destined to be a classic movie by any means. But how can you not enjoy a movie about a group of good looking kids making loads and loads of cash? In 21, the main character is a nerdy guy who rides around on his bike with one pant leg hiked up. He hangs out with two equally nerdy guys. The three of them are designing a car that runs by itself. They hang out at bars and drool over girls.Ben is all ready to start Harvard Medical School, if only he had enough cash. He is spotted by one of his teachers and covertly ushered to an underground room where said teacher forces the kids to play blackjack until they learn to play the game well enough to win loads of dough. They are MIT geniuses and can count cards.On the weekends they hit Vegas and play blackjack. Then, for Ben, everything falls apart. Will it stay that way? The rules of the after school special say no. The movie was predictable and should have been forgettable if it weren't for a math problem.I can't get this movie out of my mind because of the math problem suggested by the teacher (Kevin Spacey) towards the beginning about the 3 doors.",5,1,2,10 April 2008
Knowing," Knowing Will Generate Questions
","John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), a professor at MIT, knows which side of the debate he falls on when he teaches his students about choices. Are they random or determined? Stuff just happens, he tells his class. He tries to live his life accordingly. When he's not teaching in class or taking care of his partially deaf son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), he drinks away his sorrows. He's unhappy that his wife passed away in an accident and has taken a passive seat on the life bus. Although like everyone, he wants desperately to know that life isn't a waste, his highest goal has become keeping his son 'safe.' If stuff just happens, he won't let anything happen to Caleb by keeping him home.One day, something happens which challenges his beliefs to the core. His son's school is opening the time capsule a class buried in 1959, 50 year ago. Each student gets to open a letter from a student describing the future. Out of all the letters possible, Caleb gets the most disturbing one, a letter covered with seemingly random numbers. During one of his typical drunken stupors, John studies the numbers carefully and decides the same thing that Richard Dreyfuss did in Close Encounters: 'This means something.' Of course his confidantes all think he has lost his marbles, so John must seek out the truth in an alternate way. He finds a fitting colleague in the somewhat creepy, somewhat attractive Diana (Rose Byrne), who has a connection with the original creator of the letter Caleb opened from the time capsule.This is a suspenseful story, part science fiction, part thriller, which will challenge viewers to decide what they believe in the aforementioned debate. And unlike the sensation we find in some suspense stories, viewers won't have to suspend much belief to go along for the ride. John's journey happens step be step, each event happening in perfectly logical order. Is John creating his own story or is he just following the steps laid out for him long ago? Much of the story is laid out in cold, muted tones. We see how cold John's life is through the lens of the director's camera. When the tone finally changes to warm and bright on the screen, and it is oh so glorious to behold, we understand that John finally knows what he needs to do and is able to do it with 100% of his heart.",8,15,28,28 April 2009
Judgment at Nuremberg," We are all susceptible
","Although Judgment at Nuremberg was made back in 1961, the questions raised in this film are as relevant today as they were back then. The movie is a fictionalized account of a real trial that took place in 1947. Judges that helped send Jews, liberals, and other 'undesirables' to their deaths inside Nazi Germany concentration camps were put on trial for their part.The names in the film are different than the true people involved. For more on the real trials, click here. The film focuses on the trials from the perspective of the head of the US tribunal in charge of the trial, Chief Judge Dan Haywood, played by Spencer Tracey. Haywood and 2 other charges have the heavy responsibility of trying and sentencing 4 German judges. Public interest in this trial was high, as you can imagine. The whole world seems to be watching what Haywood and his tribunal will do. Will they go easy on these men who at one time would have been considered colleagues? Will they really let them have it? Can they really blame the judges for carrying out their duties? Many Americans wanted the whole of Germany to suffer for the pain caused.About half the film takes place in the courtroom. The other scenes, which are just as powerful, involve Haywood experiencing Germany as a tourist might. He walks around town. He makes friends with the natives. He listens to the music. Although his face remains passive most of the time, you can almost hear him asking the same questions others were asking and are still asking today: How could this have happened? How did Hitler gain control of the whole country? Were the Nazi people not fathers and husbands, too? Would I ever be capable of such evil? I highly recommend this film. I have seen many films dealing with the Holocaust, but none that deal with this aspect of the story.About the same time that I was watching the movie, I happened to be listening to The Kite Runner on audiobook. I couldn't help reflecting on some similar things that happened when the Nazis and the Taliban came to power. In both places, a country had been devastated by war. A powerful group came in, unified everyone together, and game people pride. In The Kite Runner, a Afghan man admits to Amir that they cheered when the Taliban entered the town. They wanted an end to the war and suffering. The German judge describes something similar in Judgment. Is anyone immune from the pull from this phenomenon? Are Germans or Afghans just genetically evil? They were humans with the capacity for great good or evil. Just as you are. Just as I am.We must always be careful that we don't let fear be the driving force behind what choices we make in how we will cope with a situation. I think fear clearly lead to both things. I'm not talking about Hitler or Osama or the extremists who took advantage of that fear to cause evil. But the average man, I believe, does not wake up wanting to torture someone.Judgment at Nuremberg will get thinking about these issues. It's a movie I won't forget for awhile.",10,0,2,19 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," Film Fails to Please; But See for Yourself
","After the big Oscar win, No Country came back to the local theaters. The movie is about accidents and being at the wrong place at the wrong time and how being evil sometimes comes with a code of morals.There are three major players: Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who stumbles across a drug deal gone back, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who starts out chasing Llewelyn for the money and ends up chasing him because of the fact that his chase is taking so long, and Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a sheriff who cracks up and becomes useless. It has a signature Coen brothers look: lots of dreary landscapes and very macabre characters. This is a great movie for all of those cynics out there.I think of this movie as mostly a character study. It got an Oscar for screenplay, which I don't think was the strongest part of the movie for me. There was some fantastic writing, but the movie was uneven to me. On the one hand you had the chase and the evasion. On the other hand, you had all these monologues from characters that revealed things about their pasts. It seemed like a suspense mashed in with a Shakespeare tragedy. It didn't work for me. Some have compared it to the feel of a Hitchcock film and I couldn't disagree more. Hitchcock did blend suspense with characters studies but the suspense was always the strongest part of the movie. It never took a back seat to the character study. Rather, the character study was merely a tool for drawing the reader farther in. In No Country, you don't really care who gets the money, as long as you don't have to see Chigurh do another coin toss ever again.",3,1,4,6 March 2008
District 9," Science Fiction Evokes Strong Response
","Peter Jackson's new protÃ©gÃ©, Neill Bloomkamp, has created a film that takes the science fiction genre to a higher plain. On the surface, you think you are getting a typical science fiction evil alien story. That is certainly what my expectations were after watching the trailer, which is mighty misleading. But the story here is about the essence of humanity and what humans are capable of when they forget what the word 'humane' means. It is sure to provoke a strong response in whomever watches it.The film goes back and forth between a mockumentary format and a regular narrative film. Our setting is modern day Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years ago, a large spacecraft came and hovered above the city. When the local authorities finally get up the courage to break into the ship, they find a horde of aliens that are half-starved. They move the aliens to a 'safe location' for them, which is really an internment, called District 9. The local government feels this is necessary to protect its human citizens, since the aliens began to exhibit violent tendencies.Now in our current setting, the population of Johannesburg is unhappy with the alien presence. They want them gone. So the government decides to relocate the aliens to a new location through forced migration. We can see District 9 has become a slum, and we understand why the humans want them removed. They plunder the land, fighting over tires and trash. They own weapons that humans can't operate, and they eat cat food. But we can see why the aliens might live this way. First of all, if you are starving, you will eat anything, and if the only option is cat food, well, you eat cat food. Also, when you force a bunch of people into a tight spot, they are going to fight for ownership over the little land they have. The aliens act as any oppressed people group throughout history has. They begin to act like animals.The way the humans decide to do this migration is silly indeed, and they are just asking for trouble. Unfortunately, most of the trouble lands on the heads of the aliens. The task force given the job is headed by Wikus Van De Merwe. Van De Merwe is a typical bureaucrat. He has his clipboard; he has his rules; and he'll write your name on the board if you get out of line. Hovering above at all times is the military in their helicopters, and if any aliens get out of line, they have no problem just shooting them on sight. The task force feels they are required to give the aliens 24 hours notice. They are supposed to get each alien to sign the clipboard, and if they won't, they threaten their kids or give them cat food--whatever it takes to get them to sign.The crisis point that begins our story is when Van De Merwe finds a device that is hidden in the home of an alien that must be their resident scientist. He innocently plays with the device not realizing it has a potent fluid inside that, if not impeded, will turn Van De Merwe into an alien, or prawn. Van De Merwe accidentally sprays himself with the liquid, and he slowly begins to turn into a prawn. Van De Merwe now finds himself the hunted, where he was the hunter. The ones he oppressed are now the only ones that will take him in. The scientist prawn, who is named Christopher Johnson, tells Wilkus he can fix him and get back to his planet, if they can get the device back. But there are many forces blocking their path, and everyone will show their true colors by the end of the movie. This is not a hero's tale, but it's realistic and involving.The story moves at a good pace. At no point does the action drag or waste time on meaningless or confusing plot lines. In addition, the director makes wise choices in how much violence to show. Since most of the violence in this film is done to aliens, there is that protective mask you can hide behind since the victim isn't a human, but these aliens do evoke feeling from us. Sure, they look like Jabba the Hut's ugly cousin, but they wear clothes, they talk, and they have kids. They cry for their friends, and they do feel pain, even if the most of the humans in this movie seem to forget that.The actors all do a great job, although only a few humans actually have more than a minor speaking role. You won't recognize any of the faces here.On a deeper level, we understand that we aren't really talking about aliens here. If you take away the spaceship and the alien bodies, any racial group that has faced oppression could be substituted for the aliens, and we would have the same story. The aliens have a few advantages: they are from another planet, so they have the option of escaping in a ship, and they have some technology that humans don't. Unfortunately, in the real stories where humans have been placed in internment camps and forced to leave their homes, their was no escape plan. The fact that this film is set in Johannesburg adds a deeper level, since many of its racial groups suffered similar fates as the alien prawns under the apartheid era.I enjoyed the movie. It was intense, and difficult to watch sometimes, but it does what I want my movies to do: grab me with inventive, exciting storytelling, and evoke strong emotions.",9,1,4,7 September 2009
Mamma Mia!," Happy Happy Joy Joy
","This movie made me smile. I sat in the theater by myself, smiling, laughing, and crying like a fricking idiot. I am not an ABBA fan or anything like that, although who can resist Dancing Queen? I was not familiar with the play. I wasn't going to see it at all until this co-worker told me she had seen it three times and still didn't have enough. She said it just made her feel happy and good. I concur.A young girl who lives in a romanticized island in Greece is about to tie the knot with a handsome but forgettable fellow. The one thing she feels lacking in heart is having her father give her away. She doesn't know her father. She lives with her mother, who runs a quaint hotel for vacationing guests. But now she has the solution: she found her Mother's diary and has it narrowed down to 3 candidates. Her plan is to invite all 3 estranged lovers to the wedding festivities. She believes that when she meets her father, she'll just know. It's a preposterous plan, but this movie works. It might not work for men, but it works for me.Now Mom is confronted with THE ONE from her past. When they met, he had a fiancÃ©, and he never returned.Along the way, the characters sing ABBA songs with much glee. The setting is gorgeous. The island has a mysterious, romantic gleam. You cannot imagine living there. It is something out of a postcard, although it is supposedly rundown. The beauty of the hotel and the surrounding landscape makes you believe that anything can happen, even magic. I wanted to be there amongst them, enjoying the island sangrias. I can't emphasize enough how happy I felt when I left the theater. You will believe in love again.",10,1,2,11 September 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Robert Ford, One of the Most Loathed Men in all of American Folklore?
","I saw the film a little while ago, so some of my memories are foggy. What I do remember is that the movie was interesting enough that I started doing research on the internet after watching the film. Sure, I've heard of Jesse James, but not many solid facts were floating up in my noggin.Brad Pitt plays a solid Jesse James: frightening, off kilter, somewhat mentally unbalanced, and terrified of losing his power. His strategy is to keep those under him unsure of what he will do next. He thrives on having men around him who fear him. He keeps Robert Ford around him longer than others because Ford fears him and also idol worships him.Casey Affleck as Robert Ford is amazing. Casey is Ben's younger brother and usually plays the village idiot. His first role I recall is playing the underling to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting. And he reprises this type of character as one of the two getaway drivers in the Ocean's 11, 12, and 13 movies. In this film, although he still plays someone's doormat, he is underestimated by those around him.At the beginning, we see the last big hurrah of the James brothers. The older brother seems to sense that his retirement is well advised at this time. After a disaster of a robbery (Jesse hesitates before killing a man), the older brother decides to live out a law abiding life. Jesse feels somewhat abandoned until he spots Robert Ford, who begs to be allowed to join his band. Jesse doesn't exactly take a liking to the kid, but he seems to need him for this time. He senses Ford's obsession with him with a patient, but distant, disdain.Several mini-plots come up, which are all well done, but the film is really about Ford's transition from almost in love with James to becoming his murderer. The transition is slow but complete. Ford plays a Judas type killer. He knows it has to be done, but he's guilty about it.SPOILERS*** I found the last part of the film to be the most intriguing. After the death, Ford experiences a brief time of being a hero. He is photographed by the dead corpse. He is even asked to repeat the incident on stage in a play. Although the law had been after Jesse James for years, he was an icon. You will have to decide for yourself why Ford becomes one of the most loathed characters in all of American history. Was it that fact that he killed James in a coward's way by shooting him in the back? Was it because America considered James to be a hero and not a villain? Was it because James was smooth, suave and handsome and Ford was awkward and clumsy? I found myself feeling sorry for Ford.",10,2,4,23 December 2008
Twilight," Make Mine Vampire
","Make mine Vampire! As a young adult librarian, it was my God sworn duty to view the movie that is causing teen girls all over the universe to roll over, clutching their hearts and suffering from increased heart palpitations: Twilight. I am going to try to review this as the movie alone.The acting was okay. Of course, not much acting was required. To be cast in this movie, you had to be sexy hot and make cool poses. It's similar to 300 in that sense. Robert Pattinson is convincing as Edward. He takes the acting up a step by hiding his accent and giving lots of smoldering glances. Kristen Stewart as Bella-- hmmm, I could go either way. Yes, her performance was a little bland, but let's face it, the character of Bella is bland. She has no life outside of Edward. She refuses to have any sort of meaningful relationship with her parents or any of her friends.The supporting vampires were acceptable. Like I said, not much was required except to look attractive and make cool poses like you are about ready to pounce on someone.The chemistry between Bella and Edward was off balance. Edward was sparking on her, but I didn't see it from Stewart.I will tell you what worked: Vampire baseball. Awesome! And the soundtrack was great. I think unless you have read the books and/or are under the age of 18, there is really no draw here.I liked it, but then I have read the books and am sort of invested in the story. I love the character of Jacob and am interested to see if Taylor Lautner can muster the cajones to play this conflicted character. I am sure the casting directors are hoping he will grow in height and breadth in the next couple years to be able to appear as mountainous as Jacob is supposed to be. Either that or they are going to have to CGI the life out of him.Can we make a movie tie-in about nothing but the history of vampire baseball and watch attractive vampires playing the game? I'm in.",6,0,4,1 December 2008
Revolutionary Road," What's the Point?
","I thought this movie should win the award for most depressing movie of the year. They could invent a new category with this film in mind. This movie is my worst nightmare come to life. Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) play a married couple in the 1950s. We understand that they are perfect for one another, but their marriage is horrible. They tear each other down and say awful things to one another. They are two wounded people bumping up against one another. They don't talk about these problems and instead focus on the surface problems. They have bought into the lie that 'this is as good as it gets.' One day, April decides that good enough isn't good enough and she wants a change. She decides she can find that life in Paris. If they would only move to Paris, then they would be happy. Frank agrees and then later changes his mind. They don't move to Paris and fight even more. The movie is this couple fighting the entire movie. Instead of talking to one another, they decide to have affairs to numb the pain of their lives. They tear each other apart until there is nothing left.Now don't get me wrong, this is a well-made and interesting movie. I was riveted the whole time, and my heart was beating fast the entire film. I'm not really sure why that was. Needless to say, it was intense. The acting was superb. Forget about The Reader, Kate should have received an award for her performance here. The same goes for Leo. I love Leonardo DiCaprio, and I always will. I have loved him since he was a little squirt on Growing Pains. Both of these actors can show the torment they are feeling with one look. Then, effortlessly, they cover it up to hide their pain.That would be enough, having two lead actors work this kind of magic, but the supporting cast is perfect as well. John (Michael Shannon) is perfect as a tortured mathematician whose had shock treatments. He is like an oracle who can only speak the truth, even though no one wants to hear it. There is never a dull dinner party when John is invited. The next door neighbors say much more when they are not speaking.All that being said, what is the point of this movie? I am trying to imagine someone trying to spin this to a studio . . .Storyboard guy: Okay, Joe, so there's this married couple, you see? And their both young and beautiful. They meet, get married, and they're miserable.Joe: Mmm-hmmm.Storyboard: One day they decide to move to Paris, but the husband, see, he changes his mind, and they don't move to Paris.Joe: Mmm-hmmm Storyboard: Then they are still miserable, you see? Joe: Mmm-hmmm, but it ends okay, right? Storyboard: No, it gets worse.Joe: Mmm-hmm. Well, I'm sold.It's not a movie that will make you cry. You just feel empty, and wonder what the heck just happened.What do we learn? Don't get married? Is the moral really you should have moved to Paris. Let's just get real here. It wouldn't matter if they lived in Paris or not. Neither one of them could admit their fears to one another. They never helped each to grow or took the time to reach out to one another. And that's the trap they couldn't escape, not suburban America.",5,2,5,25 July 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," As Close to Perfect as a Movie Can Get.
","Last week, I received the awesome privilege of being able to watch Lawrence of Arabia on the big screen at a local theater. I have seen this film multiple times. In fact, I own a DVD copy, but I have never seen it magnified. And yes, it makes a difference. You can actually see the grains of sand blowing around the Nefud desert. You feel the sun burning down as Lawrence rides through the scorching Devil's Anvil. And more than once, you see those blue penetrating eyes staring straight into your heart and know how a skinny, white British soldier inspired the Arab people to almost free themselves once and for all from imperialism.This won't be so much of a review as a reflection. Truly reviewing this movie would be a daunting task which I won't attempt now.If you haven't seen Lawrence, it is an experience worth having. True, at 216 minutes, it is longer than your average film. But unlike some films of this length the viewer stays involved. In fact, at the end of this film, I am always wanting more. It seems impossible that a people group could get so close to their goal only to turn back. And I want to see Lawrence and Sheriff Ali continue their strange, endearing fellowship past what this film shows. And unlike some biopics, we don't see some long drawn out story about how painful Lawrence's childhood was or follow him past his prime to see him sighing over lost opportunities. The ending is abrupt with no sense of conclusion. The whole thing seems like a big buildup to failure, but no one ever said Lawrence of Arabia could be put into a nice, neat box.At the beginning, T.E. Lawrence is stationed in Cairo in the maps room. He is portrayed as messy, reckless, and somewhat masochistic. He enjoys letting a match burn down to his fingers and 'not minding that it hurts.' He is called to the general's quarters by Mr. Dryden, of the Arab Bureau, for his knowledge of the Bedouin people. They want to send him to look for the Bedouin people and Prince Feisal. His mission is to assess the situation. That's a somewhat nebulous task, but Lawrence is enthralled. He gets to come out of his hidey hole in the maps room, out into the desert, and away from those stodgy British military folks. Lawrence has an obvious obsession with the Arabian culture and the desert. As we watch him riding his camel, he looks around him like a kid with his first slingshot.Lawrence's initial encounters with the Arabs are mixed. He gets along well with his guide only to see the man get killed the next day by another Arab merely for drinking from a well. Lawrence sees this as somewhat barbaric, but we can see his eyes sparkle when it happens. This is a physical tell. He has been raised to be a civilized British conservative, but his heart longs for the feuding and bloodthirst of the eastern world.Lawrence finds Prince Feisal and his people in the midst of a Turkish air strike. He is invited into the tent and speak out of turn. Feisal wants to hear what he has to say. Lawrence seems to desperately want to please this man and to 'out-Arab' the Arabs. What is his motivation? Does he truly love the Arab culture so much? Does he wish to glorify himself as the one who could make it work? Is he just suicidal? Is he out to prove an agenda? Director David Lean (genius) makes the wise choice to leave this open. He never attempts to 'explain Lawrence.' This is why people are still obsessed with this movie 40 years later. Lawrence is a mystery.Lawrence breaks with his orders by deciding to do more than assess. He decides to help the Arabs take Damascus and will stop at nothing to make this goal a reality. Not ridicule, not the impassable desert, and especially not 'what is written' will keep this white boy from dreaming the impossible dream. He dares to hope, to dream and creates a believer out of Sharif Ali and the rest of the Bedouin peoples.The film contains moments of grandeur, such as the battle scenes and the train raids. It also includes quiet moments around the fire, like when Sheriff Ali tells Lawrence he can choose his own name. This movie is a symphony, which has dynamics of highs and lows. This is a lost art in the film world today. Above all, there is the desert, which is more than the setting of the movie, it is a living thing which invites Lawrence into its danger and secrets. The desert is the seductress which pulls Lawrence into his long arduous path from conquering hero to possible madman to a man resigned. The dessert brings out the very best in Lawrence, and the very worst.The dialogue is precise and memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is superb. The only problem with this film is that I will never be able to understand who Lawrence truly was. That is the maddening genius of this film. I am going to make a bold statement here. I believe this is as close to being a perfect movie as one can get.",10,2,5,14 February 2009
Gran Torino," Eastwood Still Kicks Butt
","Gran Torino is an unexpected treatÂ—the type of movie that rarely comes along. You find yourself riveted to the spot, surprised at how much empathy you feel for a character that you think you would despise in real life.Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War veteran. He's racist as can be and isn't ashamed of it. The only things he really seems to enjoy are beer, his dog, his tools, and his workÂ—oh yeah, and his prized possession, a 1972 Gran Torino. His favorite facial pattern is a disapproving sneer. His favorite action seems to be spitting tobacco as he sneers. He despises young people and especially scantily dressed females. His sons are a disappointment to him.The crisis point happens when the boy next door, Thao, tries to steal the aforementioned car. Thao is Hmong and considered too feminine by his family. He likes gardening better than hard labor. Walking down the street one day, he is harassed by some Latino gang members and bailed out by his Hmong cousins. This seeming favor becomes dangerous when they decide Thao should join their gang even if he has to be forced. The car theft is an initiation for him. Since he fails, he's in the dog house, and they come to teach him a lesson. Just at as they're about to drag him off, out comes Walt, now on his second night of interrupted sleep, Dirty Harry style to threaten the gangbangers with a shot gun. This is where the turning point in the movie happens.Thao's very large, very duty-bound family decides that Thao and the entire Hmong community are in Walt's debt for the attempted crime and his heroic shotgun thing. Despite Walt's protests they insist on giving him food and gifts as thank you tributes. Then Thao is given to Walt as his personal slave for a week. Walt decides to toughen Thao up.Walt gets more interaction with his Hmong neighbors than he bargained for. And his lives become more intertwined with them than his own family. And though the gangbangers also continue to take an interest in Thao, Walt doesn't like seeing his projects get interrupted.This film is the perfect combination between humor and tragedy. I found myself laughing at most of Walt's lines. This is a man we have all met at one point or another, but Eastwood's got the charm to make it likable. His remarks are harmless, rather than caustic, and the family senses that, especially Sue, Thao's sister, whose charm and feistiness win over Walt. I loved seeing Eastwood, now almost 80 years old, scaring the young gangbangers with his words and imaginary handgun gestures.Clint Eastwood proves he's still tough and in this visceral performance that will be remembered long after the golden statues are given out.",10,1,5,17 January 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Magic
","I believe Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece is what re-ignited interest in the movie musical. Everything about this movie keeps you captivated. The characters do an impressive job. Ewan McGregor is convincing as the starry-eyed idealistic poet who falls in love with Satine. He sees nothing but her, and his face lights up when she walks into the room. Nicole Kidman does a decent job in her role as well, although all she has to do is be gorgeous and tantalizing. Towards the end of the movie, she does pick up her game and presents a haunting portrait of a woman who knows she has doomed herself to a life of torment without her love. Both of them do fine as singers. I am sure their voices were touched up a lot, but who cares? The supporting cast is great as well. The Duke sneers effectively. Jim Broadbent as Harold Zigler is great as the manager of the Moulin Rouge. He is a kind man, although his first love is his theater. He truly is sorry he has to ask Satine to sacrifice herself, but not sorry enough that he is willing to see the Moulin Rouge go bankrupt. He has a great number towards the end called The Show Must Go On. My favorite supporting actor by far has to be John Leguizamo, a Baz Luhrmann regular. He plays the dwarfed version of Toulouse-Lautrec well and represents all that glitters in the Bohemian. He believes in truth, beauty, and love and wants everyone around him to have all 3 if possible.The music is breathtaking. I always cry during the Come What May at the end of the show. And the look of the film is just beautiful. It makes the Moulin Rouge look like a beautiful carnival of sound, color, and melody.The pacing is just right. I understand that Luhrmann has a background in opera. This truly shows in his ability to make powerful use of the music mixed with the pictures. He has knowledge of how to play his audience. I was also impressed with how he created just the right mix of tragedy and comedy. During Act II, a very dark act, he throws in a light number, Like a Virgin, which provides needed comic relief. There is also the stunning dance number Roxanne, which makes effective use of the montage technique using scenes from both the dancers and the turmoil happening upstairs in an erotic tango. He truly builds tension to the breaking point.I highly recommend this movie for a romantic evening, a girls' night, or as a pick me up.",10,1,4,24 November 2008
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," New Moon Has Some Good: Jacob, the Soundtrack
","I have a dirty little secret. I am 32 years old, and I have read the Twilight book series (all of them) and watched the movies. Now, I have a semi-excuse. I am a young adult librarian and service to teens is my first priority. This means I am supposed to know what teens enjoy so that I can use that knowledge to develop programs for them at the library. However, while this explains why I might have read a couple of the books, it doesn't explain why I chose to go see the New Moon movie at midnight this morning.It was a last minute decision. I didn't have to work today so I thought, why not? Usually the big midnight releases are on Tuesday nights and I have to work in the morning. Plus I happen to live right down the street from a really cool community movie theater. It is quieter than the big cineplexes. I had no trouble getting a ticket at the last minute or finding a seat. They serve freshly popped popcorn, which yes, is a anomaly in the movie theater business.So here's my reaction to the movie, and I'll attempt to do this without spoilers. Of course, it's pretty hard to spoil this movie when everyone knows the story for the most part.The Good: The best parts of this movie are when Bella is alone or with Jacob. Their chemistry is real. And why wouldn't it be? Have you seen those abs? Little Jacob looks GOOD in this movie. The man-boy has a temperature of 140 degrees, and I am always cold. And when Bella is Edward-less, Kristen Stewart gives a fragile and sincere performance. I felt the wall she built around herself, and I felt it tumble as Jacob's warmth melts it away. I am on Team Jacob, but no one can deny that Bella and Jacob had a better connection in this movie. Maybe it's because Edward hardly shows up, but it's pretty obvious.Okay, yes, there are some very cheesy parts in Taylor Lautner's Jacob performance. Couldn't they get him a better wig? But he did what this part required, he looked good (I read today that he had given up ice cream, poor guy) and he had a good combination of anger and brokenness to pull Jacob off. And he loses the wig halfway through.I also have to say the soundtrack is outstanding. Some great songs, and maybe without the songs I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie so much. The right song can cover up many flaws in a film. I found links to the songs on youtube that were especially good. Hearing Damage by Thom Yorke played over a chase scene, and gave the moment an ethereal quality. The next one was Possibility by Lykke Li, which plays during a rather sad moment in the film. This singer reminds me so much of Julee Cruise (turn this one up, it has a great dance to it, too) who sang many of the tracks off of the Twin Peaks TV series soundtrack. Maybe not the exact sound or timbre, but just the feeling of despair you feel when listening to the songs.The Bad: The vampires all look TERRIBLE in this movie. At the beginning scenes, Edward looks all right. But the vampires do not look good. I think in general, they have done a horrible job making these vampires look good. Most of the actors are attractive, but the makeup is so bad. They are all pale and frigid looking. The vampires are supposed to be alluring, but it didn't work out that way. When we first see Edward after a long absence, we are comparing him in our minds with the muscular, tan, warm person of Jacob. And Edward and Bella together have no chemistry. They had some in the first movie, but it's gone. Bella doesn't even seem to like Edward's company. And Edward looks constipated the whole time.Go Team Jacob! I would say if you are a fan of these books and this concept, you should see the movie. If you have no interest in this series, the movies are not for you. What I want to know is, will it get better or worse? As a Jacob fan, I know I am going to hate the last movie, but the third one could be the best.",5,2,10,20 November 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Benjamin Button is a hit
","Since I first saw the trailer for this film, I have been looking forward to its release. I thought it looked like a beautiful love story, but more than that, an exploration into one man's life. It would be a story about a man who faces insurmountable challenges from the get go, but still has a full life. Boy, was I right. But I had my doubts that would be right.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is based on a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The short story and movie couldn't be more different. Many people say the book is always better. Here is a case where that is not true. The short story is typical Fitzgerald. The family is dysfunctional. The content is dark, dark, dark. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. In the short story, Benjamin is born, lives, and dies. Everything goes very quickly. His wife is mentioned in one paragraph. You can read the whole thing yourself online. I found the short story depressing. Benjamin is not a particularly likable character. After his wife gets old, he grows bored of her and goes off to have adventure. He is rejected his whole life except for one period where he is a successful football star. Lucky for the screenwriters, the movie goes in a different direction. Don't get me wrong, the short story is well written and will make you think. But I like stories with some hope. The short story doesn't have it.The movie, on the other hand, is a tale of a man who by all accounts should have died. His mother dies giving birth to him. His father considers him a curse and slips into the night to get rid of him as quickly as possible. By some miraculous touch, he lives. He is born an old man and finds himself getting younger as time passes. He has many physical problems. The first 20 so years of his life are spent in a 'home' for invalids and people with disabilities: the rejects of society. He is taken in by the kind young Queenie, who becomes Button's adopted Momma.The plot takes many twists and turns that would go on longer than a review should. Suffice it to say that Benjamin visits many places, meets many interesting people, and his ailment does nothing to stop him. The film that is most similar would be Forrest Gump, so I wasn't at all surprised when I learned that Eric Roth, one of the co-writers of the screenplay for Benjamin Button, also wrote the Forrest Gump screenplay.The main relationship of note is his lifelong friendship and then romance and then something even more with the red-headed Daisy. Benjamin and her connect instantly when he is old and she is young because they are both old souls. They like the same stories and dream of adventure. Their love is tragic, however, because of the aging problems. Can you carry on a romantic relationship when the man appears to be in his 20s and the woman in her 40s? Sure, but what about when the man turns into a teenager and even younger? If you don't like long drawn-out emotional romances, don't let this scare you away. Much of the content is odd enough to balance out the melodrama. In one scene, Queenie takes Benjamin to a tent revival. The preacher gets his lungs going and the praying gets going and in the excitement of it all, Benjamin stands up and begins to walk for the first time. It is a miracle, and then the sweaty preacher drops dead. Scenes like this keep the melodrama from taking over the story.Although the movie is about 3 hours long, it didn't drag for me. I was immersed enough that I didn't want it to end. Brad Pitt does an exceptional job as Benjamin Button. He plays Button as a man who knows something is wrong with him on the inside, but ignores it on the outside. It is difficult to convey internal tension without speaking it aloud, and this makes Pitt a great actor. I have always believed Brad Pitt is an awesome actor because of two movies: Interview with a Vampire and Twelve Monkeys. You can add Benjamin Button to his most successful roles. It is important to note that many actors play Benjamin Button, and all do a wonderful job, but the movie belongs to Brad Pitt.Cate Blanchett is not quite there for me. She plays Daisy like a superficial artist type in her 20s. I know they were trying to show that as a young woman, Daisy would be more superficial than later in life, but the character wasn't believable until she was in her 30s, and she and Benjamin are supposed to be about the same age. It felt forced to me when she was the star dancer. Once she is in her 30s, she does a fine job as a middle-aged and older woman. I'm not sure what could have made it better, but she just came across as snobby, which wasn't believable for an old soul like Daisy.But go see Benjamin Button, it is a great flick and will most likely be tagged for many Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor.",10,0,2,6 January 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," History Made More Understandable
","I heard about McCarthyism when I was in high school or was it middle school? For me, it's one of those events you hear about but can never truly understand. This movie brought me just a little closer to understanding.It takes place right in the middle of the 'witch hunts' McCarthy instigated back in the 1950s. Various government employees, actors, and other people on the fringe were accused of being part Communists or Communist sympathizers. Perhaps this person was a Russian spy? They do seem suspicious. I saw them reading leftist newspaper articles the other day. Her brother used to be involved with an organization that is now funding the Russians, etc. McCarthy claimed he had a whole list of people that were suspicious characters. And he had evidence! However, it was in a sealed envelope with nothing written on it, and no one had actually seen the contents that could attest to them. The whole thing was suspicion and hearsay. But, it was effective! People were fired from their jobs, shunned from society, and whispered about in corridors. Imagine the shame.So in this movie, a CBS news correspondent, Edward R. Murrow, decides to challenge McCarthy. He doesn't directly claim that McCarthy is lying. Only that he wants to see what is in all of these evidence reports. After a tug of war for the hearts of the American people, McCarthy is impeached. This may or may not have been a direct result of the Murrow shows, but it was clear the public tide was turning. In this movie, they show how the events surrounding this showdown might have played out on the inside. There are many meetings and threats. There is much brow-wiping and collar twisting. And it makes for a very riveting film.We see how this whole thing could have blown up in Murrow's face. We see what a risk he took and how the executive producers of the station might have treated him for taking that risk. We see fear and bravery.This was a 2005 Oscar nominee in 6 categories, none of which it won. But it is a very interesting piece of work. What's amazing is that this event happened on the heels of the Holocaust and Nuremberg trials. The United States had just spent a lot of time pointing fingers at other countries that had let fear and speculation run the day. Many people got sent to concentration camps based on this same type of rumors and hearsay as displayed in this film.This film makes for riveting entertainment, but don't try to watch it when you are in the mood for something light. This is a fairly clean picture, rated PG. It could be useful in an educational setting.",8,6,6,3 June 2008
Black Snake Moan," Deep South Meets Deep Healing
","Black Snake Moan is a redemption story cleverly set in the hillbilly South. The acting is superb, including a performance by pretty boy Justin Timberlake. Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) and Rae (Christian Ricci) are two lost souls, seemingly acting off impulses neither one can control. Lazarus, an elderly, black, blues guitarist, is torn up that his wife left him for his younger brother. He turns to booze and music for comfort. Rae, young, white, and the town slut is addicted to sex and can barely wait an hour after her military boyfriend (Timberlake) leaves for his enlistment before her next dip.Their lives intertwine one night, when Rae, high from a party is raped and beaten and left in Lazarus's driveway. I know this sounds brutal, but this is not done in a heavy, depressing manner. On the contrary, this story has a whimsical tone peppered with lots of deep fried Southern flavor. Yes, Rae is attacked, but she doesn't seem to mind. She knows it's a natural outcome of her behavior and doesn't really seem to expect much more of menfolk, a clue to the truth about Rae's past.Lazarus, raw from his wife's abandonment, decides it's his job to deliver Rae from herself. Initially, he just plans to tend to her bruises and send her on her way. But when he realizes what this lady does with her time, he decides he is God's messenger ('I will suffer you,' he says to Rae.). As soon as she can walk again, Rae is ready to hit the town again. Lazarus responds by chaining her to his radiator. She begs, please, cajoles, and seduces, but he won't unlock that padlock.Rae assumes Lazarus wants from her what every other man wants and tries to seduce him. Lazarus is outraged with her assumption and responds by turning to the Good Book. That's right, Lazarus is an alcoholic Bible beater. And so starts a clever chess game as each tries to get the upper hand over the other. By all outward signs, Lazarus seems to be the stronger of the two. After all, he is not the one chained up. But Rae starts to figure things out about Lazarus and uses these truths to pry into his brain. They have more in common then they realize and gradually, they grow to need each other.There is a telling scene when Lazarus start giving Rae a lecture on how her sleeping around is impacting her for the bad. But as he keeps talking, it becomes clear that he is not talking to Rae but his own wife ('You sleep with my brother; kill my baby!). Are Lazarus's intentions as pure as he believes? Is he doing this to help Rae or punish his wife? How do these two who mostly scream at each other throughout the movie find healing love in their friendship? You will just have to see.The acting is great; the soundtrack is hearty. The music sets the mood for this film and plays an important role in creating tension. When Lazarus plays the tune 'Black Snake Moan,' Rae sees a man from her past in her mind and clings to Lazarus's leg for protection.Rae has a lot of sexuality, but her relationship with Lazarus is more like father and daughter. Lazarus has someone to be a hero to, and Rae has a male figure she can rely on for once. The movie ends with hope, something we all need.Once again, let me say, if you didn't know Timberlake could act, you are in for a treat. He plays a reasonably good unstable male!",9,2,7,23 July 2007
Into the Wild," Escape the Mold of Society
","When Christopher McCandless graduated from Emory University, his parents are sure he will follow the path they have set for him: becoming a lawyer. McCandless wants nothing to do with that. He has grown up watching his parents choke on the American dream. They seem terribly unhappy.Instead, he wants to break out of the trap, give away all of his money, take only the most essential possessions on his back, and work his way up to his ultimate adventure: surviving alone in Alaska. He left home in summer of 2000. By April of 2002, he was ready to walk into the wilds of Alaska.On September 6, 2002, McCandless's malnourished body was bound in a bus he had survived in for the past several months. What lead him to this fate? Dying alone is no man's dream. Primary source material for this movie and the book it was based on are the journals McCandless filled while he was on the road.We see his trek across the country. The people he met and befriended. Everyone seemed to like him. Some people were ready to adopt him or make him their pseudo-son. He made no judgments and seemed to have no vices. He doesn't drink too much or accept inappropriate offers from under-aged girls. And he is single-minded in his goal. We also see the sadder side of this story, the sister and parents he left behind. They seem haunted by his absence.The performances are amazing by all characters. This film will make you question the choices you made when you were at those essential years after college. There is one telling scene where McCandless is walking the streets of a bustling metropolis. He people watches and sees a well-dressed man eating fine food at the table. The man seems confident and happy as he gorges himself. McCandless looks again and see his own face instead of the man's. And he runs as fast as he can away from the city. He knows he is not immune to the charms of wealth and suburban living, and it scares him to death. He knows one thing: he doesn't want to become his parents.I felt sad at McCandless's fate, but at least he lived in a way he believed.",9,1,4,23 November 2007
The Happening," The Happening, science vs. supernatural
","The movie is freaky more than scary. There were times I found the script random. Some moments seemed like there should have been a punch line, which didn't fit with the whole 'serious movie vibe.' The plot moved slow but it kept me involved.In this movie, people in Central Park are behaving oddly. Some are walking backwards. Others repeat the same sentence over and over again. One lady stabs herself in the neck with a needle. Then we meet our protagonist, a science teacher in Philadelphia. He is trying to get his students interested in science. He wants them to make theories up about the disappearance of bees. By this time, word of the strange 'happening' has reached the school. The principal decides to close the school and let people be home with their families.The teacher (Elliot), his wife, best friend, and daughter decide to get out of town. Maybe it will be safer somewhere else. Inter-family tensions are high, but they are determined to stick together. They soon find out that finding a safe spot will prove more harder than they imagined. This movie will keep you guessing all the way through. Can science save the day? This movie was very much like The Birds. The plot seems to weird to be plausible, but you are wondering if this could every really happen. All the technologies and things we humans rely on are of no use, and all the characters have to rely on is their wits and the kindness of strangers. Remember in The Birds when it ended you felt exhausted? I remember thinking, where can they go to feel safe? Birds are everywhere. How could you run from them? Would they be running forever? The truth is, no mater how much we might wish it to be true, safety is an illusion. There is no safety on this Earth. I feel that is an essential truth, and that is why I appreciate Shyamalan's work.",Null,8,14,30 July 2008
Hancock," Hancock Better than Expected
","Hancock was worth the money in my book. It was funny, and it had the best surprise mid-plot twist I have seen in awhile. This movie could have been just another mindless comedy if it wasn't for the fact that it has heart. Will Smith's character seem genuinely depressed. Yes, there are plenty of sarcastic one-liners and humorous moments. But Hancock, for all his drunken boorishness, is (shed a tear) lonely.Hancock has super-powers of strength, speed, and resistance to bullets, but he is also a drunken, rude, sweaty mess. And every time he helps someone, he manages to mess things up. Either he costs the citizens thousands in tax dollars for city damages or he insults somebody. And his breath stinks, taboot! Then a soft-hearted guy with a nice suit gets saved by Hancock one day. He witnesses the anger people display afterwords and decides, gee, maybe Hancock needs a face-lift. He's a PR man, and he wants to give Hancock a new image. He brings Hancock home for dinner (it's spaghetti madness night) and exhibits the same attitude towards Hancock as one would a puppy that is destroying your shoes. Can't we keep him, hon? His son loves Hancock immediately, but the wifey seem like she's not impressed. His plan is simple: get Hancock sequestered in prison so that people will miss him. Then, when the cops call, he'll be ready to impress 'em with his 'new attitude.' It's fun, flashy, and a perfect summer film. I have mixed feelings about the ending, but I still enjoyed it.",6,0,2,21 July 2008
Iron Man," Finally, a good movie in 2008
","Must . . . go . . . see . . . Iron Man. I'm not sure what makes Iron Man so good. Could it be Robert Downey's performance? He is amiable enough. Could it be all the cool techie gadgets? Yes, they are neat. Could it be that it involves the Middle East, and Americans can't seem to get enough of that right now? Yes, it has cultural relevancy. Could it be that the spring line of movies has sucked so bad that it doesn't take much to impress me at this point? Yes, that's quite on the money.For me, I love any movie where a power hungry person changes their tune and makes a mental shift. Downey gives a solid performance as someone who has seen the light of day and wants to change his ways. It was fairly clean, too.",8,1,3,15 May 2008
AmÃ©lie," Happiness Means Doing Good for Others
","Amelie is a porcelain doll of a young woman. She was how I imagined Snow White would look minus the rosy cheeks: dark brown hair, gooey chocolate-colored eyes, perfect skin, and red lips. Amelie is painfully shy. She struggles with revealing her deepest needs. She longs to be close to someone and have a friend to talk to, but instead she watches from her window with binoculars. She observes those around her and thinks she might know what might make them happy. She studies them, takes notes, and executes a plan. If special ops needed a happiness agent, Amelie would be their woman.When she was a girl, she had two type-A parents. Her father would never touch her, except when he gave her a medical exam. Her mother's greatest joy was cleaning her purse out. Amelie's only friend was a goldfish with suicidal tendencies. Now, as a grown woman, she works in a cafÃ©. She watches a male painter in his flat below. He never leaves his apartment because of frail limbs. Amelie's father is now widowed and never leaves his home, either. She is surrounded by unhappy people and Amelie is drowning in their discontent.One day, her life changes when she finds a small music box containing a little boy's treasures. She makes a decision. She will hunt down the box's owner. If it makes him happy, she will spend her days doing secret good deeds for others, finding happiness in their fortune. She becomes the good fairy, hiding in the shadows as others dance for joy at a new lover, a lost loved one found, and a look at the world outside.The movie is done in French with English subtitles. It was refreshing to watch this story about someone who simply longs to bring good to the world. Whenever one of her 'victims' brims with happiness, Amelie's shy smile brightens up her face. The cinematography was well done with bright colors. You want to enter this world of fruit stands, fairs, and amusement parks. You want to jump on Amelie's shoulder and ride around with her on one of her adventures. This was a must-see movie for cinema lovers. When it ended, and Amelie rode off with someone that made her happy, the music soaring in the background, I smiled and sighed with wonder.",8,0,3,31 August 2007
The Soloist," Has a Different Kind of Hope
","Got a chance to see the Soloist the other night. It wasn't something I planned on watching. In greater Raleigh, there is still a $1.50 theater, one of those grand places where you can catch a cheap flick on the big screen. The group I was with picked The Soloist as the film to see, and I was fine with paying $1.50. I had heard some not-so-good reviews of the film. Some said it had no point. Some said the thought the movie had no hope at the end. I found that I enjoyed the film and totally 'got it.' I thought this film showed in a concrete way that you can't force someone to change unless they are ready.This is based on a true story, and it's believable. Steve Lopez (Robert Downy, Jr in another great role) is a cynical journalist. He knows how to find the good story out of the most mundane circumstances. He isn't above interviewing anyone if it means he will get some readers to enjoy his column. He makes a personal bike accident sound thoughtful and provoking, as he rhapsodizes about the state of a neighborhood hospital.One day he comes upon Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) , who is homeless and rambles when he talks. Yet he tells Lopez that he used to attend Julliard. After checking out his story, Lopez takes a special interest in Ayers and decides he would make a good human interest piece. Lopez interviews him and listens to him play, but it's all word related---at first. Then he starts to get involved in Ayer's life, and he begins to take a genuine interest in Ayers. Lopez sees the talent in Ayers and he wants to see that talent get used. Here is where I think the movie flopped in most people's eyes.We all love an underdog story. We want to see that homeless person defeat all of his monsters and settle down in a nice, normal life. Lopez wants him in an apartment, possibly giving concerts and sharing his music with the world. And if he (Lopez) gets some of the credit for bring this talent to light, well that's quite all right with him. In the traditional film, Ayers would have pulled himself up by his bootstraps and live happily ever after. We like that.What happens instead is much more realistic and true. I won't spoil the ending for you, but we don't get the happily ever after ending. We do see hope in this film, and a life is changed, but I would argue that the life most changed is Lopez himself. He's the typical cynical, hardworking journalist. He's worked hard all of his life and managed to push all of his meaningful relationships away. Robert Downy, Jr. is the right combination of rugged, cynical, selfish, and flawed to play this role. Jamie Foxx gives a great performance as a mentally ill man with demons in his past and a child's heart. When he listens to music, his eyes shine and we want to feel what he is feeling.Besides the acting, the most notable thing about this film is its portrait of the homeless community. Lopez tells Ayers if he wants to play the cello that a reader donated, he will have to play in the homeless shelter. Ayers is terrified to go down there. To get to the shelter, you have to dodge drug dealers, panhandlers, prostitutes, and more. The shelter itself is run by a kindly man (Nelsan Ellis) who sees through Lopez's 'good deeds' to his conditional love for Ayers. There are some beautiful scenes that take place in this shelter where Ayers plays his cello for the homeless residents. And it's like a soothing balm.I have been to feed the homeless events, and I saw the faces of the people I had fed as I watched this film. Sometimes it's hard for us to understand why many homeless don't take advantage of the services available to them. I think this film shows that it's not always easy to get to those places, first of all, and even when you arrive, there is often mental illness that stops people from getting the help they need.I recommend this film. It's well worth a rental.",7,0,0,25 July 2009
The Island," Everyone Wants to Go to the Island
","No, they haven't made Lost: The Movie yet. The Island is a part sci-fi thriller part chase movie part dark side of man type of movie. It stars Ewan McGregor in a role that reminds me of the movie that made him famous. No, I'm not talking about Moulin Rouge, but rather his role in Trainspotting. It's a deeper role than he usually plays these days. In this role he must play someone who is naive but at the same time curious and precocious. He is a person who is both lost and found, confident of himself and yet very afraid. Co-star Scarlett Johansson plays his soul mate and at the same time gets to make use of all the commercials she has starred in. Good job.Lincoln Six Echo is having nightmares. He is on a boat with a beautiful woman (Johansson, who plays Jordan Two Delta) and is about to join her at the helm, when he gets pushed off the boat and drowns. Other than that, he is doing well in his life. Like the rest of his neighbors, he wears only white, is on a strict diet, and has fun playing simulated Knockout with Jordan Two Delta, his lady friend. Other than the nightmares, his main problem is that he is so darn curious. His job by day is to put drops of food into little holes that go into tubes. Lincoln wants to know where the tubes go and gets a stern look.The ultimate dream of all of his friends and neighbors is to win the lottery and get chosen to go to the island, which is the only area that was not contaminated. It gives them hope and something to look forward to. Near the beginning of the film, Jordan gets chosen to go to the island. That night, Lincoln discovers what going to the island really means, and they escape from the only life they have known. This is where the film becomes more of a chase movie. It had some plot similarities to The Matrix with the emotional feel of Soylent Green.This was an enjoyable movie that gave me good entertainment for a couple hours. Like most science fiction, I spent the first half of it in a dazed state. Then when I saw what was behind the curtain, it was like an awakening. During this part, I stared at the screen and annoyed my boyfriend by saying, 'What's that? What IS that?' He didn't know either, but we figured it out eventually. In that way, I got the horror of discovering, along with Ewan and Scarlett, the truth about The Island.",8,1,2,21 January 2008
