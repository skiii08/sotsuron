The Incredible Hulk," a great remake of a great original
","after the original Hulk i was eager to see this one and just like the original i wasn't disappointed, filled with great performances from Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and the mesmerizing Tim Roth, the effects were to drool over, and they even had a cameo appearance by Lou Ferrigno, as well as Bruce Banner watching a old show starring Bill Bixby, this movie is definitely worth it in my book, and will always be found in my collection, this might is my second favorite marvel movie behind The Punisher and just ahead of Hulk, if you want great entertainment, you've got great entertainment, The Incredible Hulk is a blast from the groundbreaking beginning to the glued-to-your seat ending, i highly recommend this film.",10,2,3,19 June 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," a great adaptation of an excellent novel
","First off please note that I did see this movie before reading the book, but to better my opinion of this film I read the book!Now the book is kinda slow with not much action at all which as you can imagine really makes a movie adaptation hard to make exciting. So how did it do? Well the special effects were amazing, and the battle sequences were epic and breathtaking. Now for the actors: I enjoyed all of the side characters (Mr. Tumnus, The White Witch, The Beaver's, The Professor, and especially Aslan), the actors really did well there. As for the Pevensies; Skandar Keyes did excellent as Edmund, he really portrayed him greatly, Georgie Henley did get slightly tedious but she did well as Lucy, William Moseley wasn't so great as Peter, he was overly cocky, and was reworded when he din't seem fit for rewards, Anna Popplewell was really annoying as Susan, though that is her character somewhat, she still over did it.The movie really is amazing and jaw-dropping, definitely see it!",10,0,0,5 July 2011
Batman Returns," An equally great sequel!
","I came across this movie with its predecessor at the store and i just had to buy them, i watched them both being left unable to pick a favorite batman movie, Michael Keaton returns just as good as he was in the first one, Danny Devito sets the bar high for Batman villains by playing such a disgustingly hilareous character, Michelle Pfeiffer was awesome as the catwoman, with Christopher Walken playing her nemesis powerfully, and don't forget Michael Gough as the memorable Alfred, really the only thing i wasn't impressed with was all the weird innuendos, it got a bit awkward. I recommend this film to lovers of the predecessor.i give this film 9/10 *'s for being equally great.",10,6,12,6 July 2010
Orphan," really surprising
","after seeing the previews for this movie i thought that i it looked really interesting, i really wanted to check this movie out in theaters but it sort of went quickly, but then i saw it was at my local dollar theater which doesn't get movies until there on DVD.i decided to watch it there, i was expecting another 'THE GOOD SON' just with a girl instead of a boy, what i got was something different.this movie was much more intense, and a lot less predictable.the acting was outstanding, Vera Farmiga was very convincing, as was Peter Saarsgard, our demonic star Isabelle Fuhrman was horribly frightening, Jimmy Bennett was great, as was CCH Pounder in her small role.this move is not really a fast paced movie but more of a disturbingly intense drama.the movie was definitely not what i expected but it was worth the time to watch.and thats why i give ORPHAN 8/10",8,2,3,2 August 2010
Final Destination 2," a fun gore movie
","After watching the first film i decided to give this movie a try.Just like the first one this movie wasn't scary, though unlike the first one this movie is actually a really fun gore ride.again the acting wasn't anything amazing, Ali Larter wasn't very convincing, AJ Cook i thought lead the cast better then Devon Sawa in the first, Michael Landes was really monotone, Tony Todd did really good again though, and the rest of the cast i thought were actually more convincing then the leads.It wasn't a blockbuster but it was really fun to watch, and it was pretty gory, which doesn't really add much except for making the death scenes more fun to watch.its a pretty mediocre movie just like the first one but its well worth a watch.and thats why i give FINAL DESTINATION 2 8/10",8,2,2,23 August 2010
Tangled," A masterpiece! My personal favorite princess movie!
","Rapunzel has grown up secluded in her tower never aloud to leave, but on her birthday there's a huge lantern festival, she wants more then anything to see them and goes on an adventure.Tangled didn't look that good to me from the previews but once I finally watched it I was blown away.As usual Disney creates amazing songs to accompany their stories. The actors lending their voices all did amazing especially when singing!It doesn't matter your age or gender this movie is a must see. Great humor! Lovable characters! and some of the most beautiful images in any movie in recent memory!Simply a masterpiece!",10,18,21,22 February 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Surprisingly Good!
","I've never read any of Captain America's comics nor have been a fan of the character.That being said I really enjoyed this movie.Chris Evans did good as Captain America, and Hugo Weaving was a fantastic Red Skull. It was cool seeing Tommy Lee Jones, as well as being introduced to Howard Stark played by Dominic Cooper. Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones also are great in their roles.Though this is kinda slow in the beginning, but it picks up well. The action wasn't anything We haven't already seen, but I love the feel of it, it really feels like its taking place in WWII.The only thing I didn't like about it was the female love interest, because She was unneeded. However the actress is pretty good.Joe Johnston, congrats! You made in My opinion, the best superhero movie of 2011! (closely followed by X-men First Class)",10,2,3,22 January 2012
Watchmen," amazingly done from the edge-of-your-seat beginning to the groundbreaking end
","the first time i saw the trailer for this movie i was mesmerized, i'd never even heard of the graphic novel let alone read it, i still haven't read it but i think that the movie was excellent from start to finish, the story and script were so well written and the actors delivered perfectly, the special effects were to drool over, and the action was no-holds-barred, the movie was slow at times but you never want nothing but violence, it seemed like every scene was important some how, and most importantly it kept your interest, you watch spider-man and daredevil and they fought the bad guys just like you want to see, but the watchmen had no mercy, some might say that Rorshach and the Comedian were sadistic but i think that every thing they did just added to there character and every scene whether it be a sex scene or a violent scene graphic as it may be was another great addition to the characters, the actors turned in a great performance in what is possibly the best movie based on a graphic novel, so thats why i gave it a 10/10",10,3,7,19 June 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," a great horror film.
","i came across this movie and thought 'i wonder what its like.' i had actually heard quite a bit of criticism about how this movie is just gonna be a gore fest, but it wasn't.the story is actually very realistic, and the acting was very believable, Aaron Stanford did extremely well leading our cast, Dan Byrd and Emilie De Ravin do really good in there roles, Robert Joy does sadistically good in this film, also Vinessa Shaw, Kathleen Quinlan, and Ted Levine do convincingly well for there small roles.this movie brings a feeling of hopelessness that makes it feel more scary and intense, this may not be a good movie for you to watch if your squeamish but all in all this is an excellent horror film.and thats why i give THE HILLS HAVE EYES 8/10!",10,0,1,1 August 2010
The Lego Movie," A few good humorous moments lead up to a very heartfelt message.
","I didn't think this looked that good based on the previews, but I decided to give it a shot.Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) steals the show, creating some good laughs, but over all I thought it was actually a little slow in the beginning, once Batman (Will Arnett) & Benny (Charlie Day) are introduced it gets funnier, but it really only had a few funny moments.Fortunately nearing the end a surprising twist happened that carried this film to it's brilliant message, ending on a great note.I didn't feel the vocals of the leads (Chris Pratt & Elizabeth Banks) were anything special nor did their characters bring much humor. Morgan Freeman's character had a bit more humor to him and he was an all around more likable character. Will Ferrell is surprisingly great.By the end I felt it was well worth the watch, I don't know if I'd place it in the top 250 but it's a very well done movie that doesn't disappoint.",7,0,2,21 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Horribly overrated extremely flawed film. I don't recommend it.
","In the future Sentinels are hunting and killing mutants, in an attempt to save mutantkind Wolverine is sent back to the past to change the future.Movies that take on time travel take a huge risk, it generally makes for a flawed film. After seeing several good reviews about X-men: Days of Future Past I hoped it would be good. Nope.First off the explanation for time traveling is just a cheap mutant ability to keep fans from questioning it. They also use the same excuse to exclude the butterfly effect from occurring.Secondly the current timeline that is supposed fix all connection problems from the original trilogy to X-men: First Class is so horribly flawed I truly don't understand how fans can stick up for this nonsense.The action scenes were mediocre, nothing amazing. The acting, uninteresting. They have great talent like Peter Dinklage and Evan Peters and make them look like they're B-list forgettable actors. Its really sad.This movie is so horribly overrated by fanboys that it currently resides on the IMDb's top 250 list. Its rated higher then classic films like the original Planet of the Apes and Arsenic and Old Lace.This is dumb filmmaking for audiences who want to watch loads of special effects and lame but good looking actors. Wanna watch a new action film with good characters and emotions? Try Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. A film with logic.",1,14,23,14 November 2014
Saw III," even better then the last one
","after watching the the first two i decided that i really want to see all of the SAW movies.this one one turned out to be possibly the most disgusting, and painful one.the acting was still good, especially from Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, Angus Macfadyen did good as well, as did Bahar Soomekh, and Dina Meyer did good as well.i really love the music that plays while everything unfolds at the end.though this movie is more disgusting it has a better story then the last movie did.if your a fan of the last two movies then you'll definitely love this one.and thats why i give SAW III 9/10",9,0,1,2 August 2010
Alien vs. Predator," i give this movie a 1/10 because i cant give it any less
","when i heard that this movie was rated PG-13 i was so disappointed, i was hoping for another R rated action film, with gore, and everything but this movie was just horrible, the acting sucked, the story sucked, the effects were good but that was probably the only good thing about it, i mean the predators seemed so dumb, while the aliens seemed so weak, i know people who like this movie and i just cant understand why, i mean if your going to make an alien vs. predator movie at least make it rated R, the movie wasn't even exciting, it would have some violent moments every once in a while, but it was stupid and predictable, i want my 2 hours back because that was a waist of my time, i don't recommend this movie to anyone, especially not a die hard alien or predator fan.",1,1,4,19 June 2009
Batman Begins," Great!
","when i heard that they where rebooting Batman i was excited to see what it would be like, Christain Bale was awesome, Liam Neeson was fantastic, Katy Holmes was Great, Michael Caine was outstanding for what all he was in it, as was Morgan Freeman, Ken Watanabe was greatly menacing for the little bit he was in, and Cillian Murphy was epically villainous, even Rutger Hauer stood out as an annoyingly mean guy, the only thing i didn't enjoy about this was how overly serious it was, its 140 mins. and almost all un comically. I recommend this film to lovers of intense action, and tales of heroism.I give this film 9/10 *'s because it rocks.",10,0,0,6 July 2010
Twilight," romantic nothing more nothing less
","well first of all i haven't read the book but i thought that this was a very slow movie, the acting was fantastic and romance brewed but the vampiranism was lost, the movie is supposed to be about a vampire and a mortal falling in love, but the movie seemed more like a movie about two high schoolers falling in love just with a little more power, the movie was not at all what i expected and i was severely disappointed, though Kristen Stewart, and Robert Pattonsen were spectacular they just weren't given enough too work with and it was a utter failure, so after summarizing the great acting with the slow blah script i have come up with a rating of 4/10 (though i still want to read the book)",4,1,4,19 June 2009
Non-Stop," Entertaining, But nothing amazing.
","Liam Neeson plays an air marshal who receives texts threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes if $150 mil isn't transferred.Non-stop has plenty of action sequences, a good mystery that will keep you guessing (or at least doubting yourself), and a few funny moments as well.That being said there are a few plot holes, the film has a lot of coincidences, but all in all it's thoroughly enjoyable.The acting is good all around though nobody really stood out.It's nowhere near Taken or The Grey but Non-stop manages to keep us entertained.Well worth the watch!",7,1,8,1 March 2014
Frozen," Disney makes yet another masterpiece!
","Sisters Anna & Elsa have grown up separated all their lives, Elsa takes off for the mountains so Anna goes after her, of course discovering love along the way.The people at Disney should be commended just for song writing ability, nearly every song in this movie is fantastic.The actors lending their voices are fantastic! Especially at singing!My only qualm is that the story was quite predictable. I understand it's hard to be original over and over again, but Disney had an original idea with this movie, they just used their originality in the first half hour and then got predictable.Still what they was amazing, Frozen should not be missed no matter your age or gender.",6,3,7,22 February 2014
Transformers," if you don't like this movie, you should check your pulse
","well first of all, i have always been a big fan of the transformers, and i was dying to see this movie when it came out, i was expecting a great action movie and what i got was, great action, great humor, great acting, great effects, great story, and great all-out movie making, i don't see how anyone could be disappointed by this movie it was just GREAT! my recommendation is to see it, Shia LaBeouf is excellent as well as Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Jon Voight, Anthgony Anderson, and John Turturro, it was just excellent in every way you can think of, this movie is a 10/10 in my book, and will always be found in my collection.",10,3,4,19 June 2009
Big Hero 6," Fun filled adventure with great characters!
","Hiro discovers a robot named Baymax, there friendship grows as they're faced with the impending threat of a masked villain.Big Hero 6 has a lot to live up to due to it being made by Disney, this marks Disney's first animated film based on a Marvel comic.Personally I look forward more to films like this that aren't musical. Frozen had wonderful songs, but the characters weren't very likable and the story was predictable, it was just a weaker Disney film.While Big Hero 6 is a little predictable its made strong by the great characters and their respective story lines.As you may be able to tell from the trailers Baymax is a great hilarious character. He is what Olaf should have been.I don't want to go to into detail just know that this film is entertaining, you won't find it annoying or hard to watch. Its just a great ride from beginning to end showcasing Disney's great character development.",9,11,31,7 November 2014
Saw II," not as good as the first but still good
","after seeing the first one i couldn't wait to see this movie, though this movie isn't as good as the first one its still on its own.Tobin Bell was just as awesome as in the first one, Shawnee Smith exceeded my expectations, Donnie Wahlberg wasn't exactly award winning but he wasn't necessarily bad either, Erik Knudsen was pretty good as well, also another notable actor is Franky G who meanly good.this movie wasn't as scary as the first but was more grisly which made it more disturbing, also i still love the unfolding music at the end.if your a fan of the first one then i recommend this movie to you, and thats why i give 8/10.",8,1,2,2 August 2010
The Dark Knight," Two thumbs up!
","Wow! i saw movie after hearing about Heath Ledgers sad death, man i wish he was still alive, he stole the show completely, he rocked as the Joker, Christain Bale was great though he was almost pushed as a secondary actor behind Heath, Gary oldman became a bigger character and really stood out as Commissioner Gordon, Aaron Eckhart co-starred as Harvey Dent, he did great through the two hours that he was normal, than after he was turned into Two-Face it seemed as though he was partially out of body, i was so mad to see that they replaced Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal, she did good as her own Rachel Dawes, but she just didn't match up to Katie Holmes' portrayal of Rachel. but still i thoroughly enjoy this film (mostly because of Heath Ledger) so i recommend this film to anyone who loved the predecessor.I give this film 8/10 *'s.",8,1,7,6 July 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Disappointing!
","I've always been a fan of Tim Burton's so I was really looking forward to this movie. In the end I was disappointed.What I liked: The special effects were amazing! The acting is good all around. The score is nice.What I didn't like: The lack of action, it could have been so much better with more creature's. The lack of direction, Alice didn't seem to know What she was doing at all.In the end it's done beautifully but it's just so slow and boring that it's hard to really like.Johnny Depp isn't anywhere near as amazing an actor as he was ten years ago. Helena Bonham Carter is a good actress but she wasn't given much here. Anne Hathaway does good with what she's given but thats not much. Mia Wasikowska does good but it seems like she isn't given any direction at all. Crispin Glover does good but he doesn't have much of a character. All of the voice overs stole the show. Like Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen, Stephen Fry, and Christopher Lee.If you love fantasy give it a shot.",6,0,2,12 July 2011
Saw," possibly my favorite movie ever
","wow i had heard a lot about this movie so finally decided to go out and get this movie.i expected it to be really grisly and disturbing, it turned out to be that its much more of a mysteriously thrilling horror that keeps you guessing until the end.Cary Elwes whom has been one of my favorite actors since 'THE PRINCESS BRIDE' turned out to be a great choice in this movie, as did writer/producer/actor Leigh Whannell, Tobin Bell is just flat out awesome, and Danny Glover is very convincing.the idea of this movie is a very unsettling one that could be very real which is why this movie is so scary, also i love the music that they have playing at the end while everything is unfolding.so all in all i cant think of anything that i didn't like about this movie and thats why i give SAW 10/10",10,0,1,2 August 2010
From Hell," magnificent, wonderful, amazing, astonishing, groundbreaking, 10/10
","i gave this movie a 10/10 because i watched this movie captivated from star to finish, Johnny Depp as always was fantastic, and Heather Graham was magic, one of the best things about this movie was that it's all possible to have happened in real life, i think this is the best crime drama/thriller that i've ever seen, mainly because its so well made, watching it seemed like it was real, this is a truly great movie, now i've also never read the graphic novel, but i wasn't confused or lost for a second, if you want a good crime thriller 'from hell' is the movie for you, this is a truly entertaining movie thats well worth watching, if you see this movie at the store don't pass up the chance to watch it.",10,0,1,29 June 2009
Thor," pretty disappointing.
","First of all, I've never read the Thor comics. That being said I thought this movie started out really well, lots of good action and effects. Then Thor is sent to Earth, from there it just gets terrible.Chris Hemsworth is okay as Thor, one of the biggest problems was actually Natalie Portman's character. I like Her as an actress, but She felt unneeded and forced.The action gets a lot more boring from then on. I thought Tom Hiddleton acted well but the character of Loki was cast incorrectly.Also there was quite a bit of unneeded humor, but probably the biggest problem was that We get no reason to root for Thor.Sorry Kenneth Brannagh, I don't think Your a very gifted director.",1,1,4,22 January 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," extremely good movie that everyone should see at least once
","this movie is possibly the greatest movie i've ever seen, it had great action, excitement, and marvelous special effects, the story is way better then expected, and it was even hilarious, if a movie can do all this then you know its great, Shia LaBeouf has never disappointed me, and neither has Megan Fox, Micheal Bay has proved yet again that he could quite possibly be the best movie maker ever, i just don't understand how this movie got so many bad reviews, its marvelously entertaining, i would say that this movie outmatched its predecessor by a mile, i give this movie a 10/10 because i cant give it anything higher, when this movie is released on DVD i will buy it and it will always be found in my collection.",10,1,5,29 June 2009
The Witch," A horror film that's worthy of appealing to critics.
","One definition of the word 'Horror' is 'Intense Repugnance' this film is a perfect example.The Witch follows a family that's being torn apart by the acts of a witch. This film doesn't have jump scares, nor lame cgi driven action. It instead focuses on its story.The performances are brilliant. Everyone was FANTASTIC! This movie just looks brilliant. So many shots look like they could be genuine works of art.I'm not going to go on about being a cinephile though. Because this movie can really appeal to all. The great dialogue and chilling audio leave you feeling perpetually chilled. You can't sit comfortably watching this.There are several shots that are quite disturbing but they aren't overly gory or torturous. We don't get to see the Witch in the film very much but when we do its awesome and unforgettable.I just can't recommend this movie enough!",10,5,11,20 February 2016
Man on Fire," zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz! wait what is it over?
","Denzel Washington is a good tough actor, but he just couldn't hold it together, Dakota Fanning was so annoying too me as she is in many of her movies (example: war of the worlds, hide n' seek, charlettes web, etc...) and the movie is so slow that i was bored waiting for something big too happen it was just one guy getting killed after another as Denzel searched for Dakota and it was so easily predictable, and the way Dakota's parents are so protective having too get her a bodyguard just reminds me how i loathe rich people and there snobby shrewdness, i felt like i was watching a movie about two rich people forcing one man to give up everything he hed to get back there snobby, bratty, little demon uugh! so i gave it a 3/10 just because of Denzels performance",3,1,4,19 June 2009
Scream 2," The Best Horror Sequel Ever?
","I didn't know what to expect going into this, but I loved it!I don't recall ever seeing a better horror sequel! (Except.. Maybe Wes Craven's New nightmare.)Kevin Williamson returns to write this amazing slasher flick!And all the actors did great as well! Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Liev schreiber, Jamie Kennedy, Jerry O'connell, Timothy Olyphant, Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett, and Sarah michelle Gellar all do great!If you loved the predecessor then you'll love this one too!The only reason I give it 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because it's a lot less unforgettable then it's predecessor.",9,0,1,13 July 2011
Scream," An Instant Horror Classic!
","It's the birth of the serial killer known only as 'Ghost Face!'Wes Craven directs this rarity of a slasher flick thats written to perfection by Kevin Williamson.The actors all do great! Neve Campbell is perfect as Sydney Prescott, as is David Arquette as Deputy Dewey, Courtney Cox does good as Gail Weathers, Not to mention Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose Mcgowan, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Barrymore, and even Henry Winkler!It keeps you guessing all the way till the end! It's easily one of the best horror movies!Any fan of slasher and serial killer movies will love this one!",10,13,15,13 July 2011
Halloween," a great film for the time it came out
","when this movie came out it was said to be the first slasher flick that would eventually inspire Friday the 13th, and a nightmare on elm street as well as many others, but really compared to nowadays standards this is a psychological thriller with no scares at all, the movie was a slow eary thriller, in fact only five people die in the whole movie, the only reason i think this is amazing is because of how well it was made on such a low budget, the acting is great, the music is fantastic, the only thing keeping this movie from being a phenomenal movie forever, is the weak, unrealistic storyline, i give this movie 7 *,s only because of how well it was made",10,1,4,15 February 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Magnificent!
","I've heard quite a few people doubting this movie would be anywhere near as good as either of its predecessors. But in my opinion they were wrong.Similarly to The Dark Knight, there actually several scenes excluding Batman, but unlike TDK, The Dark Knight Rises is actually about Batman. Christian Bale is awesome yet again as are Michael Caine (who has much more emotion in this one), Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles. Tom Hardy plays Bane brilliantly, He's dark and sinister like The Joker, though more masculine of course, he doesn't have that comedic feel to him like Joker did, but he still has quite a few awesome lines. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was perfect in this movie, as was Marion Cotillard. Anne Hathaway brought humor whether you wanted it or not, but I thought she was a fantastic Catwoman.The thing I loved the most about TDKR is how well it was written, its a perfect sequel to both its predecessors, I was worried that the end would be sad and disappointing, but it wasn't, it was done just right.There'll always be people disappointed by any movie. But I find The Dark Knight Rises to be a brilliant ending to an epic masterpiece of a trilogy.",10,4,11,21 July 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Nothing short of a masterpiece!
","Saving Mr. Banks is based on Walt Disney's struggle to achieve his 20 year long promise to his daughters to make Mary Poppins, meanwhile the writer Pamela Travers refused to give permission, all the while reflecting on her past.Tom Hanks brings Walt back to life in this film, he's mesmerizing. Emma Thompson is Travers and though she can be stubborn, she still brings magic to the screen. Colin Farrel, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzmen and many other great actors and actresses give amazing performances as well.Emoeions run high in this dramedy that's quite funny at parts while keeping its fantastic, dramatic and inspiring story flowing.While this movie has a few PG-13 elements its still a must see for everyone!While there are some differences from this and the real events, they do so to give us more brilliant dialogue and acting.Don't pass up this masterpiece! Two thumbs up!",10,0,1,29 March 2014
Final Destination," a pretty good thriller
","I remember when this movie came out and i really wanted to see it but i didn't get the chance to, recently i saw the DVD and decided to get it.It wasn't scary but more of a thriller then a horror.I was slightly disappointed by the acting actually, Devon Sawa didn't appear to be ready to lead a cast, Ali Larter wasn't very convincing, I thought Kerr Smith actually was good, as was Sean William Scott, and Tony Todd was eerie and good too.Its not an award winner but its still a pretty good movie. It didn't really bring any surprises but it was still good, and the story was actually pretty good though unrealisticAnd thats why i give FINAL DESTINATION 8/10",8,1,1,23 August 2010
Godzilla," The juxtaposition of fantastic acting and jaw-dropping effects makes a masterpiece!
","Godzilla tells the story of how us human beings in our ignorance try to contain a couple of unidentified creatures, they break out and begin wreaking havoc, Godzilla is awoken and he's not happy.Aaron Taylor-Johnson leads the cast, he gives the best performance in his career, Ken Watanabe and Elizabeth Olsen play second string but they show so much in their facial expressions and in the way they deliver lines its quite amazing, Bryan Cranston has a surprisingly small role, but he gives an emotional unforgettable performance.The effects are the most amazing I've ever seen, what I love is how the violence is not overwhelming, there are a lot of brilliant subtle shots of the creatures.The negativity this film is getting is due to Godzilla not having much screen time, but their wrong, given his fight sequences are held back till the end, but that's alright, remember this is a remake of the classic Gojira, Godzilla gets much more screen time here then he did in the original.This film takes itself seriously, and that's a rare pleasure in action films nowadays, this is not a Marvel superhero film or a Michael Bay film, this is an intense emotional realistic military based film.Even though Godzilla feels like a supporting character, when you see him its jaw-dropping and unforgettable. An action film for the ages! An absolute must-see! :)",10,15,31,16 May 2014
Deadpool," Good, but not without its flaws
","Wade AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) tells the story of how he was subjected to painful experiments, now with mutant abilities he seeks revenge.Deadpool is a superhero movie unlike anything before it. First off it's extremely R-rated. Second throughout the film the main is constantly braking the fourth wall, not mention there are some great jokes about the studio.Deadpool has LOTS of comedy, but with comedy being very subjective I personally felt this movie was very hit-and-miss, though when it hit it was hysterical.Next the story, its nothing outstanding, a simple predictable revenge story, the villain is really nothing special.Last the action, it wasn't as awesome and exciting as I was hoping, there was an overuse of CGI, given some scenes required it, but still, it feels faker looking then other CGI heavy films I've seen. Early on there are some pretty crazy action scenes, but the further the film goes the duller the action got.I personally feel this film was perhaps rushed? More time could've given them the chance to focus on crazier stunts and in the least a more balanced sense of humor.One last note, the one reason Deadpool actually didn't meet my expectations was that I kept hearing how this film was setting the new standard for R-rated films. I don't know what those people mean, I've seen movies push the envelope way more.In conclusion its worth a laugh, but don't expect anything Oscar-worthy.",7,19,48,14 February 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Pretty good, but still the worst of the series.
","Let me start with the good.The 3D was amazing. The action was intense. The special effects were jaw-dropping. The acting was good all around (with the exception of Rosie Huntington-Whitely) And the story was actually quite interesting.Now for the bad.Some extremely tedious moments. less actual 'fun' (especially lacking in laughs) The crappy excuse for Mikaela not being there. Replacing Megan Fox with Rosie (she didn't do bad but she was utterly emotionless) And the killing of a few characters. (not to mention the brutality of some of it)Die hard fans like me will still enjoy it and buy it on DVD but it probably wont be so well excepted by others. there's also a lacking of likability, characters that i loved in the past two were less awesome.In closing it's a great action flick with non-stop mayhem (mostly in the second half), and if that's your cup of tea then you'll enjoy it, but it isn't a mind blowing classic or anything.",6,1,4,3 July 2011
