Whip It," Usually...
","...movies don't get better as they move along, but here's one that really flowers in the second half. The first half is rickety and blunt. But as these very strong performers (particularly the supporting ones) garner more time on the screen, the more you fall for them.Ellen Page is a little too winsome for my tastes. She's beautiful and brings a persona that's fresh to the screen, but I always feel like her performances are rehearsals and she needs one more take to nail it.But once the second half of the movie arrives (after a party where she connects with a guy), I really fell in love with Ellen Page. The film builds to a choice her character has to make, and while it's a little generous to think a young kid would make the choice she does, it's very heart-warming. Her scene with Marsha Gay Harden sitting in front of a refrigerator is one of the nicer pieces of acting this year. And all of that is boosted by a sensational performance by Daniel Stern as Page's Dad. He epitomizes great screen acting.The roller derby team which Page's character joins is likely the reason most of us bought a ticket to see this movie. It's an eclectic bunch and everyone fulfills what we like to think roller derby mama's might be like (always happy to see Zoe Bell doing ANYTHING on the screen). Unfortunately, Barrymore bit off a little more than she could chew in making the roller derby sequences coherent or exciting, and that drags the movie down. Even the crowd scenes feel hollow, and at least we can still look forward to that great roller derby movie in the future.But Barrymore does make the heart of this movie both touching and fresh. Since it's like a hundred movies we've probably seen, that's quite an accomplishment. We know where the movie is going, and Barrymore keeps steering just slightly off course so we don't anticipate too much. I look forward to a quieter, more intimate film from her, since I think that's where her talents really lie.Just to mention: We get to see a great deal of Juliette Lewis in full roller derby scowl. I couldn't wait for her character to reappear and each time she does, the movie lights up. More, more, more (please).",8,1,6,2 October 2009
Angels & Demons," Decent...well, not decent, but not bad, although....
","This is terribly silly material mounted as though it was a revelation from some high-browed expose of the Catholic Church, I guess. The Church's history is certainly full of colorful, tawdry, lurid stories that really don't need a layer of 'symbolology' veneered over it. There's very tight, well-directed movie making here, but it's all pretty silly when we're supposed to gasp that a statue's arrow is pointing in some direction to another statue that's pointing in another direction, and there's a big jug of anti-matter (science is poorly used here) boiling somewhere about to go off.Tom Hanks needs to write this one off. I think he's a rare talent, but intellectual posturing isn't encompassed in those talents. The rest of the cast (save Ewan McGregor who can't wait to pull out the stops and chew the marble pillars...he does...have patience, he does) is miles above the material, as is the director and everyone else involved.I won't say this is a good popcorn movie (like 'National Treasure' or 'The Mummy' installments which are really its companions) because it has pretensions far above that. Those aren't really made clear, but it's mounted like a million bucks, yet it's only drivel.Ron Brown's books are written like movie scripts. Too bad that Hollywood thought Brown had something serious to say. It's above anything in 'Star Trek'...and in fact there are comparisons. Perhaps Ron Howard should try his turn with the new cast of the Enterprise. That might produce a really fine blockbuster.",5,1,4,19 May 2009
Black Swan," This is pretty grand, Guignol
","Truthfully, if I had to sit through one more preview of the trailer of this film, I thought I was going to scream. Aronofsky is someone I just don't get, and the deluge of publicity for this film as well as all the award nominations made my heart sink that I would have to man-up and buy a ticket to see 'Black Swan.' The big surprise is this is the most coherent film Aronofsky has managed to make. And good for him! I could finally join the legions who applaud him. I was, however, reminded often of two Polanski films: 'Repulsion' and 'Rosemary's Baby.' But I won't begrudge the achievement. This is a rip roaring horror film on tippy toes.The heart of the film belongs to Natalie Portman. Just go ahead and give her all the awards. She's magnificent. But so are her costars, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder and the incredible Barbara Hershey. But to be honest, I couldn't wait for Mila Kunis to reappear in whatever scene was next, usually precluded with a slamming door; she's absolutely riveting.While the hook here is ballet (and it's all very well accomplished and convincing, which is admirable) this might as well have been a Freddy Krueger film. Quite a few scenes are (were) unwatchable. And the suspense/dread Aronofsky creates earns the price of admission.While I won't say it's the best film of the year, Ms. Portman elevates it to something near that. While it pawns itself off as a study of the stress put on performing artists, it's really just a good scary film. And it's a great job from everyone involved.",10,6,13,19 December 2010
Changeling," A surprising disappointment
","No one involved in this project has anything to prove. The assembling of such talent pretty much assures a positive outcome, yet, there's something missing here, and what's missing is crucial. The director focuses on the surfaces of this story and everything seems glazed and frozen. Particularly, Ms. Jolie who brought such passion to 'A Mighty Heart'; she never convinced me of the desperation a mother must have felt in this situation.But the real fault is in the screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski which has to incorporate some pretty sensational material that the viewer constantly wants to reject. At least 40 minutes of the entire running time of this film incorporates a second story that is absent in the previews. That story belongs in a genre of films like 'Se7en' or 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' While I'm a big fan of horror films, I was unprepared for where this story went. All the facts here are documented by court and police records, yet as presented it's too fantastical to believe. And given the care of the elements in art direction, it's easy for the viewer to remain focused, say, on how carefully Ms. Jolie's elaborate make-up is applied.Eastwood is capable of masterpieces. 'Million Dollar Baby' is a film that any director would have been proud to have his name on. Throughout his career he's been surrounded by the perverse and the extreme, and 'Changeling' seems only an excuse to wallow in the perverse and the extreme.It's too bad, because the material, in the right hands, would have been electrifying. This, however, is only tedious with a few sequences that show promise, then we get the death thoes of someone shoved in our face while Ms. Jolie stands and looks beautiful; and, we wonder what on earth the character must be thinking (and where on earth is the director besides fussing with some period detail).",6,6,16,8 November 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Edith Bunker takes a pill
","In fairness to the filmmaker and anyone who may be reading this, I viewed `Requiem for a Dream' in the same week I saw `Hannibal' and `Pollock.' Afterwards, I hurried over to a local cinema to see the sing-a-long version of `The Sound of Music' in an effort to balance things out, but the box office had posted a sign `SOLD OUT UNTIL END OF RUN. DON'T EVEN ASK!' I guess a lot of other people need a sugar `fix' as well.
When we meet the four central characters in `Requiem for a Dream,' they're already fatally damaged. Their `goals' aren't anything we're rooting for, and as they spiral predictably downward, we encounter very familiar material that's been covered in literature and moviemaking for years: drugs aren't safe (prescription and non), materialism corrupts, spiritual emptiness leads nowhere, diet fads are bad, it's pathetic to watch game shows, capitalism is inherently selfish, aging will leave you lonely, the mental health system is inadequate, always ask who's going to be at the orgy you've agreed to show up for, and rotate veins when you shoot upÂ…. You get the picture. It's not a pretty world out there. All of that is well and good if you have something new and bold to say. But I didn't come away with any new insights. [Well, that's not true. I learned never to let Louise Lasser color my hair or encourage an actor to vomit directly into the lens.]There is something striking about Aronofsky's command of the medium. Using visual and editing styles from music videos with some spectacular performances (Jennifer Connelly in particular) he's created an intense and powerful experience. But so is buying a ticket to have someone hammer a nail into your skull.",5,0,0,25 February 2001
The Hangover," The Unchecked Id
","Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper fall so perfectly into the circumstances of a night out without the wife/girlfriend—a bachelor party, no less—that we're all happy we're safe in the audience clucking our tongues but secretly envying every single moment (one that includes the ever watchable Heather Graham). These boys fall and fall hard, and trying to pick up the pieces of a night they strangely can't remember brought more laughs than the last time I laughed this consistently (that was 'There's Something About Mary').The cast never forgets that they are actors here and not on an episode of 'Jackass' as Apatow's comedies often feel. There's tight control on the dialog and we never descend into simple slapstick. Oh, there's broad humor, but we're watching terrific actors in very broad situations. The trailer is a perfect sample of what you're going to get, although it may veer into raunch perhaps a little more than the trailer hints. But it's never just sensationalism, because I can—regrettably, I confess—relate to waking up in a room with a chicken and not knowing exactly from whence it came.Galifiankis has the most unique character (well, besides a naked Chinese fellow, but you can discover that one for yourself) and he's wonderful to watch. Not everything he does comes off 100%, but when he scores, it's so far out from our own comfort zone, that when the jaws of the other characters drop, we're right there with them. Rachel Harris deserves special mention as the girlfriend who demonstrates why marriage can be so fearful.This is as tidy a script as 'My Best Friend's Wedding' and just as beautifully shot. The cinematography could be pulled from any of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce ads, and it only adds to our confidence that whatever is coming around the next corner, we don't have to worry that it will wreck all that's gone before. The makers of this little gem are as much in control as the characters are out of control, and it was joy to finally get a great farce that we're very sorry to see end. I see that 'Hangover, 2' is in development, and I hope lighting strikes twice.(The standard for wedding singer has been set. Anyone want to top this?)",10,150,293,6 June 2009
Star Trek," If this was a spoof....
","...and a 150,000,000 dollar spoof (!) maybe this could be called entertainment, but it only succeeds in a surface reference to the original cast and leaves the audience waiting for something interesting to happen.Instead, we get one of the least imaginative 'back stories' and an even lamer telling of those stories that have ever been mounted for a major motion picture.The cast is terrific, but they have nothing to do but try to hit a mark that some of the original actors did. Poor Leonard Nimoy is hauled out to mumble something or other about parallel universes which brings confusion to stupidity.The art direction and special effects are above average, but only that. They aren't used to awe or frighten; they're used as filler.Hopefully, someone will use this cast for something closer to what the original series did: Bring something thoughtful and interesting to consider, and have a clever way of telling that story. This wasn't that...by 150,000,000 whatever's...this wasn't that.",6,20,37,10 May 2009
Public Enemies," Hunter and Hunted
","The film's biggest hurdle is to distinguish itself from other genre pieces like 'Bonnie and Clyde,' 'The Untouchables,' even films like 'O, Brother, where art thou?' where some of the same characters that inhabit those films also inhabit 'Public Enemies.' Unfortunately, it fails at that, but there is much to admire.With a pedigree director, a distinguished (beyond belief) cast, and all the time it wants, various set pieces are riveting. Great care has been taken in developing a soundtrack that lets the audience discover what slugs of various weights of lead sound like when passing at high speed through various substances, like air, plaster, brick, stone, tree trunks, motor vehicles, etc. It's spellbinding and the sound crew should find awards at the end of the year.But what's missing most is form in the screenplay. It's not that there are too many characters that we have to sort through, there are too many that we have no idea of who they are or why we're watching them. In the cast, it's Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis who makes the most impression as a man who traditionally is the hero, and has to bring an era of crime—apparently single-handedly—to an end. But his methods are the first herald of modern day criminology, and it's fascinating to see early wiretaps and case development. Billy Crudup gives us a hint at what a full portrait of J. Edgar Hoover might be like (we're overdue for a full bio film on Hoover). And the amazing Marion Cottilard is always a rare and welcome presence, but the role created for her is too trite; nevertheless, she carries just about all the weight in her scenes with Depp.Johnny Depp has never been boring even if he misses the mark. But here he seems not to even be present. There's probably a reason we've never had a film about John Dillinger. While myth abounds, he was a brutal psychopath. The screenplay goes for the myth, and we're left feeling ambivalent about the people he hangs with, the choice of vocation he's made, and many people we see blown to smithereens in the course of the film all to bring him and his raiding to an end. He makes a distinction early in the film that he's not taking a customer's moneyjust the bank's. In today's perilous economic environment, it just doesn't play well.The film is fully scored using some music from the period, but nothing sounds like the period. That's at odds with the detailed art direction which appears both shabby (to reflect the world of the Great Depression) and extravagant in the use of cars and art nouveau architecture from the period.Any schoolboy (or possibly girl) knows the end of this story. So what the film needs to give us is some reason to care when that end comes. But I didn't. The shootout at Little Bohemia Lodge which is a prelude to 'the end' is exciting, but we don't know who the people are running around. 'Is it Dillinger?' Christian Bale asks. I shrugged, and muttered, 'Don't ask me.'",8,5,9,5 July 2009
Us," Great filmmaking...but the need to explain every little thing sinks it
","The quality of the production values and the cast get the highest praise.What begins has the quality of a different kind of horror film like 'Jaws' with vivid color and cinematography and a killer soundtrack plus some of the best actors working today. A disturbing prologue set in 1986 in one of the creepiest places on the planet (the Santa Cruz Boardwalk), we cut to the opening credits with the close-up of a caged rabbit and a gorgeous choral composition by Michael Abels that sets the audience on edge because we don't know where we are or what or why we're looking at it. (And for my money, there needs to be a whole lot more of me asking why, not the director/writer explaining it, taking the mystery and certainly the scare out of whole enterprise.)There's a remarkable affinity by this director to timing and editing that explains his superb use of music throughout the film. It's sensational. But again we don't need to understand the lyrics of 'I Got 5 on It' to enjoy it. And as the story unfolds, the more we're told...well, the more has to be explained. There was little need to have a title card about the 'underground tunnels' networking the U.S. Who cares? I started asking questions like 'So where do you shop for groceries?' or 'What's the bathroom situation?' since 'we're flesh and blood just like you'...well, not really.This is basically 'Night of the Living Dead' with some clever twists, but in Romero's film we're much too involved with survival than wanting explanations. Yet this cast is game and does well at sticking with what they're given to say and do. I finally just stopped listening to the dialog and watched the actors and 'performance art' set up around them. There's a solid sense of the conflict within family units that was the most enjoyable thing for me to watch. But ultimately, I was left unsatisfied and wanting the 'mystery' that is the heart of horror.",8,2,4,25 March 2019
127 Hours," An experience, near death
","The biggest hurdle anyone would face in putting this material on the screen is how to make it cinematic. Danny Boyle takes hold of the static and gives it such visual verve, you might recoil and dismiss it as grandstanding. But considering the alternatives, almost without our noticing, Boyle infuses life and its need to preserve itself to a situation that couldn't be more lifeless: a man's near death pinned under a rock in a dark canyonfor four days.We waste no time in getting to the dilemma, and after a stirring Koyaanisqatsi open credit sequence, we're there pinned down, and the 'action' begins. If you've ever seen any of the real footage Aron Ralston shot when he was actually trapped, it's impressive how Boyle recreates it but takes us inside the mind of a man who rationally looks at this situation and tries to keep hold of that matter-of-factness while slowly losing his mind. It's a superior feat by someone who is becoming one of our greatest directors (rather than simply a stylist), and the work James Franco contributes by transferring Ralston's epiphany and physical ordeal to the screen is equally amazing.Most anyone will know what happens before they see the film. But the emotional catharsis displayed here will surprise even the most cynical viewer.",10,0,2,26 November 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," Quite impressive
","I'm not a fan of this genre. I went solely on the strength of the trailer which tweaked my interest. I'll sit through most anything that has a giant tsunami. (What can I say?) But after seeing the film, which I thought was thrilling, I decided the negative reviewers were just a bunch of sour-pusses. The film is tightly paced, convincing in terms laid out in the film (those who criticize it's 'science' didn't seem to have the same problem when reviewing 'Independence Day'...someone explain that to me), a plot that sets up the sole reason we bought a ticket (to see impressive special effects...and these are stunning), and to have a good time.I worried that I'd seen the whole movie in the trailers, but there's a considerable wealth of images that are in store for the ticket holder. Particularly, images from the Space Station were stirring. And a sequence on a Russian tanker was surprisingly tense. The audience I saw the film with were quite sober. There wasn't laughter (laughter at) except during the times the film invites laughter to break the tension. There's a post-apocalyptic 9/11 burn to the film that isn't exploitive. But after learning that real disaster can happen in New York City, it's difficult to see even more, even though this is fantasy. So the film has an emotional depth that isn't necessarily earned. These are cartoon figures which the genre demands; otherwise we'd be thrown into the unbearable state that films like 'Testament' (1983) illicit. We're not in the theater for a lecture, any more than we 'learned' something about cloning from 'Jurassic Park' or life on other planets from 'Independence Day.' This film was as much fun and as visually important as the 'Jurassic Park' series, and I hope everyone will give it a go. (Environmentalists who are picketing the film need to direct their efforts toward Congressional leaders...not movie producers.)In my experience it far out paces 'Earthquake,' 'Poseidon Adventure,' and the leaden 'Towering Inferno.' I even think this is more successful (as a work of film art) than 'Independence Day' which was cloying in it's nationalism. Here, we're given a fairer portrait of our Washington leaders, and those who feel it's 'controversial' because it shows a 'strong' Vice President seem to be the same people who are complaining about the 'science.' If this film is meant to criticize any particular administration, it's a very lame jab. The Vice President in this movie is a stock character in these kinds of films. If you're offended you're being way too thin-skinned (or perhaps defensive). Have fun. Go see it. It's a great popular entertainment.",8,1,1,30 May 2004
Milk," A chronicle of history
","I had little expectations walking into this film. The trailer for this movie has appeared at almost every feature film I've seen for the last two months. But, the trailer is a facile example of this minutely detailed story of the rise of a leader and his martyrdom. While I'm familiar with the story from other sources (Shilts' 'The Mayor of Castro Street,' and the 1984 documentary 'The Times of Harvey Milk'), Gus Van Sant and his cast bring a new immediacy to this story.None involved in this project could have anticipated the political climate of the premiere of this film: Both the hope of the Obama Presidency and the propaganda that helped Proposition 8 win in California. It seems a perfect environment for this story to reach across America.The dignity with which all of this is told and acted is its success. At the same time, it doesn't shy away from the culture of the Castro. Perhaps the greatest compliment is the rendering of Dan White here. He is neither demonized nor excused.We also don't get a white-washed version of Harvey Milk. He's there on the screen with all his foibles and kinks. Although his humanism shines in Sean Penn's unsettlingly accurate portrayal. It was Milk's love of--and impatience with--the rest of us that makes him a legend. And that is center stage in this film.What Van Sant gives us is both humbling and an inspiration.",10,127,182,28 November 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hollywood trashes another talented director
","I liked the first 'Hellboy' and, of course, 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. No one can deny Guillermo del Toro has an exceptional visual imagination, but the script here is such a copy (that's a compliment) of the formula Peter Jackson used for the 'Ring Trilogy' that things quickly become, uh, stupid. It's baffling that any film critic would have seen this and not blasted it for it's lack of originality. I'm not sure del Toro can recoup from this, but hopefully he'll have made enough money that he can chose his own projects. This material needs jokes about Cuban cigars, the 'f' word, and Barry Manilow songs as much as the 'Ring Trilogy' did. Staggeringly dumb.",3,8,17,12 July 2008
Watchmen," Stink-oh
","Right now, the only graphic novel that's made it successfully to the screen--for me--is 'Road to Perdition.' 'Watchmen' has very little energy and that's reserved for the soundtrack. Visually, it's dull and cheesy with action sequences so derivative that they pass without notice.The plot is one of those things you do sitting around when you're stoned and you think it's all funny and relevant and really smart. The next morning, you replay the tape recorder and you wonder what you were thinking. Oh, you forgot, you were loaded.I sat there wondering, 'What the hell are these people talking about?' The make-up is so retrograde that I wondered why did they even bother to make someone 'kinda' look like Richard Nixon.Whatever this is, I wished I would have skipped it. Even the Imax format didn't jazz it up any.",4,2,6,9 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," May It Be
","I wasn't a big fan of Tolkien's work although I respected his achievement and scholarship (however tedious it might be to some of us). But to whomever gave this material to Mr. Jackson and permitted him to film it in the manner he has chosen and with the people he's employed, thank you.
I've seen many films in my 54 years, and this one brought surprise and wonderment with each and every moment. Congratulations to all involved.
I was familiar with Enya's song prior to seeing the film (an experience enhanced by seeing it in an Imax theater, if you have the opportunity to see it projected that large, it's worth any effort), but by the time the song was sung after the last images of the horizon stretching before the characters and the audience, I was as emotionally overwhelmed as I've ever been by a work of art. This movie is easily worthy of garnering 'the best' of the year, and it's been a particularly great year for film and a sobering year on the home front. But, I would advise parents to use restraint in sending their children to this movie. If they aren't old enough to read the books, then they should probably skip the film.",10,0,0,21 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," On the outside, looking in.
","The Harry Potter phenomenon has been all around me. I've seen each of the films and made a stab at the first book, but after a few pages, I wasn't interested in reading further. Yet, the spectacle (and considerable hype) surrounding the films has always been a draw. But to say I have any emotional investment (or even curiosity) in the story couldn't be further from the truth.Action films, particularly those with elaborate CGI content, can keep me interested. Only a few of the Harry Potter films were truly a disappointment, so walking into the 'Deadly Hallows,' I was only there for the show. My companion, however, had seen none of the previous ones nor was he familiar with the books/story, and from his reaction ('And just where did they get the shovel?') I'd suggest if you don't know anything about Harry Potter, you'll belost.As the actors have aged, each episode has brought a more serious tone. While much of the art direction is self-referenced from the previous films, there's something claustrophobic in 'Deadly Hallows.' There's a sense of impending doom that is very well-done. In most 'chase' films, the characters have a chance to rest or hide and plan their next move. Not here. Danger lurks at every turn and in every shadow. That is very well reflected by the young actors, and the sense of weariness and defeat is somehow beautifully realized by the technical crew. (For instance, a short animated film is used to illustrate a key mystery, and it's stunningly beautiful and frightening as welllike a nightmare Tim Burton would have.) And in fact, this film points towards a deepening realization that evil is not just something in a children's fairy tale, but can take over the world at a moment's notice. And whether the forces of good will be able to win in the battle that's ahead, is a lesson not just for children or adolescents.",8,0,1,21 November 2010
The White Ribbon," A cold kettle of fish
","This austere, ravishingly beautiful film by Michael Haneke ostensibly concerns itself with the German mystique that led to their involvement in two World Wars. It may well be that, but what Haneke accomplishes is nothing less than exploring the nature of evil itself that emerges from cruelty, forced servitude (in many forms), empty dogma and the corruption of innocence (that white ribbon that symbolizes innocence in the title of the film and is physically manifest as a real ribbon worn on the arms of children who would—in 20 years--replace those ribbons with swastika's).Universal in its scope it may well attain 'masterpiece' status even as we watch. While the performances in this film are impeccable, it's the filmmaker's realization of what he's putting before us with such confidence and beauty that overwhelms. I won't pretend this is a movie for everyone since the subject matter alone will alienate many and the resolution leaves all that we've seen open. But isn't that true in life? The most horrible crimes are never completely understood even with intense study. How much has been written about the Holocaust and we still grapple with it even being possible. Haneke lays before us the origin of such evil, but we still find it hard to understand those who act it out.This is one of the few films that the subtitles spoil compositions on the screen. I hope the DVD edition places the titles off the frame. Great technical devices draw us into a world that is only half seen. The camera will fix on a physical composition and the action will take place off screen or half-hidden by some architectural feature, for instance a brutal corporal punishment occurs after we watch a child fetch the cane and disappear behind a closed dooronly the sounds of lashing and cries of pain are what we hear. Over and over, this technique is employed and rather than frustrating us from actually witnessing the horror of very cruel acts, we only imagine them and it unsettles us more. Walking out of the theater most of the audience was silent, but I heard one fellow whistle and exclaim, 'Boy, that's a tough one!' Yes, tough and beautifully made and hard to shake off. But undeniably a rare achievement in the cinema.",10,5,15,16 January 2010
Quantum of Solace," Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound...
","This was not only a different kind of James Bond film but a different kind of action film as well. Trimmed of any fat--so much so we get the equivalent of 'key' frames in the action, skipping as much exposition as possible--this thing runs like a well tuned sports car. Things move so quickly that the viewer has to work to keep up with what's happening. Through imaginative use of sound the startlingly beautiful cinematography (the opening car chase, an amazing edit on the Palio di Siena, a shoot out where we hear only Puccini's Tosca on the track), my interest never wavered as it did during the conclusion of the previous Casino Royale.There is no attempt to recap what happens in the previous film. The action picks up where it left off in Casino Royale. You might be at a disadvantage if you aren't familiar with that film. Still the action sequences here top anything before in Casino Royale. A chase through a construction site and bell tower was so imaginative that it could stand alone as a short film.Mark Forster's 'Quantum of Solace' up's the ante for the next installment. So much of the 'cheese' has been omitted from the Bond series (which was fun but sadly predictable and often silly) now that we're working in a realm of thriller rather than espionage drag. Something now actually seems to be at stake for James Bond rather than a reputation as a lothario and a wag.The complaint that Bond's vengeance is a bitter pill is not without relevance in today's world. How the character emerges at the end elevates the material far more than anything we've seen in the franchise. As a nod to its forbearer's the opening title sequence is elaborate and references the climax of the film. As always, it was a dazzling display of graphic arts. I hope the trend to revise the Bond series continues. This was one of the big surprises for me at the movies this year. I could watch it again in an instant.",10,3,10,19 November 2008
Mamma Mia!," Take a chance
","Let me get a few things out of the way: Generally, I don't like musicals, I seriously never liked ABBA (seriously), you couldn't have dragged me to the stage play, and I'd crawl on my knees anywhere to see Meryl Streep....That aside, I found this a nice surprise. While it's a questionable goal to put Abba songs in some kind of context(they never had a context even when they were first released), there's a plot that isn't jammed to fit the songs (a la 'Across the Universe'), and some genuine talent--and fun--is on display.The setting steals the show. You could turn the sound off and still be rewarded with gorgeous cinematography of no less than the Greek Isles. Ann Roth's costumes fit right in to the setting and the musical numbers are staged without seeming to take us out of the action. Twyla Tharp first succeeded with this kind of thing in the film of 'Hair,' and it's pleasant to see these people not try to knock us out with extravagant choreography.As well, the performances are very winning. I'll skip raving about Streep since she can do no wrong in my opinion (she IS Aphrodite). Colin Firth is game for what could be a weak role, and Amanda Seyfried rivals the scenery here, carrying the movie with her acting and singing.She's just lovely.Pierce Brosnan doesn't belong in the cast. It would be interesting to know how--and why--he's here. I would have preferred his singing be dubbed, but when he's not singing, he's always easy on the eyes.I almost missed going to see this, but I wanted something to shake off the dark of 'The Dark KNight.' This did it. And just when am I moving to Greece? Soon, I hope.",8,1,3,21 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Astonishingly beautiful, bluntly original...a masterpiece
","It's been a great year for films, and right now, this one is my favorite. I went without knowing the source material, and had only read some reviews which were mixed. I expected a pretentious mess, but instead was enthralled. I haven't seen a film that was as original as this one, that is, it references no other. Comparing it to the work of Terrence Malick is only valid because he's another unique director (who included fields of waving wheat). This has a potent narrative pull.I don't remember seeing a film that fuses images, acting, music, meticulous period detail in its art direction and mood so seamlessly. Despite claims that it's overlong, each scene--all unexpected--moves the action forward. The title tells us what's going to happen. We're left to see why...and when. So there's incredible tension leading up to the killing. While all the performers are extraordinary, Casey Affleck dominates this group of psychopaths so successfully that everyone else looks quite normal (he out Norman's Norman Bates). His very complex character is so thoroughly laid out before us that the aftermath of his notorious act disappoints us as much as it did Robert Ford.Because this film is so frankly original, I think people might resist it. But if you buy your ticket without expectation (this is not a Western; it's a psychological exploration of a wide range of deviants), you're in for an astonishing experience.",10,4,10,7 October 2007
Revolutionary Road," A reluctant Stepford wife
","There is something missing in Sam Mendes' adaptation of the Yates' novel, 'Revolutionary Road.' I fault specifically the screenplay which is heavy on explanatory dialog. The characters are trying to explain to one another what's wrong, while the audience is way ahead. We see the problem, and then a secondary character comes in later and spells it out even more clearly..The over enunciation of every word by both the leads is also peculiar. This sounds like a stage play that the two actors have over-rehearsed. And we're given all the 'high points' of their arguments with little understanding of why they are drawn to one another or why one or the other just doesn't leave.If we're supposed to condemn the 'system' that has put them on Revolutionary Road, that has been left out. Their personal problems seem much deeper than whatever rat race a capitalistic society has trapped them in. I felt like any place they were headed, they'd be just as unhappy. Their lack of fulfillment doesn't much matter since we don't see that there's much potential anywhere. Particularly in Mr. DiCaprio's character who is a liar, hates and uses just about everyone around him, and then bullies his wife into being whatever he'd like. It's a particularly unpleasant performance by a usually gifted and affecting actor.Ms. Winslet comes off somewhat more sympathetic, but the constant baiting of her husband in most of the fighting grows tiresome. My favorite moment (and it's a nicely held one by the director) occurs at a roadhouse when Ms. Winslet cuts lose on the dance floor and becomes reckless and seductive. It's a terrific moment for the actress and for the audience.I won't go into the plot since it would spoil what little there is, but the subject matter hinges on a lighting rod in today's political climate, and it's treated without much sensitivity.Even the composer, Thomas Newman, who did so much for Mr. Mendes in 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' (two of my favorite films) seems repetitious and glib. Kathy Bates, however, really perks things up in her scenes showing even playing a one dimensional character can still be both artful and entertaining.",7,3,7,2 January 2009
City of God," What? Wretched are the poor?
","You wouldn't think anyone would get away with exploiting the suffering of children. Here it is bordering on the obscene. No one would question Fernando Meirelles' talent. He seems to have an abundance of it. So much that it gets in the way of his subject. Over and over we get, 'Watch what I can do with a camera or in the editing room!' It's exhausting.
Through the blur we see the most deprived behavior that we're only invited to laugh at, wince over or look away from. I felt like I was watching some film student's final project where literally every trick in the book was dumped on the screen...albeit a very talented film student.",5,4,22,3 February 2003
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Well....
","This is a film that you'll either love or hate...or simply shrug off. I'm not sure I'm in agreement that this is 'one of his best.' 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Jackie Brown' are enough for any one director to have created. They're masterpieces. This film is marred by an unchecked self-indulgence.What I liked:
The craftsmanship, the work with the actors, the infinitesimal period detail, the ability to create considerable suspense in a story that's so familiar we can almost tick off the forensics of the crime which is the film's culmination. The performances of Pitt and DiCaprio both as a team and as individuals is remarkable. It's nice to see them do very serious work that is both comedic and dramatic--and a whole lot of action. When the camera isn't the star (much of the film is done with actors alone in a scene, tripping through a sunny recreation of 1969 Hollywood), the film really soars. The soundtrack is a trip as well. It keeps the film alive when there's very little reason to be engaged other than an odd blunted nostalgia for a time in America where cigarette smoke filled lungs and penetrated clothing, women were objectified, drug use was about to flood American culture...and dog food really sucked. But by the time Feliciano's 'California Dreamin'' hits the soundtrack, and it's late in the film, all that's come before gets infused with an immense sadness, and a dread that's not just about a crime and lost lives, but the weight of time itself.What I didn't like:
I'm not sure why the producers indulged the length of the cut of this film. It could easily have been a 90 minute feature. We have long sequences of people driving in cars or riding on horse back or...just walking down a street. Beautifully shot, I can see why the footage would be hard to let go. But the film is unnecessarily long. There is precious little plot, which was very disappointing. Given the subject, I would have liked to see something a little less like soft buttery nostalgia which Tarantino seems to revel in. The scene at Spahn Ranch is lengthy, unnerving and prepares us for the climax. But like most of the set pieces in the film (the filming of the Western with Caleb Da-ko-ta, Sharon Tate's watching 'The Wrecking Crew' (which is charming), DiCaprio's tantrum over not remembering his lines, etc.) they go on and on, and...nothing much comes of it. A party at the Playboy Mansion gives us little.All I'll say about the ending: This is one of the most disturbing crimes among many in American history. It wasn't just our fascination with the rich and famous, but the brutality and lack of real motive is the stuff of nightmares. For Tarantino to use it in the manner he's chosen--which of course he's free to do--puts us in the position of laughing it off while survivors of the victims are still living. It's ballsy, yes. I'm not sure it was worth risking where it leaves the audience.",7,27,50,26 July 2019
Gone Girl," Fincher laughs!
","This is likely as close to a romantic comedy that we're going to get out of David Fincher. And while I found the film enormously entertaining and watchable, I was unconvinced by the two leads. (The supporting cast is superb.) I do think it needed a screenplay writer to adapt the material, but here it is: the sensational Gillian Flynn novel with all it's dark humor.Affleck tips the balance in his favor since his general appeal helps the audience forgive him (as Tyler Perry in a departure from his usual shtick promises). That leaves Rosamund Pike as the wife with the unhappy job of bearing the weight of all the misery of the relationship. In the audience I was in, boos and curses directed at Pike, primarily from the female members of the audience didn't seem to be bothered by Affleck's portrayal of more than just a cad in the relationship. And I took issue with how winningly he plays the protagonist in a story where there really isn't one.All the gloss of a Fincher production is here: superb cinematography, sound and art direction. But the cleverness of the plot is bound to the page, particularly in the final third of the film where everyone simply shrugs 'nothing I can do about that' and leaves more than just a little of the principals' behavior without consequence. But perhaps that's the biggest joke of all; it was just poorly executed and left the audience unprepared for the finale.",8,2,10,5 October 2014
Across the Universe," Well, I thought this was awfulbut
","I also thought 'Hairspray' was awful. So draw your conclusions from that. In fairness, it's the producers that let this project proceed on any given day who are at fault. There is no merit to making this filmStill...the performers are all remarkable. And of course, they're singing some of the best popular music ever written. If you can ignore some of the rest of the stupidity on display, there are great rewards.If you're going to 'Mamma Mee-a-fie' the Beatles canon, couldn't you come up with something less inane than this? And if not, copying (in some cases, stealing) the work of others really puts the audience in an uncomfortable position. The people responsible for 'Moulin Rouge,' 'High School Musical,' 'The Doors,' 'The Wiz' AND 'The Wizard of Oz,' 'Platoon,' 'Hair,' 'Rent,' 'Grease,' 'A Hard Day's Night,' 'Tommy,' (although there's nothing as campy fun as Ann-Margaret in a vat of pork 'n beans, 'She's So Heavy' comes close) can all claim their work is being, uh, reused here.You'd think someone who is as an original an artist a Julie Taymour could have come up with her own ideassomething besides synchronized bowling? (Now there's a sport the Olympics needs.) I found it offensive to take historical tragedy (like the assassination of Dr. King, the death of soldiers in Vietnam, the Watts riots, the killings at Kent state, the draft protesters, the activities of the Weathermen and Black Panthers, etc.) to score emotional points in a film that's unworthy of any of the material it bastardizes.Most of it made me cringe; some of it was quite effective (the 'Let It Be' sequence; 'Revolution' is maybe the only song put in its proper context; 'Because' is suitably dreamy; 'Dear Prudence' is cleverly staged and performed). But you sit there waiting for the next punch in the gut like 'When is the awful moment coming when someone says, 'Hey! Jude, '?' I don't think you need to name a character Prudence or Jude or Max or Lucy for the songs to work. It assumes, perhaps, we're as stupid as the people who made this. If Taymour and the audience aren't redeemed, the performers are. The Beatles, god bless 'em, can take care of themselves. They're music is not only strong enough to drift across the universe, it can survive tripe like this.",5,3,9,23 September 2007
The Hurt Locker," We don't need another hero
","This film rises to the level of 'The Red Badge of Courage' less in aspiration than in the accumulation of detail. And those details are intricate yet laid before us effortlessly by Kathryn Bigelow. In the blink of an eye we understand the mission of this group of men, what's at risk and the chaos whirling around them. And within 10 minutes the key character enters, and Jeremy Renner grabs the audience by the throat as effortlessly as Bigelow. Renner plays a hot dog who is so hooked on the adrenalin of war, his performance pushes each harrowing sequence by squeezing the audience to one of the most agonizingly suspenseful films of the last decade.And while the kinetic energy of the film is marked, it's not the film's purpose. Bigelow has bigger fish to fry, and they're not either political nor pacifist. This isn't—by a long shot—an anti-war film. But it even rises above, I think, the director's intentions. War turns out not to even be for the victors. It destroys those on both sides. It kills everything but one: the need to survive and even that is put on the table for debate. Over and over, this small group of men (three superb actors) are called to defuse some type of explosive. We barely see 'the enemy.' We see their weapons which lie in wait for whoever happens to be near when they detonate. It's like something out of Kafka. And we watch these men brought near mental, physical and spiritual breakdown, only to get up and do the same thing again.The dialog flows so naturally, that while we may have never even heard most of the vocabulary here yet we immediately understand what's going on. Visually, I can't remember a film that is both beautiful, a mise-en-scène that is so complete, beautifully composed but never is either self-conscious or without purpose. Midway, there's an extended sequence with three British soldiers that could be used to teach a master class in film schools: We're thrust into an unknown landscape (as the characters are) and what develops is told with such clarity, it's as if we've been given a map prior to seeing the film.Since this is fiction, I did worry that some plot device would become too clever, and while that doesn't happen, the end of the film doesn't add to what we've learned long before the conclusion. It wasn't a let down, but I felt the film had achieved its point so successfully, that the director was unaware she had achieved her goal long before the final sequences.Shot in Jordan, the Middle East looks like Mars. Everything is so alien and no one can communicate with one another because of language barriers. While this isn't any particular political point about our involvement in Iraq, it does point out the grave differences that can exist on two sides of a conflict and how misunderstandings—casual and significant—can perpetuate violence and hatred.Special mention should be made of the soundtrack, which is very close to the one used in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' It adds an unnerving edge that jibes perfectly with documentary look of the film, combining brilliantly with the sounds of war.",10,5,17,10 July 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Not really my cup of tea, but this was brilliant
","If you're going to make a movie with this material (and I can think of a lot of reasons not to, 'Forrest Gump' being at the top of the list), you really need to take your time setting up the world these characters inhabit, and David Fincher is in the position where he can...take his own sweet time.I would recommend that if you're ambivalent about this at all, go when you can surrender three hours as well as yourself. Sentimental and romantic (an excerpt from the Broadway musical, 'Carousel' is recreated here and it fits perfectly), the tone Fincher creates is pitch perfect and amazingly sustained--with the help of Brad Pitt's performance--from beginning to end.Using the Fincher bag of cinematic tricks to seduce the viewer into accepting without even trying to understand the hook here, the main character's aging backwards, the film packs several emotional wallops, particularly the long end sequence with the amazing acting of Cate Blanchett.The audience I saw this with was stunned at the finale. And so was I. Likely the film that will sweep the awards season.",10,5,10,25 December 2008
Paranormal Activity," A+ for concept
","There are some good scares in this film. In fact, I can't remember the last 'horror' film that gave me goosebumps the way this one did. Returning to a 'the basics' where suspense and storytelling are key--not the great folks over in CGI--hopefully this will be a demonstration to the industry of what's been missing from horror films: subtlety.On the other hand, the rendering of the concept in this case would be more appropriate for, say, YouTube than a feature length film. While the device of 'found' documentary footage (like 'The Blair Witch Project') is as valid as any other, here it's an excuse to omit production values: like actors of some merit, dialog that isn't mindnumbing, sets (although the house here is used effectively). I will compliment the videography/cinematographer, because given what this is, it's very effectively shot.As well, we get a very convincing portrait of a relationship, and while the actors aren't awful, I was always aware that they were 'acting.' But if you've got nothing better to do on a rainy night, rent or download this and it'll be entertaining. However, making the effort to go to a theater, putting up with what often awaits one in the audience, in addition to the cost...this is better viewed at home.",7,1,3,18 October 2009
Hotel Mumbai," When is it too soon to exploit a recent tragedy?
","Throughout my life I've always been bothered by films--particularly fictional--that use historical events, like the Holocaust--to prop up an entertainment and not earning or giving the respect due to living survivors. 'Hotel Mumbai' is a good demonstration of why it bothers me. The incident has been the subject of many documentaries that keep their distance from exploiting the sensationalism of seeing innocent people slaughtered in a mass murder. This film jumps right into the horror of the situation and never looks away at the terror and mayhem.It's a combination of the 1970's disaster films like 'Towering Inferno' gathering an all star cast in the 'Grand Hotel' model, and then setting it aflame and blowing it up, all the while murdering people nonstop between the more traditional disaster film explosions.Even if you can resolve the moral dilemma this raises for the viewer: Getting a thrill at the cost of reconstructing a live terrorist attack, we're both invited to marvel at the luxury of one of the most famous hotel in the World and then have to witness the guests and staff summarily slaughtered. I'm not an opponent of explicit screen violence. I do mind watching 'what it was like' for the victims of this massacre for no other reason than being a voyeur..There's an attempt to weave a narrative thread that intersect or 'hook' us emotionally into identifying with certain members of the cast. But it all unfolds so quickly we don't time to really gain an attachment to the 'characters' we're given. The film wastes no time into getting down to what we're there to see, tacking on the devotion of the staff to their rich clientele, in a self-sacrificing manner that raises the point the terrorists are there to make. It's a very mixed bag of compromised values and motives that in there repetition give the viewer time to ask why you bought a ticket and is this something that is edifying or exploitive.The filmmaking itself is mainly set in a soundstage in what we know is actually a famous spatial paradise that the soundstage can't recreate. So we feel boxed in and claustrophobic, but we also can't ever get our bearings on where we are or what's happening where. The use of the actual dialogue between the terrorists and there handlers is chilling. And raises, unintentional sympathy for the perpetrators because they're brain-washed and naÃ¯ve, being promised payments to their impoverished families for their self-sacrifice. If this was done purposefully, I question whether or not the survivors from the incident would find much solace.Despite the effort to make this a 'nail-biting thriller,' anyone even cursory familiar with the incident knows the outcome, and due to the repetitiousness of the killing, my interest flagged several times and I found myself looking at my watch. I suppose I was waiting for the filmmakers to give us a reason they did this project other than to market a recent, actual tragedy and turn it into an action movie.",4,205,463,3 April 2019
The Dark Knight," Oh, we got trouble in Gotham City
","Difficult to assess, this film has ambition--big ambition--beyond an action film. Midway, I thought, 'Oh. This is a serious movie.' That was welcome, but that's not why I got in line. Expecting a slam-bam big summer action film (and it is partially that), the film reaches very far into the American and International psyche on the role of evil, the fragility of good, the ambivalence of governments on the subject of right/wrong.... It's a longer list than that, but Nolan strives for something very deep here. It's close to 'The French Connection' in the intricate plot and reversals of the protagonist who is pushed to abandon his fight for right and seek revenge OR...to find personal happiness OR...to continue the battle he's begun....About 3/4 of the way through the film, the weight of all of this begins to strain the interest of the audience. However, it never sells itself short like it does the audience. We're 'told' what the film is about, and I think the screenplay would have been stronger had the audience been left to piece that together for themselves. Catharsis is taken over by the characters and not the audience.Still, there's gobs to enjoy: I found the soundtrack (Zimmer/Newton Howard)splendid. They use a similar device that John Williams used in 'Jaws,' alerting us that either there's a man in a bat suit about to appear or a fellow with a painted smile is about to do something really, really awful.The performances can't be faulted. Christian Bale is suitably brooding in all of this without once appealing to our sentiment. And then there's Heath Ledger. After all the build up, you wouldn't think he could live up to the hype. It's not a stunt but the embodiment of madness that we see laid out (sometimes to our delight). Finally, though, he's a force that we dread, and that's one of the accomplishments of this film: a cartoon character is fully realized as not just a villain, but all the psychotic terror we see in today's news.Before the film, the projectionist announced that several of the scenes were filmed in Imax, and the screen frame ratio would change. I thought, 'That's going to be stupid.' It's not. When the Imax camera flies through various locations, it's breathtaking. The largest action set piece (roughly 2/3rd's into the film) ups the ante for every action film to follow. It's absolutely stunning. If you think you've seen all the car chases you care to, wait until you see this one (well, it's trucks, but the same idea).Brilliantly edited, the film never gives us spectacle for it's own sake. The cinematography is dark, many of the scenes are done in close up, but when the action opens up, we're aware this is epic film-making at its best.I would have welcomed 15 minutes cut from the film. While all of the many plots (deviously set up by The Joker) are fine, some went on just a few minutes too long. Otherwise, don't hesitate to see this. While the audience I was with was mostly male, 18-50 years of age, the issues it raises are worth the price of admission for anyone. However, the level of violence (some of it implied) would make me leave the kids (13 and under) at home. This is a worthy sequel to 'Batman Begins.'",9,3,8,18 July 2008
Midsommar," How I spent my summer vacation
","...or, a good way to break up with a crappy boyfriend.Somewhere there is a good movie to be made of this material (already accomplished by M. Night Shyamalan in 'The Villiage,' but Sweden is a lovely setting). It's very much like the commercial where the kids decide to hide in the chainsaw shed rather than head for the car with the motor running. But honestly, most films of this genre require a suspension of belief, but if you frame your horror movie in the pretense of academia, I think it's fair for the viewer to expect more than this.After a long and, I think, pointless prologue, a group of graduate students arrive at a festival in Sweden that's a 4 hour drive from anywhere. It's a little disconcerting that none of the usually annoying need-to-know-more-than-your-colleague seems not to have infected this group. They get on an airplane without a care.... Well, everyone except the lone female in this expedition whose major is psychology not anthropology so we can forgive her for not researching the trip a little more than the rest, plus she's in the throes of grief which really annoys her boyfriend and his buds.Ari Asher's previous film, 'Heredity', was an infinitely more developed and visually compelling film than 'Midsommar.' And it's curious since there seems to be much more to plumb here. It has the look of something that the producers just gave up on and said, 'No more money,' like some uninhabited, freshly built stage set. (Where is the kitchen? Where is the bathroom? Where does water come from? Is the puny garden meant to feed all these people? Maybe they live in Stockholm and just come to this location every 90 years to dance around a maypole? I don't know. Answering one or any of these questions would have helped make any of it more believable.)I walked into this film cold. I'd not seen a preview or read a review. It just looked interesting from the poster. About the only expectation that was fulfilled was from the costumer, the set decorator and the score by The Haxan Cloak...and Florence Pugh who manages the best she can with the material.The idea of the disabled having magic powers is offensive. And the Swedish Bureau of Tourism and Travel should sue. That was my take-away.",4,1,3,1 December 2019
Avatar," Spaceballs
","This is a film (and a rare one) that just about anything you say about it, it's probably valid: good, bad, indifferent. I'm in the latter category. It's interesting that James Cameron abandons what made him a legend—storytelling in Titanic—and dumps just about any and everything from all the rest of his films combined in a 2.75 hour epic.No denying, visually it's astonishing. And that's not entirely a compliment. I'm kind of a beige fellow, and the color scheme here tends towards the dayglo of a black light. I won't quibble about the choice. Cameron brought us those extraordinary photos of actual creatures from the Marianas Trench, and I guess their lack of color was something he wanted to work against. There are a few moments of delicacy and wonder from the planet Pandora, but otherwise, the camera is flying up and around and down and through the CGI scenery, and the thrill wore off (for me) about an hour into it.Almost two hours left, and I was discouraged at how paltry the imagination was when the screenplay had to settle down and involve us. I saw one review that compares this experience to what audiences must have felt in 1933 when they saw King Kong. And I agree. But we cared what happened to those stuffed animatronic puppets, here I cared nothing for anyone on the screen. I think the problem is the Na'vi never came to life for me. Their movement was stilted and their, er, belief system was of such a silly New Age goofiness that the young fellow next to me couldn't stop giggling anytime some sort of nonsense was spouted. (I was always taught not to laugh at other people's beliefs, and maintained.) The last hour is very difficult to sit through since, well, we are at war, and the script is not subtle in comparing the policies of the Bush Administration to the 'English' army in this film. Watching what would be U.S. soldiers slaughtered isn't really something I was up for. And as the film closes, I could clearly hear the echo of an Arnold Schwarzenegger intonation, 'We'll be back.' Giving, in my opinion, Mr. Cameron no moral authority to preach to anyone about how the sins of the military industrial complex rules our politicsfor greed and graft.I'm not speaking for the rest of sold out audience that I sat with, but there was a discernible pall throughout the theater.",8,0,2,21 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," The goat and the machete
","I won't pretend to score critical points by suggesting this is pretty silly material. But is it scary? I'll sleep well tonight.It does have style. Taking some of the elements (stylistically and thematically) from Brian De Palma's 'Carrie' (that's a compliment), we're amused to see an ugly duckling already transforming into a swan. It's more amusing still that she's a loan officer and is faced with a dilemma: Should she deny an extension on a mortgage payment and earn points with her boss or should she give in and extend it to basically do the right thing? She makes the wrong choice and really pays for it. Alison Lohman serves the material well because she's someone we see as both vulnerable and growing into her own.The honey-colored cinematography, the almost camp skewering of quite a few California 'types,' and a pretty good group of actors is wrecked—for me—by the intrusion of incessant loud noises that startle in the first 60 seconds, then become very unwelcome because they fill in for what could be/should be deeper development of character and plot.And for the record, in horror movies you can't just make up rules on how to break a spell. Okay, a stake through the heart of a vampire is something you can rely that the audience doesn't need schooling on, but anything else needs to be either presented at the beginning and the characters need to accomplish (or not) that very thing. It's lazy (and it's cheating) to just make stuff up as we go along. We lose interest and any investment in what happens if the rules keep changing as the movie proceeds.The kitten thing was actually funny, but I worried about the goat. I wasn't scaredjust worried.",7,0,2,3 June 2009
Up," Boom shacka lacka (Pixar takes you higher)
","With their latest installment 'Up,' Pixar once again--with canny skill--makes the consistently most entertaining, dazzling films that fall into the category of 'family' entertainment.'Up' is yet another advance in both the skill of animation as well as story-telling but with a maturing respect for its audience. While this doesn't make you as deliriously giddy as 'Finding Nemo' or 'Wall*e,' it takes a more traditional story arc and reaps the benefits of a more satisfying catharsis.While we get talking dogs, the primary characters here are human and therefore ones we fully accept and also know. Their perils--physical and emotional--are rendered fully and will provoke a mature, adult response. There's nothing here as violent as anything in the Indiana Jones franchise, but parents have complained (wrongly, I feel) that the content is too strong for six or seven year olds. However, it is not the pap that Disney is known for.Again, greater advances in technical digital effects and animation abound. Specfically the pull of and resistance to gravity on characters is impressive. I saw the 3D version, and the depth that's achieved, particularly in any of the aeriel sequences is astonishing.Was it my favorite Pixar? It's like asking who is your favorite child. You may have one, but it's rude to verbalize any preference.",10,0,2,2 June 2009
The Happening," --it Happens
","I wish people would cut M. Night Shyamalan some slack, 'cause I'm going to. I've always found his films watchable and of a type that I'll call 'intelligent' horror films. I'm perplexed--not that fans of, say, Freddy Krueger are non-plussed by Shyamalan's work, but--that those who praise films like 'Iron Man' can point to this and say it's nonsense.It's one of the few post-9/11 films that taps into our paranoia without exploiting it. What happens is the fun in the film, so I won't betray that. But as a filmmaker there's a constancy, a visual artistry, and a dread that makes Shyamalan a modern day Hitchcock. I think his work will wear better when we have some distance from the era in which they were made.If I had a complaint, I think this screenplay could have gone through a rewrite once or twice more. Some of the ideas aren't fully developed (a subplot in which Betty Buckley returns to the genre many, many years after 'Carrie' and she's riveting is one example) and while claustrophobia is enhanced by the intimacy of point of view, I'm trying to imagine the exodus from the train station as being so organized. I'd like to have seen something more epic in the panic to flee. And the resolution of the issues between Walhberg and Deschanel seems hasty and forced.Still, we have some fine unsettling moments only a few of which are red herrings. And the cast is quirky and nervous in their performances. It's the first time ages that John Leguizamo has delivered something worthy of his talent.I think people who find their way to this film will enjoy it. I enjoyed 'Signs' as well as 'The Village'; 'Unbreakable' a superior super-hero film, and while those films never matched the popularity of 'The Sixth Sense,' I find that unfortunate. M. Night Shyamalan has brought some class back to suspense and horror films, and I hope people will applaud that.",8,18,39,13 June 2008
The Witch," 'Be sober and alert. The devil prowls the earth.'
","Robert Eggers' 'The Witch' now replaces my all-time favorite horror film (previously Robert Wise's 1963, 'The Haunting' with Julie Harris, now a little dated). What the two do have in common is a literary-mindedness, fine performances, superior cinematography, and that which is new and strange, that is, nothing is predictable.In the case of 'The Haunting' sexual repression, loneliness and maybe a psychotic heroine; for 'The Witch,' sexual tension from single room living as well as a religious repression, a dark foreboding wood, and a landscape unfamiliar to the inhabitant, that is, a New World. In both cases, an ignorance that needs some kind of definition so fear/panic can be managed. Ignorance is usually at the heart of the supernatural, but both films manage to convince the audience there is some kind of actual unknown force threatening the characters.Eggers researched cases from the 1600's prior to the infamous Salem witch trials. Using court documents and lore, he's put together a convincing logic for what happens during the course of 'The Witch,' whether it be contaminated food, starvation or isolation born out of new surroundings or expulsion from society.The spookiness creeps in slowly. The personality quirks of the family explain a lot. Never before have two 'twins' been more cause for alarm than Mercy and Jonas and their 'pet' goat Black Phillip.The use of archaic language both Christian incantation (and other darker forms of religion) really raise the hackles. When Mercy and Jonas taunt an untethered Black William (a goat) with repetitious rhyme, I wanted to flee. But family members are stuck with them, and tensions build in their new surroundings as various significant and insignificant mysteries begin, and alarm and panic consume the family where no one is trusted and blame comes quickly to the lips, causing more and more tension. As pioneers, they are living on the margin of survival, in and of itself terrifying.What happens in the wood is both beautiful and fraught. Jarin Blaschke's painterly cinematography draws us in to the drama, as does the careful costuming and production design. The film harkens back to the work of Carl Theodore Dreyer's 1920 'Leaves from Satan's Book,' and masterful exploration of occult throughout his long career.But it's the music that pushes this over the edge. Mark Korven's dissonant chorale and seemingly period instruments are as unfamiliar to us as the surroundings are for the family, driving us as mad as the fear that inhabits the characters.All of this is accomplished in an almost casual way. But slowly the injection of the unknown and fear of it, consumes us without the usual tricks that have become so familiar (and anything-but-scary) the many horror films that are cranked out by the industry. 'The Witch' is different which is bold enough. But it's also accomplished in what it sets out to do and earns a very special place in the canon of horror films.",10,5,8,29 July 2019
There Will Be Blood," Fallen
","A familiar subject of great films (Stroheim's 'Greed'; Welles' 'Citizen Kane') the result of capitalism (in extremis) drains the humanity from an individual just like Daniel Plainview drains the oil fields of California. Here, capitalism is competing with religion (a Protestant, uniquely American variety). The preacher seeks to drain something different from the Land and instead of bathing the world in oil, Baptismal blood will do. It's a particularly stunning metaphor for this particular time in the American experience.Given the ground that has already been paved by previous works on this subject Paul Thomas Anderson is perhaps freer to focus on other aspects of this fall into the abyss. Stripped of any nod to the popular crowd, a radical score, no 'love interest,' not a lot of time is spent on adding up sums of money and what it buys. We just see souls wither and the act the title promises fulfilled.It's a strange, fascinating experience in the theater to watch this film. Every aspect of film-making here is exceptional, but it's the story told that parches the viewer. The heightened sense of realism makes what we see instantly familiar yet we dread what will come next.This film ends very much the same as Stroheim's 'Greed' and Welles' 'Citizen Kane' ends. Meglomanicas never renounce their sins and atone. They fall, and in this film they fall hard.In a year of some really magnificent films, this one tops my list, and time, I believe, will hold it with esteem.",10,3,8,6 January 2008
Burlesque," Legit
","Over the last several years/decades, we've had various artists attempt musical comedy on film when they didn't, necessarily, have the talent to showcase in the film. It's almost killed the genre for me (which didn't have much going for it anyway).But when there is a legitimate talent to be featured or simply vehicled, show me where to buy a ticket. The young Christina Aguilera has nothing to prove vocally, but everything was riding on her ability to act on screen and hold our interest between songs. As well, I've always found her performances physically static, while vocally unimaginably executed, so when the trailer put her in a line of chorus girls in a burlesque house (which is showing a rivival of sorts in San Francisco), I did have a question about whether she could be compelling. I shouldn't have worried and wonder why no one hasn't grabbed her before now and put her on the screen. She's mesmerizing and surprisingly demure (which is not a problem she has in interviews on talk shows); and when she mounts the stage she controls everyone watching. Her dancing is quite acceptable and isn't accomplished in the editing room as recent filmed musicals have slipped less than talented actresses over hurdles they clearly couldn't scale.The story in 'Burlesque' is a trifle, and no one tries to apologize for that. 'Showgirls' tried to get around the limitations of this genre by adding scale and tawdriness and it only distanced us from any of the characters. The burlesque house here is modest, unapologetically copied from the Broadway show/film 'Cabaret,' and the musical numbers scaled to a small stage that really's not much larger than an average film house's proscenium. It's a lesson directors of future musicals for film should learn. Keep it scaled down and accessible; otherwise, the audience and performers get overwhelmed and shut out. Here the talent of the dancers shines. The choreography is smart and sassy (as are the costumes), and I couldn't wait for the next numberwhich we're given a generous helping/selection of songs, all kept within the confines of the burlesque house.Is it revolutionary? No, but it's the best offering since 'Moulin Rouge,' and I actually found this more appealing. I suspect the Golden Globes are going to eat this up, and that might give both Aguilera and Cher a shot at an Oscar nomination.",10,13,23,24 November 2010
The Reader," A victim's guilt
","The film is a series of profound moral dilemmaswhile contrived by the author, they are fair questionsthat resonate deeply in the 21st Century: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals and collectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and, of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.All this is a pretty heady mix for a film, but Stephen Daldry (as with 'The Hours' ) makes literary conceit play very naturally here. David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of the always remarkable Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making. But the actors are what drag the audience into this story. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael who has to play a range of virginal innocent to wizened and bitter. It's the key role in the film, and we're all lucky he was found to play this role. And the ever confounding Kate Winslet. What an amazing career for this young actress! Running through a list of her credits, she has some of the best performances of the last decade: 'Holy Smoke,' 'Eternal Sunshine,' 'Iris,' 'Finding Neverland,' 'Little Children.' But here she does something very different. Playing what amounts to a monster, we see that they too are human. Not many actresses could bring this off, but it may be her greatest accomplishment to date. Ralph Fiennes brings a continuity to the work David Kross begins, and there's a brief appearance by Lena Olin who commands the dignity the role deserves. I'm puzzled at the lukewarm reception to this film. I almost missed seeing it. And it turned out to be one of my favorite and the most heart-rending films of the year. All involved should be very proud.",10,312,368,4 January 2009
The Wrestler," Tedious, derivative...ho, hum
","I'm not an Aronofsky fan, but I went to this, I hope, with an open mind. First, I think the critics have focused on the wrong performance; Marisa Tormei walked away with this film as far as I was concerned. O'Rourke is a great actor, but there was something calculated and obvious both in the conception of the role and the performance. Everyone seemed to forget Evan Rachel Wood and her character were in this movie (which really was a disappointment; she shines in what little she has to do here).As a metaphor for America's spiritually bankrupt, 'U-S-A!' chantin', hero/celebrity oriented, Muslim fearin', self-loathing, economically dying culture, I suppose this has value. But I'm guessin' not many in the audience latch onto that. Instead, Aronofsky's need to alienate his audience with despair, gore, and ugliness is stripped bare of his usual excess with cinematic 'tricks.' Glad for latter anyway.I mean, didn't anyone involved in this see 'Rocky?' 'Rocky II?' 'Rocky III?' 'Rocky IV?' 'Rocky V'...?",6,3,12,28 December 2008
Inception," Overwritten...with sensational imagery
","I doubt any film could have lived up to the hype surrounding this one. I thought 'The Dark Knight' was about the best action film ever to hit the screen, and 'Memento' a clever puzzle that engaged.'Inception' has the look of a great film, but it's about as heavy-handed as any film I can think of. We're constantly stopping to hear a long explanation of the new rules of dream logic that got us to...something that isn't at all dream-like. And by the time we hit the slope on skis it seemed so weighted down by mundane 'action,' I lost all interest.The first 30 minutes or so when you don't have your footing on what's going on are the most satisfying. But once the explanations start (and they never approach the cleverness of 'Memento') tedium sets in.Logic is abandoned: Who says that if you die in a dream you never wake up? Why is one person's projection lethal and another's isn't? How can an 'architect' of one person override another's? On and on.... And 'just because' really isn't a satisfying answer for a film that purports to be a sensation.Visually, it can draw gasps. Intellectually, it's just plain silly. And the entire length works against any excitement. I'd have voted for one less dream within a dream.There's a 1962, 28 minute short film, 'La Jetée' which is likely the source for Nolan's idea. It devastates the viewer with much less fuss than all this $160 million dollar rattling and rolling.",8,1,6,18 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," No shirt, Sherlock
","This is an entertaining film, but it adds nothing to the canon of filmed versions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective. As some have mentioned casting Robert Downey Jr. was certainly interesting, but Downey seems insecure with the role (and the accent). He's enjoying his performance much more than the audience.Jude Law is—as ever—reliable in what he's given to do. His exasperation with Holmes' peculiarities seemed a little intense for what would have been a lifelong acquaintance. But it doesn't help to compare the Sherlock Holmes enterprise with this particular film.If I were casting this movie, I'd have put Mark Strong as Holmes (he has the stature, composure and profile) and Downey in the role of Lord Blackwood. But here again there's no point in wishing this film and its concept were somehow different. We have to look at what's on the screen.It's basically a 'Classics Illustrated' version of Doyle's detective. Pow! Bam! Boom! being operativea lot. The washed out gray palette is appropriate (and right out of Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd'). Dirt is everywhere, even under Holmes' fingernails. The 'mystery' here is of the Indiana Jones variety, and, in fact, the whole tone of the movie has that kind of daring do. The opening sequence is right out of Martin Campbell's 'Casino Royale.' And while this film isn't badly directed, it's just nothing new.It would be nice to see Guy Ritchie get serious. He has talent, but he doesn't trust it. He wants to shock us, and, I guess he doesn't go to many films. Because today, the audience really can't be shocked. Downey rips off his shirt and has an extended 'boxing' brawl to hone his. Well we're not sure. But it gives Ritchie the opportunity to do something that has nothing to do with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And that isn't shocking; it's just silly.'The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,' 'Sherlock, Jr.' were interesting shifts in points of view of this famous character. Ritchie's point of view is truculent, and it winds up looking, if not childish, sadly adolescent.",8,2,5,25 December 2009
The Conjuring," The reviews led me to buy a ticket....
","...and this is the second time recently ('Cabin in the Woods' was the other) that reading about a film overrode my better judgment. What was true about both films is they were 'different' than the usual horror film, and for some reason viewers here/reviewers in print thinks that makes them successful.For one, horror films need characters that would behave similar to what an audience member would do. Wandering into a darkened boarded-up basement--more than once--where all manner of unnatural things/sounds occur becomes at first laughable and then tedious. Two, when new rules for demon possession have to be spelled out to us in anticipation for what's surely going to happen later in the film spoils the surprise. Three, the couple who 'rescue' the family but also keep a room full of 'possessed' objects in a special room in their own house was so ridiculous that whatever was bound to be the consequence had me cheering for the demons.Finally a film that can make Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson dull, should be shelved permanently. Unfortunately, for reasons beyond my comprehension, this film is getting rave reviews. If you want to see a truly scary movie, find Jack Clayton's 'The Innocents' or Robert Wise's 'The Haunting,' and leave 'The Conjuring' alone.",4,15,31,24 July 2013
Casino Royale," A couple of extra points for being a better Bond.
","This was an enjoyable film with a post-Cold War sensibility that makes you consider what a 'license to kill' really does to you. Does it make a better man or justify a psychopath? We never had to wonder about that in the previous installments. I thought this was closest to Dr. No, which is welcome news.However, this never had the kick or audience involvement of some of the better Bond films. It is a better pieced together work of cinema, but the story line is muddy and I never warmed to Eva Green's Vespa Lynd, lovely as she is. Some of the torture seemed to dwell on the sadistic and slowed things down. But Daniel Craig, I thought, lived up to the hype.As an adventure film, though, I thought this was mediocre with an emphasis on production values instead of action sequences. And I started to squirm at the third hand being dealt at the casino. The outcome was certain and the film 20 minutes too long. For instance, minute for minute, Mission: Impossible III (under-rated and ignored for the wrong reason) is tighter and has more kinetic punch (nothing in this Casino Royale approaches the sequence on the bridge in M:I3).But hail to Daniel Craig! Give this guy a script and a good directorand his angst over a license to kill. And they can knock out even more of the stuffy self-references to the Broccoli enterprise. I'm sure half the audience had no idea what any of those meant.",8,0,2,27 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Zelig-ing Almodóvar...and quite well
","Fans of Woody Allen have gotten used to him 'honoring' other directors (Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock), but I'm not sure any other director could get away with what he does. Woody Allen's talent has always been as a writer, and in this outing, he writes. Perhaps over-writes. The voice over narration digests a lot of the circumstances here that I think the audience would have be capable of doing and become more involved had it been omitted. This is a gorgeous film, well-edited, fully developed in its analysis of a well-worn path (that would be 'love'), and I wished Allen would have trusted what he'd put together.It's a rip-off of several Almodóvar films, 'Talk to Her' being the most 'honored.' While both films share the same cinematographer, I think this movie rises a level above Almodóvar's film visually. And what a beautiful setting this is.Surprisingly, the weakest element of the film is in the performances of the two leads of the title, Vicky (a lanky Rebecca West) and Christina (the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). You could accuse Allen of losing his ear in some of the exchanges between the two which sound reluctant and improvised. But others in the cast do very (very) well.Patricia Clarkson needs to be in every movie made. She brings such conviction to any role. Putting 'sexy' back in his work after 'No Country for Old Men,' Javier Bardem is not only watchable, but quite believable as the hedonist who threads the women in this film around his, uh, finger.And then God created Penélope Cruz (let's all give thanks). Funny and tragic at the same time is quite a feat, but she pulls it off effortlessly here proving her work in Almodóvar's 'Volver' wasn't a fluke. Any time she's on the screen only Bardem matches her acting. We're left wondering (as Cruz' character wonders) what can Bardem possibly see in these two American tourists? I almost skipped this film, but it was quite enjoyable at every level. It's Woody Allen's most successful work in years. While 'Match Point' was fun, it was plot heavy. And let's face it, no one talks the way people talk in a Woody Allen film. But here his graduate school dialectic is appropriate for the two leads, who are immersed in their degrees. By the end of the film a lot of the stuffing has been knocked out of those who believe matters of the heart can either be measured and weighed or bear no consequence to the participants, and it's welcome to see Allen turn the tables on those who over-intellectualize the Universeand love.",8,3,9,16 August 2008
Up in the Air," Every time you buy a ticket...
","you hope it's going to be a movie as good as this one.Jason Reitman puts together a superb cast, a polished production crew and some terrific writing, cannily, with a film premiering at a time when 10% of the American workforce is without a job. It's a movie about a 'terminator,' a man who is employed for difficult situations when someone needs to be fired. It's a lucrative profession, and Ryan Bingham (another sensational performance by George Clooney) loves his work. Not only does it afford him a life in travel, but he has the notion that he cares for the people he's employed to fire, letting them down easy so they don't gopostal.While the performances are perfection, it's the screenplay that shines. Without apology, it meanders over and through (deeply in some cases) many aspects of modern life, scoring bulls-eyes each time. One part of the film is a romantic comedy, another a treatise on how to tolerate a difficult coworker, but it all adds up to the toll that modern life has taken on our emotional lives, effectively neutering all feeling and interpersonal joy for the good of the 'the company.' And as soon as you become irrelevant, you're tossed out and left with a packet of instructions on how to put your life back together againon your own, someplace else.While the audience may be ahead of the script in some instances, how it's all played is just off center enough that every twist is enjoyable. Clooney gets amazing support from Vera Farmiga, a seductress who makes you believe you're doing the seducing, and Anna Kendrick as a thick-headed youngster who we watch both learn a few things about living as well as teaching her elders about what is really valuable at the end of a workday. Kenkrick's role is the trickiest and she pulls it off with a kind of daffy dignity that gives the movie its charm.This should dominate the award season.",10,6,17,5 December 2009
