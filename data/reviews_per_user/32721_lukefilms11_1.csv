It," Fantastic
","Fantastic film, my favourite horror film of all time, original, disturbing, funny,great casting, Bill Skarsgard nailed it as Pennywise. Great chemistry between the losers, very close to the book, best film of this year so far. Can't wait for chapter 2, worth the watch, Highly recommended",9,4,11,11 September 2017
