Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," What The ..............................................
","I don't understand, This movie is 'critically acclaimed' they had to be paid off. Not only is this movie not funny. It is some of the worst acting i have ever seen. This either is an example of just how bad movies are now, or i just didn't get it. Borat as a comedy is a Jackass ripoff. At times, in the movie you can tell he knows what hes doing, or people are laughing b/c they are in on the joke they are playing. Its just bad. There was some Gross 'humor' that just wouldn't stop. I can count on one hand how many times i chuckled, and it was b/c i saw the setup on the preview. I also didn't think there was any acting, I thought this guy was really going to act like he didn't know what was going on and he totally knew. When I was walking down the steps out of the theater there were people stuck in their seat as if they were thinking 'If i don't move no one will see that i just wasted 80 or so minutes of my life.' If you need to see Borat please just Watch the trailer ten times and then you will have all the 'quotes' and the gist you will ever need.",1,12,25,11 November 2006
