The Avengers," The perfect superhero film
","This is the perfect superhero film. You will not find much in the way of social comment (one bit about Loki & Nazis is a bit clunky), you will not find a great deal back-story or exploration of the depths of the characters. But this film doesn't need those it is awesome and it is fun! Striking the perfect balance between dark and light (in the pain vs fun sense) no time is wasted on introducing the heroes or the villains (it is assumed you know them already and of course you do)and the pacing is perfect. The action sequences are well done and pure comic book, there is no slacking in the pacing but you do not get a lot of the 'what-the-hell-jst-happened' too fast to follow action . That is the essence of it, a comic brought to life in a way that you don't question. The balance of the characters is right too. Stark's smartass humour counterpoints Captain America's straight guy perfectly and the swaggering Thor goes well sided with the mild Banner and brutal Hulk. Hulk especially is someone who worries everyone in this, unpredictable yet necessary, he is a presence even when he isn't big and green. Sure there are some unbelievable bits, if I had taken even a fraction of the punishment Black Widow does whilst fighting the bad guys I would wind up dead or very injured at best and the consequence of actions taken is not always carried through but Hey! This is Marvel not Tolstoy and it delivers the goods as they fit within that universe.",9,0,1,3 April 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Nice film shame about the acting
","There is a great deal to like about this film. It has some excellent action sequences, some nicely realised planetscapes and a well used look to all the equipment that reflects the ethos of the original (not to mention a few in jokes for the fans). PLUS!... Well spoiler alerts later. However the area that really, really lets it down is in character development...there isn't any. I can not think of one character that was anything other than a flat cardboard caricature with the possible exception of the robot K-2S0, who is marvellously voiced by Alan Tudyk, which says a lot really.SPOILER ALERT!! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU LIKE SURPRISESThe CGI Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin. Well the estate of Peter Cushing are fine with it but ti does open up a whole field of ethics regarding the reviving of dead actors to star in new films. That aside the CGI worked quite well and shows just how far we have come with the craft. I also liked the final scenes with Darth Vader which were actually quite terrifying. Finally the best thing about the film, in an age where everything has to have a happy ending, is that everyone dies. Just a shame that you don't feel enough for them to care.",6,2,5,29 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Harley Quinn! Harely Quinn! The only name you need
","I wanted to like this film, an insane mix of DC's bad guys & gals, throw in a new Joker. What's not to like? Well quite a lot actually, which I will come to, but then I gave it 6 stars. Why would I give a film I was unimpressed with an above average score? In a word Margot Robbie (aka Harley Quinn). Quite simply she makes the film (with a little support from Jared Leto's Joker). She's mad as a box of gun totting frogs and utterly at home with that (aside from one forgivable dream sequence). It is hard not to like her cheery psychotic disposition, which takes a battering but is never broken. In so many films where you have a 'strong' female lead they are there to endure great hardship or to out bloke the blokes. And while it is true that Harley Quinn shares a blokey love of violence really she is just out to have (twisted) fun. In this she has a lot more in common with Tank Girl (the comic not the film) than he co-female characters (Amanda Waller, Enchantress, Katana) who are all, well, a bit serious. I could have watched an entire film featuring just Harley Quinn and Joker and given it a resounding 10 but, alas, it was not to be. So what was wrong? Well to be honest although the premise was good(ish) and Cara Delevingne's Enchantress a great tragic villain, and Viola Davis gave a good performance as Amanda Waller, and Jared Leto was fascinating as the Joker..in the end the whole was just a bit too clichéd. There was nothing at all sympathetic about the 'good guys'. We had sadistic prison guards (yawn), troubled soldier Rick Flag with a tangled love interest (ho hum) and endless fight scenes against anonymous attackers which were just like any other mass fight scene ever filmed. CGI was OK but nothing special these days. Will Smith's Deadshot was a positively pedestrian 'bad-guy-with-heart-of –gold', single parent assassin with teen daughter whom he adores. Adam Beach's Slipknot might just as well have worn a red star trek jumper. As for the rest they were either one dimensional caricatures or just blended into the back ground. I tell a lie, Jay Hernandez did a good, if clichéd, performance as Diablo. It could have been so much more. I raise a glass to Robbie, she may be slight but she must have damn good muscles 'cause she carried the whole film. And finally who in their right mind would think it a good idea to give unstable psychotics guns and expect them to behave? I mean seriously?",6,0,0,16 August 2016
The Revenant," One long bad day
","In some ways this feels like Mike Leigh does a western. It is unremittingly grim. DiCaprio is definitely not having a good day, good week or even possibly a good month. It goes bad from day one with an attack in the opening scenes and doesn't get much better for him. Especially after the famed bear attack! However this hard-to-kill man takes us on an epic journey through some wonderful mountain scenery and the story, plainly told, develops to a suitable climax. DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for shear bloody endurance in the face of some incredibly harsh conditions alone! It did not look like a very comfortable acting job and he bore it with great fortitude. It had a great frontier feel and I felt for the hard lives of those who lived through those times. If I have one quibble it felt over long and a bit more editing would have produced a tighter film. But that said it must take its place in the hall of classic westerns.",8,1,2,1 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," An English Wizard in New York
","So no Harry Potter. No Hogwarts. No Voldemort. And a film based on a throwaway Christmas cash in from a few years back. Not a promising start. However in many ways the lack of a 'Potter' novel to fall back on is the strength of the film. Allowing it to take new directions and explore the wider world of Magic in the Rowling universe. Setting it in New York is a good move. As well as making it more appealing to American audiences it breaks the mould of English eccentricity and delivers a world of magic with more bite and a hint of social conscious. Set in the time of the Great Depression this world of magic has a more jagged raw feel than the whimsy of the Potter sagas. Newt Scamander (Redmayne) is the English man in New York, a shy awkward person who doesn't quite fit in and immediately falls foul of American Magical law (no importing of beasts, no wand permit, consorting with nomag (muggles)). It is this law which sets the tone of the film and gives it its own slant. The Salem witch trials of the past have given rise to a situation where magicians are hidden from the non- magical world, which sees magic as sinful, evil and dangerous (they have good reason on this last). Mary Lou Barebone (Morton) is the main witch hating focus for this stance and is suitably chilling in this role. The underground nature of magic in America riffs on a host of witchcraft films and TV programmes of the past. While not making any actual references there are elements of 'Bewitched' and the problems of relationships between magical and non-magical folk. Which brings us to Kowalski (Fogler) as the comic light relief and our nomag view of the world. I like Kowalski, I like his aspirations to be a baker and his wide eyed wonder at the magic he encounters. I do however feel that he is put into the clichéd fat funny guy role. My main criticisms are that while the 'keep it under wraps' view of magic is different it also gives rise to the problem of how they manage to do this when New York seems to be getting torn up by magical events on a fairly regular basis. Surely they can't obliviate everyone and keep on repairing the damage or passing it off as a gas explosion? And there is the oh so tedious your superiors won't listen to you when you have something important to say (even if you do keep gatecrashing meetings) don't people ever follow correct procedure? Still these are minor quibbles and Newt's TARDIS like suitcase is a fantastic nod to Hogwartian eccentricity",8,3,7,14 December 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A flawed masterpiece
","I confess I am a huge fan of Frank Millers's seminal 1986 work 'The Dark Knight Returns', which is just as well as the film, in its early sequences, borrows heavily from the book to the extent of recreating exact scenes from the comic (note Martha Wayne's exploding pearls in the opening sequences, to name but one). In this sense and this 'interpretation' the film reflects the moral ambiguity that made Dark Knight so compelling. It brings a reality to the Superhero film that is often lacking (When Superman throws someone/thing through a building what happens to the people in that building?) and reflects that just because you think that you are doing right it doesn't mean that everyone thinks you are doing right. Ben Afleck as Batman is superb and brings real grit to the role, so much so that I was almost moved to tears at one point, and his beef against Superman is logical. Henry Cavill too brings the power and virtue of Superman to the screen in a way that feels grounded and real. Amy Adams also deserves an honourable mention as Lois Lane and Gal Gadot, in her brief appearances, as Wonder Woman certainly make the character worthy of further study. Even Jesse Eisenberg in his early scenes as Lex Luthor lends a logical argument to his desire to stop Superman. Set pieces are stunning and the film raises interesting questions on what it would be like to have very powerful beings roaming the planet, in a way that Avengers doesn't (not that I don't like Avengers films, I like them for wholly different reasons). So what goes wrong? Doing a Dark Knight returns film is a great idea and in so many ways this is a Dark Knight returns film. BUT! Dark Knight Returns was an endgame, a portrayal of Batman at the end of his time and how he faces that, while this is a beginning, Dawn of Justice and all that. Which means that some run-of-the-mill action film plotting has been shoehorned onto a classic story. So while the action sequences are superb they arrive at the expense of the plot. This includes the way in which Batman and Superman are persuaded to fight. In DKR it is logical and easy, Superman is a lackey of the government brought in to bring Batman down. However in a film where Superman isn't a lackey of the government the method is more contrived and ultimately weaker. Superman takes some scenes which were originally Batman's in DKR and if this WERE an endgame film would still have great power and resonance. However we know that this is just the start of a series so it renders the impact null and void. Nevertheless go and see this film for yourself, where it is good it is very good and will probably be the best film adaptation of DKR that we are likely to see.",8,4,8,31 March 2016
