The Monuments Men," recommend you see a superb film, thematically similar
","If you have not seen the 1964 film ' The Train, ' I highly recommend it. That the film is only IMDb-rated @7.9 is shameful. The only fault I found with the film was that it ended, not too soon, but ended...at all. I have viewed this film countless times & it never fails to move me; notice I did not say ' entertain me.' Burt Lancaster, Paul Scofield & Jeanne Moreau are excellent, as is the supporting cast. Filmed in B&W was a brilliant choice; I can still taste & smell the soot & smoke from the locomotive's coal-burning engine. I recently saw this film in a refurbished ' movie theater ' in Suffern, NY, on the theater's BIG SCREEN, which made me appreciate the film more than ever before. After all this time, it blew me away like it did the first time I saw it. I promise you, at the end of film, you will sit there until you are able to compose yourself & only then, leave the theater. It is film making of the highest order. I hope I have not over-sold this film. If you are not impressed by this film, you need to unsubscribe from IMDb.com; you are not a film lover!!!",Null,2,8,4 February 2014
