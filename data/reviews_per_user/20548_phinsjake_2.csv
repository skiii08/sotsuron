Skyfall," Appalled
","Both by the film's magnificence and the multitude of negative reviews for this Movie! And I'm not just saying this because I thought this was a masterful film, which it was, but because the reasoning behind these arguments is just ridiculous. From misconstruing what's actually happening in the movie to not being able to accept a change in Bond. First off, Bond wasn't made to stay the same forever, change is a real thing people, ACCEPT IT. Secondly, this is a story that's different than previous films. Skyfall is much deeper as it hits Bond's childhood and exposes his dark past. Sorry if this is too hard to comprehend so far.The plot holes that exist are minor and are really only noticeable if one is really trying to bash a film without real reason. The key to a successful film is if it depicts a moving story and enthralls its viewers, and if one does nothing but to criticize a movie without an attempt at appreciation at any level is, again, appalling.Away from the blind opposition, Skyfall is made great through its exceptionally well-acted cast on all sides, especially Dench's and Bardem's performances (I mean what do you expect). The cinematography is done exceptionally, because if Roger Deakins has anything to do with anything, it's gonna look beautiful, shown here at the Casino in Shanghail and especially in the building surrounded by neon lights. Thomas Newman is another veteran who does the score the justice that such an iconic theme deserves. The production design, especially between the Shanghai and Scotland scenes, adds to the momentous effects the film is able to create. The plot is more than intriguing, as it continues to develop and captivate the attention of its viewers more. Mendes has been an impressive director since '99 with American Beauty and Skyfall showcases his mastery is still applicable now.Do not let the negative reviews on here push you away, Skyfall is no waste of time and will create an experience that you surely will not forget soon.",10,8,11,29 May 2017
500 Days of Summer," An Original Take on Breaking a Heart
","'But you should know up front, this is not a love story.' Such an impactful opening line still doesn't manage to prepare one for the heartbreak and beauty that is about to ensue. Who even needs chronological order? All of these different surges of emotions over the titular 500 days are pieced together so smoothly and with such brilliant originality that all one can do is feel! Having to endure that painful juxtaposition between expectations and reality felt like an unexpected punch to the gut. Loved the message that the summer was necessary to reminisce on in order to look forward to the changes in autumn. The entirety of this clever (dare I say) love story is wrapped up in two utterly endearing concluding scenes that really showcase the heart of this film.",9,0,0,17 May 2019
