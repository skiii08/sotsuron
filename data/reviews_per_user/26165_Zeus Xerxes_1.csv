Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is pure Star Wars.
","I saw this movie last night.  About half-way through, I realized I had already been subjected to Jar-Jar Binks and a good deal of the boyish Vader's acting ability.  I was content.  I knew I had the star battle and the light saber duel ahead of me.  I was then truly happy.  THIS IS STAR WARS!!  It follows the formula so well (with just a little TOO much Jar-Jar).  The acting was on par for the series, and the story was a mix of the first three.  This sets up for Episodes 2 and 3, and does a great job in doing so.  I had heard that this was mostly for the kids, but I'm sorry, when I take my 11 year old brother to this in the next week, he won't understand jack about the trade federation and how involved the 'menace' is in this movie.  He will enjoy the sights and sounds of the film, I would bet you on that.  This movie works on so many levels, but the only level it needs to work on and succeeds at is the Star Wars level.  I would rate this movie as good as 'RoTJ', and I liked it MORE than 'Star Wars'.  See this movie, and relish it.",8,0,0,23 May 1999
