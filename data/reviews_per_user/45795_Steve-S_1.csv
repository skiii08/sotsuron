Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent all round entertainment.
",Thin plot but the fast paced action and the humorous character of Jar Jar Binks gave the film life and soul. Enjoyed the racer scene. Excellent special effects. Very entertaining. Look forward to the next episode.,10,0,0,23 August 1999
