The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Stupidjay, boringjay, dumbjay!
","The 2 is for some of the sets. The rest of the film could just barely receive a 1 if I was feeling seriously generous or off my head on coke. I suppose that would be a great way to watch this dribble. Made for the mindless moron teenagers of America and they got what they deserved. What a load of total hogwash and bad acting to boot. Lawrence is painfully stressing us with her over the top attempts to show pain and solidarity with the poor and downtrodden. Total FAIL! She is just not a great actress. That is is all one can say. The plot or story or whatever this is, is pathetic and Sutherland is a wasted talent here and even he is finding it difficult to portray his role. Someone like the director may have to be blamed for this mess. Anyway, who cares is ultimately the big question. This stuff should never have been made. For those of you who actually liked this film I suggest a visit to your shrink or better yet go out and get seriously plastered and then watch it again and maybe you will see how awful this garbage really is.",2,14,19,29 December 2014
John Wick," Such a load of total clichÃ© BS
","I do not know what a lot of you others are drinking before you watched this attempt at a film but I will not be imbibing, that's for sure. There are comments in some of the reviews here that this will be a new cult film, that it is the best action film of the year etc etc etc. Sorry but 'fail' is the only word that comes to mind. The gratuitous and total violence is just pathetic and I might say a serious low point in American culture. Keanu has returned! From what? He looks like a very sad has been actor forced to not act so that the film maker can get his rocks off on this masturbation or a movie. I hope that the directors and producers of this garbage are duly banned from ever making another attempt. Seriously people, if you liked this film then you need to seriously look in the mirror. I mean really! If the mirror don't crack then just be thankful. If I had to find just one redeeming factor I would be very hard pressed. OK - I liked the little dog. YUK!",1,298,586,16 November 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," So so awful
","Firstly, milking this old cow is a disgrace but then that is what Hollywood is all about. Secondly the dated style is just pathetic, rehashing krap for the star war groupies does not cut it and makes me wonder what in the name of sanity any of these actors participated in this sham for? Thirdly it is a disgrace that this film makes political insinuations against President Trump. Just goes to show how childish and pathetic these people are. Fourthly, the film presents a scenario that is so totally boring and overused throughout the film industry history that it is just laughable and why so many people think it was great says a lot about the level of people's intelligence. This film is totally childish. Lastly I am so happy that I did not pay to see it but saw it in a different manner. Hahaha. Not getting a cent from me you disgusting liberal snots.",1,12,29,23 December 2016
World War Z," Sorry Brad - you are fired
","The only reason I did not give it a 1 was that the mass crowd scenes were very well done. SO, that leaves a 1 for everything else. How low has our Brad Pitt sunk. Doing it for the cash for sure. What a waste of intellectual effort or the lack there of. Time to kick the guts out of Hollywood and just do not go see their products. Thank god I do not have to pay to see this crap. So to make it absolutely certain and without spoiling the plot - the nature of science is so easily circumvented by this story line and a hero emerges that just makes you wonder who the hell these people think are watching their films. Oh I forgot - they know only too well and the gullible public keeps lining the coffers of the Jewish monopoly in Californication land. Just laughable.Do not go to see it. You will kick yourself afterwards. Go buy your girl a great dinner instead.",2,21,40,28 June 2013
Interstellar," Fair to middling movie
","Some nice stuff and a lot of reasonably good acting and a some great GFX stuff. Storyline reasonable and definitely the type of movie I can recommend even if only so that you can form your own opinion. Scientifically it is seriously far fetched and much of it is beyond reasonable doubt. Morally it is a very thin plot. The premise is not the problem but the good versus evil is. The nature of these characters is somewhat childish and to an extent unbefitting the astronauts we have already experienced. This is Hollywood people and leaves as usual a lot to be desired. After the Gravity film it seems that these types of morally driven sci fi movies are a good bet to make money and win a few Oscars. Not for me though. Acting wise I can possible understand it but not on any of the other levels. I feel that there were far too few plot developments undertaken. The stupidity of the liberal brainwashed public for one. Anyway, you will have to do your own assessment. Watch it for free as I do not feel it is worth watching for money.",4,6,11,10 November 2014
Oblivion," No spoiler here
","Just watched this flick and I got to tell you that again I am just amazed at how much money they can throw at a movie and still screw it up bigtime. I do not want to say anything about the plot because that would destroy the only aspect that may be of interest to any viewer even if only slightly though. The problem is that we have had AVATAR and PROMETHEUS and now this. What connects them all together is the totally childish storyline that accompanies each one of them. There are some nice CG FX etc and a nice graphic aspect in all three movies each had a certain WOW factor in some of the imagery but that just does not make a good nor a great flick. In AVATAR we had a glorified cowboys and indians film with a slight twist of eco friendly and emotionally charged weird blue people and then in Promethues we had a rather strange philosophical conundrum that was never resolved and never explained and if they meant to leave it up to the viewer then they sherked their responsibility because the film was just plain childish. Now we have again a setting of the really bad alien taking over the world. MARS ATTACKS, War of the Worlds all over again just with a slight twist and if it was not for the ever delightful appeal of OLGA we would all have been bored to death by CRUISE's lame acting and over the top disdain for his craft. By all means watch it but if possible do not spend any money on it because you will regret that. So sad to see that Hollywood just can not get the message but then with all these liberal do gooders there who live on the high end of the stack and preach to us mere mortals what can you expect.",Null,2,7,12 April 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Only dolars in the mountain for jackson
","I did not give it awful because the dragon was really quite good. The problem with this series is that Jackson has fallen into the trap of making money before passion for his art. That is OK in itself as most film makers do exactly the same and always have and always will but why does he do it? Good question. I mean he has enough cash does he not? He has enough fame does he not? So why? Well, because ultimately he was never really been a hero of film making at all. Disguised in his hobbit cloak he tricked almost everybody into believing the garbage he was saying but now we all know where his true allegiance lies. In the gold at the bottom of the mountain. The ring has him firmly in its grasp and such a shame too. Will not be supporting any further of his ventures and I will never forgive him for selling out to the true Tolkien spirit. Should have made one good film and end it there but NO. Sequels mean cash and so it is as it has always been. The mind of man summed up in a travesty of deceit.",2,2,2,25 April 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," one is the only number
","I am so sad that this has happened again. QT is just a stupid and loathsome fool who has exceptional skills in making films. This was again a total failure not as a film but as a message, plot, theme whatever. The acting is however superb. The feel of the movie is also very good and I am sure this will get a great run for an Oscar and why should it not in the land of HOLLYWOOD where the real world is taunted by the madness it is created by.
Nero burned Rome in a similar way only here we see people making a fortune and being ever so smug about their own self importance.
Can I adequately express my disgust at this film and QT? I do not think so but I am sure a silver bullet would do the trick. Pity about the silver of course.",1,4,5,23 November 2019
Ex Machina," Not a bad effort
","Obviously this film has a ZEITGEIST aspect and is a novelty within the present development of the digital age. None of the content is not widely known so the impact of the film is not as earthshaking as lets say 2001 A Space Odyssey was. Never the less it was a good effort at exposing some of the AI processes and their attenuated relations with the soft bodied human species. As far as film making goes it was a very classy and somewhat graphically over clean production. I quite like that sort of approach but I can see how it detracts from the content of the film in regards to its 'HUMANISM' dilemma. If you are already living in a sterile surrounding then it is not unimaginable to behave even more 'ROBOT' like. This is all however quite irrelevant to the overall theme of the film. Will this film become a cult classic. I do not think it deserves it but it surely is worth advocating that people see it for themselves and do not let critics sway their opinions. Did it educate me in any new way? NO! Emphatically not. Did the antagonist deserve his comeuppence? Definitely not. Was this the area of the script which made me feel that this film failed? YES! The stark contrast of creator come bad guy was overblown and quite unrealistic. The approach taken by the director was to walk a fine line between science fact and fiction and still entertain the masses. Maybe a more defined approach tending to the fiction side may have proved more rewarding? A lot of effort was put into this film for sure and the girl acted her part very convincingly. That part of the script was quite successful in my opinion and she was obviously chosen to fulfill the cute aspect of feminism. Geeks love chicks like her. The role of the Protagonist male was a weird selection of a casting decision. I just felt that this guy was never in his role. That may have to do with the script but I think a lot had to do with the actors lack of acting experience and in a role like this it was mandatory. A casting failure for sure. Location was great but again within the context, slightly clichéd. Did I enjoy the film? A little but I did watch it thru which I do not for a lot of others. I usually end up fast forwarding and dumping many films. The reason was that I was hoping to be given a new take on this subject matter or even a seriously twerked plot reversal or something but it never happened. Overall I did not mind it and I surely suggest that people check it out for themselves preferably online as paying for it in a theatre may irritate a lot of people. PS If he does a sequel he should dump the sterility aspect. It was too clean and clichéd. Deeper plot development would also be advised",7,1,4,16 May 2015
Elysium," Such a load of BS and a total moron script
",Besides having to fast forward a few times to get thru the totally dreary bits I must say it was a slog to watch. The only thing that was reasonable was some of the FX and that is it people. There are many who say this is a propaganda film and it sure is for the dumbest in our society who are already democrat voters anyway so this film makes very little difference to the overall political climate. What is very sad is that the people who paid for this garbage to be made are sadly now having to face the fact that they were totally duped by the production people. This film should never have passed the first draft. To associate yourself with this tripe is shameful and it really finally seems like Matt Damon is a total egg head brainless fool. He may be making the bucks but his socialist and liberal utterances whilst sending his kids to private schools etc is just a typical example of Hollywood liberal hypocrisy. I know that there will be many who think this is a great flick but that is normal for a society whose general level of education is below many third world nations. If you are one of these then just do yourself a favor and ask yourself what was the point of this show? What indeed? I assume that the marching moron brigade will never die out but at least we can make them feel really uncomfortable while they crawl on their knuckles from birth to death.,1,9,19,14 August 2013
Joker," The joke must surely be on us
","Lets get a couple of things straight.
Phoenix = Oscar or they can forget ever giving them out again
Joker film = OSCAR as above
Now to the message of the film.
This is without a doubt a ZEITGEIST event of a film. The society especially in the US has reached a divide that is beyond redemption and no savior will exist either.
The darkness of this film is not the character but what drove him to it.
Slow and ever draining attack on his being.
The story had some unexplained holes in it that are either annoying to the viewer or are actually helpful in getting to the feeling of this madness. The not fully knowing allows room for the viewer to fill in the gaps and that means it becomes very very personal. One reason why so many people walked out of the film. Facing the face!
I think that there are many sub elements to this like why were the two social workers and the files clerk black? Think about it. These were definitive decisions in making the film. Then there are the political aspects like choosing that liberal loving idiot De Niro. Then the attempt to very quietly look at this as the present presidents fault. Yet again we see idiots in Hollywood doing what they can not let go. This film is more about that madness than the street madness but that is way to deep for most viewers.
The reason why I gave the film 8 was because of that last aspect. It is not Trump that is the problem it is the people in our society who fail to face reality and make the choice to get up and do the dance. I hope this film sinks into the psyche of the society and I also hope that Phoenix does not suffer from the depth of this performance. It could scar a person easily.",8,2,4,12 November 2019
