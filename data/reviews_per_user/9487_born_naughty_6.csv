Blade Runner 2049," Emotionless
","I never liked Blade Runner, I also never liked similar movies about the same subjects. Androids act emotionless, that's the point of the story. Can things that aren't born but manufactured have souls and emotions? There's plenty of movies out there that ask this question. But without physically showing emotion and without hearing any kind of intonation in the voice, I as a viewer don't feel anything either. And without emotion, what is the point of any story really?",1,5,7,14 May 2018
Underground," Too fast-paced and misses context
","As it is, the 170 min version, is simply not finished. It goes from one scene to another and seems to be missing a LOT of scenes. The movie and the story lack much needed context. Now, I've read that the original movie was supposed to be about 5 hours long and the director had to cut more then 2 hours. How can you expect to still have a comprehensive movie when you have to cut almost half of the content? There's a 5 hour long mini-series which aired in Serbia. I hope that it becomes available because I can truly imagine this to be a masterpiece... if all the pieces are present that is. As it stands now, there's not much else I can tell you, I don't have enough knowledge about it to truly know what the movie is about.",4,5,12,29 October 2015
Frozen," 'the movie is too beautiful'
","I wanna be short about the story because I don't want to spoil anything. It's basically about two sisters, princesses, one of which has magical powers. Those magical powers could be harmfull to others because she can't completely control them. That's all I'm gonna say about the story...The story is simple but well written and it doesn't feel like it's been done a million times before. The characters are interesting and lovable and the animations is beautiful.Almost forgot to say: this movie is a musical, but it works, they girls sing their feelings to each other and it just simply works. The songs are all at least more then decent and performed well.The only two things I'd like to comment on are these: the movie is too beautiful, the animation is just too smooth, the princesses are too pretty and the potential love interests off the two are too handsome. It feels too fake and it would've benefit the movie if it felt more real. Yes, even an animated movie benefits from some down-to-earth-ness. Second, it could've been a little funnier. Especially the opening where the story and characters are introduced was a bit boring. After that it got better and better. One of the few Disney movies where the ending was good and didn't feel completely predictable either.",8,2,3,11 December 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Watch Extended Edition
","Enough has been said about this now I think so I'll keep it short. Just watch the extended edition, it has better character development and just plain better story telling. Also, the theatrical cut feels more like it only tries to impress with visuals and CGI. Now years later we've seen better special effects so it doesn't impress as much anymore. What's left is storytelling, world and character-building. In conclusion these are my scores: Theatrical cut: 6/10 Extended edition: 8/10 Now I'll just write some more lines so that IMDb excepts my review. Because that's what IMDb does, it forces you to type longer reviews even if you have nothing more to say.",6,0,1,30 November 2014
The Evil Dead," I wish I knew what the point was
","I wish I knew what the makers were going for. I saw Evil dead because of all the positive reviews and I hated everything about it. I'm not even gonna analyze it, I'm not gonna pan it as I don't see the point. The simple fact is that I hated every single aspect of this movie and I haven't the slightest clue what the they were going for. So afterwards I was reading reviews and I noticed something funny. With the positive reviews there are two kinds: the ones that love it because it's terrifying and the ones that love it because it's hilarious. So which one is it? Was it supposed to be funny or scary? Or both? I'll say right now, both doesn't work. Being scared and laughing are opposites IMHO. I can't be scared and laugh and I can't laugh and be scared. So horror comedy doesn't work, a parody on horror movies does. Except for the famous tree scene (which I didn't find remotely funny nor scary) I don't see anything here that could be meant to be funny. The sequels and Ash vs Evil Dead are definitely more like comedies. So here's what I think. I think this original was either never meant to be a comedy (it was in no way billed or promoted like one and IMDb doesn't list it as one). I think the audience thought it was funny and that's why they decided to make the sequels into comedies. That also explains why Evil Dead 2 feels more like a remake then anything else. I know it's just speculation, I have absolutely not basis of proof but it's an interesting thought nonetheless. You don't have to think so, I think it's an interesting thought.",1,7,13,20 October 2016
50_50," Good, not great
","This is my first review ever so I'm still looking for the right way to do this. You can read the plot here so I'm going straight to the good and the bad.I'm going to keep it simple. The good is, that there is almost a perfect balance between the drama of a young man being diagnosed with cancer and comic relief. That is, the first and last half hour of the film nail it perfectly. In the middle however there is to much comedy and profanity. I'm 24, it has nothing to do with my age, it just didn't fit in this film. The problem here is Seth Rogen. I'm a fan. I like all his movies and jokes. But he's supposed to be Joseph Gordon-Levitt's friend and all he does is try to get laid. Besides that, he doesn't show any human emotion what so ever, in the whole film. Seth Rogen could really prove to the world that he was a good drama actor, but he blew it. Then a couple of comments. Gordon-Levitt's performance is perfect. The perfect amount of (outside) putting everything in perspective and the pain you can see on his face. The story is well told but it should of focused a little more on the drama. Less on getting laid and more on the relationship with his girlfriend. This is a problem mainly in the middle 30 minutes of the film. I give it a 7/10, I believe that without Seth Rogen, and more focus on the main character's problems, it was easily a 9 or 10 out of 10.",7,3,6,15 January 2012
