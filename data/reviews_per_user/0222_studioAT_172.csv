"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Schwimmer and Pegg keep on running
",Run Fatboy run doesn't really set out to be anything more than a simple silly comedy that has a bit of heart running through it and thankfully it achieves this aim due to some likable performances from Simon Pegg and Thandie Newton.With David Schwimmer at the camera the pace moves from one comedic set piece to another with all the skill that Schwimmer acquired during his 10 years working on Friends. He knows when to go for the joke and when to sit back and let the relationships of the characters develop. No it's not going to be a film that will be looked back on in 50 years as a masterpiece but it is a simple piece of entertainment that can be enjoyed by everyone and in this day and age of silly 3D and outrageous sequels and prequels quality entertainment is very much needed.,6,0,1,29 May 2011
The King's Speech," The awards speak for themselves
",This film deserves all the high praise it has been given. Sometimes when this happens the film does not meet expectations but this one truly does.Colin Firth seems to have the step up from playing the silly guy in films like Mamma Mia and Love Actually to now playing some great parts and getting the recognition he deserves. Everything he does in this film is underplayed and the character beautifully crafted.Geoffrey Rush as always shines and it is always nice to see Jennifer Ehle on screen.A remarkable film that I hope continues to do well.,5,2,4,16 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," Just as Despicable
","To produce the perfect sequel animated or not is hard to do, especially in the case of this film where the original was so beloved.I think the smart move made by the creative powers that be was to take the bits of the original that people enjoyed and make more of them. So yes, we get a lot more minions and a lot more interaction between Gru and his girls.The character of Gru is developed well which was important and there is some genuine heart to be found in amongst a wide range of jokes that appeal to both kids and the adults who've more than likely taken them to see it.This sequel achieves it's aim of bettering (or at least being on par with) the original but I think it would be better to leave the series on a high rather than produce further sequels.",7,0,0,26 August 2013
Moneyball," Aaron Sorkin's home run
",Aaron Sorkin returns after writing The Social Network to pen this great film that allows Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill to give great performances that were well deserving of their award nominations.In the same way that Sorkin was able to write a film that could still be interesting to people who do not have or like Facebook here he takes the concept of Baseball but chooses instead to make the film not about the sport and more about the relationships between the people who are involved in it.Pitt gives a leading performance and the sharp writing of Sorkin allows this to come through. Hill has appeared in a wide range of films but in Moneyball really shows how good of an actor he can be.Overall this is a film for people who both love baseball and for people who have no understanding of it at all. War Horse and The Iron Lady may have stolen the awards but Moneyball is a underrated great.,7,0,0,6 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Nearly, just nearly a return to form
","All 'Pirates' films have been trying to match the originality and magic that made 'Curse of the Black Pearl' such a breakout success, with not much luck.The hope with this film was to focus on the series strongest aspect - Captain Jack - and hope the magic return. And of all the 'Pirates' sequels, this is the one that comes closest to a return to form.Almost. The fact is though that this film, like the previous two sequels, remains too complicated in terms of plot, and too long as well. I thought they were meant to be aimed at children? What child is going to sit for nearly two and a half hours? It's a good attempt at reclaiming the magic, but it falls a little short.",3,0,0,19 February 2017
Men in Black 3," A return to form. But stop now
","Will Smith was at the top of his fame when he made the first of these films. Sadly (and I don't know quite why) time hasn't been kind for either star of franchise.After the second film was largely underwhelming there is a sense that MIB3 is trying to get back to what worked first time around. It doesn't quite pull it off, but there is a fair bit to like here.Lots of the standard sequel plot lines are followed, and if nothing else James Brolin can say that he can do a good Tommy lee Jones impression.I think they should leave the franchise here though.",4,4,6,18 June 2017
Captain Phillips," Slow start. Epic end
","Stick with it. That would be my advice to anyone watching/or planning to watch this film. This is because the start is a little slow. That's not me being critical, it's just the way things are.But once things get going this film is pretty relentless in terms of action, with Tom Hanks doing his normal wonderful job of holding things together.I can't say this is normally my sort of film, but I managed to stay with it through the slower bits and enjoyed it hugely.ITV obviously had faith in it as they put it as their big Boxing Day film in 2016. It was well placed faith.",4,0,1,27 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The return of the force
",After much hype Star Wars returns with the three prequels that will probably continue to divide fans for the rest of time. Visually the film is stunning (by 1999 standards) with the final fight scene and the pod race in particular being very good.The acting is also pretty good with Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor bouncing off of each other as master and apprentice Jedi. However it is in the storytelling that this film falls flat and the overall tone of the film wavers from being a sort of kiddie friendly outing to more of a political space epic and ends up failing to be either successfully. Overall a good starting place for the series and one that younger fans will relish but may leave those familiar with the older films not feeling the full force.,5,1,4,8 July 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A more gritty teen film
","I agree with the other reviewers who have said that this is in no way an average high school movie. While others tend to apply a more rose tinted view or even a version of how adults perceive it to be this film has a feel of being authentic about it.The cast are all pretty much unknowns to me but play their roles very strongly, they capture all the heart and warmth of the subject matter while dealing equally with some very heavy issues. Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame is the big name going in though and once you get used to her American accent you realise what a talent she is.My only negative point is that the film should be higher than a 12 certificate. The blurb on the DVD box makes it sound much more cheery but be warned that there are some pretty dark and disturbing moments within the running time. I think a 15 certificate would be more suitable.",3,1,5,28 September 2013
Skyfall," The sky is falling
","Skyfall has been deemed not only a very good Bond film, but also the best ever.I can certainly see where people are coming from with this view. It is well directed, has lots of action sequences and as with all of Daniel Craig's outings, manages to add more depth to the character.After their absences from the last two outings it is nice to see Moneypenny and Q back along for the ride (both with new faces) and Judi Dench is on good form as M.But the best Bond film ever? For me no. None of the action sequences will live long in the memory as being the best of the franchise and there are too many slow moments.So overall, a good Bond film,not a great one.",4,3,4,31 October 2015
50 First Dates," Average rom-com
","This is one of the many films that people rave about that I thought i'd give a watch.I can see why they like it. It's easy going enough, and has two engaging stars at the centre of it. But it's really a one joke film, that is funny for the first half, before becoming wildly sentimental in the second.It also goes into the familiar pitfall of being vulgar at times also, which is off-putting, but that seems to be the way with modern comedies.It was a passable enough 90 mins, but I can't say i'd be rushing to watch it again.",2,3,6,27 October 2016
Catch Me If You Can," Catch it
","Spielberg/ Decaprio/Hanks - just those three names alone are enticing enough to get viewers into cinemas to watch this film, based on true life events.I can't fault this film. It's entertaining, it's well performed and well directed (of course!), but it just didn't grab me in the same way my favourite films do. Perhaps I found it hard to root for a character who is clearly breaking the law, I don't know.I would recommend it though, because it's a pacy, fun film that is entertaining enough.It just sadly didn't do much for me.",3,0,2,24 June 2017
Ghost," A bit of everything
",Maybe Ghost's enduring appeal is down to the fact that there are elements in it for everyone. There is enough romance in it for women and just about enough humour and storyline for the guys to enjoy as well. On some levels this film also works well as a murder mystery as well.It looks a little dated in places and I have no doubt that in a few years time some bright spark producer will try to do a remake of it.The leads are all good in their roles and the film is enjoyable enough if you look past a few of the plot holes.I think this film will continue to make people laugh and cry for many years to come and the newly opened musical will only help this.,4,0,2,9 January 2012
Finding Neverland," Depp gives a magical performance
","Having seen Johnny Depp in all the endless Pirates films it was very nice to see him give a honed and effective portrayal of J.M Barrie in this strong film from 2004.Not only is it an interesting idea for a film but it also manages to not go for the obvious way of telling it. Depp shines in his role as Barrie and as an audience we go along with his actions, despite the fact that in a way he is cheating on his wife.Kate Winslet is also on top form in her role, with her chemistry with Depp and the boys that play her children feels genuine and this is one of the main strengths of the film.It's not the quickest film you'll ever see in terms of pace but that doesn't make the final moments any less touching or well written. With audiences being reintroduced to it through the new musical version I can only recommend you check out this quietly charming film.",4,0,0,23 June 2015
Meet the Parents," Horrible
","Creud,lewd and just plain unfunny. These are just three of the words I'd use to describe this film.To call it family entertainment is laughable - in fact it's probably the only laugh you'll get. Stiller and co can do better than this and yet seem quite happy to be dragged into this horrible film and its two sequels.The only people who would find this funny are immature teenagers with nothing better to do. Every joke is signposted and even then are boring.If this is what passes for entertainment then I despair. It is a very poor film.",1,8,16,22 December 2010
Darkest Hour," Good
","A good film, shown on the BBC this weekend as part of the VE Day 75 celebrations.",4,0,1,10 May 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Go rogue with this new Star Wars film
","'Rebels plot to get the plans that will help blow up 'The Death Star' - that's the basic plot of 'Rogue One', the first of the Star Wars Anthology series. If as an audience member you keep that in mind at all times you'll follow the plot and enjoy the film.Because there are lots of other bits and pieces that get in the way of this, some useful as lead ins/call-backs to other entries in the Star Wars saga, and others that are really just filler.It's a decent story being told though, and beautifully links in with 'A New Hope'. It was a risk to introduce so many new characters, but for the most part we engage with them. There are a few familiar faces that pop up along the way too.For me it isn't a better film that 'The Force Awakens', but it's a good entry in the saga. There were too many slow moments for me to claim it was spectacular though.",5,5,12,16 December 2016
Shaun of the Dead," A little bit more than a dead parrot
","If you like the other two films in the trilogy you'll like 'Shaun of the Dead'. If you didn't, you won't. In all honesty it's as simple as that really There' a very thin story in place, but really the strength of the film is the interaction between Pegg, Frost and co as they battle seemingly endless undead zombies.Bill Nighy pops up and steals the film as ever, and he is one of the many famous faces that appear here along the way.'Hot Fuzz' is probably the best of the trilogy, but there is a lot to like about this film.",4,3,8,1 January 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not half as good
","The first film was such a surprise hit that I think everyone was caught off guard, especially Disney, and there's a rushed quality to this film. The DVD documentary shows as much.The first film was so good, that even if this film had been exceptional (which it isn't) it would have been hard pressed to top what had gone before.What we do get though is an overly long, ridiculously plotted film, that manages to turn Captain Jack into a parody of what he was before, and suck any fun out of Will and Elizabeth.This film isn't as good as the first by any stretch, and marks the slow decline in quality which would continue throughout the series.",2,0,0,11 June 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The best. Forget the rest
","With every additional sequel the 'Pirates' saga has become bloated and weighed down by its own sense of whimsy and importance. And why do they have to be so bum-numbingly long?! However it is important to remember that this first entry was actually pretty good and contained lots of good moments.Johnny Depp is on fine form as Captain Jack and the Will/Elizabeth romance is not nearly as annoying as it would become in later instalments.It's a good stand alone film really but you can understand why Disney, faced with a surprise hit, would want to milk it for all its worth. Sadly though, the more films that are produced the more the reputation of what once was a strong franchise is weakened.",5,1,3,25 July 2014
Beauty and the Beast," A classic Disney film
",Disney continued their 90's revival with this lovely film that really does highlight all the elements that make Disney films so great. It is one that clearly caught the imagination of people the world over and that is why we've had a couple of inevitable spin-offs and 3D re-releases. It also of course is the basis of the hit musical.With great voice talent and lovely songs this film can be enjoyed by all the family. I haven't seen it in 3D but I would imagine the 'Be Our Guest' and the ballroom scene would be spectacular in it. This film will continue to live on as one of the best films that Disney has produced in recent years and maybe of all time.,10,2,2,13 May 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Average comedy
","A man's wife leaves him and he has to start over in the dating world in middle age. So far, so 'Two and a Half Men'. This actually is a comedy starring Steve Carell, that people are rediscovering now, based on the fact that it stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, who have danced their way into the public's hearts via 'La La Land'.It's a decent enough film. Quite why the review on the DVD box claims it's better than 'Love Actually' I don't know, but it's amiable enough.My main problem with it is that it doesn't seem to know whether it's going for heart-warming or lewd in terms of its humour. It flits between the two and ends up being neither properly.A talented cast do their best with a so-so film.",2,3,6,17 January 2017
Madagascar," Nothing new
","Madagascar follows the trend of animated movies these days by having an all star voice cast that the studio hopes will bring in people. It has the now obligatory in jokes for adults and follows the Disney trick of having lots of cute creatures that can be made into cuddly toys to create synergy.So all the boxes are being ticked so far. And as fun as it is to hear Ben Stiller be a lion this gets old pretty quickly and we as the viewer are left with a strange and overly long story of zoo animals getting lost in...well you've guessed it.It was bound to be the start of a franchise so it's no surprise that much like Shrek and Ice Age before it we now have multiple sequels, prequels and holiday specials. Disney used to be bad at milking their product for all it was worth but now Dreamworks are just as bad.Overall this is a fair film but there are far better examples of animated films for kids out there.",3,0,1,11 June 2012
Ice Age: The Meltdown," This sequel is an equal to part 1
","Sequels are hard enough to get right at the best of times, but following such a beloved film as Ice Age made the challenge much greater.And I think in fairness this film is equal to the original, sensibly upping the ante in terms of plot, while also giving us lots of the elements and characters that we enjoyed first time around.It's a bit preachy with some of its messages, but on the whole I enjoyed this film as much as the original.",6,1,1,14 October 2017
Spider-Man 2," Spidey swings back onto the big screen
","The first 'Spiderman' film was great. This second one though is a classic case of a sequel that's trying to do too much, and ultimately does not much at all.The second half, I grant you, is action packed and good fun. But oh dear it takes a long time to get there. Lots of in jokes and pointless scenes.I can't fault the actors though, Maguire and in particular Dunst are much improved from last time around, settling into their uneasy 'will they, won't they?' romance.For action sequences, it's probably the best of the three, but that opening hour spoils my interest somewhat.",4,4,7,7 July 2016
Pirate Radio," The boat that sunk
","To be fair to writer Richard Curtis, after the success he achieved with films like Love Actually and Notting Hill that adhere so tightly to a set formula I think that anything that moved away from that would struggle at the box office but this film is a disappointment, largely because it has such a good cast and the idea has potential.Sadly though what we end up with is lots of pointless scenes, more vulgarity than we're used to from a Curtis film and lots of good subplots without one big plot for them all to work around. The first twenty minutes and the last twenty minutes are probably the best and even the extensive use of classic pop music from the era can't save it.If you're looking for a good Richard Curtis film I'd point you in the direction of About Time which is far superior to this sinking ship.",2,1,2,18 December 2013
Finding Nemo," Little fish, big ocean
",Finding Nemo wasn't one of my favourite Pixar films when I first saw it but with every passing watch my enjoyment of it increases.First of all visually it's stunning. Should it ever be re-released in 3D it would be quite a treat because the way the ocean is created on screen is magic.Like all the best Pixar films (and probably any kids film) it appeals to both adults and children with a simple story that is overflowing with warm characters (with a few famous voices thrown in with good measure) and the ability to make you laugh and cry. Pixar really do excel at making quality family films that I have no doubt will be entertaining audiences for many a generation to come.I have my doubts about the proposed Finding Nemo 2 but it's ultimately a case of 'in Pixar we trust'.,6,0,1,6 March 2013
That Thing You Do!," Tom Hanks' debut as a film director
","Tom Hanks steps into the directors chair for this film about a small band who go big, before ultimately ending up as one hit wonders.It's a fun film, in which the young cast (Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Liv Tyler etc) give good performances.I don't know if it was intentional or not (if it was it's very clever), but the song the band have is played an awful lot in the film, to the point where I was sick of hearing it.A fun film.",5,0,2,12 February 2020
Dead Poets Society," Robin Williams continues to teach us
","This film was one of the career highlights for Robin Williams and I can see why.This film gives him the opportunity to show off all the colours of that talent, he can be funny, he can be sentimental and in his role as Keating can make you laugh and cry in equal measure.A lot of credit has to go to director Peter Weir who gets such engaging performances from the young actors playing the boys at the school and also for channelling such a layered performance from Williams.I think though while the film is good it is slow paced at times and there are too many short scenes that don't really add to the piece. However,what makes up for that is the heart and message behind the film, and they are the reason that it is held in such high esteem by everyone who sees it.",6,0,1,13 December 2014
Just Go with It," Another dud from Adam Sandler
","Adam Sandler seems to churn out this romantic comedies with alarming ease, regardless of whether they are successful or not. Somebody must be watching them! He teams up with Jennifer Aniston (who again seems to churn out romantic comedies) here for this adaption of a play that sees Aniston's character acting as Sandler's character's wife. Hilarity ensues.Only it doesn't. Full of dud scenes and weak jokes, this film is poor and low brow entertainment.Everyone involved is capable of better.",1,3,5,4 September 2017
Chicken Run," A little plasticine can go a long way
","From the team behind Wallace and Gromit comes this great kids film about Chickens that are trying to escape from their owners.While the premise is simple what is not simple is the great characters and the jokes that come thick and fast as the minds of Aardman manage to create a film that adults and children can all enjoy.The film is nearly 12 years old now but still looks great and is far better than a lot of the films that adults have to sit through with their kids these days. The comedy comes from the characters and not lots of tricks and 3D technology. Aardman in this and in all their other films make well crafted entertainment and there isn't a lot of that around these days.From parodies of other films, great jokes and characters Chicken Run will always be fondly remembered.",6,0,0,7 May 2012
Home Alone," Classic? Not for me.
","Home Alone is one of those Christmas films that pop up every year. It's many people's favourite modern Christmas film too. I just didn't like it.It couldn't cope with the overly sentimental subplot about the neighbour, the cartoon humour was too dark for my liking and as ever I found Macaulay Culkin annoying.It has its moments, don't get me wrong, but would I rate this as the best Christmas film of all time as others have- no! So good luck to you if you're dusting off the DVD and enjoying it with nostalgia. I'll instead watch 'The Santa Clause', a real modern classic.",2,3,8,8 December 2015
About Time," An excellent film
","'About Time' gets a lot of flack from people who spot the plot holes, or who are biased against Richard Curtis films before they even watch them. For me though this is his best work.It's got everything. The first half is classic Curtis Rom-com. We've got the bumbling Brits, the American girl he hopelessly chases, there's supporting characters we fall in love with. It's all fun and lovely.But then along comes the second half that absolutely breaks your heart because the scenes between Nighy and Gleeson are so poignant. For a film to have this much warmth and heart is a rare thing.I can't recommend this film highly enough.",10,7,10,3 November 2016
500 Days of Summer," A unique film
",This film was one of those that slowly became more and more popular upon release and is one that certainly deserves to be hunted out because it succeeds in being a warm and funny film that manages to add a different dimension to the rom-com genre.The simple plot eases the viewer in and the two leads are very likable. It's not the type of film you could watch in a passive manner due to the jumping around in terms of narrative but I like that this film again is trying to be different.There are some very nice moments throughout the films 91 minute run and the ending in particular is very well handled by first time feature film director Mark Webb.The film is a little slow in places and the supporting characters are not well fleshed out but it does not stop this film being worthy of the praise it gains.,Null,0,1,31 August 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Sinking fast
","Filmed back to back with 'Dead Man's Chest' this third 'Pirates' film suffers lots of the same problems as the film that preceded it.It's almost as if the producers just said 'We have Captain Jack, people love him. Lets just give the audience more of him, and throw in a ridiculously silly plot along with it'.Overlong, over complicated - if the second film sucked the fun from the franchise, then this drains it dry completely.It has it's moments, but one funny exchange amongst a mass of CGI trickery every half hour is not enough.Oddly this didn't sink the series completely, but it didn't do it much good.",1,0,2,11 June 2017
X-Men," A solid first outing
","The X Men franchise has been spun off into lots of various directions since the series began on film way back in 2000, but this is the film that started it all.And it must have done pretty well to be the one that started it all. Most of the success is down to the casting, not least Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.There are some slow moments along the way in this film, it's not all perfect, but there are enough big set pieces and examples of snappy dialogue to grab the audiences attention for as long as the director demands it.",3,2,5,17 March 2017
Spider-Man 3," Stay calm Spiderman
","The first Spiderman film was good fun, and managed the rare feat of appealing to both comic book fans and just people who want n entertaining film with a good story when they go to the cinema.This third outing though is so bogged down by what has gone before that it takes a good hour before the plot really kicks in. I know there were plans for a 'Spiderman 4' with the same cast, but it does feel at times like the director is trying to tie up all the loose ends.Maguire and Dunst do well in their roles as ever, and what's nice is that various people who have appeared across the series return.It's a decent film, albeit one that like many sequels before it is trying to do far too much.",3,0,2,7 July 2016
Yes Man," Yes... Well maybe.
","Based very loosely on the far superior book by Brit Danny Wallace this film allows Jim Carrey to do all the things that we'd expect Jim Carrey to do.The basic idea of a guy saying yes to everything is simple enough and the film acts as a vehicle for Carrey's talents as he gurns and mugs his way through set piece after set piece.There are some good moments in the film, but there are equally some dull and crude ones, and while it is an easy enough film to watch but lacks the tongue in cheek humour of the original novel of which very little remains. I understand Wallace's decision to take the spirit of the book and turn it into a film but really there was nothing wrong with the original book.Although Carrey is great in this sort of film the real shining light of the film is the very cute Zooey Deschenel who brings a great deal of warmth and heart to the role.Overall an average film but lacks the spirit of the original book.",3,0,2,22 June 2011
Midnight in Paris," Goodnight Sweetheart in Paris
","Ever wondered what would happen if Woody Allen did his own version of British Sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart? Well if that's the case the closest we'll ever get to see it is in this film in which a Hollywood screenwriter turned aspiring novelist travels back in time in Paris, meeting his idols along the way and falling in love with a woman from the past.This was the first Woody Allen I'd seen so all the talk of this being a return to form meant nothing to me but for the most part it was enjoyable. It's a little slow paced and the ending rushed but the cast are all stellar names and Owen Wilson as the lead plays bewildered very well.An odd film to place as it's not really laugh out funny but equally not overly serious but nevertheless it's a decent film to seek out.",4,0,3,28 April 2013
The Last Song," A good attempt, but not a good film
","Just as Zac Efron did with films such as 'Me and Orson Welles', fellow teen star Miley Cyrus uses 'The Last Song' as a bridge between Disney kiddie films to adult roles.And while this is admirable I think the fact that she teamed up with Nicholas Sparks, a man who seems quite happy to repeat his 'Notebook' trick for as long as the public can stomach it, for this film.It's sappy, it's overly sentimental, and overall despite the best efforts of Cryrus, this film isn't that good.Cyrus does well in her role, and holds it all together well, but I don't think this was the best choice of project.",4,0,0,20 June 2017
Molly's Game," Not my favourite Sorkin film
","Aaron Sorkin is a genius writer, but I find his film work hit and miss.Unfortunately for me this goes in the 'miss' column, as I couldn't really get into the story, or feel much empathy for Molly.I look forward to Mr Sorkin's next work, which I hope will be better.",2,1,9,4 November 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Great chemistry between Newman and Redford lifts a legendary film
","This is an iconic film, and anything I say in this review will not change that.It features some of the best film chemistry of all time in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and lots of great, often still quoted lines to this day.I enjoyed the film, I thought it had some great moments, but the western genre isn't really my thing and I can't say that I'd rush to see this film again.That's not to take away from its obvious quality though.",3,0,6,2 August 2017
Moana," A fun modern Disney Animated Classic
","Disney really seem to be on a run of good form with their Animated Classics (Wreck it Ralph 1 and 2 aside) and this is another good entry.It has a story and humour that will appeal to children and adults alike, as well as some catchy songs along the way.It's well worth watching.",6,0,0,16 October 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Here we go again
","Another reboot?! After three Toby Maguire fronted films (two of which I thought were great) and two with Andrew Garfield (that were OK, nothing special) in the lead it seemed very odd that Marvel would reboot the franchise yet again.Sadly for me third time is not the charm, and this film verges on being a bit silly and dare I say it pointless.Everyone gives decent enough performances, and its nice that it's more of a teen film, but having sat through better Spiderman films, this one seems to come up short.",3,9,23,29 November 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Seller stars...three times
","Peter Sellers, whatever his personal life was like, was a fantastic comedian, and this film really highlights that.He dominates every scene he is in, playing multiple characters with ease. He makes a ridiculous plot entertaining and enjoyable for an audience.While it's never going to be one of my favourite performances from him (the Panthers and Being There take that position) this is a different side to him, and he excels.Overall I'd recommend this film to people who have always wanted to see Peter Sellers in another role to that of the infamous Inspector Clouseau.",3,4,9,12 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The end? Or was it?
",Until 'The Force Awakens' this was the last episode of the Star Wars saga and sees young Luke Skywalker face the evil Darth Vader for the final time.Although it's not as loved as the previous two films that make up the original trilogy there is still a lot of good things to say about this film. Apart from giving us the final showdown that we've been waiting for we are also treated to several other big chases and action sequences.Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher continue to impress and Mark Hamill does a good job of playing Luke's journey from young farm boy to Jedi knight convincingly.The only thing that slightly lets the film down is the Ewok subplot that continues to divide opinion to this day.Overall a nice end to the original trilogy.,5,0,3,28 December 2015
Begin Again," A waste of good music and a good cast
","Having enjoyed John Carney's previous film to this 'Once' I was intrigued to see how he was going to top it.The resulting film sees him trying to replicate the idea of a lost guy being saved by a woman and some music, but moving the action to the US.And sadly much of the charm gets lost in translation, with the almost home made quality of 'Once' being left behind.Levine and Knightley form an unlikely double act and are well supported by Ruffalo, but although the music is good, the story is flimsy and too reliant on swearing to be entertaining.I've read lots of reviews of this film that call it 'charming' and a 'must see'. Sadly I can agree with neither. The only good thing is that Carney more than made up for this mess with his next film 'Sing Street'.",2,9,15,16 September 2016
Horrible Bosses," Crewd but strangely enjoyable
",Horrible Bosses won't be everyone's type of film. Yes it does contain slightly more sexual references than I feel comfortable with and yes there is a fair amount of foul language that is off-putting (and really just not needed) but strip away all of that and by and large this is a fairly enjoyable film.A lot was made of Jennifer Aniston's role in this film and while her character is a mile away from what we've seen before she really isn't that great in this film and anyone could have played the role.It is the three male leads who make this film and their banter helps it to flow at a nice pace. The whole film is far-fetched but if you just accept that you should have no problem understanding this film.At two hours the film is too long and the premise cannot hold out that long. The end is rushed and dry but by and large the film serves it's purpose. It's certainly not all about Aniston though.,1,5,9,28 August 2011
The Polar Express," I can't agree with the praise
","People rave about this film, and despite me hoping to be able to join in the positivity I can't.I didn't like the film, and found the technology used to create the characters a bit creepy.It won't join my list of festive favourites sadly.",2,2,8,8 December 2019
Elf," Christmas comedy fun
","This film has become a sort of modern day Christmas favourite and it is not hard to see why. It has all the magic, heart and humour that makes a perfect Christmas film.Throw in a good script, Santa and a twist on A Christmas Carol and it is clear why this film has endeared itself to so many people.The cast are good - Ferrell may be the star name but James Caan and Ed Asner are all good in making their roles add something to this film. The whistle stop romance is rushed but very sweet and there is enough visual humour to entertain kids while also being verbal enough to make their parents smile.If any modern Christmas film has a chance to be a classic that is enjoyed every year it is this one, because it has all the magic ingredients, and appeals to so many.",7,3,3,27 December 2010
Lost in Translation," A little lost on me
","Lost in Translation is well regarded as being a modern classic and while I wouldn't argue that it is a very good film, it isn't one that would make me rush to see it again.Don't get me wrong, Bill Murray in particular gives a very good performance and shines in every scene he is in. The relationship between the two main characters feels genuine and there is no doubt that the final scene is both highly romantic and beautiful even without words being said.For me though there were one too many slow moments and scenes that didn't add particularly that much. And it's only a short film in terms of length anyway, so these moments felt emphasised more.Overall though a good film and I can see why it is so beloved by so many.",9,1,2,11 August 2015
Tangled," Disney's 50th animation
",Tangled captures all that is good about Disney animation with all the vivid colours and characters coming through combined with some strong songs and laugh out loud moments. It may not be the strongest of the 50 animated films but it is a more valid entry than previous Disney flops like Chicken Little.Unlike The Princess and the frog this doesn't feel like a girl orientated film and the character of Flynn is on equal footing with Rapunzel throughout.The voice actors are all good with Mandy Moore and Brad Garrett of Everybody Loves Raymond fame being the standouts.Although 2007's Enchanted starring Amy Adams was perhaps a better homage to the legacy of Disney there are enough elements in this film to satisfy Disney fans old and new.,6,1,8,27 May 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," And so it ends. For now
","After 'The last Jedi' divided fans (understatement?) it was up to JJ Abrams to return to guide not only this modern trilogy but also the 'Skywalker Saga' (Eps 1-9) to their conclusion.With so much to do it was a huge task he faced, but on the whole he does a decent job, picking and choosing bits from the 'Last Jedi' to take forward, while also paying a lot of lip service to fans whilst bringing down the curtain.Old favourites have their moments, there's twists and turns galore (some work, some don't) but on the whole this is a decent finale.",7,5,27,26 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The saga continues
",This second Star Wars film of the second trilogy irons out some of the problems that were highlighted in the first new film and manages to be an entertaining enough film.Lucas is a good director but struggles to write naturalistic dialogue and therefore some of the dialogue his characters spout sounds clunky and weak.The acting is by and large good with the mix of action and comedy being more equally balanced and visually the film is stunning.Those who are opposed to this new trilogy will find nothing to alter their opinions but my opinion of this film is that it acts as both an improvement from the first new film and also as a good set up for the third part.Some will love these new films while others will hate them for the simple fact that they are not the much loved originals.,5,0,2,8 August 2011
"Monsters, Inc."," Pixar at it's best
",Now i'm a big fan anything that Pixar produces and they rightly deserve all the praise they get because they are pure storytellers of the highest quality and this film is one of the best.The story is simple and told beautifully combining strong voice talent such as Billy Crystal and John Goodman with great visual imagery and animation. Only Pixar can tell a story about monsters from our closets in the way that they can and make the characters to endearing that we care for them.The sweet little Boo steals the show and Pixar tell her story with such heart that is rarely found in the films of companies like Blue Sky.This film fits well into not only the impressive body of work of Pixar but also Disney and is well deserved of it's place alongside other great works such as Snow White and Lion King.,8,0,1,28 June 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Decent enough
","I can't say I've ever really got into this whole MCU thing, but this as a stand alone film was enjoyable enough.",3,1,4,29 October 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Worth the hype
","Riddled with problems during production, what emerges from the mess is nothing but a triumph.With a stellar central performance from Rami Malek (hasn't he come a long way since 'Night at the Museum'!) as the legendary Queen front man Freddie Mercury, this film is a wonderful piece of entertainment.It's a lovely film, covering the singers relationship with not only his bandmates, but also Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) with a lot of tenderness.Lots of the Queen anthems we know and love are all threaded into the narrative seamlessly, and we end with a stunning recreation of the bands 'Live Aid' performance.Certainly a film worth watching.",8,1,2,3 April 2020
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams at the microphone
","Good Morning, Vietnam was one of Robin Williams' first movie roles and perhaps one of his best.The reason for this really is the fact that the character he plays allows him to channel both his manic stand up comedian side and also allow him to show just how good a dramatic actor he could be given the chance.This film manages to combine that humour without being neglecting the story of the war that was going on at the time. The laughs are aren't but then again so are the moments that really do shock.While not my favourite Robin Williams film I still accept that this was one of the occasions where the great man was at his best.",4,2,6,18 October 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," We begin our journey
","This was an epic undertaking from director Peter Jackson, and it was well worth the effort, and he is able to bring the original text to life in vivid detail.From great performances from the cast, to the great use of CGI to bring some of the books key moments to life, this film deserved the plaudits it received upon release.Yes, it's overlong, and quite dark in places, but it's a good retelling of a classic novel, and even then some details are left out to keep the running time down. Which seeing as it's nearly three hours long to start with is saying something.Well done Mr Jackson.",4,0,4,1 June 2017
Grease," It's still the word, it still has meaning
","Grease will live on forever as one of the greatest musicals of all time and it will do this because of it's story, it's music and the cast who brought it to life.There will be imitations and spin-offs but the original is still the best and Grease captures elements of everyones high school experience beautifully.The cast are fantastic from John Travolta right down to the supporting players while the songs come thick and fast and are still beloved today.At almost any wedding a Grease song will be played and have everyone dancing and this is a testament to this film.Anyone can enjoy it, anyone can sing along with it - in my opinion if you're looking for a musical to watch then Grease is the word.",8,1,3,9 January 2012
Cast Away," A quality film that just didn't grab me
","There's nothing wrong with this film, it was an enjoyable enough watch, with Tom Hanks giving a strong performance, but it just didn't grab me over the long running time I'm afraid.",2,0,4,30 September 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The magic returns
",After the slightly below par 5th and 6th instalments of this saga I was pleasantly surprised with this entry.All the Hogwart aspects of these films are stripped away making this film feel more like a road movie as Harry and his friends search for objects that will destroy the evil Voldemort.It's not without its slow moments but overall this film maintains the ever growing darkness that this series has been brewing towards while also allowing the three principle performers to play some scenes with depth. The cut off point for this film feels rightly placed while also leaving the audience wanting more. All of the normal faces from previous films return albeit briefly but this film much like the last two feel like a drawn out build up for the final film.,7,0,0,19 December 2010
Shrek Forever After," Ogre and out
","Dreamworks have smartly ended this series before it continued its decline. The first two films were excellent and while these last two have still had a lot of charm and humour they have lacked that vital punch that separates a good family film from being a great family film.This film may be a slight improvement on the last one but there are still a lot of weaker jokes and already dated pop culture references that miss the mark. All the beloved characters return but by now the format is looking slightly tired. It is a nice final chapter for the fans but it feels right that this is Shreks last outing. Overall the Shrek saga has been an enjoyable one with lots of nice lines and characters. You could quite happily buy the whole box-set and find good moments in all four films, the problem is that these moments got a little far and few between in the last two films.",4,0,1,24 December 2010
Dunkirk," A triumph
","Although for many this is known as 'that film with Harry Styles in' it is in fact a very good film, from the creative mind of Christopher Nolan, who did the 'Dark Knight' trilogy.With good performances from Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh, this film flies along at a swift pace, with some great filming during the battle sequences.It's far more than just 'that film with Harry Styles in' it is perhaps the standout film of the year so far.",6,1,5,22 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The magic darkens
","After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.",7,0,1,8 July 2011
Ratatouille," Pixar do it again!
",While it will never be my favourite Pixar film Ratatouille is an enjoyable enough film that is visually stunning and full of all the heart and humour that we've come to expect from this company.The story is more complex than an average Pixar film perhaps but the characters are so strong that this never becomes an issue. This film has some lovely moments and the animation is getting better and better.Brad Bird shows off his talents again by making this a film that is relatable to everyone and it truly is a tale about friendship and loyalty and that is endearing.Pixar have done it again and long may their reign as the kings of animation continue!,5,0,1,21 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Haven't we been here before?
","Remakes are a part of Hollywood, but even by Hollywood standards, remaking a film just over a decade after it was released is odd.But that's what happens here, with Marc Webb being charged with the responsibility of remaking the original Sam Rami film for a new (or slightly older) audience.Unfortunately there's only so many ways that you can tell the origin of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, so in many ways this is just a carbon copy of what Rami and co had done actually quite successfully a decade earlier, and it means that audiences are playing compare and contrast throughout.Sally Field wasn't great as Aunt May, Martin Sheen was better as Uncle Ben. I didn't much care for Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker though, he seemed too cool for the role.The break out star though is Emma Stone, and it's a shame she's not in in it more.A fairly harmless remake, but you can't help but think that this has been done better before...because it has.",3,2,4,22 July 2017
Now You See Me," An enjoyable new spin on the heist film
","'Now You See Me' cleverly takes the much used heist concept, adds a bit of magic and ends up being an entertaining and smart film.A lot of its success comes from the talented cast. All four of our Horsemen have charisma by the bucket load, with Eisenberg and Harrelson's banter being a particular high point. I thought Isla Fisher was good too. I haven't seen the sequel as yet, but I imagine she'll be missed. It's testament to the film too that people like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are popping up in small roles too.Yes, the plot has holes in it, and the final third is chaotic to say the least, but if you stick with it you get a great twist that isn't unlike a magic trick in itself.I'm surprised Hollywood felt this needed a sequel. I thought this was a good one off.",6,0,0,15 January 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Just average. Not fantastic
","J.K Rowling, not content with having milked 'Harry Potter' for all it was worth (quite a lot as it turned out) has now decided to expand her 'wizarding world' with this sort of spin-off series.Sadly this first instalment isn't that fantastic, in fact it's lots of special effects holding together a paper thin plot that seems largely to involve poor Eddie Redmayne running here, there and everywhere trying to catch whichever creature has escaped from his suitcase next.There are moments, yes, when this film actually lives up to its billing, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes, but this was a load of old nothing really.",3,0,2,1 May 2017
Ocean's Eleven," 11 was enough
","Ocean's 11 was the first in what became an unwanted trilogy, but I think most people forget the others and just watch this one.And it's not actually that bad a film. It relies very, very heavily on the chemistry between the main leads (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts) but there is a decent story being told too.There's lots of witty banter and one-upmanship that is entertaining and the heist itself is well directed.It can at some points come across as being a little overly smug though, in a sort of 'how can you not like this film?' way. I found it a little self-indulgent as well.Overall, the best in the trilogy that shouldn't have been a trilogy at all.",3,1,3,4 October 2016
Jackie," A strong performance from Portman elevates a simple film
","There have been lots of TV series and films about The Kennedy's and Jackie herself, but while this film doesn't cover any new ground it does feature a strong performance from Natalie Portman, who I often think of as an underrated actress, possibly because of her involvement in those 'Star Wars' prequels.That isn't to say that this film is perfect. There are a few slow moments, and it's crying out for someone else to take the pressure off of Portman, but for the most part this is a good film that deserved the plaudits it gained upon release.If there were more films like this, I'd go to the cinema more often.",5,0,1,2 March 2017
Enchanted," A tribute to all things Disney
","Enchanted manages to be a lovely tribute to Disney films of the past while setting the bench mark for Disney films to come. For a Disney fan such as myself there are so many references to previous films for us to enjoy while watching the film.From great storytelling to great songs Enchanted is well deserving of the praise it received. It is an old fashioned family film that you don't see very often in this day and age of fancy 3D.Amy Adams is a fantastic actress and does this type of film so well as she has since shown in Night at the museum 2 and has all the charm, warmth and beauty to carry of the role of Giselle.This is by far one of Disney's best films of the last decade and is well worth searching out if you are a fan of Disney films or just a fan of good storytelling.",7,0,0,27 May 2011
Inside Out," A good film. Inside and out
","Despite the good reviews I was a little unsure of whether I would like 'Inside Out' going into the cinema. I mean, a film about the emotions in a little girls head, how funny could that be? I am pleased to say that I was wrong. Not only is 'Inside Out' a funny film but it is also incredibly moving, with some real moments of heart.What I love about Pixar films at their best is that they don't talk down to kids. 'Inside Out' is actually a really complex film, but there are enough big moments to keep both kids and adults engaged throughout the film's running time.Having been slightly underwhelmed by 'Ratatouille', 'Brave' and 'Cars', I'm pleased that Pixar are back on form.",7,4,25,20 August 2015
Yesterday," A fab film about the fab four's music
","Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle team up (yes, really) to make this fab rom-com, that in a summer of Disney remakes and superhero nonsense comes as a breath of fresh air.Yes, the premise is a bit too similar to 'Goodnight Sweetheart', but other than that this is as enjoyable a film as you could hope to see.With good performances from all involved (Ed Sheeran doesn't disappoint) and of course great music from the fab four (sort of) I cannot recommend this enough.This film thoroughly deserves to sit amongst Richard Curtis's other greats.",10,1,3,16 August 2019
Mamma Mia!," A cheesy tribute
","Yes this film isn't the best you'll ever see in your life and yes the singing isn't all that hot but if you see through all that you will find a mildly amusing and entertaining film.The pantomime style acting grates a little but the sight of Julie Walters, Colin Firth and former James Bond Pierce Brosnan all having fun as the film progresses makes us an audience forget the films flaws and just sit back and enjoy the film.The ABBA songs link the piece together and are well chosen. Musicals aren't for everyone but everyone has a secret love for ABBA so the two are linked.There are some great musical numbers that look like they have been lifted straight out of Broadway.A great stand alone film that captured the publics affections when it was released. I just hope that the temptation to make a half baked sequel is not too strong.",5,0,1,30 December 2010
Toy Story 4," A more fitting conclusion to the Toy Story series
","Like lots of people I was very sceptical about there being a 'Toy Story 4', after part 3 appeared to wrap up the franchise so beautifully.However, there is a lot to like about this 4th instalment, with it feeling like a lovely epilogue to what has gone before.While perhaps not without it's slower moments, and Buzz/Jessie are a little underused, there is enough quality storytelling and heart to justify the film, and the ending is right up there with the incinerator moment in TS3.I hope Pixar celebrate a job well done by now closing the toy box lid on Woody,Buzz and the gang, as this would be a fitting ending.",8,1,7,14 August 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," A few faults, but on the whole fine
","This book touched many millions of teenage hearts around the world, so it's not surprising then that eventually Hollywood came calling wanting to adapt John Green's words to film.And it's an honest attempt actually. Yes, there are slight changes, there has to be really, but on the whole this is a well made, and well acted film, that will bring more people's attention back to the book, which is not a bad thing at all.It's not the best book adaptation in the world, but it captures the message of the original, and I have no doubt will become as beloved.Not bad at all.",3,1,2,11 June 2017
Wreck-It Ralph," A decent Disney animated film
","Since the early 2010's Disney Animation seems to have a bit of a revival, and this film is a big part of the reason for that.Yes, it helps if you're a gamer and can identify with some of the cameo's, but even that aside this is a fun and entertaining enough film.While it's never going to be my favourite Disney film, it's well worth a watch once.",3,0,1,24 August 2019
Meet the Fockers," Awful, awful, awful
",I didn't think it was possible but this film is worse than the original. I have no idea why a sequel was made.It's the same horrible set up from the original film but all over again mixed with even more horrible sex references and lewd comments from all involved.This is NOT family entertainment - it is smut and that isn't cool. It shows family life in the worst possible light in order to get a cheap laugh.Comedy is a beautiful thing and this film goes against everything that is good about it. It's gross out humour at it's worst.,1,2,3,22 December 2010
The Chorus," Well worth watching
","I'm not a huge fan of subtitled films if I'm honest, but I heard good things about this one so gave it a go.I wasn't left feeling like I'd wasted my time by the end in any respect. The Chorus is a deeply thought provoking and moving film, that manages to appear quite simple on paper but profound in other ways.Not many subtitled films go on to have a wider appeal, but this one does because the central character manages to tap into our thoughts and in my case, remind me of teachers I had who were similar.It's not a popcorn movie, there are no explosions, not big iconic moments, but for a well constructed piece of film this is a good way to spend an evening.",4,0,2,23 March 2016
Cars," Not Pixar at its best
","While visually stunning I cannot say that I am a huge fan of 'Cars' or the sequels that follow.Pixar can create such wonderful complex stories, but if anything this feels a bit simple for them, and probably appeals to younger children more than anyone.",2,1,1,21 September 2019
The Little Mermaid," The film that launched the Disney Renaissance
","After a few years of making decent, if not exceptional films this was the one that enabled Disney Animation to bounce back on a big scale and launch their 'renaissance' that would last until 2000.This film, which sees a young mermaid dream of being a human, sets a template which lots of the Disney films that followed would stick to.It has great voice acting, some ear grabbing songs that stick with you beyond the end credits, and the animation is great too.It's a classic Disney film for a reason.",5,1,2,29 October 2017
Aladdin," A good live action remake of a Disney classic
","These live action remakes of Disney classics have been a mixed bag as far as I'm concerned, with some being good (Beauty and the Beast) and some being poor (The Jungle Book). I am happy to say though that Aladdin is served well in its new form.Yes, like all these remakes they drag the running time out longer than it should be, but there's a lot to like here, and some faithful recreations of the moments that fans will hold dear.Will Smith is of course the big name cast members, replacing Robin Williams as the Genie, and brings his own unique comedic sensibility to the role. It's different, not better, not worse.I enjoyed this film.",7,0,2,20 August 2019
The Theory of Everything," A brilliant mind. A brilliant wife
","I like everyone else got swept along with the buzz for this film upon its release and while I don't think it was worth all the hype it still remains a good film.The two central performances re fantastic and we see the decline in Hawking's condition and the couples marriage from both sides in a way that means we never take sides.There are some slow moments though and that ultimately is what reduces my rating for this film. I wasn't expecting big bangs or anything, but some of the scenes felt like they were recapping what we as an audience could put together in our own heads.A warning also for those of you of a squeamish disposition, in some cases we do see what goes on in a operation and it could be quite upsetting for some.Overall though a good film that tracks what Jane Hawking had written in her earlier book.",5,2,3,1 November 2015
Frozen," The one word Disney titled films continue to be hits
","After the recent successes of Tangled and Wreck It Ralph various members of both creative teams combine to create this latest Disney animated film and thankfully it manages to keep up the roll that the studio seem to be on.Frozen is similar in look to Tangled and combines all the stunning visuals and strong characterisation that made that film so strong. People expecting a straight adaptation of The Snow Queen will be left disappointed as apart from a few character names Disney re-invent the story for a whole new generation. The character of Olaf also continues the long tradition of scene stealing sidekicks.Although the plot is a little complicated at times there are enough twists to keep you entertained and the songs are memorable enough to have you humming them as you leave the cinema.Overall, not classic Disney but good enough to continue their good run of form.",6,1,6,15 December 2013
P.S. I Love You," Soft centred stuff
",Despite a couple of really bad attempts at an Irish accent this is a fair film that never really gets going. The first half hour drags by and before you get too into it the film wraps up.Hillary Swank is on top form as Holly as she tries to get over the loss of her husband played by Gerard Butler and is well supported by Lisa Kudrow who gets all the best lines.It is a soppy film and there isn't really much for guys to enjoy but they aren't really the target audience. This film is a good old fashioned weepy and once the story gets going the tissues become as needed as the popcorn.Not a film for everyone (as I think the box office takings showed) but it is well worth watching as the cast try to bring the original novel by Cecelia Ahern to the big screen.,6,0,0,16 January 2011
Good Will Hunting," Robin William's is great. The rest of the film is average
","'Good Will Hunting' is a film of two halves for me. There's loads of fairly uninteresting 'buddy scenes' between Damon and Affleck, and any scene involving Minnie Driver's character is a write off, but in the middle of all of that dross is an amazing performance from the late, great Robin Williams.His scenes with Matt Damon are so good. In fact if you could go on You Tube and watch only those bits I'd suggest it. Williams remains the warm and funny legend that we've seen in his comedies, but here he is also slightly more guarded and restrained. The poetry of the dialogue and his delivery all match up to make for some lovely moments.It's just a shame that they appear in an uneven film, that is F-bomb heavy and at times slow.",5,1,2,30 October 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," I daydreamed whilst watching this film
","Ben Stiller can play amiable better than most, so to cast him as permanent dreamer Walter Mitty was a no brainer.That doesn't mean it was certain to be a good film, which it wasn't.Slow, drawn out, and all on Stiller's shoulders. I could never really get into this film, especially as all his day dreams seemed to end up with him fighting someone. Surely someone should have picked up that this was just one over stretched (I didn't like the Stretch Armstrong thing either)joke.I like Stiller, I like Walter Mitty. I did not like this modern interpretation.",2,0,3,15 June 2016
The Lion King," An alterative to the original
","Disney's recent trend of remaking their animated classics continues here, with 'The Lion King' being given the same treatment.There's a lot to like here. Visually it's stunning, and unlike 'The Jungle Book', here the original plot is adhered too (in some cases shot for shot), but longer.I liked some of the new voice cast better than the originals, and vice versa, but this made for an engaging and interesting reimagining of the beloved film.",7,2,6,16 August 2019
The Incredibles," Not quite incredible, but certainly still good.
","Made when Pixar really were at their absolute peak, this is an entertaining film that manages to find that hallowed ground of appealing to both kids and adults.It's a smartly written film, with some good vocal work from people like Holly Hunter and Samuel Jackson. Some of the animation at times is breath-taking too.It's a bit long though, which may put some younger children off, and the plot is stretched out a little too.On the whole though this is quality entertainment from the era where every Pixar film was a winner.",4,1,1,19 August 2017
Stardust," Not great reworking of the fairytale world
","A modern take on fairy tales was the spin the marketing team tried to put on this film, which is probably best known for the Take That song 'Rule the World' that appears within it than any of the actual plot points.It's an OK film, modernising the fairy-tale genre isn't the unique twist that the filmmakers seem to think it is.There are lots of big names hamming it up for all they're worth, and some decent enough moments.However there's nothing here to warrant the hype, or to make you wish to watch it again.",3,0,5,17 March 2017
School of Rock," Jack Black rocks out
","This is a film that has spawned a tv show and a musical, so it must have done something right.I watched this for the first time recently, having heard all the hype about it, and was pleasantly surprised.Yes, it follows the 'inspirational teacher film' structure, but puts something new on top of it, and features a good performance from Jack Black in the lead.Yes, it's unbelievable, yes, its ethics are questionable, but it's all good fun ultimately.",5,0,1,25 October 2019
Cars 2," A weaker sequel
","Probably due to merchandising as much as box office takings Pixar's least acclaimed series returned with this so-so sequel, that gets a little bit too big for its boost by trying to be a bit of a spy caper with cars.I started playing 'spot the famous voice' rather than follow an overly complicated plot.",2,0,0,21 September 2019
Ghostbusters," A decent comedy
","Ghostbusters is an iconic film, and for many people their favourite film. And don't get me wrong, I watched and enjoyed it.But would I say it was my favourite film or indeed that I'd rush to see it again, no.The cast all give good performances and there's no denying that the special effects for 1984 are great, but it just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would.Overall, I had a decent time watching this film and laughed out loud on several occasions. Personal preference though means that I cannot say it will rank as one of my all time favourite shows.",3,6,15,8 June 2016
Shrek the Third," Three shrek's and you're out
",People have a lot of affection for the first and second Shrek films and this one did prove to be a bit of a let down but judged on it's own it is a fair sequel that does have a lot of heart and charm. The plot as many have said is very ordinary and feels like one of those straight to DVD sequels that Disney made throughout the late nineties. It tries to pack in all the characters we've grown to love in these films but fails to do them all justice. It has it's moments but just cannot match the earlier films in the series. I believe the decision to wrap the franchise up after the fourth instalment may have been a wise move by Dreamworks.,5,1,2,10 June 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A vast improvement
","The 'Pirates' franchise has been a victim of the law of diminishing returns in my opinion. However, it was still a surprise to see this 5th instalment being touted as the 'final' film.Salazar is hunting Jack down this time around, with Captain Barbosa only too happy to help. It makes for a dramatic and somewhat poignant finale.I actually enjoyed this film. I thought the shorter running time and the fact that the plot was somewhat simpler made a big difference. Yes, it's all very much on Johnny Depp's head to keep it all moving, but Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush both have their moments.It also harks back to the original film at times too, and that can only be a good thing.I don't for one minute think that this will indeed be the 'final' instalment, but if they do make more they should certainly use this as a blue print to follow.",6,1,1,7 November 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Better, but it's all been done better before
","After the carbon copy remake of 'Spiderman' (2002) that was 'The Amazing Spiderman' (2012). albeit with Gwen Stacy as the love interest (played beautifully by Emma Stone) rather than Mary-Jane, proved successful it was no surprise to see Andrew Garfield (still too cool for the role) return in this sequel.It's a better film than the one that preceded it, mainly because it's not having to cover the origins of Spiderman, and also it doesn't just feel like a copy of what Sam Rami did in his trilogy of films a decade ago.Emma Stone is the best thing about this film, effortlessly playing what is essentially a thin role, but Jamie Foxx is good as the villain too.Like me, Marvel obviously weren't convinced by this these films. Garfield got the boot, and yet another 'Spiderman' reboot has just been released.",3,1,3,22 July 2017
Back to the Future Part III," Not quite as good as the previous two trips in time
","To come back for a sequel to a beloved film is risky in itself, but 'Back to the Future part 2' managed to be a good addition. However, to come back again for a third go is riskier still.I'm not a big fan of westerns, so this film is perhaps my least favourite of the three. I can't deny it had its moments, but for me the fact that the plot was more centred on Doc rather than Marty put me off a little.It's good, but for me not great.",3,0,6,5 September 2017
Men in Black II," Not great
","I can understand why they would want to make a sequel to MIB, but that doesn't mean they should've.This film falls into the trap many sequels do, in the sense that they try to do too much, whilst keeping true to what made the original work, and it in the end doesn't do either that well.There are starry cameos along the way, but they can't hide the fact that this sequel isn't that good.Smith and Lee Jones remain good in their roles, and their chemistry carries some of the film through its rough patches, but they can't paper over all the crack.",2,2,3,18 June 2017
Wimbledon," Formulaic Working Title rom-com
","If anyone has ever felt that 'Working Title' films have a formula then this is a fine example. Posh Brit meets American girl, throw in some oddball secondary characters played by well known faces and you're off to a winner, aren't you? The fact is no. Despite all the right pieces 'Wimbledon' fails to match the big 'Working Title' hits like 'Love Actually' or 'Notting Hill', mainly because you can see the formula a mile away. The fact that the tennis scenes look notably faked and Bettany and Dunst don't have much chemistry doesn't help either.It should be a big hit, but as this film proves, sometimes the big names don't produce the goods.",2,2,6,17 July 2016
Coco," A return to form for Pixar
","Pixar on top form is unbeatable, and in amongst some so-so efforts came this fab little film.It has a great message about making the most of life ,and not forgetting those gone before, and those are rare things to tackle in a kids film.With lots of heart and some lovely storytelling this is well worth watching",6,0,2,18 August 2019
1917," Worth the hype
","Sometimes a film wins loads of awards, you go to see it, and realise it's not worthy of the hype.And then there's 1917. A film that lives up to the promise and then some.This is an excellent film, beautifully shot and performed.",7,0,1,5 February 2020
Sing Street," Brilliant
","Sometimes a film sneaks up on you and is so enjoyable, so feel good that you forget everything else that's going on in your life and just enjoy it.For me that's what 'Sing Street' did. I'd seen and enjoyed Carney's film 'Once' and loved the music but disliked his other film 'Begin Again'. 'Sing Street' though is on another level.It's got a great story, the characters are identifiable, and each of the songs sticks in your head.Whereas 'Begin Again' seemed to get bogged down by bad language and ex references, here Carney goes back to the basics of 'Once' - characters, stories and music. It's a perfect combination.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. As the final song says, go on.",10,1,2,31 August 2016
Brave," An average Pixar film
","Pixar's reputation goes before them and any film that they produce is instantly going to be compared to their classic films such as Toy Story and Monsters Inc.Brave marked somewhat of a return from Pixar to original ideas after the very successful Toy Story 3 and perhaps the lesser hit Cars 2. With all the hallmarks that we love about previous Pixar films in place this film is well worthy of the praise it gained upon release.It's great that at long last we have a lead character who is female and for the mother/daughter relationship being explored. Visually the film is great and the storyline is fast moving and emotive.My only negative points about it is that despite the main characters being very well fleshed out and developed there are no secondary characters to provide as many comic relief moments and those that are, aren't that funny.Overall the elements are all there but for me Brave does not match up to the very high standards that Pixar have set prior.",4,0,3,2 June 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Good, but doesn't match the hype
","A rag tag group of misfits try to defend the galaxy - that's the basic plot, though it's stretched to breaking point.There was so much hype surrounding this film upon release and for the sequel that followed that I thought I'd better check it out.And what I found was a decent film, certainly one of the better Marvel film adaptations, full of good music and a sense of humour that is lacking in some of the other similar films.Despite good performances from all involved I can't say it's a film I'd ever wish to see again, but it was enjoyable enough.",3,1,2,6 September 2017
Shrek 2," Another chapter of the Shrek saga
",Shrek was a massive hit so it's no surprise that this sequel soon followed in 2004 and again proved that sequels can be better than the original.The plot is kept simple with the addition of new characters only helping this to come across while also leaving lots of room for returning characters such as the gingerbread man to have their moment.This perhaps marked the high point of the Shrek saga as the two later sequels really lacked the spark that made these first two so great. Maybe Dreamworks got greedy and tried to create a franchise when there really wasn't scope for one.Overall a worthwhile sequel to watch but I would stop after this one before the lovable ogre starts to out stay his welcome.,7,0,1,1 June 2011
Here Comes the Boom," An average Kevin James film
","Kevin James has a natural likeability, and all of the films he has made have cashed in on this factor, with mixed results.This isn't a bad film, certainly not his worse, but it does run out of steam in its 3rd act sadly.",2,2,3,29 October 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Dahl's greatest creation on the big screen
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp combine to bring the classic novel by Roald Dahl to the big screen and manage to capture all of the elements that make the original book so beloved even to this day.Depp is the perfect Wonka and brings all the elements that people have had in their heads about the character onto the screen. He's creepy, he's funny but at all times he is believable and it is his persona that helps carry the film.The film itself is visually stunning and the cast is great. It perhaps is a little long for a kids film but is certainly well worth watching if you are a fan of the original book or find the Gene Wilder version a little too twee.",5,1,2,27 April 2012
The Dark Knight," A dark Batman film
","Of course this film sadly had extra weight attached to it as it features one of the last performances (and what a performance it is) from Heath Ledger.Other than that this is an above average superhero film, that again adds new depth to the Batman mythology.It's very, very dark at times, and it made me somehow miss the lighter Batman films of the 90's, but its quality as a film can't be denied.",3,2,3,29 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The slow build begins
","This was my least favourite book of the series as it only really acts as a long winded build up to what happens later but happily what new director David Yates has done is to turn that original source material into a worthy addition to the film saga.This film is dark, it's funny and importantly it tells it's own complex story of Harry realising that he alone cannot fight the dark lord. From the leads to the always excellent support this film moves along at a quick pace and shows a different side to the characters we have seen grown up on screen.However it is a long film with only the last half an hour being what you would call action packed but once it all kicks off it makes for a thrilling conclusion.",5,0,0,18 August 2013
Annie Hall," I didn't get the hype.
","People love 'Annie Hall'. They rave about it and regularly claim it's the most influential film on their lives.So I watched it. And I can't say it did much for me. Sorry.I think it's mainly down to the fact that I found Woody Allen's character annoying. Yes, it was endearing for a bit, but over the course of the film I lost patience with him and his neurotic behaviour.At times it felt more like a collection of sketches rather than a film, with some being funny, and others not.My review is largely pointless, I know. Those that love 'Annie Hall' will continue to watch it and get others to do so too. But for me 'Annie Hall' is a tad overrated.",2,16,29,12 September 2016
Toy Story," A film that will last for infinity and beyond
",This film will continue to delight children for many years to come and will truly last the test of time because of it's simple story and bright and interesting characters. This was probably one of the first family films that adults could really enjoy as well and it is a testament to Disney and Pixar that other companies have tried to do this in their own films.The voice cast is fantastic and it is great that they all returned for the 1999 sequel as well as the soon to be released third film.Overall this was one of the main films of my childhood and I still enjoy it very much today. No matter how many films Dreamworks milk the Shrek franchise for it will never have the heart or the humour of Toy Story.,10,0,0,13 June 2010
Toy Story 2," The sequel is equal
",Sequels rarely match or better their original but Toy Story 2 is just as good a film as Toy Story.The animation is fantastic and the characters look much more lifelike. The story has so much heart that it moves you and I agree with another reviewer that this film indeed does mirror life at times.Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lead the great voice cast (surely the best voice cast ever)and their parts fit them like a glove.All the supporting cast that you loved first time round all return and unlike many Disney sequels are all voiced by the same actors.As with the first film Toy Story 2 can be enjoyed by all ages with the jokes coming at a fast pace. The Toy Story films will always be special to me and I can't separate the two as to which is better. Roll on Toy Story 3.,9,0,1,13 June 2010
The Artist," Silence is golden
",There are a lot of films that get massive hype and then do not live up to the expectation but The Artist does in many ways.It's been said that the film is a love letter to Hollywood and I would agree with that. It has a simple story and has such a fluid and lavish look to it that you instantly sit up and take attention to it. Although very few words are said you follow the story effortlessly. The actors play their parts well and the music used throughout is great.I can only say that this film is well worth watching and is probably only one of a few from recent times that capture the spirit of old fashioned Hollywood glamour and can be enjoyed by all ages. All the praise and awards this film gain/ gained are deserved.,8,0,2,9 June 2012
La La Land," Worth the hype
","There was so much hype surrounding 'La La Land' before it even came out, so I thought I'd go and see if it was worth the hype.The answer happily is yes. 'La La Land' is a modern musical, that is also reminiscent of classics from the past.It boasts two very good central performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and a story line that allows us an audience to root for both parties.It's a musical, so of course it's all about the songs. And again there are some lovely ones. Some leave you wanting to clap along, while others can leave you close to tears. If that's not what music is supposed to be like I don't know what is.Yes, there are some slower moments, but on the whole this is a rare film that is worth the hype.",8,3,10,13 January 2017
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Same again, only different
","Writer John Hughes was a clever man. He knew that what people really want (though they may say otherwise) from a sequel is the same thing to roughly happen again, but with a twist/the ante being raised.So that's what he gives us in 'Home Alone 2' which perhaps is more 'Holiday Alone' as Kevin finds himself separated from his family in New York. Cue the Donald Trump cameo!The format from the first film is largely followed, but despite being perhaps a little overlong, it all works and is good fun. The slapstick sequences are wonderfully staged and there's a nice bit of sentimentality too.A worthy sequel to the original.",5,1,3,18 December 2019
Up," Up up and away
","By now everyone knows the work of Pixar and how they are so capable of producing magical moments of film and if anything Up cements their place at the forefront of animation.It truly is a lovely film - visually stunning, well written and with Ed Asner as the voice of the main character the film flows from scene to scene effortlessly.As with all Pixar films Up walks the line between being a kids film and and adult film with ease and the first ten minutes of the film have the power to make anyone cry and they are so moving.If you are looking to watch a film that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure then Up is the film for you.",7,0,1,9 August 2011
Groundhog Day," One to watch over and over again
","'Groundhog Day' is right up there with the best work Bill Murray has ever done, and it's also one of the best comedies ever made too.The plot is simple, and yet complex at the same time. Bill Murray's character goes on a journey to become a better man, doing some pretty dark things along the way, and yet we as an audience go along with it and will him to do well.There are lots of lovely moments throughout, with the comedy being intertwined with drama and poignancy perfectly.I highly suggest that you watch this film, because it is one that's message stays with you long after the final credits.",10,5,8,3 November 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Very good
","So beloved was the animated version of 'Beauty and the Beast' back in 1991 that this film was always going to attract perhaps more scrutiny than the other films that Disney have taken from animated to live action form.I thought a lot of this film worked very well. Everyone is well cast and all the classic moments from the animated film are brought to life with a lot of class and attention to detail.Yes, there are deviations from the original, with whole new songs and subplots inserted, which people will either love or hate, but if anything these enhance the experience rather than detract. I don't know what all the fuss was about Josh Gad's character being gay, it's been blown out of proportion.This was an enjoyable new take on a classic film.",7,2,6,12 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The magic begins
","This first film in the Harry Potter series spends a lot of time setting up the story for the later instalments while still managing to be entertaining in its own right.The three leads all look very meek, mild and very young but still give good performances alongside their established nearly all British elders. The plot moves along at a quick pace and the former Home Alone director Collumbus is able to combine the magic and humour from the original novel with all the darkness and visual aids that only cinema could offer. Although the warmth can be a little cloying at times the balance is by and large good.Overall a solid first instalment to the series and a must for anyone discovering Potter for the first time.",7,0,1,24 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The magic improves
","This is one of my favourite films in the series as it captures of the whimsy and magic of the book, tells a strong story and also has just the right amount of humour.The source material is used well and there aren't too many parts of the book that are left out unlike some of the other films.All the returning cast are good while the new additions of Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant all add that bit of class to the film.Newell has comedy experience and this is shown with characters like Fred and George all becoming a little more active in this film.Overall a strong film and the last consistently good instalment in this series before David Yates took over for the haphazard fifth instalment.",7,0,1,27 November 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Wonderful indeed
","Like many people I had heard about this film and seen the parodies or things inspired by it but had never sat down to watch the actual film.However now I am pleased to say that I can understand why this film is so beloved by people and continues to stand the test of time. It's now not just one of my favourite Christmas films but one of my favourite films of all time.It has everything. It has a strong story (inspired by a Christmas card no less), heart and mixes comedy and drama effortlessly. It's also a beautiful love story between Mary and George as well as showing us the importance of friendship and loyalty.I can't fault this film - wonderful.",6,2,6,22 January 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The magic continues
",The second chapter of this film series took a slightly darker tone under the direction of Collumbus while still maintaining the heart and humour that made the first instalment so popular.The performances of the three lead actors have all improved by this film and again they are supported well by top class British talent like Alan Rickman and Richard Harris.Although Collumbus' style worked well for the first two films of the series it is difficult to see how he would have managed to cope with the progressively dark themes of these books. Collumbus likes to have a balance of humour and darkness in his films and while that balance is acceptable in these early films it is difficult envisage what the rest of these films would have looked like if they had been produced with Collumbus at the helm.,7,0,2,25 November 2010
The Holiday," I don't get the fuss about this film
","For many 'The Holiday' has joined the ranks of Christmas classic's in terms of films. I wish them well with this but for me this is an average film that is made marginally better by an all-star cast, who seem to be having a better time than the audience.It's trying to be like 'Love Actually', it's trying to be sweet and romantic, but in the end I just didn't buy into Jack Black's character, or the one played by Kate Winslet.It has it's moments, but for me they are far and few between in an overly long film that could've been over and done with in 90 minutes tops.But it's Christmas, we are kinder to films that are trying to entertain us. Even if this one tries too hard.",2,0,1,4 December 2016
Steve Jobs," Sorkin's genius continues to shine through
","I knew pretty much nothing about Steve Jobs going into this film but with the calibre of people involved I thought it was worth a look.I was not disappointed. Aaron Sorkin proves yet again why he has no need to return to TV again with a smart, complex and yet witty script that manages to sustain the film's running length when really it's a film about three product launches.It's not everybody's sort of film, and if you didn't like 'The Social Network' (Sorkin's other film about a tech founder) then it's unlikely there'll be much here to change your mind.However this is a well crafted, entertaining film that is well worth watching and deserving of awards.",6,1,5,28 December 2015
Hercules," Disney goes Greek
",Hercules has never been considered one of Disney's best efforts but it is well worth adding to your collection as it is a fun and entertaining film that combines some basic Greek mythology with good story telling and the music of Alan Menken.The voice actors bring a particular spark to the film and this so often is what makes or breaks a Disney film. While Tate Donovan is bland as the lead Danny DeVito and James Woods more than make up for it.The songs are good and the plot is simple enough to be enjoyed by both adults and children alike.Overall Hercules is a strong addition to the Disney legacy.,6,0,2,8 July 2011
Love Actually," Comedy is all around
",Richard Curtis creates movie magic with this romantic comedy set at Christmas. He combines at least seven stories beautifully and introduces us to the same sort of manic and lovable people that we have become accustomed to in his other films.From ageing rock stars to the Prime Minister this film has it all. As with all of Curtis' comedies there is enough sap and sentiment to sink a ship but really at Christmas we want to be made to feel warm inside and this film certainly does that. Not all the stories work but the majority do in order to make this film an instant classic that can be watched every year at Christmas time.,7,1,2,20 December 2010
Ice Age," The best Ice Age film by miles
",I liked Ice Age. I thought it offered a nice change to the films of Pixar (which don't get me wrong I love but everyone needs a change sometimes) and to play on the buddy comedy idea between the creatures worked well.It's a good film that works on many levels and is one that both adults and kids can enjoy. The voice talents aren't as well known to people in the UK as perhaps they are in the US with Ray Romano being the only one I knew from his great sitcom.However while I like this film I feel it could have worked much better as a stand alone film because the standard was so good and has only been cheapened by the many sequels it has now produced. Perhaps studios need to understand that not everything needs to be a franchise.,5,1,2,25 July 2013
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Lovely stuff
",A lovely British comedy/Drama with a stellar cast.This film has so much warmth and heart that it deserves all the positive ratings it earns here.,8,2,3,6 May 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," And this would be a comedy because...?
","The Coen Brothers have produced some moments of comedy gold over their careers. This film will not join their list of successes.Why? Because this film is poor. It lures you in with a glorious cast, who should be brilliant in this, and then it repeatedly disappoints. Scene after scene of I'm sure 'hilarious moments' on paper, that end up being naff.Channing Tatum and Scarlet Johansson aside this is a silly film, that doesn't know if it's trying to make a point about life/Hollywood or religion or not. In the end it does none of the above.I cannot recommend this film.",1,14,22,17 January 2017
Hitch," A good Will Smith comedy
","This film attracted a lot of positive reviews at the time of its release, and quite rightly so, it is a good comedy with an original premise, as well as boasting a good performance from Will Smith.It's a unique take on the romantic comedy, and allows Smith to use the comedy skills that he honed on his TV show 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air'.One of the joys of this film is that Smith is paired up with the equally funny Kevin James (of 'King of Queens' fame) and their dynamic produces some strong moments.It's perhaps a little overlong, but on the whole this was a good comedy.",5,0,0,4 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The saga ends
","And so George Lucas brings his epic Star Wars saga to an end by finally letting the audiences see how the villain from the original trilogy Darth Vader came to be.All the good points about these new films remain in place for this third helping - visually it is stunning, the acting by and large is good and there is a mix of humour and action running through the film.However likewise the bad points about these new films remain in place -the story is long and complex and the dialogue never really flows naturally.This isn't a bad film and in time it will probably be regarded as one of the best. Younger generations will love them while older fans will still crave the adventures of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.",Null,1,3,8 August 2011
The Lion King," Pure Disney magic
",Disney pull off another magical film with The Lion King. From great characters to superb music this film has it all. Despite telling a simple story Disney capture all the features and elements that make their films so beloved and loved. The voice cast is right on the money and the sentiment that can often cloud this type of film is subtle and emotional. If ever there was a Disney film that perfectly captured the spirit of pure family entertainment it was this one.This film was a huge success for Disney and catapulted them back to the top of their game which judging by this film is exactly where they deserve to be.,7,0,1,23 December 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Worth the hype
","With its all star cast this adaptation of the Agatha Christie classic has bums hitting seats as soon as it was announced, and thankfully in my opinion it lives up to the hype.Everyone involved gives a good performance, and the action has lots of entertaining twists and turns. It was a big ask for Kenneth Branagh to replace David Suchet as Poirot in our minds, but he puts a different spin on the character that is entertaining.I have not read the original source material, so can make not points about how accurate a retelling it is, but for nearly two hours of escapism I found this to be an entertaining film.",7,1,5,11 November 2017
Defiance," Daniel Craig proves he is more than just Bond
",This is one of those decent films that proves that Daniel Craig can actually be more than just James Bond and will be absolutely fine career wise once he hands up the famous tuxedo.Full of good moments and its fair share of gripping scenes this is a decent film that needed more of a publicity/word of mouth following.I enjoyed this film.,3,0,3,29 July 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Nothing special
","This is Guy Ritchie's take on 'Sherlock Holmes'. That alone should give you a clear sense of what to expect from this 2009.I think this film's reputation was spoilt slightly by the fact that the bafflingly popular BBC TV series started around this time too, but there are several things to like about this film, in particular a good performance from the always lovely Rachel McAdam's.It's lots of big explosions and fight scenes, and everything really you would expect from a Guy Richie film. It's up to you as a viewer to think whether that's the take you want on the famous detective.I'm no fan of the BBC TV series, but this wasn't much better.",3,0,1,1 June 2017
WALL·E," Lovely
","Finally, a film that lives up to its hype!WALL-E is one of those films that people say you should watch, but never get around to it.I'm very glad I did though as this is Pixar at their best in terms of storytelling and emotion.It just goes to show that sometimes you don't need to have big action sequences or even a lot of dialogue to make a hit film.",6,0,0,22 August 2019
Finding Dory," Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable
","13 years (yes, it's been that long) since 'Finding Nemo' the talented folks at Pixar again decide to break their 'no sequel' rule and bring us 'Finding Dory'.'Cars 2' and 'Monsters University' had their moments but weren't great, so I was going into this film with low expectations.However, despite there being quite a few similarities between the plots of both films 'Finding Dory' is entertaining enough, with lots of charm and humour.I did find it a bit repetitive at times though. We lost Dory, we find Dory, then something else happens to Dory. It almost seemed as though they were padding the story out.Is 'Finding Dory' set to be a classic? No. Could you just watch 'Finding Nemo' and forget this sequel was made? Yes. But for a better than average film then this is a good one to watch.",4,22,46,21 August 2016
The Terminal," Wonderful
","I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this film, but wow was I surprised.This is a great film, full of heart and warmth, as well as observations about our society.Tom Hanks gives a wonderful performance, but then again when doesn't he?While it is a little overlong, and the snap change in Amelia's character is odd, this is still a strong film.",7,0,0,10 September 2019
Music and Lyrics," Musical comedy fun
",Hugh Grant has and could quite easily make films like this for the rest of his career. And to be fair to the man he does them well and they appeal to a wide audience. This is a sharp and funny romantic comedy in which Grant is allowed freedom to do everything that he does so well. He has great romantic support from Drew Barrymore and the always welcome sight that is Brad Garrett who steals many a scene.The music in which the film is set around is fine and although this film will never win any big time awards it remains a decent film that can be enjoyed by a large amount of people all over the world. It has a good heart and a message behind it. Critics are always looking for smart and sophisticated films and while thats fine it means that they overlook simple and effective films such as this one.,6,1,3,2 January 2011
Despicable Me," Would have worked as a stand alone film
","Like a lot of people I only got to hear about this animated film amid all the hype about it's sequel.The first twenty minutes are a bit slow and take painstaking detail to set up all the characters that we will spend the next ninety minutes. We laugh amiably at Steve Carell doing vocal gymnastics is the voice over for Gru and adults will get a laugh out of the fact that Julie Andrews is voicing such a horrible person while kids will be besotted with the Minions.However if you can get through the first twenty minutes what you'll find is a funny, visually stunning film that appeals to all ages. It has warmth and humour running throughout and is certainly the most creative animated film I've seen in a long time.However do I think the idea needed to be stretched to a sequel? No.",6,1,2,25 July 2013
Back to the Future Part II," Back to Back to the Future
","After the huge success of the first film it was not surprising to see that a sequel was made.And it quite rightly cashes in on the plot of the first film, using technological advances at the time to blur new sequel footage with moments from the first film.Yes, it gets a bit too full of itself in terms of storytelling, but this is a good sequel to a much loved film.",5,1,2,5 September 2017
The Queen," Over-hyped
","Am I missing something here? For all the awards this film won, and the amount of press it gained at the time of its release I sat down to watch it expecting something special.I was wrong. This film is slow, biased, and lacking in any sort of enjoyable qualities.There was so much fuss about Helen Mirren's striking accurate portrayal of The Queen and Michael Sheen's version of Tony Blair, but having seen both I'm still waiting to see what all the fuss was about.I did not enjoy this film. I thought it was poor.",1,4,12,14 July 2017
Shrek," The one that started them all
","The first Shrek is perhaps one of the best family films produced in a long time as it combines all the elements of humour, warmth and good storytelling that these films need.The voice cast is top notch and there are perhaps more magical moments in this film than there were in the rest of the Shrek franchise put together.Dreamworks spotted an opportunity and that is why the Shrek story was milked for so long until much of the magic that made this first film so good was lost. All the Disney bashing is uncalled for as well because without Disney there would be no Dreamworks.This film will remain a favourite for families for generations because the messages are so timeless. What will date it though are all the pop culture references (many of which already are dated) and that may stop the film being as beloved as such classics such as Snow White.",7,0,2,1 June 2011
The Emperor's New Groove," An underrated Disney classic
","When you think of Disney's animated classics (and some of the ones that are touted as 'classics' but really aren't) this film rarely comes up but I think it's well worth looking out for because in my opinion it's one of the funniest Disney films.Stripping back a lot of the usual Disney conventions like lots of songs and cute fluffy animals that will sell a lot of toys, this film is more about slapstick and verbal comedy which means it appeals to a wider age range than just kids. I know nowadays this is more common place but back in 2000 this was a big deal.It's bright, it's got a lot of charm and some decent vocal performances (though I can't hear John Goodman's voice these days and not think of Sulley from Monsters Inc) so once your kids have tired of Snow White and co I think The Emperor's New Groove would be worth a watch.",6,1,2,4 June 2013
Bruce Almighty," An almighty comedy
",Love him or hate him Jim Carrey is a master at what he does. He's showcased that in films prior to this (Liar Liar) and in his newer films (Yes man). Much like Bruce he has the ability to bring joy to so many people.The basic concept of an ordinary man being given the Lords powers is funny on its own but what Carrey and the writers do is create a film that has all the big laughs that a comedy needs while also creating characters that we care about and can relate to. The film also has a moral and a tenderness that Carrey can portray in.While it's clear that this is Carreys film he his ably supported by Jennifer Aniston and the then up and coming Steve Carell who would later become the lead in this films sequel Evan Almighty.The casting of Morgan Freeman in the role of God is also inspired and there are few actors who could play this part with such grace.Overall a great comedy that really acts as a vehicle for the fantastic comedic talent of Jim Carrey.,8,3,4,3 August 2010
The Greatest Showman," Great in every way
","Oh it's fab.Very rarely does a film come along that makes such an impact with the general public for pretty much a whole year.With a lovely story, and some stellar performances this has 'classic' written all over it.",10,1,2,28 August 2019
Monsters University," I wanted it to be great. It was only good.
","With Monsters Inc being the hit it was it was only natural that we'd want to see more of lovable duo, Mike and Sulley. The big problem that Pixar had for years was finding out how to do that, especially as the 1st film ended so perfectly.The solution to the problem ended up being to make this film, a prequel to the original.And it's OK. There are lots of jokes about Uni life and not judging people that are good. When Pixar are good they're practically unbeatable.I found it an entertaining enough film, up until the final 3rd. Then it seemed a bit forced, as the creative team tried to add peril to characters we knew had to be OK anyway.It's a decent film, but I'm happy to watch Monsters Inc instead.",3,1,2,8 April 2016
Casino Royale," A reboot if ever there was one
","After things started to get a bit silly towards the end of Pierce Brosnan's time as 007 (the invisible car anyone?) this reboot/prequel tries to address the balance, and bring Bond into the 21st century with Daniel Craig putting on the famous tuxedo.I thought this film was gritty, and darker than past films, but Craig undoubtedly is good in the role, and Eva Green is a suitably beautiful Bond girl.It's not my favourite Bond film but it certainly is a game changing film in the series.",5,0,5,5 August 2017
Toy Story 3," One final playtime
","Toy Story 3 proves that the third film of a series does not have to be the weakest and that it can sometimes even be the strongest. Toy Story 3 is just as magical as the first two offerings and the quality of the animation is second to none. Dreamworks and Blue Sky should take notes from Pixar because they are the true masters of animation.All your favourite characters are back for one final adventure and we really do feel for them as they try to make it back to the owner who loves them. From Tom Hanks and Tim Allen right down to Jodi Benson the voice cast is strong and the script is filled with the same heart and humour that made the first two films in the series so loved. The final scene is the perfect way to end the film and the series. Although it is sad it is also hopeful because like the toys we know that by growing up bigger adventures lie ahead.Overall Toy Story 3 is a fantastic film filled with magic moments, strong characters and visuals that only Pixar can produce.",10,1,1,21 July 2010
Space Jam," Michael Jordan in a jam
",Space Jam has become sort of a cult film for kids now and many of them probably only know Michael Jordan from this film and not for all his real life achievements as a sports star.No this film is not a classic in the same way that Groundhog Day is and will never be sent to the Smithsonian for prosperity but it is a mildly amusing film that is bright and colourful for kids. For adults there are some nice jokes that will go over the kids heads and i'm sure many a person will have a laugh at the level of Jordan's acting.It's Looney Tunes on the big screen and that's not such a bad thing. Go and check out this film if you have a chance. You'll find yourself singing 'I believe i can fly' in no time.,Null,2,3,22 October 2011
Before Sunrise," It is what it is
","This was the first of what became the 'Before' trilogy, three rambling and romantic films starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.I think this is a film you'll either love or hate, purely because of the style of film it is. There is very little plot, and is very talky instead. That's fine if you're a fan of big powerful speeches, and poetic language, but if you're waiting for a 'big moment' then you're going to be disappointed.I enjoyed this film, I thought it was without doubt a clever film, but I can't say it enticed me enough to make me watch it again, or to see the subsequent sequels.",3,3,4,28 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It all starts again
","Despite the huge love there is out there for 'Star Wars' after the lukewarm response the prequels gained rebooting the saga was always a risk. Especially when there was so much hype about how 'great' this film was bound to be.And to be fair it is a good film and in my opinion one of the best in the saga. It has a lot of action, a logical and clear plot and all the new actors fit in with the stars from the originals such as Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.Of the old crew it is Ford who has the lion share of the screen time and yet again oozes charisma as Han Solo. His interactions with Daisy Ridley (who herself shines) is great and mirrors the Obi Wan/Luke set up of 'A New Hope'.Yes, there are flaws and the plot does feel a little like a remix of what's gone before, but Abrams has achieved his goal of bringing 'Star Wars' back to the head of the sci fi table.",7,3,44,21 January 2016
Cinderella," A true Disney classic
",There have been so many versions of the Cinderella story that you may be surprised to find that some of the elements that you think are a part of the story are missing. Gone are Buttons and Barron Hardup figures that we see in Pantomime and instead we have a selection of cute animals (this is Disney after all) that will either warm your heart or annoy you badly.Cinderella herself is a typical Disney princess but the film moves along at a quick pace after quite a slow first 20 minutes. For it's age it looks stunning and the humour does not date.Although it probably appeal more to girls than boys there is a lot of fun for them to enjoy in the film as well what with the bumbling king and his servant.Overall a classic Disney film that is well worth seeing to bring back some childhood memories.,4,1,7,18 July 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The magic ends
","So after ten years the Harry Potter film series is brought to a climax with this eighth film.All the tension builds to a close in this film with the fate of the wizarding world being solved in a bum-numbing two and a half hours. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give their beloved characters one final run out and as ever play them to perfection. Radcliffe in particular does very well and holds the film together at times. Credit should also be given to Alan Rickman who gives a fantastic performance as Snape whose true colours finally get revealed in this film.Yes there are parts of the original book that were missed out and yes nothing can replicate the imagery that fans have in their heads when reading the book but by and large the director David Yates has constructed a fitting end to the saga and there can be no doubt that these films will long live on in the memory.",8,0,0,21 July 2011
Pitch Perfect," Not worth the hype
","As a previous reviewer has said - you'll either love this film massively, or dislike it massively, it's that sort of film.For me I was left a bit numb by it, feeling neither emotion. The story of a women's singing group bouncing back after defeat, it has its moments, and features some good performances from Rebel Wilson and Anna Kendrick, but it's certainly not worth all the hype it gained upon release.An average comedy. I'm sorry I don't get the hype.",3,1,2,24 October 2017
The Truman Show," A classic? No.
","People rave about this film, it pops up regularly on their best film lists.I ask the question why? Because lets be honest, it's a one joke idea that is strung out for all its worth over the 99 minute running time.I can't fault Jim Carrey, he plays his part well, but what the script really needed was somewhere else to go. There are questions you have while watching this film that you think 'oh, they'll answer that in a minute', but they don't, preferring instead to cover the same old ground.I was surprised to see that Peter Weir (Dead Poet's Society') directed this because although that film was longer, it had more fresh ideas than this film manages in less time.People rave about this film. I won't be joining them.",2,0,3,5 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The 1st/4th film in the Star Wars saga
","'The New Hope' is the one that started them all for Star Wars back in 1977. It is only due to the prequels that we see its real place within the whole saga.It's a decent enough film, ground-breaking at the time.If you're going from prequels to this one you might find the opening 30 mins a little slow, but the pace really builds after the entry of Obi Wan and never really lets up from there.I find Mark Hamill a little too meek and wooden at times but Harrison Ford more than makes up for it, stealing every scene he's in as the brilliant Han Solo. His chemistry with Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia also adds to the fun.Start at Episode 1 and work up to this smart and funny sci fi film.",4,2,4,11 November 2015
Tarzan," Tree swinging fun
",Disney had a period of revival during the 1990's and this film is a good example of how they can still create magical stories after all these years.Great storytelling and music from Phill Collins all comes together in a way that only Disney can make happen with the voice casting also matching the vivid animation that takes place in this film.We get a nice love story in this film combined with some laugh out loud moments that remind us all of the immortal line from Walt Disney that 'for every laugh there should be a tear'.Disney may perhaps have been eclipsed by the hip and trendy animation from Blue Sky and Dreamworks but for sheer heart and warmth you cannot beat Disney and that is why films like this one will long live on in the memory while the pop culture laden films of the two previously mentioned companies fade away.,7,1,1,12 June 2011
Easy A," Almost John Hughes-esque
","Apart from of course 'La La Land' and those dire Woody Allen films she appeared in I haven't seen much of the always lovely Emma Stone's work. 'Easy A' however is a good example of how talented she is.Playing out like an old fashioned farce this film is a lot of fun. It won't be to everyone's taste due to the subject matter, but even then I don't think you can complain too much about the performance Stone gives in the lead. She's funny, she's sexy, she plays the role so well that you almost forgive the slightly questionable nature of what she's up to.Lots of films try to imitate the great John Hughes's 80's comedies like 'Pretty in Pink' ('The Edge of Seventeen' I'm looking at you) but this film does a very good job of gently doffing the cap to them while being its own beast.I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would, and Emma Stone's portrayal was a big part of that.",6,0,0,13 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," And it strikes back with a bang
","Empire Strikes Back is widely called the best Star Wars film (to date) and it is clear to see why.It certainly contains lots of the iconic moments from the series and all the best lines. Hamill, Fisher and Ford all have eased into their lead roles and there is enough action for them all to be involved, even if after the first act they don't spend much time together.Whereas 'A New Hope' had a sluggish start this second film in the original trilogy opens with action and never really lets up after that. There are great fight scenes and technical effects that more than make up for the moments where it all gets a bit sci-fi jargon heavy.Is this the best Star Wars film, the one for future films to beat? Possibly.",7,2,3,17 November 2015
Minions," Minions - small but mighty
","After stealing the Despicable Me films from the sidelines it was only a matter of time before those little minions got their own film. And here it is.Honestly, I know lots of people have been harsh on this film but if you take it for what it is it's a lot of fun and there are some funny moments.The minions are as quite as ever and what's nice is that we start to see more about their individual personalities. The problem with prequels is that it is difficult to create conflict because as an audience we know that the minions are going to be fine and end up working for Gru. However the creative powers behind this film have made it so that this film both stands alone and also fits within the Despicable Me canon.The only thing I would say is that the plot felt a little drawn out at the end. The bad guy (or bad girl) simply wouldn't be beaten! We could have done with 10 minutes less chase scenes perhaps.",5,0,2,11 August 2015
Aladdin," Robin Williams goes blue
",Aladdin again highlights how good Disney can be when it combines all the elements that make their films great. This film has all the heart and humour that a Disney film should have with a great voice cast making the story come alive. There are jokes for all the family and the story can be enjoyed by everyone. The songs are mostly timeless and the film is as beloved today as it was when it was first released.Robin Williams as the genie steals the whole film and is as funny as Williams has been in any live action film past or present. His ability shines through and he elevates this film from being good to being great.,6,2,3,23 January 2011
Incredibles 2," Another subpar Pixar sequel
","While it tried to be too many things and was overlong I found the first 'Incredibles' entertaining enough to see this second film eventually.Unfortunately 'Toy Story' aside Pixar don't seem to have a great record with sequels, and for me this film can be filed in the 'Monster's Uni/Finding Dory' camp, because while it's good, it's just not great.There are some nice moments, but again, it's too long, with too much time dedicated to Jack Jack, who wasn't really that funny the first time around.It all ends up being a bit predictable.",2,2,5,22 August 2019
A Walk to Remember," A walk to forget
","With a plot not too dissimilar in places to the far superior 'She's all that' this adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel isn't that great unfortunately.It starts very slowly, but picks up the pace, but is largely held together by a likable performance from Mandy Moore.Full of clichéd moments, and paper thin supporting characters, this is a walk to forget.",2,2,4,7 October 2017
Spectre," Oh, what a muddled Bond film this is
","'Spectre', much like 'Quantum of Solace', has to follow a game changing Bond film, and comes up short.It's hard to say why. All the ingredients that made 'Skyfall' good are retained here, but the story never quite gels, the set pieces veer from silly to stupendous, and at the centre of it all we have Daniel Craig who looks a bit bemused (and dare I say bored) by it all.The tone is off too. Ok, Craig is never going to be a pun heavy Bond like Roger Moore, but his delivery of the 'comedy' aspects is almost delivered through gritted teeth.It's also a violent film indeed, how it was only a 12A is shocking. Eye gouging, suicide, torture- a trip to the cinema with the kids this was not.It all makes for a muddled Bond film, that has now has its ending spoilt, because despite Craig saying he'd never return to the role, come Spring he's back again.Can't wait after this...",2,1,5,11 February 2020
Me Before You," A surprisingly good film
","I don't watch 'Game of Thrones' - I know that in itself is a crime - so I hadn't really seen anything Emilia Clarke had been in prior to watching this film. However, she's so good in this it's ridiculous. Warm, funny, engaging, it's not to say that she carries the film, because of course Sam Caflin (who I only knew from the horrible 'Love Rosie' does his fair share, but she shines in her role.The film itself is much better than I thought it would be. It's heartfelt without ever being sentimental, it's full of engaging moments. I don't know why the critics weren't more positive about it.I didn't start watching this film with high hopes, but I was very pleased to be proved wrong.",6,0,2,1 May 2017
The Social Network," Sorkin is the king
","When you see the words 'written by Aaron Sorkin' you know you are going to be watching something of quality and this film much like West Wing or Studio 60 follows that rule. Sorkin is a poet with words and his dialogue flows so fluently through every scene of this film. He loves language and uses it to make even the smallest of roles memorable. Every character is real and three dimensional and that is a testament to Sorkins writing.I don't really care about Facebook or how it was created but what I do care about is strong, well crafted theatre, TV and film and whenever Sorkin is attached I know that is what i'm going to get.Hats off to the men - he is a genius.",7,0,1,24 November 2010
The Wedding Singer," A good Adam Sandler film, but certainly not great
","It's since been turned into a stage musical but here is the film that it started life as.It's a decent Adam Sandler film, one of his best some would say. But I can't say it did a lot for me. Yes, there are some minor chuckles in there, and yes, Sandler has good chemistry with Drew Barrymore - but I certainly wouldn't rank this as being one of my favourite comedies of all time like lots of people do.It's got a good 80's soundtrack, I'll say that for it, and it has it's moments,but apart from that this is not a film i'd recommend or rush to see again.",3,2,7,19 February 2017
Back to the Future," Good fun
","This is one of those legendary films that for some reason I just hadn't seen. I have now! I don't think it could ever meet the hype that people put on it, but i can't deny that it is a good film, and certainly one of the iconic ones of the 80's.It's a bit overly long though, and I think it could have been in need of tighter editing, but you can't argue with the quality and performances given by the cast.I enjoyed this film, I thought it was clever, but I can't say it'll be a film I return to regularly.",4,4,12,8 April 2017
The Simpsons Movie," Great fun
",I agree with many other reviewers that The Simpsons Movie did fail to match the high standards of the early years of the series. However this film is still very funny and has a decent story and a lot of heart as well. Many of the jokes are as good as anything we saw in the early years of the show and come at such a fast rate you have to watch the film again to catch them all.Although there isn't much time given to the supporting characters the main focus was always going to be the family. I would like to see a sequel based around Sideshow Bob though. Overall a great film that despite not meeting some fans high standards is much much funnier than some of the tripe that gets passed off as comedy.,8,1,1,9 June 2010
The Wizard of Oz," Pure fun
",A film in my mind can only be a classic if it lasts the test of time and this film without a doubt does this. The songs remains popular and the DVD still sells millions every year. The upcoming West End musical will only enhance the memory of this classic film.Everyone loves this film and Judy Garland gives the performance of her career as the young Dorothy.From the lion to the tin man each character is beloved and the film moves along at a great pace with many of the magical moments still being just as magical to a modern audience as they would have been to those watching it when it was first released.The word classic is branded around a lot but this film truly deserves the title.,10,3,4,18 January 2011
