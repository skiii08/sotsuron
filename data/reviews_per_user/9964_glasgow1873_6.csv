Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic, in the true sense of the word
","This film has everything. Comedy, action, excitement, a story, great effects, good direction, baddies, great actors, horror, monkeys....you name it, its got it.My favourite scene has to be the truck chase. Remember this film was made in 1981. I just watched it again today and you would not think that it was this old. The effects were ahead of their time and the stunts were good old fashioned original ones. Harrison Ford has an appeal that no other actor can ever hope to capture in this genre or role.I personally cant wait for the fourth instalment this year. I hope to god to matches up to the trilogy as films like this will stand the test of time, they just don't make them like this anymore.If you have not seen this then watch it. You have to.Perfect, 10/10",10,0,1,20 January 2008
Juno," See it - Definitely worth watching
","I just got through watching Juno tonight. I originally really liked the look of this but after reading some negative reviews and getting the impression it was another indie flick trying too hard to be quirky, my anticipation had dampened a bit.I was certainly not disappointed. Juno is quirky, it is indie and it is a little tiny bit pretentious in bits. This does not spoil a lovely, warm, touching movie that leaves you with a smile on your face for a long time after the end credits have rolled.Ellen Page was outstanding. She drew the viewer in with her funny, thoughtful and challenging portrayal of Juno. Michael Cera is pretty damn good as the geek (he plays this part so well in all his roles) and Junos father is outstanding also. I particularly liked the way her step mother was portrayed. There appears to be an element of jealously between them at the start, this is quickly replaced by a deep fondness of Juno by her step mother as she struggles to cope with the pregnancy.I noticed so many little bits that I liked about this film. Sure it is predictable in places and it is overly quirky, but it leaves you feeling good - is that not what a film should do? Not the film of the year but a defo must see. Very enjoyable and stays strong in your memory long after the film has ended.8/10",8,2,8,18 January 2008
I Am Legend," Short and Sweet
","First up this film only runs for 90mins. Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing. The fact that its short allows for a roller-coaster 90min ride. The fact that its maybe lacking half an hour means it probably will not be remembered for too long in the memory afterwards.Great acting by Smith. I had read before this film came out that it did not concentrate enough on the emotional aspects of the main characters plight (being alone for 3 years). I disagree though, I think his relationship with the dog and the store dummies proves this point. I found it heartbreaking at times to watch him flash back to his family. This worked very well and made for more than just a dumb blockbuster.The zombies are crap though. The CGI annoyed me. I would have preferred 28 days later type zombies better I think. These guys were not scary at all.Overall I had a blast though. Good fun and a bitter sweet ending, which fitted perfectly. Go see it for yourself.8/10",8,2,4,14 January 2008
Mission: Impossible II," Not a bad film, a bit under rated.
","I first watched this not long after it came out around about 2000. Back then my taste in films had yet to develop into what I now pride myself on. I enjoyed it back then. Great stunts, straightforward pop corn action story, good closure. I watched it again a few years back too and noticed a few more flaws that had gone past me before. From that point on I decided that this film was not a good film at all.My wife had asked me several times to buy the mission impossible trilogy as she had never saw them and was a Tom Cruise fan. I finally done this last week. We watched MI and throughly enjoyed it. I mentioned to her I was looking forward to MI3 but did not fancy sitting through MI2 again as I had saw it before and it appeared to be the weakest of the trilogy. Well...we watched it last night and I must say my opinion has changed again! This story is stupid. The script is wooden and Dougray Scott makes me cringe when I hear his Scottish accent on screen (not unusual for a Scotsman to cringe at his own accent!). BUT - the action is superb. John Woo makes for a completely different feel to the first film. This is a pop corn movie. Don't expect witty dialogue or the European feel to the first film. This is brain dead shoot em up material and its actually quite good.If your going to watch the trilogy then give this a try. Its not supposed to be real, after all its a suspension of reality (like most action films). Take it for that, ignore the poor script and you might just have a nice time watching it. Also, maybe its top flaw is the running time. 90 mins would have been spot on here. Instead we have close to 120 mins. I haven't saw MI3 yet - thats for tonight's viewing, but after watching this I am actually looking forward to it now.6/10",6,9,16,13 January 2008
The Wrestler," Masterful performance by Mickey Rourke, run of the mill film which excels off the back of him
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I liked the idea of it, I like Mickey Rourke and I like Oscar contender films.The film does not disappoint. The story is really run of the mill, and there are a few suspect subplots (his daughter for instance) that don't really add to the film in anyway.One thing is for sure though, Mickey Rourke IS this film. It makes it everything it is and is well worth it. He is totally astounding as Randy 'the Ram' and leaves you feeling heartbroken for him and his circumstances.Its sweet, funny at times and overall, incredibly sad.I really want people to see this film. I will also be very disappointed if Mickey doesn't get best actor for this one.",9,3,3,30 December 2008
Iron Man," Great Fun..........but
","loved this movie. great story, great fun an RDJ is always good. Couldn't help thinking at the end that it was a shame that the whole set up of the film was to start the inevitable franchise instead of a whole hearted movie in its own right, but hey, if more films were like this then cinema would be better.great fun, go see it. RDJ has the charisma an character to carry this hero off for a while to come, I hope he stays in the main role.Gweneth is her usual sexy self and plays the part very well indeed. Suport from Bridges is also excellent. I wanted to see him get it at the end!8/10 (maybe a 9)in fact its a 9 :-)",9,1,2,26 May 2008
