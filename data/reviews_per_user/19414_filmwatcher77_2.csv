The Blair Witch Project," Pretty scary, but no Exorcist
","Pretty scary, but no exorcistThis film is no doubt scary as hell.  However, to pour on the accolades and say this is as chilling as The Exorcist is going a bit far.  I give it to the filmmakers for pulling this one off but I don't need to hear how all filmmakers can now make movies for  $4,000. I think we all look forward to how they will do with a real camera and some film.",Null,0,0,17 November 1999
Fight Club," Violent? Yes, but worth every punch.
","This film is comparable to such works as Easy Rider giant Giant.  While these two films protagonists asking 'what purpose do I have in this world?' The Fight Club asks the same question.  This time the protagonist is us. The American male. 28 years old.  Working hard for his things.  That are just that-things.This film is like getting really drunk.  At first it feels pretty good but later you feel like death and hurt all over.    In other words, the viewer easily gets sucked into the void of Norton's character.If you enjoy seven or The Game you will like this film. If NYPD Blues is too graphic for you-stay away.",10,0,1,17 November 1999
