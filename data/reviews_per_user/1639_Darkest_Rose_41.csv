The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant Movie
","The Blair Witch Project is a movie or should I say a documentary that really makes you think. Are the woods in Burkittsville, Maryland really haunted? Is there there such a thing as the Blair Witch? Three young adults that are interested in the blair witch rumors, pack some bags and some food and decide to camp in the woods to see if the rumor is really too. They hope to get a good documentary and maybe become famous someday. On the first day, everything goes find. On the second day, they get lost. On the third day, the voices begin. On the fourth day, the horror begins. On the fifth day, someday goes missing. On the sixth day, they all disappear, no one hears from them ever since but one year later their footage is found and people decide to make a movie out of it. I think the acting was superb, for a minute i thought that it wasn't acting, but the real footage. This is a wonderful and truly frightening movie. If your one of those people that like to see a lot of blood and enjoy watching people getting sliced into little pieces then this movie is definetaly not for you. I would give the Blair Witch Project 10/10",8,2,4,3 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Uma kicks Ass once again with more Feeling(Contains Spoilers)
","In this much anticipated sequel to the fantastic 'Kill Bill Vol.1',Vol.2 takes us right where it left us before. Uma is not yet finished, but her revenge is close, so near she can almost smell victory. In this volume, the story takes us much more into depth with the characters, leaving us with many long, silent and emotional moments. Don't be mistaken and call these moments boring, nothing in Kill Bill is boring, every second of it is more interesting and fascinating then the previous one. But this is not all there is to Vol.2, the whole movie is just filled with so much witty humor that you can't help but chuckle to yourself. The most wonderful scenes for me were: 1.Uma being buried alive(but of course finding her way out eventually) 2.The anticipated cat-fight(if you want to call it that) between Uma and Elle Driver, and last but not least, the first acquaintance Uma makes with her daughter, that scene brought tears to my eyes. The only disappointing part for me was Bill's simple and quick death, but that is just because I was expecting more.True Kill Bill fans will not be disappointed, for Tarantino is a genius and Uma Thurman is a Goddess in so many ways, I would give Kill Bill: Vol.2 9/10",9,1,2,30 April 2004
The Ring," A Truly Frightening Movie
","After Katie(Amber Tamblyn) mysteriously dies after watching a strange video tape, her aunt Rachel(Naomi Watts) who is a young journalist, goes to investigate what really happened and what the real secret behind The Ring is. This was a truly frightening movie, I have already seen it three times but I still get goose bumps just thinking about it. This movie will leave your head pondering with horrible images that will stay there for a long time. I would give The Ring 9/10",9,1,1,21 April 2003
The Ring," AWESOME!!!!!!
","THe ring was so inredibly awesome! i loved every minute of it. it was so scary and beautiful and sad at the same time. naomi watts is beautiful, and so are the two girls at the beginning. the little boy is trying to be like the kid in the sixth sense great movie 10/10",9,0,0,21 October 2002
Se7en," Se7en Is Brilliant
","Se7en is about two cops, there is Detective Williams Somerset(Morgan Freeman), who is sick of his job and thinking about retiring. And there there is Detective David Mills(Brad Pitt), who just moved into town, he's kind of a loud mouth and though guy. Anyways, Somerset and Mills get assigned to work on this murder where people are being killed by the seven deadly sins. As the story develops a little bit more, you will be amazed at how brilliant Se7en is. The acting by everybody was great and the whole plot, music and atmosphere were amazing. I would give Se7en 10/10",10,0,1,5 February 2003
Underworld," A Waste of Time
","Selene(Kate Beckinsale) a vampire warrior and a death dealer, along with the rest of her kind, is in a war with the lycans and hunts them down and kills them. But things get complicated when a human(Scott Speedman) gets bitten by a lycan and Selene falls in love with him. Slowly she starts finding out about her past, how she became a vampire in the first place and why vampires and lycans hate each other. Now, this movie may sound and look good in the trailer but it definitely isn't. I like old-fashioned vampires, not vampires who wear leather pants, own guns and spend time on the internet. There was way to much action going on but not much of a story. This movie was very boring and too long and just a big waste of time. I would give Underworld 4/10, for some good scenes and because it could have been a better movie if it tried.",4,1,1,20 September 2003
Dawn of the Dead," And the Dead still Keep on Running
","Most of us love our Zombie movies and we've all had our share of them over the last few decades. This newest one, features a couple of survivors that find themselves hiding in the local city mall from flesh-eating zombies who are not about to go anywhere anytime soon. Dawn of the Dead is exciting, creepy and most of all, entertaining. Like every horror movie, it has it's share of humor and laughter and that's what keeps the movie going. The cast features a couple of not so well known actors and the performances are decent by many and well, not so decent by a few. The movie has a few flaws but just enjoy it for what it is, plain bloody fun. Plus the Score is awesome. I would give Dawn of the Dead 7/10",7,1,1,20 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Great Adventure!
","Pirate Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) who was once captain of the Black Pearl and Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) must go save the beautiful Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley) who has been kidnaped by evil pirates that need to spill her blood in order to break a ancient curse. This was a great movie filled with adventure, fun and also lots of laughter. Johnny Depp does a great job as usual along with the incredibly stunning Keira Knightley who I am absolutely in love with. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. I would give Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl 8/10",8,0,1,11 July 2003
The Girl Next Door," How do you want Me?
","This movie revolves around a young man named Matthew Kidman(Emilie Hirsch) who is about to graduate but has absolutely nothing to write in his yearbook and nothing interesting to remember his school year by. Until, Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert), moves in next door and in Matthew's eyes and I'm sure to most of us in the audience, she is an angel sent from above. Danielle and Matthew become friends and start to develop into something more until Matthew finds out that Danielle is actually a porn star and that's when trouble starts brewing, misleading Matthew and his friends into many dangerous adventures.I enjoyed half of this movie and for the other half, I couldn't wait for it to finally finish. It's a nice little, interesting and sexy story but there are just too many messy and useless moments that at the end, you forget what the movie was really all about and wonder what was ever really the point, since the movie seems to drag on forever with no real meaning. The cast tries hard to make it work but the dialogue doesn't seem to agree with them. It's a very forgettable movie but still entertaining overall with some funny situations and a great soundtrack. I would give The Girl Next Door 5/10",5,0,1,22 April 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Funny and Charming
","Andie(Kate Hudson) is a beautiful young woman that works for a women's magazine called Composure and for her next article, Andie has to write about how to lose a guy in 10 days. Ben(Matthew McConaughey)is an advertising executive and he makes a bet with his friends that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Of course, these two meet each other and the scam is on. Andie will do anything to lose a guy and Ben will do anything to win a girl, what they don't expect is that the two of them will fall in love with each other. I thought this was a funny and charming romantic comedy. The lovely Kate Hudson gives a great performance, she was absolutely hilarious! I would give How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days 7/10.",7,45,60,30 July 2003
The Others," Pitch Black Perfect
","The Others is a story that's happening sometime in the 1940's and Grace(Nicole Kidman) is living with her two children in a big lonely house, waiting for her husband to come home from the war. Her two children Anne(Alakina Mann) and Nicholas(James Bentley) are photosensitive and can't be exposed to the light. Grace has to live in the darkness and often feels lonely and hopeless. Grace hires a group of servants to help her with the house. Suddenly, Anne and Nicholas think that their house is haunted and Grace slowly starts to believe it too. As the story develops, you will not be able to stop watching The Others, and the ending will leave you shocked. Nicole Kidman is brilliant and The two young actors are great too. I would give The Others 10/10",10,2,4,25 January 2003
Sleepy Hollow," A Wonderful Gothic Story
","Sleepy Hollow puts me in such great atmosphere and i love the whole gothic look. It was filmed so wonderfully. When Constable Ichabod Crane(Johnny Depp) goes to investigate a gruesome murder in a small town called Sleepy Hollow he doesn't expect that the murderer is a dead headless horseman searching for heads and killing until he finds his own. The story, the setting , the music and the costumes were just absolutely marvelous. Johnny Depp does a great job and so does my beautiful Christina Ricci, she plays Katrina Anne Van Tassel a girl that falls in love with Constable Ichabod Crane. I would give Sleepy Hollow 9/10",9,0,0,1 January 2003
Final Destination 2," Here Comes Another Sequel...
","And everybody knows what that means. Sequels always tend to suck and this one does too. Okay, Kimberly(A.J.Cook) is going to college with her friends and she has a vision that there is going to be a big car accident and everybody is going to die! Oh No!!!!! Unless they can cheat death but then death is going to get them anyways, so what's the point? Exactly, nothing is the point of this movie. The deaths are boring, predictable and ridiculous. The plot was more like a comedy then a horror movie. The acting was absolutley terrible. A.J.Cook has got to be one of the worst actresses ever. The rest of the cast was pretty bad too, the actors were all unrealistic and fake. The only good one was Ali Larter, who returned in this stupid sequel as Clear Rivers. Anyways, i did not enjoy this movie, like I said, unlike in the first Final Destination, this one was very predictable, it went by way too fast, the acting sucked and it was just silly and not exciting at all. I would give Final Destination 2, 4/10",4,1,4,2 February 2003
Lost in Translation," Perfect
","A washed up actor Bob(Bill Murray) and a lonely young married girl named Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson) meet in Tokyo and become wonderful friends. This was such a beautiful movie, everything about it was just perfect. Bill Murray and the beautiful and amazing Scarlett Johansson are wonderful, this is definitely the best movie of 2003 so far. Lost in Translation gave me hope, made me cry a little and made my heart smile 10/10.",10,0,1,4 October 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," Your Average Teenage Comedy
","Bianca Stratford(Larisa Oleynik) cannot date until her older rebellious sister Kat(Julia Stiles) starts dating. A new guy at school Cameron(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls completely in love with bianca and will do anything to get her. When he finds about the rule that bianca cannot date until her sister starts dating, he tries to make a popular jock Joey(Andrew Keegan) pay someone to go out with Kat, in order that Bianca can also start dating. Cameron, of course, wants to do that for his own good because he's already starting to win over Bianca. Joey has found the perfect guy to go out with Kat: A handsome bad-ass from Australia named Patrick(Heath Ledger). Patrick agrees to go out with Kat if Joey pays him a hundred dollars per date. Now everything is going fine until Patrick really starts falling in love with Kat. This wasn't a bad movie, it's your typical teenage movie but that it's based on a Shakespere play must mean something. Plus it's got the lovely Julia Stiles in it, so that's always a bonus. I would give 10 Things I Hate About You 7/10",7,0,1,22 February 2003
American Beauty," The most beautiful movie
","American Beauty is a experience you will never forget. It's my favorite movie of all time. It's just so amazing. Amazing actors, amazing story, amazing everything. Everytime I see this movie, i am so amazed, i own it and i love it 10/10",10,0,0,13 November 2002
Edward Scissorhands," A Magnificent Tale of an Unfinished Boy
","Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful , unforgettable story of an unfinished boy that has scissors instead of hands. Wonderful, Tragic sometimes funny, Edward Scissorhands remains one of my favorite movies. Johnny Depp is the most handsome actor in the world. All the other actors did great too. I give Edward Scissorhands a 10/10",10,0,0,23 November 2002
Save the Last Dance," Smart Movie With Style
","Save the last dance is a story about a girl following her dreams. Sarah Johnson(Julia Stiles) was always a ballet dancer but on the night of her audition, her mother dies in a car accident. Sarah blames herself. She goes to live with her father wanting to do nothing with her past. Sarah lives in a black neighbourhood and no matter how hard she tries, she is never appreciated. Then she meets Derek(Sean Patrick Thomas). He promises to teach her how to dance and how to fit in. Sarah and Derek fall for each other, but the people around them are not happy. They try everything to break them up because they don't appreciate their relationship. Save the last dance is a movie about following your dreams, never giving up and ignoring the people that get in your way. A smart movie with style,class and some nice moves. I would give Save the last dance 8.5/10",Null,0,2,11 December 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Absolutely Ridiculous
","Meet Evan(Ashton Kutcher) a young disturbed man suffering from blackouts and memory loss from his troubled past. The only thing that can help him is his journal, which can make him travel back in time and save the love of his life Kayleigh(Amy Smart) from becoming an unhappy suicidal crack whore. But of course, whenever Evan travels back in time, he manages to screw up the future even more so this Butterfly Effect has really not much effect at all. Now, maybe this movie wouldn't have been half as bad if the cast was different because the acting was just terrible. Starting from Logan Lerman who portrays the younger version of Evan and gives a painfully bad performance back to Ashton Kutcher who mumbles throughout the whole movie and his serious facial expressions were priceless. The only person who gave a great performance was Amy Smart. This movie had the whole audience roaring with laughter and half of them walking out. Note to Ashton: Stick to Comedy and don't mess with the future. I would give The Butterfly Effect 4/10.",4,2,7,25 January 2004
School of Rock," Cute but quickly Forgettable
","Dewey(Jack Black) wants nothing more then to be in a band but when his own band kicks him out and his roommate and his snobby girlfriend are threatening to kick him out, his dream seems impossible. But opportunity calls, and Dewey takes his roommate's job as a substitute in a private school. Of course, Dewey has absolutely no idea how to teach but when he finds out that his class can play instruments very well he decides to form a band with them and is determined to win 'The Battle of the Bands'. This was a very funny and entertaining movie with great music. Jack Black is his usual insane hilarious self and all the kids are adorable and extremely talented. However, I think this movie is a bit overrated and it's quickly forgettable in my opinion but still, School of Rock is an enjoyable little movie 7/10.",7,1,2,11 October 2003
Moulin Rouge!," A Beautiful Masterpiece
","A poet named Christian(Ewan Mcgregor) goes to the Moulin Rogue, hoping for a career there as a singer but then he falls in love with a beautiful courtesan named Satine(Nicole Kidman). But there is one rule at the Moulin Rouge: Never Fall In Love, the people at the moulin rouge are creatures from the underworld and cannot afford to love. I thought this was a very beautiful story. Just the way it was made, all the colours, dancing and music were brilliant itself. But also all the acting was amazing too. At the end of this movie, i had tears in my eyes and i couldn't wait to see it again. I would give Moulin Rouge 10/10",10,1,3,28 February 2003
Empire Records," Open 'Till Midnight!
","A lot of people I know always say what a good movie Empire Records is so I decided to rent it. It's pretty good, but nothing special. It's a simple story but it's pretty entertaining. Empire Records is about a bunch of teenagers working in a record store. Each of the characters had a different story to tell but in a weird way they were all pretty similar to each other. Basically the point was that this store brought all these different people together and made them realize that their not alone. It's a pretty funny movie, with some touching and hilarious moments. I would give Empire Records 8.5/10",9,0,1,15 January 2003
8 Mile," Overrated
","8 mile was way too overhyped and overrated. I don't understand why it got such excellent reviews. I was expecting more from this movie. Eminem is a good actor, he's got talent. This movie is about a rapper wannabe and I think they call him rabbit or something like that? Well anyways, he's mom is a trailor trash { kim basinger}, and the only reason why he even sticks around with her is because of his young sister. Kim Basinger did a great job, even with all that trailer trash makeover she still looked beautiful. The only reason why this movie was any good was because of all that loud music that just makes you want to get up and dance and all that beating up and stuff. Brittany Murphy is a very beautiful young actress but she was such a tramp in this movie. I don't know what to write anymore, I would give 8 mile a 7/10",7,0,0,24 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Funky and Amazing
","An asassin whose name is never mentioned but lets call her Uma(Ms.Thurman)was brutally beaten and shot in the head on her wedding day by her boss Bill and five of his assistants. Now four years after, Uma wakes up from a coma and realizes that not only she has lost a big part of her life but also her beloved baby. Uma is furious, Uma wants revenge, Uma must kill. Where should I start? Not only was this movie fun and exciting from beginning till end, it was a crazy mess. Add some dark humor, lots of gore and a really great soundtrack and there you have it. But that's not all, see this hugely entertaining movie for yourself. Kill Bill is the perfect combination of madness and beauty 9/10.",9,0,1,10 November 2003
Big Fish," Not Burton's best Work but still a Wonderful Movie
","The movie starts of with Edward Bloom(Albert Finney), telling one of his famous yet annoying stories to his son Will(Billy Crudap), who is now a grown married man and about to have a family of his own. Will can't stand his father's stories, I mean, they are just fairytales, none of the stories that his dad has been telling him his whole life really happened, right? Will and his father stop communicating for a few years but when Edward starts growing older and weaker and closer to his dying day, Will and his pregnant wife Josephine(Marion Cotillard) come to visit and the story of Edward Bloom is told. The story is mostly narrated by Will without knowing if his father's stories are true or if they are all just a big lie and part of the story is narrated by Edward himself. The tale starts of with a young Edward Bloom(Ewan McGregor) and his many adventures starting from when he was a little boy and meeting the old witch(Helena Bonham Carter) that lives by the swamp with the glass eye, to meeting Karl the Giant(Matthew McGrory) and leaving town with him, to joining the circus and finally finding the love of his life, his wife Sandra(Alison Lohman). While Edward's life might often sound unbelievable, Will believes there might be some truth to it and he is bound to really find out the story of his father's life and love him for what he was and always will be: A big adventurous fish with an imagination bigger then life itself. I am a big fan of Tim Burton and while this may not be his best work, it's certainly a wonderful movie. All the characters are beautiful and unique in their own way and the movie itself is just simply magical and filled with beautiful moments. I would give Big Fish 8/10.",8,0,0,28 December 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Joel+Clementine
","Joel(Jim Carrey) is a confused and lonely man who falls in love with every single woman that looks at him. But things change when Joel meets Clementine(Kate Winslet), her witty charm and colorful personality brings out the best in Joel. The two of them spend some wonderful moments together but all good things must eventually come to an end. After a big fight, Joel finds out that now Clementine has no idea who he is because she has had all her memories erased of him. Joel decides that he wants to get his memories erased of her also but during the procedure, he realizes what a wonderful and magnificent love he had with Clementine and that he would like to keep those moments forever not only in his mind, but in his heart as well.This movie was like sucking on a jawbreaker, sweet, hard and once you get used to the flavor, you never want to let go. Everything about it was just perfect, it's charming, sad, funny and most importantly, real and very special. The cast was wonderful, the beautiful Kate Winslet especially blew me away. Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst were also great and very entertaining in their roles. This movie is truly great and those of us who love a little strangeness in our lives, will adore it. I would give Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 9/10.",9,0,1,26 March 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," A Stunning Erotic Achievement
","After a party, Alice(Nicole Kidman) confesses to her husband William(Tom Cruise) that she almost once cheated on him. William is bewildered and now wants to have a few sexual desires himself. He goes out at night and strange yet wonderful encounters happen to him. He ends up at a dangerous sex cult that turns out into a mysterious murder which threatens William's Marriage and his own life. I thought this movie was great, it was very creepy and strange in a lot of ways. The dark colors, the music, everything was just so stunning and erotic. I would give Eyes Wide Shut 9/10",9,0,1,1 March 2003
Mystic River," Dark, Heavy and disturbing movie filled with Hatred and Sadness
","Three childhood friends(Jimmy,Dave,Sean) are forced to come together again when Jimmy's(Sean Penn) daughter is murdered and Dave(Tim Robbins) is found to be the main suspect. This was a very dark and heavy movie and at times quite disturbing. Knowing what people are capable of doing when they are filled with hatred and desperate to find a meaning in their sad lives and to forgive and forget the past plays definitely a big part in this movie. Sean Penn is the Man! He is amazing as usual and his performance is oscar-worthy. This movie had a heavy atmosphere, it was quite long but I had no problem with that. Life is long and things take time to figure out. I would give Mystic River 8/10.",9,2,3,22 October 2003
Love Actually," Is Love Actually all around Us?
","I heard a lot of good things about this movie and since I'm a sucker for holiday films I decided to check it out for myself. The story revolves around several love stories and the movie goes back and forth to show what's going on with each character. There is the Prime Minister(Hugh Grant) who slowly starts falling in  love with his pretty maid Natalie(Martine McCutcheon). A married father and husband(Alan Rickman) who has a thing for his younger secretary Mia(Heike Hakatsch). A young man Mark(Andrew Lincoln) who has always liked his best friend's wife Juliet(Keira Knightley) but has always been afraid to tell her how he really feels about her. A young boy Sam(Thomas Sangster) tries to win the heart of his classmate Joanna(Olivia Olson) with the help of his father(Liam Neeson). A young rather unattractive man(Kris Marshall) is sick of snobby British gals and decides to go to America to find the right girl for him. A lonely woman named Sarah(Laura Linney) who has always had a thing for her sexy coworker Karl(Rodrigo Santoro). An old drugged out rocker(Bill Nigghy) who realizes that his fat manager is the only real friend he has ever had. A man(Colin Firth) working on a novel in his cabin in the middle of nowhere falls in love with his foreign caretaker Aurelia(Lúcia Moniz). And last but not least, a couple who fall in love while shooting a porno. At first I thought of this movie to be overrated and I didn't see what all the fuss was about but I have learned to appreciate it. It is rather long and sometimes it feels like everything is just thrown and mushed together with no directions and it makes you wonder if it will ever come to an end. However, it is touching in it's own way and it's interesting to see how each love story turns out. I did not leave the theater with my heart humming happily like the critics promised but it was still a enjoyable and entertaining movie. I would give Love Actually 7/10.",7,0,2,24 November 2003
Scream 2," We've Got a Friday the 13th thing going on here
","SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!hmm, I really hate sequels. This wasn't a bad one, but c'mon who needs a scream 2? Nothing can compare to the first one, it really wasn't neccessary to make a second one. Well basically it's the same story, some guy in a mask is running around killing people. Oh no, who could it be? During the whole movie you keep guessing and then during the end of the movie, the movie gets so complicated and confusing that it made me dizzy. Who else could be the killer, other then Billy's mom? I think we have a friday the 13th jason's mom thing going on around here.And her partner turns out to be this guy in sidney's english class. Okayyyyyyyyy,c'mon people, give it a rest and stop making annoying sequels. But hey! Dewey and Gale live! Ready to be in scream 3! Oh god... I would give scream 2 6.5/10",Null,0,0,13 December 2002
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Wonderful Gothic Vampire Love Story

Dracula's old love Elisabeta(Winona Ryder) turns out to be Mina, Jonathan's fiance. Now Dracula travels to England to find his lost love and spend forever with her. I thought this was a wonderful gothic vampire love story. I loved the way it was filmed, and the costumes and makeup were fantastic and often frightening. The acting was amazing, especially by Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins who played Professor Abraham Van Helsing. I would give Dracula 10/10",10,2,4,8 April 2003
The Waterboy," High Quality H20
","I think The Water Boy is  a great comedy. The main reason i rented it was because of Fairuza Balk but i ended up really liking the movie. It's about a waterboy named Bobby Boucher(Adam Sandler) who is sick of being treated like crap from the other football players and decides to join the football team himself. With the help of his gorgeous girlfriend Vicki(Fairuza Balk), Bobby can achieve anything. Also there is a very funny performance by Kathy Bates, who plays Bobby's Mother. I would give The WaterBoy 9/10",9,1,2,20 January 2003
Scream," Scream is a Pleasure to Watch
","Scream is one of the best teen horror/thriller movies ever made. It is not only original, clever and exciting, but also this movie has everything a movie needs to have. Forget the Sequels, the first scream is a classic that no one can copy. It is funny sometimes and downright crazy. One of my favorite movies, scream gets a 10/10",Null,0,0,7 December 2002
Identity," I Am So Disappointed - Spoilers
","I have wanted to see this movie for a while now, ever since i saw the trailer a few months ago. But I must say that it was a very big disappointment. The movie is nothing but a lame and predictable ghost story. First you see these strangers all stuck in this hotel during a storm and really horrible and cheesy accidents start happening to them. Slowly they all start dying one by one and obviously you start wondering who the killer is. But near the movie you start to predict that the hotel and all those people never even exist, except in the killers mind that's telling his story who was there once and really killed all these people in a hotel when he was a little boy. The ending was absolutely ridiculous and left me wondering what the point of this movie was. The story had nothing to say, except a unbearable pointless mess that's waiting for you at the end. There was also no good acting to save this pathetic movie. I would give Identity 3/10.",3,2,5,26 April 2003
The Sixth Sense," One of my favorites
","this movie is just so amazing, beautiful sad and creepy. bruce willis is such a awesome actor and the little boy does a good job too, 10/10 oscar material, it's one of my favorite movies,  i could watch it over and over again and it would still amaze me",9,0,0,13 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Mindblowing, Breathtaking Masterpiece
","In the final stunning achievement of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the movie finds Frodo and Sam, along with Gollum who has a new sneaky plan of his own, still making the long and dangerous way to Mordor to get rid of the Ring once and for all and save Middle Earth. Meanwhile, the rest of the fellowship, such as Gandalf, Aragorn and Legolas are battling many evil forces and villains in order to save Gondor from becoming a disaster. I thought this movie was just simply amazing. I am a big fan of the first two Lord of the Rings movies but this one just tops it all. Everything about it was just breathtaking. To the amazing battle scenes, the beautiful soundtrack and to the wonderful battle for friendship that will make you weep throughout the whole movie. The best movie of the year so far, it will leave you breathless from the beginning of the journey till the end and the story will stay in your minds forever and in your hearts even longer. I would give The Return of the King 10/10.",10,0,0,21 December 2003
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," A Beautiful And Heartbreaking Story Of A Vampire
","Interview with a vampire is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is about a vampire names louis(Brad Pitt) telling his life story to a young reporter(Christian Slater). His story is just so beautiful and so tragic, at some points, I could feel my heart breaking because it was the feelings and how the vampire explained his life were so real and powerful. The acting by Brad Pitt,Tom Cruise,Kirsten Dunst,Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater was outstanding and amazing. I would give Interview With A Vampire 10/10",10,1,2,12 January 2003
A Walk to Remember," Nice Little Movie
","A walk to remember is a nice sad little enjoyable movie. The acting was solid but nothing spectacular. Shane West, I have to admit, is a fine actor and he isn't too bad looking either. Shane West plays Landon, your usual popular guy who slowly starts to fall in love with jamie sullivan[ mandy moore] an outcast disliked by everyone. Mandy Moore did an okay job, at least she was better then britney in crossroads, but back to a walk to remember, it's a nice movie but when finally landon and jamie fall in love but then there is death waiting in a corner, ruining everything. I had tears in my eyes after the movie finished but however the story has been used one too many times. Sweet November, Autum in New York, it's all the same thing. I would give A walk to remember 8/10",8,0,0,17 November 2002

I thought that Donnie Darko was a stunning achievement, the story is just so amazing and unique. The music, cast and the beautiful dark atmosphere were great. I would give Donnie Darko 10/10",10,1,2,24 March 2003
The Wedding Singer," Very Funny And Very Cute
","The Wedding Singer is a absolutely hilarious and cute movie. Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) plays a wedding singer who can't wait to get married himself to his girlfriend Linda(Angela Featherstone). But when Linda doesn't show up at their wedding, Robbie becomes totally devastated and depressed. One night while singing another lousy wedding song, Robbie falls in love with the beautiful and charming new waitress Julia Sullivan( Drew Barrymore) But bad news again, Julia is about to get married to a total jerk that doesn't care about her and cheats on her whenever he gets the chance too. Now Robbie wants to make Julia realize what a total scumbag her fiance is and make her fall for him. I really enjoyed this movie, Adam Sandler was so cute and funny. I would give The Wedding Singer 8.5/10",8,0,1,1 January 2003
Beetlejuice," Awesome... Tim Burton is My God
","A happy couple, adam(Alec Baldwin), and his girlfriend Barbara(Geena Davis) have just recently died but just can't seem to find their peace. Suddenly this family moves into their house and adam and barbara will do anything to scare them away. With the help of BeetleJuice(Michael Keaton) a bio-exorcist they want to make sure that the obnoxious family never returns. I love this movie, it's funny, original and clever and it always puts me in a great mood. Tim Burton is a god and his work is always excellent. I would give BeetleJuice 10/10",10,1,2,2 January 2003
