Vertigo," Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece and one the best films of all time!
","I experienced Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO yesterday(10-15th time), and boy was I impressed--Not only with the classic film itself, but with the DVD presentation.  It's extraordinary to see an old film like that, that went through a lot, to have excellent picture quality and sound!  James Stewart and Kim Novak are absolutely magnificent together.  And I think it's Hitchcock most personal film.  The music is awesome--it's sets the moods for the scenes perfectly.  It's a great personal experience!! 10/10",10,5,5,28 November 1999
Casablanca," The Best Big Hollywood Production!
","As far as the classic movies go this is the best big Hollywood production I have ever seen.  It just a movie, yes, but a perfect one!  Even though it's a small little story about something not to important, the actors, the direction, the photography, the editing, and the score is great!  It's why movies are made, to entertain!  It entertains a great deal.  The best film acting in film history by Bogart in this movie.You can't analyze this film and have fun with it like Kubrick films or Citizen Kane but your not supposed to with this one.  I feel it's just a regular movie, but the best one at that!  I think in some scenes the music over powers the screenplay because it's such a small story but it's been rated the second best movie of all time by AFI and critics around the world love it!  Casablanca entertains!  Casablanca is a perfect movie all together!!!!!  'Play it.'  It's great!",10,1,1,24 October 1999
The Others," In 'The Others' Nicole Kidman is great!
","Spectacular film thriller highlighted by Nicole Kidman's hard and cold performance.  The film consists of many creepy encounters with `the others' leading up to an unforgettable surprise ending.  Tense, suspenseful, mysterious, but also slow and inactively directed at times.  The real highlight here is Kidman.  The cinematography is also wonderful.",8,0,0,29 August 2001
Cast Away," this might be the one.......
","Cast Away is excellent!Tom Hanks' performance is the best of the year; no music, no effects, no fancy anything for about an hour and a half, just Tom Hanks performing in front of the camera.  He, not only performs, but he shines and entertains and inspires!  His performance might be genius!While I give most of the credit of Cast Away to Tom Hanks, the photography was also good!  The conclusion was somewhat awkward and unfocused, unlike the rest of the film, but still very interesting!  This is one film I encourage everyone to see...NOW!A great achievement by Hanks, once again.THE BEST FILM OF 2000!CAST AWAY * * * 1/2",9,0,0,1 January 2001
The Insider," It's an excellent drama!
","It's really a good film!  It tells a great, solid, and magnificent story with outstanding dramatic performances.  Felt myself really caring for the characters in the film.  Mann creates different atmospheres for the different scenes in the picture.  Great time in the film is when they actually air the interview!  A GREAT dramatic story.  One complaint is---some of the scenes are unimportant(they stick out) and that's too bad, otherwise it would of have been perfect.   (***1/2 out of ****)",8,0,0,12 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," It is a piece of art! Excellent cinema!
","Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) are a married couple with a young daughter.  One night Alice gets high and tells Bill of a sexual fantasy she had with a Naval Officer.  Bill is then set off on a sexual odyssey of adventure and curiosity.  It's a magical journey into the mind and adventures of of man determined to do something about his wife's revelations.  The many different moods and emotions through out the picture is played and is crafted brilliantly!  It also deals with a mysterious masked ball where Bill is almost killed but is saved (redeemed) by a mysterious woman who later in film turns up dead.  This thriller is absolutely extraordinary and the whole two 3/4 hours of the film is entertaining, textural, surprisingly refreshing, and simply perfect.  The great director's last and his best film before he died on March 7th, only days after seeing his final cut of the film for the first time.  It is extremely haunting.Everyone has a different view on the film.  That was partially mine. I've read the screenplay, I've read the novel Dream Story, I have the soundtrack.  I plan to really analyze and study the film more when I own it on DVD.  I've even corrected reviews of the internet made by some pretty popular critics but have their information wrong on the film.  I think it might be too strong right now, but in time Eyes Wide Shut will be called a piece of art, a masterpiece, and  by everyone.Eyes Wide Shut**** (out of four)",10,0,0,19 October 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," Woody Allen's tale about an artist's persona...very entertaining!!
","In 1992, Woody Allen made 2 films...Shadows and Fog & Husbands and Wives.In Shadows and Fog, the filmmaker relied mostly on atmosphere and wonderful photography.  And it was great!  The dialogue was very witty, and Woody's performance was comedic brilliance.  80% style...20% substance.In Husbands and Wives, Allen picked up his camera(hand held) and pointed it towards the actors.  He relies on dialogue and thought provoking elements. So 80% substance...and 20% style.In 1999, Woody Allen realized 'SWEET AND LOWDOWN'.  In it, Sean Penn and Samantha Morton create fascinating characters....and they both received oscars...and golden globe nominations.  They did not win....but in my opinion...Sweet and Lowdown contained the BEST acting of 1999.  It was brilliant!Woody Allen's tribute to jazz is crisp and delightful.  An enchanting comedy in an era of over blown, over stuffed stuff...And that's not all, the substance and style is almost equal for the whole film!  Near the end, Allen gives us a warm, intelligent, and honest dramatic ending.It's perfect in it's own way...",10,0,0,17 December 2000
The Sixth Sense," One of the greatest films of the year!
","I highly recommended this haunting thriller to my family and all my friends. It was great; most of all for three really important reasons.  First of all the ending twist is the best and most thought provoking twist in a horror film since Norman Bates was Mrs. Bates in 'Psycho'!!!  Because a film can not be judged on the ending alone, there are two other reasons why this film is the best horror film made in the 90's.  It's dramatic and caring.  I really cared for these characters even though it was total fiction; that's what really good films do best.  And I also enjoyed the terror and scary images in the film; they were very HAUNTING!  This is a great motion picture.  Only complaint; the Bruce Willis character leaves the boy too soon I think, I mean we are dealing with ghosts here; you would of thought he would of stayed with the boy longer.  Also the film is never truly climatic or absolutely enthralling.  But, all in all this stands as one of the best films of the year; it's on my top ten list!   The Sixth Sense   ***1/2(out of four)   -   7/10",8,0,0,19 December 1999
