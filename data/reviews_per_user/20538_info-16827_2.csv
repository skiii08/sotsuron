The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Delicious to watch, but too slow and too superficial.
","Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are getting married being aware of the fact that she's a human being and he's a vampire. But love is said to conquer it all. The vampire flock however is discontent with the alliance and is planning an attack. When the couple is in Brazil on their honeymoon, Bella discovers she is pregnant. Their first worry is whether the child will be a killing monster or a human baby. Bella might not survive the birth and she also dies, even if the child seems normal. But Bella comes back to life, as a vampire.The film is the fourth sequence of the Twilight story by the author Stephanie Meyer telling us about Bella's and Edward's impossible love story. The film is seductive. Beautiful young people that exist only for their pleasures are exposing themselves through the film. The threat is there, otherwise there will be no adventure, but the danger is magic and with supernatural powers and therefore attractive.The good and evil is not clear in the film as in the fairytale world. The vampires have got their rules and the wolf pack is constant struggling about leadership and how to punish the traitors. There are certainly parallels to the real world, but that's not of interest. The film itself has no message to its audience. It just wants to adore and scare us a bit and also manage to do so. There are some nasty scenes, but not worse that the computer games packed with murders and torture.The film is well made. The costumes and settings are perfect, as taken from exclusive fashion and interior design journals. The casting is also perfect for its context. The actors look right for their rather flat film characters and play their parts as good as they can be done. The graphics are however a bit edgy. The movements and expressions of the wolf vampires seem artificial, which surprises me. The graphic technology shows in the recent film an impressive development, very convincing and well added to the pictures.The Twilight story is a worldwide success in books, on film and in on TV, exciting for its crossing-border issues. But this drama is too slow and boring, despite all the visual efforts. Probably because the filmmakers actually having nothing special to tell.",Null,5,20,14 November 2011
Coriolanus," Theatrical and violent Shakespeare drama in a brilliant film version.
","Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes) uses military force against people's uprising when they demonstrate against oppression and starving in Rome. Coriolanus is first declared as a hero but later relegated from the city by the Senate for his brutality. He then allied himself with its former enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) and they march together to Rome to destroy the city. Coriolanus's mother, wife and son plead for peace and reconciliation and when he gives up he is murdered by Tullus Aufidius.Shakespeare's dramas may well be set up in a contemporary set, because the content is timeless. Here the screenplay drama is performed in its original text. The old lines sometimes are in conflict with the modern outfit, but you are quickly caught back to the drama by the violent intrigues and you become strongly affected by the deep conflicts between power and love. The war scenes are realistic and bloody. It is exciting and the outcome uncertain for the uninitiated.Ralph Fiennes both directs and plays the title role and succeeds well. He has got a star team both in front and behind the camera. The film photo by Barry Ackroyd is brilliant. The set and costumes are next to perfection. The 74-year-old Vanessa Redgrave portrays Coriolanus' mother, Volumnia, powerful and convincing. Gerard Butler as the rebel leader acts with strong charisma and realism. Additional casting is also very good.The staging reminds strongly of the NATO's efforts in the Balkan War. Military leaders are wearing American uniforms and the recordings are made in the environments of Belgrade and in Serbia.Eight of ten for a masterful direction, brilliant acting and a clever staging.",Null,34,47,5 November 2011
