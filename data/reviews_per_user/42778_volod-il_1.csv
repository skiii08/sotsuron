First Man," A test for your patience and seasickness
","Taking Ryan Gosling's character from The Driver movie and just copying it into this one as Niel Armstrong is a very bad (and stupid) idea.
The character has no (explained) justification to be like this, nor any (emotional/logical) development throughout the movie. Especially in the eyes of someone, who isn't much familiar with this historical figure.Constant camera close-ups and shaking are 95% out of place and only caused nausea and frustration. You know, human eyes have built-in optical image stabilization system, so that when you walk or even run, you see everything smoothly, with little or no noticeable shakes.
But here they added shaking EVERYWHERE! Actors are just having a calm dialog, while STANDING in one place or slowly walking - and they shake the camera, like it's an intense action sequence...Emotional accents felt lacking in some scenes and out of place in others. I couldn't relate to the main character and to the gravity of events most of the time.Pale, weak, disappointing.",4,4,8,31 October 2018
