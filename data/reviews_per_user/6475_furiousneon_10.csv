The Expendables 2," An action fans dream. Surpasses the original in every way.
","First off, I grew up watching Stallone, Van Damme, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Lundgren, etc. For the people who did not and disliked this movie and the first one, I understand. But for any die hard action movie fan of the late 80's and early 90's, this film is it. The one we always wanted. The one that answers most of our what if's when it comes to this genre. The first Expendables was a mean, fun little beast of a film. I applaud Stallone for what he did with it. But no matter how many times I watched it, I always felt more could have been done and this time, more was. Stallone handed directing duties over to Simon West and from the first frame you can tell this film is more polished. The action is amped up, the effects are of higher quality, the humor is timed better. Its all quite an improvement over the first. The film revolves around Sly (he did after all write the script). Willis and Schwarzenegger both have bigger roles this time around (loved the cameos in the first, but felt like it was all just a big tease). Statham plays right hand man to Stallone again while the rest of the crew do exactly what they did in the first with the addition of 2 newcomers (Hemsworth and Yu) and a solid, hilarious extended cameo from Chuck Norris. Statham is always a pleasure to watch, his action scenes are always explosive and he does not disappoint this time around but I especially enjoyed Lundgren and his character. He was funny, literally, not unintentionally and you can clearly tell that he is relishing this opportunity. Stallone gave all of these guys very little at the core as far as character, but I believe that was the point. We want to see them as who they are and who we love them for being and Sly knows that. That might even be why in the first one, Mickey Rourke's (who is absent from the sequel) emotional scenes seemed so out of place. They were phenomenal and truly moving and in reality, had no place in a movie like The Expendables. But since we are speaking of character, the best performance in this film by far belongs to Jean-Claude Van Damme. Its obvious to anyone familiar with his early work that his acting his improved tremendously and he uses this film to showcase that. His character is ruthless and evil in a fun way. He literally demands your attention when he is on the screen and the final fight between him and Stallone is almost perfect (wish it lasted a little longer, but not complaining). The first 30 seconds of the fight had me immediately smiling thinking to myself, am I really watching Rocky Balboa and Kickboxer go at it right now? It was just great. And Stallone, Van Damme and everyone else involved knew that many moments in the film would have you smiling, thinking exactly that to yourself. Are you really seeing this? Yes, you are. A bunch of broken egos finally came together to please the audiences that have dished out millions to continuously see them punch, kick and shoot their way through films. They all shoot high this time. And they hit the mark. 10/10. Not based on if it will an Oscar or not, but based on the tremendous amount of fun that I had with this film. Go See it.",10,5,11,19 August 2012
United 93," A Stunning and Remarkable Film.
","United 93 is one of those films where there isn't a star, there isn't a plan, there isn't one hero. The whole movie is full of hero's. People trying to find some kind of plot behind what was happening right before there eyes. The plot we know now, but they didn't know then and its quite amazing to watch these tragic events fall into place. United 93 had me glued to the screen, even though you know whats going to happen. It is very hard to watch but should fill you up with pride for this country and respect for the brave people who lost there lives on that plane. Everything about the film is solid with some of the best direction I've seen in a while. One of the best films I have seen so far this year. Should not be missed by anyone. 10/10.",10,1,4,29 April 2006
Batman Returns," Well done sequel
","The first batman film goes down in history as one of the best comic adaptions of all time. Forget the sketchy strictly for children adaptions of today(Spiderman, X-Men), although Daredevil was very good. Batman Returns was a very dark weird film. Michael Keaton proves again that he is the best man to slap on the mask. This movie was very fresh.  Good acting, good special effects, very fun movie. There were lots of problems with the films violence and dark tone, many people felt that a film which kids love should not involve these subjects. I thought the films tone was perfect, it made Batman look like a true bad ass and made the villians look like villians, not like guys in costumes doing things 'bad' until they get captured. If you want to see a good Bat-flick check out this or the first, maybe even Batman Forever, but if you want to see an overlong episode of ER with special guests Batman and Robin, check out Batman and Robin, probably the worst movie i have ever seen.",10,0,0,24 March 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Disappointment
","This Matrix series really just went in a downward spiral from the first to this so called 'finale'.  This movie is without a doubt a huge dissapointment, a let down to all fans.  The movie doesnt sum everything up they would you would expect and the performences here from the HUGE stars seem tiring.  Some scenes are so boring that i almost fell asleep..literraly.  The final fight scene was so lame that it actually reminded me of an episode of Dragonball Z...so without further adue..I voted a 1/10 for this horrible excuse of a final chapter in a series that if this film could have been what it was expected to be would have been great.  If you want to see a good movie that's similar to this with non stop action and a great everything else..go buy Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines..it really does take a dump on this piece of garbage.",1,0,1,12 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Best Movie Ive Seen All Year
","Ive always been a huge fan of the two Terminator movies.  They were both excellent.  I was really hyped up to see Terminator 3..and trust me, Terminator 3 is no let down.  It is the only movie that made me leave the theater wanting more, feeling good and feeling generally excited, even after seeing the movie.  It was just that good.  The action was unbelievable, better, in my opinion, then the action in Matrix Reloaded.  The movie cost 180 million to make and it definitly shows it.  Arnold IS back and gives an awesome performance the third time around as The Terminator.  I recommend this movie to all action fans, Arnold fans, terminator fans..just movie fans in general, CHECK THIS OUT! 10/10.",10,0,0,3 July 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Very Good Movie
","Ive been interested in this movie since i first saw a preview for it over the summer.  Ashton Kutcher in a serious role? Sounds like Mission: Impossible.  Ashton Kutcher is Evan..a troubled young man who discovers that he can go back in time and change things from his past, but when he changes one thing, he changes everything..and  this can either be really good or really bad.  The movie had me on the edge of my seat for pretty much the whole time.  It is very random but in a good way and it does have a good, interesting and very original plot.  So does Ashton pull it off? Indeed he does.  I was impressed by his performance, as a matter of fact, I didnt even watch the film thinking it was Ashton, I believed that he was Evan..thats a very good thing.  I mean he wont be winning an award for this movie, but note that this is his first dramatic role.  Overall i really enjoyed this movie, its better than lots of crap thats being loaded into the theaters lately and it really, really does make you think.  Screw what the critics are saying, check this one out, you wont wanna miss it. 10/10.",10,0,1,26 January 2004
Halloween," Set the Standards..
","Halloween is one of the best horror movies ive ever seen. It was genuinely frightening and creepy. Michael Myers has become one of the most horrifying and gruesome serial killers out there. Donald Pleasence did a great job as Dr. Sam Loomis. He steals the show in numerous occasions when he speaks of Michael. He really deeply examines the horror within Michael. Jamie Lee Curtis did a good job as Laurie Strode. She portrayed a scared Laurie better then anyone could have. The movie did seriously scare me the first time i saw it and isnt just a good Slasher Flick, but a really good movie as well. Highly Recommended.",10,0,1,3 February 2003
Signs," A Really Great Film.
","Signs was great. The acting was great. The suspense, comedy, scares and drama all in one film was truely great. This isnt a stupid aliens attack and we kick there ass because we know thats what would really happen movie. This is a film that not only deals with alien invasion and the end of the world, but giving something another chance, showing just what life means and how much something or someone can mean to you. Like i said, this is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone and everyone. 10/10.",10,0,3,3 February 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Very Original Horror Classic.
","As a child, my older brother would always scare me with stories of Freddy Krueger.  You see i was at that age where my parents wouldnt allow me to watch anything like A Nightmare on Elm Street because they didnt want me waking up in the middle of the night and asking to sleep in there bed.  He would tell me the history of Mr. Krueger and that if i went to sleep he would get me in my dreams.  The thought of this at that age really scared me.  A few years later, i was a little older and i was home alone.  I took my brothers copy of ANOES and watched. I was extremely scared.  Freddy was a great horror villian.  I just saw this movie recently, me being much older then i was the last time i saw it and more mature.  This was a good movie. Now, not so scary, but definitly a classic and it was very original. It was also very entertaining and really made you think about your dreams.  This movie does live on as a class, although it was almost killed by the all of the horrible sequels, you were no long entertained and or scared while watching freddy, you were suppost to be laughing because freddy went from being a horror monster to the next Jim Carrey.  Please avoid all of the sequels besides Wes Craven's New Nightmare and watch this. A Classic.",10,0,0,14 February 2003
Donnie Darko," Cult Classic
","Donnie Darko holds its own as not only a great movie, but a cult classic. The movie has a stellar cast that propels us into this engaging piece of art. The plot is very original and the movies atmosphere, pacing and soundtrack work great with each other. Even though this movie was put to shame at the box office, it should be seen by everyone and should receive a lot more credit. There is no doubt that this movie is weird. It is very confusing and its definitely not for everyone. But the people that it is for love it for what it is. Featuring great performances by Jake Gyllenhall, his sister Maggie, Patrick Swayze, Drew Berrymore and a man in a rabbit suit named Frank, this is one movie you really shouldn't miss. Worth the rental and in my opinion the purchase. I hear its being rereleased in theaters soon, if you haven't seen it yet..see it then.",10,0,1,20 July 2004
