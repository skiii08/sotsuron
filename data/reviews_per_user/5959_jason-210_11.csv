Black Swan," Over-rated but OK.
","Knowing almost nothing about ballet, I watched this film after hearing good things about it. I thought it was going to be based on the tragic life of some Prima Donna. It turned out to be more of a shock horror movie rather than a study of disturbed psychology and was unrealistic and sensationised.It isn't a bad film, but I certainly isn't worth the 10/10s I keep seeing on IMDb.com. It reminded me a bit of Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (only without the hilarity) probably because of the abundance of hallucinatory visual effects which were very well done; but also because both films were so highly over-rated! There was very little way of development in the film. The main character, Nina, starts off as being deranged and gets even more deranged then dies. The performances, however, were strong and I particularly enjoyed Portman, especially in the dance of the black swan, with the wings growing on her, and of course the music, though there was surprisingly little dancing.May be I had the wrong expectations, but whatever one's expectations this film is not more than a 6/10.",6,1,2,9 September 2012
The Finest Hours," Entertaining, Inspiring and Gripping.
","The movie does an good job of portraying a convincing 1950s, innocent ocean town and its people. The casting and acting is strong, and the story, once it gets going, is quite gripping. The special effects of the storm, and waves, the wreck and rescue are handled well and not over-done.With a film based on a true story like this, it's easy to overlook its qualities and focus on fact checking instead. Unfortunately the movie does stray from the facts, the main discrepancies being depiction of events on-board the SS Pendleton, such as the attempt to ground it on a shoal and the dramatic argument among the crew. These are fictionalised. When it comes to the actual rescue mission, however, events are followed accurately and there is an extra sense of drama knowing that this part of the move happened in real life in much the same way.A rare movie that not only entertains but, being based on a true-story, also informs and inspires.",7,3,6,17 April 2016
Se7en," A symptom of the appetite for pain and death of our society
","This film, though well made and well acted, was popular because of its subject matter - extreme violence, torture and sadism.I can only say that the genere itself reflects the sick appetite for entertainment based on crime pain and death that has become a hallmark of western society.I can only wonder what less corrupted people think when they watch this and similar films, along with the inordinate amount of gruesome crime TV series.Perhaps, folks, it is time to reflect on this obsession and demand better. As if there is not enough violence in the real world...",1,13,30,27 October 2014
Fight Club," A symbolic representation of psychological healing
","It took me a while to figure out that Fight Club is not on a level that allows the audience a normal 'suspension of disbelief'. It is unreal, dark, and nightmarish, and has all the hallmarks of powerful symbolic dream, or story made out of a chain of such dreams. It is also a story of hope. One could say, in Jungian terms, that this is a story about a man's inner journey of discovery of the Self.What we are watching is a personal representation of a psychological journey, beginning with the realization that something is missing in the protagonist's life. That something is contact with his own subconscious.Because of the great tension between Jack's inner subconscious and outer consciousness, communication finally breaks through in a form that Jack can understand. The form is a manifestation of a real person who represents everything Jack is not - in other words the missing half. Shortly after its appearance, Jack's life is changed forever. This symbolised by the destruction of his flat.In the beginning communication with the the alter ego (or shadow, in the Jungian sense) is just an occasionally contact or dialogue; but gradually it is integrated into Jack's life. Later, when Jack realizes that the manifestation is in fact himself, he can't let go of the conditioned idea that he is 'two' people. He is still dual. Can he really be one person. How? A 'death' is needed. Death in this sense is symbolical. It symbolises the end of the old way of life, the old Jack, and the beginning of a new life, with both halves integrated. The fact that this is achieved by suicidal effort represented a conscious decision by Jack to change himself, without relying on 'outside' help. It also represents is willingness at last to face the unknown. Of course he must sacrifice his former life complety to become a 'whole' or 'healed' person. So he shoots himself.When the two halves have come together, and a new perspective on the Self is reached, the crashing down of the buildings immediately afterwards was a symbolic representation of Jack becoming free from the bondage of his personal habits and history. In other words, the credit card conditioning, IKEA nest lifestyle and everything else is 'set to zero' as it crumbles into nothing. In fact the image of a crumbling tower'is a well known and documented symbol of a sudden and radical end to all one is used to.Now Jack can start a new life with meaning. Notice that after he shoots himself there is of course pain, but he seems to recover. This is also symbolical of the healing that is taking place. Notice how his voice has changed.Very Jungian. Wow!",10,0,1,9 April 2005
Inglourious Basterds," Violent World War II comedy fantasy
","Looking through many of the reviews here, it seems that people either love or hate this film. There seems to be an even split.The film has some disturbing violent scenes, and it seems to be this that many object to. But don't we see violence in a lot of other films and think it's OK? We are fed this type of violence every day, in computer games, TV series and routine action adventure films such as the Die Hard films, and Arnold Schwarznigger films and so on. It's not often we hear people calling for those films to be banned. The violence in those films is acceptable to most audiences. Inglorious Bastards also has violence, but many think it's unacceptable. Why is one type of violence acceptable, and the other not? The same thing is happening in both films...people are dying violent deaths.I think many react negatively to Tarrantino violence partly because of its graphic portrayal, but mainly because the way Tarrantino involves the audience with the dying or about-to-die characters. We don't want them to die, we think it's wrong, even if they are the supposedly bad guys, they somehow don't deserve it. And yet they die, and we see how they die. Whereas in your typical Hollywood action film the bad guys are demonized and stereotyped, and we want them dead. Personally, I think watching Tarrantino's kind of violence is healthier than watching the Hollywood action type of violence, because this makes you think, and shudder. It's not mindless.Despite its dark, heavy moments, Inglorious Basterds is, above all, a comedy with some really funny characters a great dialogue. There are some extremely funny scenes in this film. Humour is often funniest when it deals with taboo subjects, and a comedy about Nazis, the jews and violence, if not taboo, is certainly not politically correct.I think it's important not to be politically correct with good film making. After all, Nazi propaganda movies were politically correct...",9,3,10,20 September 2009
Passengers," An good sci-fi flick with some excellent special effects.
","Note that this contains spoilers. If you haven't watched the film, I suggest you do before reading this.The first hour or so of this film was fantastic. Just taking in the spacecraft with all its amazingly conceived features, was reminiscent of the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also struck me as being a realistic version of the type of spacecraft in Wall-E (think of the little cleaner droids, buzzing around, fixing things and cleaning the mess the characters make!) The premise of being alone on a vast, automated, self-repairing craft that is aware of your presence and provides all the conveniences you require, was an interesting concept. The technology and physics seemed plausible, cool, and realistic; and the special effects were restrained and effective. The robot bartender was fascinating, and provided some welcome entertainment.For the first hour the story seemed meaningful and thought-provoking, but after that it began to fall apart. A major aspect of the plot during the first half of the movie was being unable to get to the crews' quarters to wake them up, and the hopelessness of the situation because of this.Then, as if by magic, one of the crew wakes up, says there's something wrong with the ship, wanders around a bit, then dies. From then on it seemed to me like the script had been taken over by a different person, there to ensure the film served the public the usual smattering of sensationalist action scenes at expense of both the plot and plausibility of science. There is a brief promise of mystery as the trio realised there was something wrong with the ship and tried to figure out what it was, but this quickly evaporates as the problem turns out to be nothing more than a faulty nuclear reactor that is heading for self-destruction.The obvious thing to have done here would have been to wake more of the crew, now that they had access, to see what could be done. However, we are told there is not time for that, so the protagonist miraculously fixes the nuclear reactor all by himself. What a genius! This involved finding and hot-swapping a replacement circuit board, getting blasted into space, being spectacularly rescued by his female companion, dying, and finally brought back to life by having about a dozen or so different resuscitation techniques applied to him at once by a machine! Yeah. Face palm.",6,60,96,7 March 2017
Cloverfield," Entertaining post-modern horror movie.
","This film is made using the hand-held amateur camera technique, a bit like the Blair Witch Project, but it's much easier to watch because instead of the incessant shouting and camera fumbling of the Blair Witch, this is calmer with more control. During first 15 minutes we are allowed to get to know the characters, and the world they live in. Occasionally, when camcorder stops, we see glimpses of another film made earlier, which the cameraman is recording over, which gives us an insight into the happy twenty-something lives of the main characters. The horror, when it comes, is unknown. A bang, like an earthquake, a momentary power blackout, a confused newsflash. The cameraman and his friends react with a mixture of shock, curiosity and finally panic and fear, and you really feel like you are there with them. They wonder if it's a terrorist attack. In the next ten minutes, there are explosions, and a skyscraper collapses sending a cloud of dust billowing down the street between the apartments. It's a clearly a direct reference to images of 9/11. After the initial sequences, the film moves at a very quick pace, with plenty of action and some very suspenseful moments. Along the way the film has just the right level of humour to add to its entertainment value, delivered to us in the form of comments from 'Hud' the nerdy cameraman.A central idea of the film – a big monster smashing up the city – is an obvious reference to Ishiro Honda's 1954 Japanese Godzilla movie, which featured a prehistoric creature that has been awakened from the sea by hydrogen bomb testing. If Godzilla was an allegory about nuclear war, and effects of nuclear war, then I think we can say that Cloverfield is an allegory of terrorist attack on cities. It certainly touches something in us when we see the scene with skyscraper collapsing and dazed people covered in dust looking for their families. In one part of the film a body on a stretcher is wheeled passed the camera with its stomach blown open – it made me think of suicide bombers, although it was at the same time a reference to the first Alien movie.In this allegoric sense, the monster is a symbolic manifestation of our fear of terrorism, and the destruction terrorism can wreak in a city with a high population and so many buildings so close together. The inability of the US army to contain, to successfully stop the monster is also metaphorical, as are the 'bits' that fall off it – there is no hiding place. This is an enemy that is largely created in the mind, and thus cannot be destroyed, rather like the monster in the 1950s sci-fi film 'The Forbidden Planet'. I call the film post-modern because, on a deeper level, it has references to many earlier sources, such as Godzilla, to 9/11, Alien (when Marela's stomach explodes), Lovecraft (Dagon), and Forbidden Planet. If you look hard enough, you will also see that throughout the movie there are a wealth of small details that give clues about what will happen later, or that help us figure out what has happened, or just make us wonder. This suggests that the script and continuity in the movie are watertight.I wish I'd seen it at the cinema.",8,1,2,25 January 2009
The Imitation Game," Well crafted but mostly fictitious film about Turings involvement at Bletchley Park
","This is well-made and well-acted film, with an important message. However, the danger with films like this is that the masses think they are getting a history lesson, but in this case they are most definitely not.The film takes enormous creative liberties all the way through, by adding conflicts where there none; by portraying Turing as if he were autistic when he was not; and by inserting a number of fictions about Turing's character and achievements.Perhaps the most glaring fictionalised part of the movie, which will no doubt upset many historians as well as the descendents of those actually involved at Bletchley, is the lie that Turing singelhandledly invented and built the machine that could break Enigma's code. The machine was actually invented by Polish crytanalysts before Turing even started working at Bletchley! Turing's involvement came later, when he helped mathematician Gordon Welchman (who is not even mentioned in the movie) designed a newer model that looked for likely letter combinations.I also want to mention that the conflict between Turing and Denniston (played by Charles Dance) is completely fictional, and Denniston's family have taken issue with the film's negative portrayal of him. Denniston picked out Turing based on his work at Cambridge, and Turing never went to Winston Churchill to complain, and Denniston never tried to fire him!Contrary to what the film depicts, Turing was an approachable person with a keen sense of humour, and was well liked at Bletchley. There are many more inaccuracies, such as his lack of knowledge of German, his dislike of sandwiches and the scenes about his compulsions regarding carrots and peas. All of this is fiction. I could go on... but I've pointed out the main issues I wanted to raise.So once again, as with so many bio-pics (recent examples being Churchill and Dunkirk) an opportunity is missed and we are presented with a mixture of fact and fiction - fiction that goes well beyond what we generally call artistic licence, to the point that people living today connected to those war-time efforts are deeply offended.",5,5,5,11 November 2018
Titanic," A Night to Remember at the Cinema
","Anyone who saw the old black & white movie 'A Night to Remember' will appreciate the improved special effects in this one, but miss the more accurate portrayal of the historic event. James Cameron really managed to bring the old ship back to life for the big screen, but at the same time he strayed from history, painting a negative and inaccurate picture of the crew and passengers.I'm not referring to the fictitious love story between the two fictitious characters Kate and Jack. This addition is clearly pure invention, a device to involve the audience's emotions in the tragedy in a way that a documentary style film doesn't. That's fine. What's not fine to twist the historical facts about real people, which Cameron clearly does in this film. Many of the portrayals of the crew members are fictionalized. I suppose it's forgivable to make ordinary people into heroes, but to make heroes into villains, as this film does, is I think, unethical. It's damaging to the memory of those people, and I'm sure it's offensive to their surviving descendants.The biggest misrepresentation is of 1st Officer Murdoch, who is portrayed as losing his mind and shooting passengers and himself during the sinking during the evacuation. In reality Murdoch did not shoot passengers or himself. The writers of the film completely made this up. Captain Smith is portrayed as a weak, ineffectual human being incapable of making decisions. For me, Bernard Hill was wrongly cast in this role - he does not have the charisma and presence of Smith. According to most studies and records, Smith was also active until the very end. A one point he was calling back boats on his megaphone when he saw that they weren't full – a scene that was edited out of the movie for the final release.I've always had mixed feelings about this film. The effects, sets, costumes and technical accuracy are impressive; as are some of the characters. I particularly like the chief engineer, and Murdoch; but there are aforementioned inaccuracies, and also many unnecessarily silly bits like the scene with Cal chasing Jack and Kate down the grand staircase with a gun, firing shots as he went, which cheapen the film.I think that, when you make a film like this, dealing with such a monumental tragedy, with characters representing real people in recent history, it's very shameful to invent bad things about them.But all in all this remains an epic film and was one of the most impressive films I'd ever seen at the cinema back when I first saw it in 1997.",6,2,3,26 January 2009
War of the Worlds," Almost - but not quite...
","Although I enjoyed this film, I felt that it was somewhat overshadowed by the film 'Independance Day' of a few years earlier. It lacks the entertainment value of that earlier film, perhaps because it tries to be too serious and lacks humour.The first part of the film, with the invasion coming, and the panic that ensues as people try to escape, is scary and extremely well done. Excellent special effects, of course, which are now a required standard in a movie of this calibre. The rest of the movie is OK, although the action scenes with Tom Cruise go overboard, and the scene in the cellar was better done in the earlier 1950's version. Just why there had to be a lunatic down their who Tom Cruise had to kill, I don't know. It added nothing to the movie.Apart from being updated to the 21st Century, the film sticks pretty closely to H.G. Wells' classic 19th Century Novel 'The War of the Worlds'. And therein lies the problem with the plot. The idea of aliens invading earth, and then getting destroyed by bacteria which we humans have become immune to, but which the aliens overlooked, may have been acceptable and new back for the audeinces of 1897, but for a 2005 audience it doesn't wash. We know aliens are cleverer thatn that! In the original 1897 book, we humans have no power to stop the invasion - and so it is in this film. No Wil Smith or Bruce Willis to save the world. Plots like this aren't good for the popcorn market, so I guess that's why Hollywood threw in the Tom Cruise heroics.For me, the movie is a curious mixture of 19th Century visionary science fiction and 21st century Hollywood action, and doesn't quite come off.",6,0,1,24 December 2005
Contact," The best Science Fiction movie since '2001: A Space Odyssey'
","This movie reminds us how superb Science Fiction can be when done properly. It belongs in the same league as a handful of SF classics such as Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey.This is an intelligent and convincing story that for once pleases the science buffs as well as the mass audiences. The script is intelligent and thought provoking. The movie does not rely on seducing the viewer with special effects, as so many do these days. Excellent performance from Jodi Foster as the dedicated scientist who believes in her work. John Hurt's Haddon is simply superb. However, I found Matthew McConaughey's character Palmer Joss unconvincing and the fact that he finds his way into the Whitehouse struck me implausible. Tom Skerrit's character 'Drumlin' was also weak and stereotyped. The rest of the performances were OK, and it's even got Bill Clinton in it playing himself!!!The message of this movie is interesting, and gives it a philosophical dimension: That there is a uncrossable gulf between the mind that can only accept empiricism as reality, and the mind that can knows that subjective experience can be just as real. Jodi Foster's character is given an experience comparable to a subjective experience that is quite real but which she cannot share or prove, and through this she is able to finally understand that there may be something in spiritual reality after all.In summary, I'd say this movie is as a good a science fiction film as you're going to get.",9,4,8,10 April 2005
