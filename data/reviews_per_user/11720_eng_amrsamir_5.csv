Blade Runner 2049," Never watch it again
","Last week i watched joker (2019) twice, not long before i watched Rocky for the 100th time maybe. Some movies are so good you want to watch over and over again.
This movie on the other hand i won't, i never enjoyed it nor fully understood itðŸ¤” ... i lost 3 hours of my life watching this movieðŸ˜¥.
Not a thriller nor action nor drama
And by the way, Ryan Gosling always acts with the same face ðŸ¤”",1,7,13,15 December 2019
The Terminator," Great Classic movie that i can't adore it now 2019
","Come on, i can't watch this now in 2019. it is too lame. i fully understand that it is a very important movie in the history of Sci Fi and action movies, yes i know but still. after the modern action and Sci Fi movies even compared to terminator 2 which was in 1991 this movie The Terminator 1984 is not well done. i could understand all the fuss back in the good old days, but now !! I can't.",10,0,4,16 December 2019
Halloween," Not scart now ðŸ™„
","First of all Jamie lee curtis acting is so lame. The plot is so lame and not logic at all.
Really we in 2018 cant watch this anymore ... even 20 years ago when the movie Scream was playing no way we can go back and watch Halloween.",2,1,6,12 October 2018
Mother!," WTF did i just watched !
","I had to read the synopsis to get the film, it is so disturbing and mysterious and vague.
Well, it is the kind of movies i get to see once.
The environment people would live it, it should be played in events and demonstrations.
I am the seinfeld and simosons kind of guy. This movie was not for me.",3,1,3,13 October 2019
Annihilation," Didn't understand anything ... like the martian.
",I didn't like the movie ... it is strange and i didn't understand anything ðŸ˜Š,1,2,7,3 March 2019
