Iron Man 3," save your money
",I don't even know where to start on what a let down this movie was. I really didn't find the special effects that good at all? a lot of explosions but they had those 25 years ago in Rambo movies. more like special education than special effects. the physics seems off in a lot of scenes. you hardly even get a good look at all his suits at the end. the glowing red guys what a cheap cheesy excuse to save money when they get more screen time than Ironmans armors. I wanted to see the Hulkbuster suit and I think once I got about a half second glimpse of it? Tony Starks armor must be made of aluminum these guys seems to just pull them apart with ease. not to mention war machines armor all they have to to is grab his arm and he shuts down. they steal his armor with no passwords or security of any kind reinforcing the seconds films idea from the government that these suits could just fall into the hands of anyone. don't these suits have any kind of insane security software or backup plan if they are that dangerous? the end when he blows up all his suits doesn't make sense? if they are so dangerous what happens when people on the dock or divers start finding pieces of them? if the world is that dangerous I'm sure a lot of people would be diving for arc reactors? if you are looking for anything resembling the previous Ironman films don't hold your breath. they didn't seem to put a lot of effort into the planning and making of this one? it felt rushed like trying to profit off the name and other two films. they made a big mistake getting a different director and special effects studio to make it. there have only been a few times I have really wanted my money back from the theater and this was one of them.,3,1,3,10 May 2013
Fury," Been there, done that
","The visuals and effects are outstanding. The acting is great and they really do a great job setting the mood. I loved the scenery and detail especially the tanks. The death was graphic and a few caught me off guard like the tanks rolling over dead bodies in the road. I also loved the tiger tank scene. I was really impressed that it is not only a real tiger tank but is actually the only surviving functional tiger tank in the world. Now the bad. The story of the fng being thrown into a group of hardened veterans has been done to death. The fact the new guy was never trained to drive a tank and had never seen the inside of one and was a typist before seemed alittle dumb. Why wouldn't the military retrain a seasoned soldier to do it. I had a hard time sitting through the whole meal eating and the new guy and his German girlfriend. They drag it on way too long and I was falling asleep. I hated what low life's most of war daddies crew were. It made it hard to feel anything for them. Then I felt there were a lot of misplaced ideals like the end when the German soldier discovers the new guy hiding under the destroyed tank and doesn't say anything and let's him live even though he had wasted tons of that Germans platoon. Does that mean the Germans had more morals than Americans? they show scenes of not only abuse but executions of German POWs by Americans. It sounds like I'm being harsh, all in all not a bad movie but certainly not 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. I will probably still pick it up on DVD because I can always fast forward through the boring parts.",6,1,5,20 October 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Stick with the Rankin Bass version
","This movie is as bad as they come. The special effects are great but the writing is horrendous. Thorin just look like a human. The villains, all they know how to do is die. When the troll are turned to stone watch carefully as one points down at the last minute for absolutely no reason except so he matches the original lotr. The worgs look like cat/dogs hybrids. As terrifying as they are supposed to be they are just chopped down with ease by the tiny dwarves over and over. Too much to write but i would suggest pick up the RankinBass version.",1,1,1,22 April 2020
It Chapter Two," I wish i had redboxed it before wasting $18
","When i first heard they were remaking 'IT' as a die hard fan of the original i had serious doubts. I decided to give it a chance for 2 reasons. 1. They asked Curry first if he would reprise his role but he had to decline due to health reasons and 2. if they had imitated Currys Pennywise or the first film fans would have been upset too. Part 1 was pretty bad but i have to admit after seeing part 2 i am scarred for life. Not only do i want my $18 back i want the 3 hours of my life i wasted watching this back. What a mess. The plot is a seizure inducing, idiotic mess. The acting is bad, the cgi is bad, the characters are unlikable. I spent most of the movie wishing Pennywise would kill them. He had chance after chance but for some reason didn't? I will admit they did a better job this time with Pennywise than in part 1 which is why i didn't give it 1 star.",1,1,2,10 December 2019
It Chapter Two," I wish i had rented it first
","That was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. I thought maybe after part one they would learn from their mistakes but no. The plot is a mess, the acting is bad, the cgi is bad, the jokes are awful, the characters are unlikable. The only decent part is Pennywise killing but he hardly kills anyone.",1,1,3,10 December 2019
