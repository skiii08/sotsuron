Source Code," Another Deja Vu experience
","Wait a minute where do i begin from? ah yes in the spirit of the movie let me start from 5 years back.Tony Scott's 'DEJA VU' released into our theaters starring his most preferred actor Denzel Washington(a total of 5 films starting with Crimson Tide).Deja Vu begins with a bomb explosion on a ferry carrying the crew of the USS Nimitz,killing both the sailors and their families.An experimental FBI surveillance unit is pressed into action who use a space folding technology to directly look back 4 days into the past to assist the investigation in identifying the bomber.Now let's fast forward to 2011 and we have Duncan Jone's 'SOURCE CODE'.The premise is very similar to Deja Vu,the movie begins with an explosion killing over 100 passengers traveling in a commuter train to Chicago and the protagonist has to assume the identity of another man and relive the last 8 Min's before the explosion to investigate and identify the bomber.The first 30 Min's keeps you interested with the scenes playing in an indefinite loop where the actors repeat the same actions and lines till the explosion.There is nothing much to write home about the acting however Jake Gyllenhaal our protagonist did a decent job in the role of an American Army helicopter pilot.While Michelle Monaghan just had to repeat the same dialog 'I took your advice blah blah' every time Jake wakes up on the train in the body of an unknown man.Denzel Washington in Deja Vu while investigating the bombing finds a connection between a murder of a woman on the same day of the bombing.He falls in love eventually and builds a mental picture of the dead girl while searching her apartment.So in the end he travels back in time to save her from being murdered by the bomber while putting his own life at risk.In Source Code Jake falls for Michelle from the few lines of dialog they exchange before Jake set's off to catch the bomber before the bomb goes off again in 8 Min's.Beats me why Jake would risk his life to save her from the explosion.I can understand Denzel Washington trying to save the beautiful Paula Patton but why Michelle? why Jake why? I bet Heath Ledger (Broke Back Mountain) was far more interesting than her.can't remember one striking feature about Michelle to make a guy put his life at risk.The biggest Goof-up in Source code has to be when the bomber must blow up the train exactly when a freight train passes by.But the bomber gets off at a station just before the explosion.He clearly can not see the trains passing each other from where he is standing!Source Code is a mash-up of both Deja Vu and it's equally brilliant counterpart 'GROUNDHOG DAY' where Bill Murray finds himself living the same day over and over again.The Writer of Source Code Ben Ripley is hands down 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' a 1999 movie starring Matt Damon as Tom Ripley whose talents include impressions and forgery.Ben clearly ripped off Deja Vu and Ground Hog day to script Source Code without any major changes in the premise.It's a shame that critics like Roger Ebert and Rajeev Masand failed to notice the similarity and to top it all they gave a generous rating of 3.5/5.The Director Duncan Jones should from here on script his own stories like previously for his debut movie 'MOON' starring Sam Rockwell which was 100% original and genuine.Of course Jones is no Tony Scott but he is a decent director in his own right. you can follow him here on twitter HTTP://twitter.com/#!/ManMadeMoonWatch Source Code if you haven't seen Deja Vu before,trust me you will enjoy watching it and have a good laugh about my review later.However i felt the movie was dragging itself to the finish and a lot predictive.Yes i know i just wasted an hour trying to convince my friends not to watch Source Code but sadly they will go watch it anyway.i think i am going to beat myself up now.",7,1,1,17 May 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," The Kaboom of Doom
","With the success of Kung Fu Panda Dream Works finally managed to surpass Pixar with it's heavily detailed and achingly beautiful animation.3 years later it's sequel picked up from where it's predecessor left us in a small tiny village in the Republic of China no wait,China wasn't republic then it was still under the Imperial rule.Never mind history,Part 2 begins with the Villain Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) embarking upon a mission to take over China,as the story progresses Lord Shen's and our Hero Po (Jack Black) paths intertwine as prophesized by his soothsayer.Po discover's his past while in pursuit to stop Lord Shen from destroying Kung Fu and taking over all of China.I particularly found Lord Shen a bit tamer than Tai Lung from the first part.Lord Shen when compared to Tai Lung cannot do awesome Kung Fu or does he emit the same evil as Tai Lung does.Though Tai Lung had a lot less of dialog than Lord Shen i prefer Tai Lung over Lord Shen as Villain for his super powers and imposing character.The heart of the story remains the same with Po overcoming odds to see out any challenge to the peace and tranquility of his village.Underneath the silly gags and Laugh Out Loud moments there is an underlying message in the movie.'Your Past doesn't matter,it is what you choose to become' Po chose to become the Dragon Warrior and he finally finds 'Inner peace' and come to terms with his past in the movie.Audiences often ignore the message a movie tries to convey to it's viewers,all they want from a motion picture is to be entertained the whole 2 hours.Even the first Kung Fu Panda had a beautiful message,which urges one to go out and achieve their dreams despite the many obstacles that confront them.Kung Fu Panda 2 has a lot more 'Kung Fu' in it.It's fast paced action and equally fast editing leaves you bedazzled with you wanting more of it.I personally feel the animation got better than the previous Dream Works production's,it had the same detail and shades of their hit animation picture 'How to train your Dragon'.However i felt the sequel was less comical than the prequel.Part one was a laugh riot with every passing scene,also part two had it's moments but not in the same volume as part one.Another comparison between the two being the movie's climax.Part one wins hands down with an epic sorts of fight sequence laced with humor over part two's slow ending with a hint of a possible 3rd movie in the making (i learnt today that Kung Fu Panda is a 6 part franchise,can you imagine the fun that awaits us?).",8,0,3,27 May 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," A movie for those suffering from selective amnesia.
","Watching The Amazing Spider-man was like sleepwalking into a multiplex screen and waking up jolted in your seat. You won't remember how you time traveled 10 years backwards, to watch Spider-man swing across his not-so-friendly-neighbourhood in his old red and blue spandex outfit.You'll feel like you are reliving those two and half hours of your life once again, but only this time it gets excruciatingly painful to watch it entirely. The original Spider-man was adapted to the screen so well that the new writers seem to have seamlessly traced the story with a carbon paper for the 2012 audience.Peter Parker can't get laid in high school. A Spider humps Parker. Uncle Ben dies preaching about responsibility. The Villain is a madcap scientist. Lather, rinse, repeat. Nothing changes in the reboot except for the cast and crew.The story has so many loose ends that you could tie them into a long plait. The makers think it is OK to allow Irfan Khan missing from the movie after a brief cameo. And the Mr. Osborne, who Irfan constantly keeps referring to, is a ghost character. Peter Parker's parents are a new addition to the story, but nobody bothers searching for them after they go missing years ago.The amount of Batman references are too obvious not to notice. If Jim Gordon had a daughter, then Spider-man doesn't live too faraway from Gotham City. The city police chief's daughter is Spidey's new love interest. They join forces to defeat the villain. The villain - a giant green lizard - chooses Osborne tower to spread his airborne virus which is pretty much similar to Batman Begins ending. Watching it 3D had its advantages like getting to actually feel what it would be like to jump off rooftops from dizzying heights. The first- person camera view of Spider-man in action is a decent addition to the reboot. However, The Amazing Spider-man manages to fail on all three levels when compared to its predecessors.",1,37,96,29 June 2012
