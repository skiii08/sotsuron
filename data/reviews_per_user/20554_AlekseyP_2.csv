Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the Best Adventure Movie ever
","Except for the third movie in this trilogy, this one is the best adventure movie ever.Character, story, storytelling are captivating and entertaining. The experience (of watching this movie) is almost as satisfying as from the reading of 'Three Musketeers' (one of the best of my teenager memories).No other adventure movie comes even close.",10,0,0,4 March 2002
The Usual Suspects," The Best Thriller
","For me, it's better than Psycho (or whatever else is considered the best Thriller of all times). I can assume that this movie's effect is similar to the Hitchcock's at his time, but I leave now and this movie works for me better than Notorious or North by Northwest.",10,0,1,4 March 2002
