Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Dreadful
","Far from showing Americans in an unpleasant light, or 'Kazakhs' this film shows simply how much bad taste Sacha Baron Cohen is ready to perform to attract attention on himself.Publicity arising from 'debate'? The Americans portrayed in this film, even though some of them may have rather conservative or even racist views, are nothing compared to the crude pointless nudity, verbal abuse of this film, and derogatory statements about supposed 'Kazakhs' or non-Americans (especially in the Middle-East in general). The underlying statements are, I feel more powerful even than the statements of the victims of this prank.As a supposed portrait of a Kazakh, it is horrendous, and although some scenes could have been a good candid camera, and some scenes recall Andy Kaufmann's humour, we are amazed at how good natured the people are, and how they fake not noticing his crude language, how much patience they show to him (showing him how to use the toilet, selling a car), or simply leave the room to cut the interviews.It is unfortunate though that some people find it funny because it remains in a wider sense offending. While some asks very pertinent questions as how funny it would be considered if Jews or blacks were portrayed, what is very clear to me is that this film does its fair share to spread hatred in this world.Ideally? Don't give money to Sacha Baron Cohen for his talentless work.",2,29,56,22 December 2006
Citizen Kane," Outdated, possibly used to be great
","Citizen Kane is one of these films that one feels obliged to watch in order to be able to discuss it with other film fans.I found that as sound take is still 1941 technology the low quality of the sound makes the dialogue nearly impossible to follow. Am I unfair? Possibly, but when Orson Wells rejoices in background noise over spoken dialogue, not so muchActors are awfully static, and they do not convey emotions, they do not raise empathy, I found it impossible to connect with them.The shooting is sometimes innovative, fairly modern, but I do not judge the merits of a film for the impact it had on other films, nor how good or how new it was when it came out, I judge it for what it produces on me now.As for the story, the 'mystery' of Rosebud being the sort of philosophical thought that a man always longs for his childhood happiness, sorry about that, but it does not justify 90 minutes.I resent the lack of clues towards that mystery too. It seems that Orson Wells thought 'I'm going to do the biography of a media tycoon, what could I do to pretend there is a story?' and then came up with some sort of vague philosophical idea about the meaning of life, et voila!If you disagree with this opinion and think 'He did not get the true meaning of the film', just remember this one thing: I judge a film for what it brings to me now, not for what it brought others a long time ago. By today's standards, Citizen Kane has fallen into the 'old boring film' category.",2,3,8,23 September 2009
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," A beautiful film, an even better book
","This excellent adaptation of Louis de Berniere's book is not as good as the book. It is incomplete, and the script is cut with a chainsaw. I gave it a 9. So you need to multiply 9 by 5 or 6 (on a total of 10) to have an idea of what the book deserves. 45? Yeah that's about it.Really. The book is a masterpiece of literature and the film chops a major character down to a few lines, another character to a few moments, and major historical plots to insignificant references. Plus the book has the courage of a sad ending whereas the film goes to a happy ending, and still a happy end is what you'd wish because the characters 'deserve' it. I gave the film a 9 because managing to make a coherent film when you have thrown away (for lack of time) two thirds of a script and still make such a wonderful film, with actors that fit so well in their role, a film where you will cry and where you will be afraid like you're 6 and everything that happens on the screen is for real, please please forgive them for salvaging the core of the script and making you want to read the book, which will keep you fascinated and remain in your memory for the rest of your days.The story - but do you really need this in a nutshell? - is about acts of heroism and love and the horrors of the war. Reducing it to a love story is just this, reducing it, and it certainly does not deserve it. Save money, buy Captain Corelli's Mandolin DVD + the book and remember the film is only there so that you can have the joy to read the book, one of the best works ever written.",9,1,3,12 October 2007
Shaun of the Dead," A romantic comedy ... with zombies
","They picked their subtitle well. A blend of genres like never before and a success. Real gore, this is a parody that pays homage to gore (I quote Simon Pegg himself there).Way above spoofs, this is a weird exercise in directing, where none of the two must prevail over the other, and where the audience never know whether they're going to laugh or be scared next.Not a fan of horror movies myself I found this was so odd, but so nicely done, that US film makers really have a lot to learn about still.Fabulous!",8,0,2,1 September 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Too long, too confusing
","The plot of the first film is complex enough and it seems that in this instalment they lost their mind in secondary plots and special effects to care about keeping it simple. Watching Curse of the Black Pearl again before you go is absolutely necessary.Stunts are fabulous though, and a great team of Johnny Depp, Keira Nightly (*oh i'd love that) and Orlando Bloom deliver a very good performance.Also Bill Nighy and MacKenzie Crook deliver a very good performance.It did not keep me from getting bored, and although I laughed, would not buy it on DVD any time soon. The magic of the silver screen and theatre sound made up for a complex but poor story. Even the great music theme was shrunk. What a pity.Watch it or not watch it? Go ahead then. But you should know this is a bigger sandwich with less taste than Curse of the Black Pearl.",5,2,3,1 September 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Slow to start, boring in the middle
","Slow to start, boring in the middle, painful to end.Big news everyone! CS Lewis was a friend of Tolkien and this film shows clearly that friendship does not affect writing skills for one, that marketing does not trick everybody in seeing a film or buying merchandise, and that when you want to express your religious opinions too strongly it does not make good fiction books.The books have the same flaw as the film: story is boring. Have you seen the film? No? Don't and be sure you don't miss much.Special effects are million dollar apiece, same quality in fact as LOTR, the cast did their best, really, they did, the story was simply too symbolic to be interesting any more, like a joke they explain to you is no longer funny.CS Lewis expressed his renewed religious feelings in a fervent way and wrote plain uninteresting books, whose symbols are too close to propaganda to be attracting anymore. Adapting them to the cinema could only lead to a result where every moment is lasting too long.",2,0,1,10 March 2007
Hot Fuzz," Brilliant and funny flick
","Get ready ladies and gentlemen for Nick Frost and Simon Pegg's second film. This film, the clever remake of another film, will keep you on your toes from the first, hilarious moments, till the middle twist and then all the way to the end. When Simon and Nick decided to shoot 'The Shaun of the Dead', there was no moment of the film where they lied about 'a romantic comedy, with zombies'. Same here. You think you are dealing with a comedy until the plot is revealed (I was trapped as I thought what the plot was until it caught me by surprise, I had not watched their source, which I will not tell here), which is great because at the beginning you are just laughing at the misfortunes of this big town policeman in a small peaceful village. And if you are mistaken about this being a funny film, just wait and enjoy how well even in the most unexpected moments they manage to drop the odd joke or so and make you smile. A brilliant film, just buy and watch again!",7,1,3,9 October 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Not a publicity stunt
","There was a lot of talk about this film, a lot of publicity because of the gay interest in the script, and like always when there is too much talk, I don't pay for a seat because there are a lot of clever marketing scams around these days.It went away and then it was in my video store. I waited. Then it went on '3 for a week for a fiver' and I rented it. Ang Lee did a great job there, not only in shooting a difficult story, but also with exceptional photography (it looks like an ad for a cigarette brand, but I don't remember which) and brilliant acting and bringing us back to the US in the 1960s.The story itself, about a secret love affair, is dealt with cleverly, and with qualities in the script, in the performance, and without cheap and easy voyeurism, which in itself is admirable of Ang Lee. Heterosexual love is the subject of so many films that directors lack practise in treating homosexual love, and with the controversy around Brokeback Mountain managing to get through the minefield was not easy. I felt a bit that only one of the two cowboys was in love with the other - but this is an opinion only, but most importantly it seems to me that Brokeback Mountain deals also with the eternal topic of forbidden love, and in that way manages to send the gay aspect of this love to the background",7,12,13,12 October 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Take all you can, give nothing back
","The first installment of 'Pirates' was really neat, I even bought it on DVD because my girlfriend had not seen it when we went for '2'. She came with me for '3' as well and falling asleep was hard. Where is the charm (except Keira Knightley of course)? Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp et al. were simply involved too far in a franchise that makes too much money. Whose fault is it? Mine. Mine for going to the cinema for '3' even after '2' - hey rumors are running they could be in for '4'. After all if I was willing to pay for '3' there's probably enough like me to keep selling seats, DVDs, and Pirate toys for years now.'Take all you can, give nothing back'. They say it's a Pirate saying. So there's a Pirate haven somewhere in California, I guess.",3,1,2,18 September 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A story I can't relate to
","I watched this yesterday - it's not every day you get to watch something that mythical. So what was all the hype about? Dr Strangelove has a reputation, but that's about it. The plot itself is the weak point of the film: it's irrelevant to us today.Was it more relevant for people during the cold war? Probably. But for a film to be a classic, it cannot age if the politics have changed.The treatment of the topic is funny, but only at times (about 3 times during the whole film). I found it long, tedious to watch, and it's not a long film. Peter Sellers is good, but it takes more than his individual talent to lift it up. It was like a story I can't relate to.It's directed by Stanley Kubrick? So what? I don't rate a film according to who directed it, even if the director is considered a god by some. After all I disliked Eyes wide shut and found 2001 boring too.So I guess it's probably because I'm not a Kurbick fan in the first place.",3,4,14,25 August 2009
Pitch Black," Poor, simply boring
","Should I start on the impossibility of a solar system to have the planet revolve around three suns (not that a planet around with two neighbours is impossible, though) or have with 19 years of scorching light AND support life, or simply a breathable atmosphere ? Or maybe on the need for plants to support large life forms or simply the fact that predators like the aliens must have something else to eat when there is no humans around?OK Hollywood is not supposed to be science exact, but that reaches extremes I do not accept anymore.Naaaah. Better judge the film for what it is by comparison with what you hoped it would be when you purchased your ticket.Well if you've seen 'Aliens (2)' or the silly 'Godzilla' or even worse 'Jurassic Park 3' (or 2 for that matter), well you are back on the same roller coaster, and not a good one.Supposedly about 'how we all need to stick together', the message is coated sci fiction, taking place on a hostile planet with aliens who obviously feed on each other when there is nothing else, and still manage to be quite numerous.Borrowed it from a friend? Well choose your friends better next time.",1,8,16,10 March 2007
Ocean's Eleven," The best heist ever
","Sure, Ocean's Eleven is a remake.But it does take some skill to make it comparable, if not better than the original. The cast is really hard to maintain, it's like a dream team, and all want attention. The film is split in three parts, the introduction and recruitment, the planning, and the heist. The film is not only enjoyable for the heist and how it's pulled (which is a surprise only once) but in fact the whole film is enjoyable AGAIN because of the 'bad boys on the run' tone which is very funny in the way characters are introduced.A sure DVD buy which will give you fun on several viewings.",8,1,2,18 September 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Congenital disease
","Warning! Congenital diseases can affect franchises too. When the holders of the Alien and Predator franchises decided to cash on their respective cults, they had only one thing in mind: cash. So a cock and bull story was born, involving a mysterious ruin not crushed under the ice of the Antarctic (reminding me of a small element of a book by Barjavel), and a moving labyrinth, which really was cool given the video game ambitions there. What do you get?A commercial machine bred from a poor, if not laughable script, a few action scenes which unfortunately cost a lot (less cash for the producers, but they had to), a nice preprequel which in turn can breed as many sequels (one in 2007 - oh no!) as a gullible public will fork out. Watch this on DVD - this way you can fast forward - and obviously do not buy this or you would be counted among the milch cows.",1,0,3,7 November 2007
Meet the Fockers," Laugh out loud for grown ups
","Now that is a title that brings a smile on your face! I watched the beginning of Meet the Fockers with a bit of concern about whether this was a waste of time or not. Then, from joke to joke, I got entertained and kept watching.Jokes are below the belt, and the clash of values between the families is really funny, and in fact this is what really matters when you want a funny film. Not for the whole family but for grownups it will be laugh out loud.I was also pleased to see De Niro and Dustin Hoffman and a surprising Barbra Streisand, who are so serious, capable of the best dramatic performances, in something so refreshing. I think that they had a lot of fun shooting this, and that in a way it shows.",8,0,0,28 October 2007
Back to the Future Part III," A nice ending
","In the third installment of the series, we discover that Doc is alive in the past and Marty goes back to the beginning of his home town, only to find that Doc may be murdered in the past. This one is not as brilliant as the first two, but to its credit it is a nice end to the series, and in fact was scripted and shot with the second installment. I liked the set, which shows how the town has changed without changing - by the clever use of the layout of the set, as well as some jokes that have now become a classic - in particular the reference to Clint Eastwood. Although this film is not as good as the first one, it is a must watch as it closes the series and although the end is a bit wacky (were they opening the way for a fourth installment?) it is clear that should Michael J Fox be in a position to deliver a fourth installment today 'for the sake of cash', the audience would follow. Kids will enjoy this third part more than once. Grown ups once only.",5,0,3,9 October 2007
The Da Vinci Code," One time use
","The film has the same flaws as the book. Everything lies in the plot unveiling, and when you know the end it is tasteless.The cast is good, I mean there are far too many good, excellent actors to get it wrong: Tom Hanks, Andrey Tautou, Jean Reno, Ian McKellen. If you can't get a decent film out of THAT cast, you're done. Even I could (just kidding).You don't want to know the story I hope? A conspiracy about the Holy Grail being in fact Jesus Christ's bloodline.The book was nice to read once. I still have it, but try to read it twice, and it gets so boring. Same thing for the film. Once it will be fun 'how did they adapt the book?' and then you can sleep it through.Just a cheap rent for a single use.",3,0,2,18 September 2007
Hercules," Among the best 'classical' Disney
","A few years before the computer days, Disney sang the swan's song with Hercules. Although loosely based on Greek mythology (in which Hercules is Zeus' illegitimate son with a human, which obviously had to be surgically removed), and while the story of Hercules 12 Tasks is far from respected, the Disney studios managed to deliver a funny and entertaining adaptation of the myth.Most importantly, songs and musical bits are really good, especially the opening sequence with Charlton Heston's voice and the muses, the duet Meg / the muses and guess what 'Zero to Hero' sung by... the muses.What I also liked very much are the second level humour (spot the spice girls if you can), such as 'Air-cules' ads and references to Greek myths in general.This double-level reading makes it a nice and entertaining cartoon for kids and grown-ups. Even more enjoyable now these paper and celluloid days are over.",7,1,3,18 September 2007
Amélie," Can a film change your life? This one can.
","Amélie Poulain is a philosophical tale about a young woman who decides to make the people around her happy, and how she finds love herself.It is a tale about new love, about how unique people are. Jean-Pierre Jeunet tells the story beautifully, supported by Audrey Tautou in a very difficult part. Amélie is my favourite film (my daughter's name is Amélie...) and I know it virtually line for line.Yann Tiersen's beautiful music, the romantic Paris set and secondary characters serve the story very well. For me it is like chicken soup for the soul, a message of hope like no other.",10,1,6,9 September 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A very good sequel
","***** NO SPOILERS *****JJ Abrams had a very difficult task to face when he accepted to direct Episode VII. All the fans out there (including George Lucas) expected a variety of things. The story and individual scenes feature a large number of nods to Episodes IV V VI, and even to I II III (I was too engrossed to look for them all as I have only seen the film once, but I have noticed 6 on this first viewing).The set design, lines, landscape, are also perfectly in line with the story we know, and those details are noticeable, but never obnoxious.The film might actually be a bit confusing for a kid who has never seen another film from the franchise, but honestly I do not know if TFA will be anybody's 'first' Star Wars (if so, it will not be their last).I know Episodes I II III were widely criticised, although I believe they had their good bits too. TFA will not gather negative reviews like they did and when I heard George Lucas say he liked it, I have the feeling that he is not just meeting a contractual agreement with Disney, he probably means it.",9,3,23,20 December 2015
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Faded and not replaced
","There is indeed a lot in this film to bring it to cult status. The Holy Hand Grenade, Shrewberry and Knight that say Ni are so weird, beyond any measure that they have had no equivalent. It is wonderful that a film made with such a low budget could survive for so many years, but for me it just did not work, sorry.I also approached it with high expectations, I mean at 35 I only remembered watching it once when I was 8, and had only vague memories of it. Is it a matter of mood? Humour gone stale or repeated too often as 'a film they watched and they remember as great?'. Possibly. Some old films are better as memories than for what they are. For their cult status, once built, cannot be completely destroyed.Holy Grail is possibly one of them. Oh it still has its charm, especially its absurdity and the 'we had no budget, and we did better than you with a big one'. The Monty Python put a lot of talent there, and are still making a living out of those crazy years but 30 years on (yes, 30 years on), the comedy effect they achieve, which was such a breakthrough, has faded away, at least for a 'first time' viewer of 2000. I do not mean something has come to replace it, except maybe Wayne's World, and this is probably the saddest conclusion. Nothing has really replaced the weird Monty Python. So watch this, enjoy it with all its faded absurd humour and hope the next laugh-out-loud film will come within your lifetime.",5,6,14,9 October 2007
Back to the Future," A Sci-Fi classic
","Back to the Future was not expected to be what it became. Shot with an impossible schedule as Michael J Fox was committed to Family Ties, and made into a series of three films, 20 years on they remain fresh and entertaining (not even the nationality of the terrorists needs updating!).The plot, while it is original and cheeky, is based on a classic time travel plot, and could be expected to age fast. It is not the case, and it remains a solid family value entertainment... the sort of films you can expect your kids to watch over and over again. I suppose the whole skateboard and matchmaking your mum and dad must be part of the timeless magic of the script.So only one thing to do: buy a collector's three film box set and you'll know what sound investment means when they have been watched 20 times plus and your kids ask if they can watch it AGAIN.",9,0,0,9 September 2007
Jurassic Park," Get your tickets
","When I first saw Jurassic Park I was astonished at the powerful effect of CGI dinosaurs with a rather well built script, fairly good acting and some form of idea behind it.More than ten years on, I still feel the same. Of course the story is no longer a surprise, but I see that the film has not aged and got even a bit better with time.For anyone who does not know what the story is about, it is about a dinosaur zoo turning wrong - and two sequels which should not have been made.Overall, you will probably enjoy the CGI Trex chase because to be honest Jurassic Park is less accurate than Walking with Dinosaurs but more fun.Watch this on a big screen.",8,2,4,9 September 2007
