Miracle," Hockey Excellent from a Hockey Fan
",This movie surpassed my expectations with Kurt becoming Herb Brooks and the hockey scenes being so believable because of using ex hockey players.  I also was a teenager during this time and the movie caught the essence of the time with so many unsure of the US place in the world.  A country on the decline or on the rise.  I still remember being at a high school basketball game when it was announced that the US beat the Russians.I have been a season ticket holder to Gopher Hockey for alot of years. Kurt became Herb Brooks for me and the movie caught the feeling of what hockey means to Minnesota and to the New England states.,10,0,0,20 February 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," True to the Story & the Message
","I always applaud directors who stay true to the story and message which this movie does. The story, adventure, and graphics are outstanding and definitely want to see it again. The tale is a classic good vs. evil but for me it also makes the point that people are not all good or all evil. Everyone has good and evil inside them. The most important thing is to realize when you are committing evil acts and ask for forgiveness from the person that your wronged. And as the person wronged forgive others who wrong you. The Edmund and Mr. Thomnus characters speak volumes about being a character with a mixture of good and evil. My only negative comment on the movie is it could have used more character development. I realize the challenge in this with so many characters while keeping the movie to 2 1/2 hours. I am sure one of my personal heroes, CS Lewis, would be proud especially how it speaks of the Christian message without clobbering you over the head with it.",9,6,8,9 December 2005
