Requiem for a Dream," Probably The Greatest Drug Movie Ever Made
","Movies revolving around drug abuse have been en vogue for quite some time, especially in Britain (Human Traffic, Trainspotting, Sorted, etc), but this just about eclipses them all. Show this to someone impressionable and it'll probably put them off drugs for life. I'd seen PI and adored it, and didn't think Darren could top his first film, but Requiem For A Dream supersedes Pi - an amazing feat in itself. This is the greatest drug movie since Trainspotting, full of Oscar-worthy performances with some of the best camera tricks I've ever seen. Go buy it. (This guy HAS to film a Stephen King adaption.)",Null,0,0,21 September 2001
