It," Unsettling yet funny and heartfelt masterpiece
","In the days since viewing IT 2017, many thoughts have overcome me and that being that this is one film that you cannot help but love. You must also understand it is a complete deviation from the original 1990 miniseries up to Tim Currys performance as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Bill Skarsgard is no comparison to Currys work yet puts on a mystic and unsettling presence that personifies his role to full nightmare fuel. A particular scene comes to mind when in the Neibolt House Pennywise emerges from the refrigerator in a spectacle of awe and terror. The film itself however is only scary at times but it's not about Pennywise it's about the Losers Club, brilliantly portrayed by Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, among others. What I got from this film was a throwback to classic films such as The Goonies, Stand by Me, and I believe it lives up to those films even. There is never a dull moment among the Losers Gang and Finn Wolfhards character 'Richie' was a standout player spewing wisecracking remarks even in the face of danger. IT Chapter Two cannot come soon enough.",9,5,13,11 September 2017
Black Panther," Third Act Fell Apart
","Story wasn't super one of a kind, but the first and second act established a lot of interest and mythos worthy of excitement. That is until the third act. It seemed the visual effects money was spent too much on the first two acts because by the last 45 mins there was very bad green screen backgrounds that didn't match the character lighting at all in some shots followed by some bad CGI. (There was a bit of this earlier but it was acceptable) The only other problem is the ending. T'Challa is a hypocrite! Killmonger wanted to expand Wakandas resources to help the rest of the world. Living in poverty while the Wakanda live gloriously infuriates him and this and the death of his father as a child, drives his character. T'Challa and the Wakandans are against allowing their resources to help those in poverty for fear of possible wars started with their technology. But once Killmonger is defeated, T'Challa turns around and opens Wakandas doors to the world. There was no reason Killmonger should been murdered by Black Panther (T'Challa) and the only reason there was a conflict is because Killmonger took the throne and presumably killed T'Challa, angering his family/friends and they took upon an act of revenge. How did this ending even get approved?",5,3,6,9 March 2018
