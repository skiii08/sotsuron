The Legend of Bagger Vance," POOR CASTING
","This motion picture was poorly cast. It drags along, with no character development. People at the sneak preview were laughing at the unbelievably of the actors, with many walkouts. Matt Damon is just not  what the publicity mills have built him up to be. And the casting of Joel Gretsch as Bobbie Jones was the casting directors biggest mistake. He is a very poor actor, former Target model who has been around Hollywood for ten years before somehow getting this role. His performance is not even up to a high school plays' quality. The entire film looks like something  the producers are trying to fool the public with  by advertising reviews with the critics name being so small you can't tell who they are.  Poor acting, slow, very slow story will have this one out of the theatres before Thanksgiving. What a turkey!",1,4,10,31 October 2000
