Source Code," Inception-like flick for the really simple people.
","Many rated Inception so high I was almost forced to see it on the big screen. OK! Saw it, understood it (duh), was a simple, plain, craftsmanship-wise well made movie. No biggie. For sure not an 8! I mean Jesus! Fellini has films with 8/10Well this one was also extremely high rated - 7.7 - almost an eight. This time it was prepared and i saw a film made for all the Simpletons which couldn't understand Inception and for all high school kids with attention deficit for which all things must be really slowly explained visually and verbally at the same time... and if you still missed the point, they will explain it at the end of the movie, in this horrible way of 'the letter which is read off screen'.And now for all the fans of this film (I will try now to communicate with them in a way they can understand): This movie sucks like a crack madame on cold turkey!And this is why:No story. Maybe I'm wrong some kids like pointless 8 minute flicks on YT... so maybe I'm not the primary target.No characters. No one, not even the bad-guy, I can relate with, feel for nor even understand the motivation they have. Cardboard thin! The bomber has a motivation of a 15-year-old Emo computer-freak and the skills of a nuclear physicist from MIT? WTF? Where did he bought uranium?? Wallmart? He acts alone? Really?No acting. I mean come on! Mr. Wright and Mr. Gyllenhaal are top actors. Here is the answer - it is the lame director! So please f()@k off Duncan Jones and don't you ever dare to waste any feet of film stock!enough saidnow for the rating system: I am with IMDb since 1995. Almost from the beginning. I can not trust your ratings anymore. I think, I shouldn't trust them for a long time.",3,2,9,22 May 2011
