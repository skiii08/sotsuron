Blade Runner 2049," Mood
","It's all about mood for me. The original BR was futuristic noir, perfection in every way. To do a sequel to Blade Runner there's the Phantom Menace route, and there's the right way. I think the filmmakers succeeded. It was a tad long, a few unnecessary scenes, but Ryan Gosling, Ana de Armas, and Sylvia Hoeks were spectacular. The music was right, and the cinematography was exactly how it needed to be.The story is secondary - this film was meant to be beautiful and it was. Simply beautiful.",Null,0,4,8 March 2020
Orphan," Loved it all except 1 thing
","The very end sucked and was unnecessarily cruel, and by the mom, not Esther. The breaking of Esther's neck with a side kick stomp from a prone position by the mom while screaming 'I'm not your effing mommy' made me cringe and disgusted me a little too.True, I was rooting for Esther because she was always the coolest character on the screen - but I understood she'd probably die in the end like all 'bad seeds' in movies. I think the mistake on the script was we were never supposed to feel sorry for Esther. Maybe that's why I did. Also, I know adoption and foster advocates hated the movie for being anti all that, but I disagree. She wasn't a bad seed, she was a 30-year old dwarf. If anything, the LPA should've been upset.Overall a great movie. In future viewings I'll cut it off after Esther and mom fall through the ice. That would've made a better ending anyway.",Null,1,1,11 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Very good idea
","As someone who has read everything I could ever get my hands on about the Manson family, and to this day believe that Tex & Sadie were the real criminals in the so-called Manson killings, there is a lot to like with this movie.If I were related to Sharon Tate, this movie would depress the crap out of me as a 'might have been,' proving that creating your own reality is the greatest value of movies.Nitpicks? Too many feet, knowing Tarantino's fetish makes that worse somehow. Lynn Fromme's voice was all wrong - should have been more airy, like a child's voice. Tex looked like a wimp. And an awful lot of filler. We need the Pacino arc at all. Way too many full scenes from tv shows and movies. Could've easily been 2 hours or even 90 minutes.That said, I love the Cliff/Dalton buddy angle, the dog, the cathartic ending, Margot Robbie, Jay Sebring, the cinematography, the music, and the Bruce Lee scene was fantastic!It's well worth watching. Loved it really.",Null,1,2,25 January 2020
A Quiet Place," Gun control
","So the whole time they could've just shot it in the face with a gun?Great atmosphere and acting, effects, etc, no throw all logic out the window. Very poorly written. Still, oddly enough I liked it anyway.",Null,0,3,1 September 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Forced
","Pros: Emma Watson is pretty and Kevin Kline is a great actor. Gaston was funny.Cons: Emma Watson is an underwhelming singer, a disengaged actress, and British. She's not a bad actress, but not right as Belle. It called for a Julie Andrews-type energy. The other problem, and it's only a problem because you can't suspend your disbelief that there are so many black people in 18th century France. It looks like a high school play with 'whoever we can get' to fill the roles, including Emma Watson. The 1991 version was better in every way except casting Americans as French is somehow worse than casting Brits.",Null,4,9,21 July 2017
Signs," I don't get it
","I don't understand the supposed tension that was supposed to occur in this movie and Mel Gibson proves once again that he's a completely overrated actor.  Did anybody else laugh outloud when he started in on the mashed potatoes at the dinner table - yelling at his kids?  Was that supposed to be acting?  And furthermore, was that supposed to be a script?  After scoring a hit with his tricked up ending Sixth Sense, but then bombing with his repeat effort (Unbreakable) - I think his lack of originality and vision is more than apparent.  Unbreakable was a carbon copy of Sixth Sense and Signs was a copy of War of the Worlds.  Wow - what a visionary!  Or is he paying 'homage'? All I know is, $igns was a disappointing piece of sh*t.",Null,1,1,13 September 2002
