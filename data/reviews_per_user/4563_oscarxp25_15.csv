Changeling," Son if a Jolie
","Changeling- ***1/2 out of **** By Kevin Muller With all the press lately about Angelina Jolie being 'Uncool' people may have forgotten she is a movie star with a new movie out. With this film, Jolie reminds us why she is one of Hollywood's greatest talents. Seriously, if Jolie isn't nominated for an Oscar come February, it is a crime. In 'Changeling' she dives so far into her character and displays every emotion with such ease that it will make you glad you spent money on a ticket to this fantastic film.Clint Eastwood, who directed this picture, really explores the dark side of human emotions in this picture. Anyone who has seem 'Mystic River', 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Unforgiven' knows that Mr. Eastwood can easily tell a story about the ugliness of human nature. With 'Changeling', he goes a step further and really makes us feel uncomfortable because this time the victims aren't a bunch of cowboys, a teen girl or a adult female boxer, but little children.For those of you who don't know, the movie is inspired by true events that took place in 1930's Los Angles, when the cops ran things their way with no questions. Jolie plays Christine Collins, a mild mannered telephone operator, who is raising her son Walter. One day she she arrives home to find her son missing. Like any other mother, she starts to search for her son with the help of the police. Three months later, the police say they have found her son and hand over a boy who doesn't resemble her son at all. Christine keep insisting that the boy isn't her son, but the police keep making up excuses to cover their own tracks; even going so far as saying that the obvious case of her son's shrinking height is due to some connection to distress that he probably went through while captured. I won't give away any more of the plot, but things do get ugly and the only one on Christine's side is a local preacher Gustav Briegleb (John Malcovich) who has a extremem distaste for the LAPD.The movie is quite long, running almost two and half hours, but it is worth it because Eastwood is a master story teller, who doesn't let everything unravel all at once. The time period is perfectly mimicked as are the costumes. What Eastwood and screen writer J . Michael Straczynski accomplish is making a picture that is both filled with both hope and hopelessness. You feel Christine's highs and lows because the movie takes its time connecting you to her. There is a scene where Jolie comes face to face with the suspected killer, pleading him to tell the where abouts of the son, which is so powerful that you just are taken a back how amazing Jolie is in this scene. She throws him around like a doll, slaps him, bullies him and you feel every emotion she is throwing at this man.'Changeling' is definitely an adult picture, with moments being almost as dark as 1995's 'Se7en.' Most of all, and I can't stress this enough, it is a emotions picture about the undying love and drive of a woman who has lost her son, acted out beautifully by a beautiful and talented actress.",9,7,11,20 November 2008
Underworld Awakening," Why did Kate come back for this?
","There is an old saying that 'money is the root of all evil'. This statement is usually reserved for people involved with bribery, corruption, banking, and politics. Well, I am taking that statement and applying it to everyone involved in the making of this film. This movie was made to suck money from our pockets by people who don't care about a once worthy movie property. They destroy it.The original 'Underworld' was a fresh take on the centuries old rivalry between vampires and werewolves (called 'lycans' here). It wasn't game changing cinema, but a movie with interesting characters, worthy performances, and slick action sequences. This movie, clocking in at a incredibly short 73 minutes, not only destroys, but turns its back on what once was a promising series. The second film was as good as the first. I did not see the third, but heard it was good. When people rip on 'Twilight' for the terrible acting, the teenage girls now have a film to use as evidence to show it ain't that bad in Stephanie Meyer's universe. Everyone in this film is terrible; even Kate Beckinsale. Beckinsale, who was so good in the first two, is sleep walks though this film. I must give her some credit, at least she is better than the films terrible villains. The characters are lame, as are the actors playing them. They come off as laughable, not frightening or horrifying in anyway. The once cool designs of the Lycans have been replaced by rubber looking coyotes. Worst of all, there is not a single memorable action scene in the movie. It is just extremely boring to watch, considering all the gunfire going on.Former director, now writer, Len Wiseman, tries to inject some emotion into the movie by creating a relationship between Beckinsale's character and a hybrid child created from her DNA. There is only so much you can do in the movie's short time span and given the amount the screen time these two have together, it doesn't work. It doesn't feel natural, only a cheap ploy to create some type of humanity in this action snooze fest.Michael Sheen, who played a Lycon in the first three movies, wisely bowed out of this one. Beckinsale, I have no idea why she came back after walking away from the third one. My only guess is she got a pretty good amount of cash to reprise her role. The film does establish something; it is like its main character: empty, soul less and dead on arrival.",1,10,17,28 February 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," All hail, Captain America!
","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is not only the best Phase Two Marvel Movie but it is also in the ranks with 'The Dark Knight' in terms of storytelling, directing, and acting. Oh, it is also one hell of a ride that is loads of fun. This movie has everything and nails every promise it made to give the title character the movie he deserved.'Winter Solider' takes the approach of a conspiracy thriller and boy does it work. If you took the superheroes out of the picture, it still would have held up as an superbly written thriller. Joe Johnston has stepped down from the director's chair and the reigns have been given to Anthony and Joe Russo. The directors, who mostly did comedies, including directing a few episodes of 'Community', seemed like an odd choice to take over an action film. While the film does have its moments of humor, it is quite serious. The Russos are more concerned about making the conspiracy plot work than gathering up a belly of laughs. It is not to say the picture isn't funny though. Their comedy background does help in giving light to the dark places this film goes.Steve, who is Captain America when he is not kicking ass with that incredibly cool shield, lives the present day and is still learning about the years he has missed. He even has a checklist of things he must find out about when he has time for himself. When Nick Fury gets into a pickle, Steve is called to home base to talk to S.H.I.E.L.D. senior officer Alexander Pierce. Steve won't divulge what Fury told him at their last meeting and Pierce warns him that he will get the information no matter what. After this meeting Steve is labeled a fugitive and a person of interest. Along with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and newcomer Sam Wilson, who later becomes Falcon, they try to go deeper with the information they have obtained.That is a very brief rundown of the plot that contains many twists and turns. It does go a lot deeper and is a lot more interesting than that but half the fun of this film is experiencing it. The film is expertly paced and is quite interesting. As in 2005's 'Batman Begins' the film is as interesting between action set pieces as it is when Falcon soars in the sky, with his mechanical wings, out running a number of heat seeking missiles. The plot in this thing is the best of any Marvel film to date. It is an intriguing puzzle that never acts like it is above the audience and forgets it is a comic book film.A strong element in this film is the acting. Chris Evans, who was good in the original and 'The Avengers' goes leagues beyond anything he did in those two movies here. Hell, this maybe his greatest role yet. Steve is a man who is starting to question his role, not only in S.H.I.E.L.D., but the world. His wide eyed innocence about the rules and how people like him are supposed to protect the world starts to crumble when he learns the shady dealings of the people he works underneath. He has grown into this role and made it his own as much as Bale did with Batman or Downey Jr. has with Iron Man. Steve is a fully fleshed out character that breaths and feels alive outside of the kick ass action scenes. Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie, who is plays Wilson/Falcon as a great admirer of Steve and is willing to risk everything to fight by his side, are great here too. Though they aren't as fleshed out as the title character, they do add to their characters quite a bit. Mackie as you can say 'earns his wings' to be part of this epic universe. The real treat here is seeing the legendary Robert Redford play in a comic book movie. His performance is as serious and well played as any of the conspiracy thrillers he has been in during his career. It works extremely well and it looks like he has a blast doing it.What about 'The Winter Solider'? Who is he and how does the Russos handle the character? The character doesn't say much at first but still comes off as deadly and dangerous. The Russos handle his scenes with brilliant care. The music and suspense are built up perfectly whenever he is on screen. You can feel the fear this man projects from being an unstoppable force. He is as dangerous as Steve because he has been enhanced to fight. Sebastian Stan plays this role as if Javier Bardem's, Anton Chigurh, from 2007's 'No Country for Old Men', was dropped in a comic book universe. He is just an unstoppable killing machine with zero empathy. While Stan's Winter Solider is that way through brain washing, unlike naturally twisted Chigurh, he is still a frightening.The action set pieces in the film are a marvel to experience. While the big set pieces, especially the ending battle, do flow nicely, it is the smaller battles that are just as impressive. Evans not only sells the emotional part of the character but the physical part as well. Captain America is fast, brutal, and expertly skilled at every type of skill a soldier, like him, would need in battle. One thing that many don't have is that shield. The shield really does shine in this film. The way it is incorporated into the battle scenes would make the coldest of men smile. You feel like a kid grinning ear to ear whenever Steve uses the shield as a weapon.Steve's own personal story will continue from this film, even after the next 'Avengers' installment, and if it is half of what this one was we are in for the treat.",9,2,4,5 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack the Critics (its good)`
","Coming back from Attack of the clones. 3 in the morning.  Was it worth my time?  YES!!! Besides the slow, poorly acted and written first hour this was a great Star Wars picture.  Unlike Episode 1 this had appeal for adults and children.  But a little more for the adults.  Let me break this down for you.  First with the story.The story was not bad.  Nothing grand but nothing horrible either. Basically is deals with an assassination attempt on Senator Amidala (no longer queen)  Anakin who has a huge thing for her must along with obi won protect her.  While doing their duty Obi Won finds out that a mass army of soldier clones are being created for the republic.  But who would order them?  Not spoiling anymore for you.  Go and see it.  The first hour dragged very much.  I didn't really care for the love factor of the story.  All my friend previous to the movie said it would suck.  They were right.  But I admired the Pearl harbor love story even though it was cliched and totally recylced.  Thats just me.  But our next subject is the actingActing in this movie was only supplied by 1 and half people.  Obi Won,  and half of Anakins performance.  Anakin in the beginning when he was all humble was really a bore.  He had no flare to him.  It was like he was just there. But once he turned on the anger button he was amazing.  You felt the anger through the screen.  I was really frightened by his character.  Obi Won is always good.  He was good in the Episode 1 and just as good here.  Now who was the worst? Natalie Portman!!!!!  I was so dissapointed by her. I....okay I know I am going to get a lot of angry looks for this but.... liked episode 1 a lot.  I even....god... Liked Jar jar binks to a point. But I think Amidala in episode 2 was even worse then jar Jar Binks in episode 1.  She was just a flat character.  In episode 1 I thought she was fine but it seems that when they took her crown away they also took away her ability to act.  Very bad.   Now on to the next point of order. Writing and directionOkay.  The Special effects were amazing.  Going into a Star Wars film you know Lucas will deliever 100% with that category.  His direction was quit well.  I have no real compliants about this because Lucas is a very talented director.  But he needs to take writing classes on how not to make a uninteresting love story.  I really hated the love story so much that it almost ruined the movie for me.  There was chemistry between the two characters but the lines and situations were so cheesy. Now my final words on the film.Episode 2 is not as bad as the critics say.  Believe me.  They make it out to be the most dissapointed movie ever to be released.  it is a fun movie that won't fail your expectations.  If they aren't that high.  For me episode 1 didn't drag on.  episode 2 did.  But enough comparing.  There is tons of foreshadowing in the movie to furture events which I liked.  The force is strong with this one in a summer of blockbusters.Final Rating: *** out of ****",8,0,0,16 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter Review
","'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' follows our heroes Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as they set out to find the seven objects, known as Horcruxes in the film, that will evidently destroy the evil Voldermort. It is a extremely difficult task since not only are they hidden in unknown places, but also the knowledge on how to destroy them is unknown too. There is also one more person who faces an extremely difficult task too, director David Yates. Can he possibly make a Potter movie that not only takes place out of the familiar Hogwarts and is much more dramatic still lovable to J.K. Rowling's fans? David Yates has surpassed Christopher Columbus in terms of handling the reigns with the popular series. Columbus up until now was the only one who directed more than one Potter film. The third film (Azakaban) was directed by Alfanso Cauron and the fourth (Goblet) was directed by Mike Newell. Yates, then came in and handled the fifth (Order), sixth (Half-Blood Prince), and finally this film, that has been split into two parts. The reasoning being because nothing is being cut out of the this time around. Fans rejoiced when they found out they would be getting a five hour conclusion to their beloved series. Yates has said to have brought out the maturity in the series that it needed. Under his eye, the films definitely have more of an adult feel to them. Signs of the change were present the second 'Order of Phoenix' started with Potter's evil cousin, Dudley, finally got what was coming to him. Even before Dudley came face to face with one of the most feared inhabitants of the wizarding world, you could sense something terrible was bound to happen. Yates perfectly nailed the sense of dreariness through the flushed out colors and perfectly placed camera angles. Then in 'The Half Blood Prince' he created a very sympathetic character out of Horace Slughorn, with the help of Jim Broadbeant. Here, he keeps the same gift for creating dread and despair. One of the first scenes in the film, a poor ex-teacher at Hogwarts, hangs in the air while Voldermort's crew discusses their next move. We know, as does she, it is just a matter of time before she bites the dust. It is detail like this that make these films establish the dark tone that Yates is going for.Before I make the poor guy seem like a one-dimensional director, I will point out some of the other strong points that he possesses as a director. There are some scenes of thrilling action and creativity that are just a sight to see. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione, must infiltrate the Ministry of Magic, they drink the physical form changing Poly Juice Potion, to turn into awkward adults. This scene is a joy to watch because it is adventurous and quite comical. Another scene is when Hermione tells a wizard fairy tale. I won't go into detail about it, but it shows how much these films have taken an identity of their own. An identity that we will only get to enjoy for only 150 minutes more.Grade= B",7,0,1,22 November 2010
Divergent," The Cerebral Games
","Since the release of the juggernaut 'Twilight' back in 2008, Hollywood has been searching for any film, based on a young adult novel, that would spark the same craze those movies did. While some are successes, such as 'The Hunger Games', there are countless others that just fall to the waste side. Does the new film 'Divergent' rise to occasion or just fall into the same league as the other failures? The plots of 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent' are very similar but different in their own ways. Both take place in a futuristic society that has become a wasteland. The people in these societies have been split into different factions that serve their own purpose to the high power of the government. These governments try to play it off as if they are one of the people but, of course, stand for everything these societies are built on, which is freedom.In 'Divergent', which takes place in a post-war Chicago, people are split into five factions: the selfless Abgenations, the peaceful Amitys, the honest Candors, the brave Dauntless, and the intelligent Edrudites. When children are sixteen they are given a test to see where they would fit in. After the results are given, they are must choose to go with what their results were or choose their own path. Our young heroine, Beatrice or Tris as she later refers to herself as, is urged by her family and faction in Abnegation to stay, but becomes part of the Dauntless. She wants to be part of the group who protects the city and lives a more wild lifestyle than the other four.The first half of the film is a bit slow paced. It is a very stereotypical journey of a fragile young woman slowly being transforming into a strong woman. As Tris, the film's star Shailene Woodley does just fine. Tris isn't as powerful of a character as Katniss from 'The Hunger Games' but also isn't a complete bore like Bella Swan. She falls nicely in the middle. Though Woodley, at times, does play it bland at times she does own the role and makes you care about this young girl and her journey.Director Neil Burger does the future well. It is a very sterile future that seems too clean and pure for its own good. As far as the look of everything it echoes science fiction films like 'Logan's Run'. Burger does have some pacing issues with a run time that went a bit too long. It is close to 150 minutes. Some of it, especially the beginning, could have been trimmed a bit. The only other fault I would give the director would be the waste of the role that Winslet has. What is with Hollywood casting great actresses to fill roles that aren't good enough for their talents? It happened in 'Elysium' with Jodie Foster and it does in this film with Winslet. It isn't a terrible performance but one that just requires them to go through the motions of being a typical female baddie, right down to the wardrobe.Those things that don't work are overshadowed by what does work. The film is quite smart in the way it handles what it has to say. The title of the film comes from those select people in society who have all the qualities of the five factions. They have the ability to have empathy and see situations as whole instead of just through their own factions beliefs. Of course, the higher ups, who are the Edrudities, don't want this because this would inspire hope in people through ideas. They are creating soldiers through brain washing their citizens into doing their dirty work. It is a an interesting way to communicate to younger people, who read these novels, the power of influence and the even greater power of fear of non-acceptance. Even though she can kick ass, which she does to her costar Milles Teller, who plays a sleaze bag here, who also starred with in the the terrific 'The Spectacular Now', Tris' true power is her ability to influence others and show that they don't have to succumb to others beliefs. Woodley does have the pureness to sell this ideal. One of her initiation processes is facing her fears head on in a dream like sequence. Burger captures the insanity that goes through a young teenage girl's mind perfectly. Especially one in the wasted world where Beatrice grew up in. There are other surprisingly wise decisions made in this film to communicate the down falls of a controlled society which you should see for yourself.While 'The Hunger Games' shows its points through a grand and epic scale, 'Divergent' is more cerebral in the way it lays out its evidence. 'Divergent' maybe the answer to people who like a less flashy way of telling them the downfalls of the 'perfect society",8,2,8,30 March 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," It's a beautiful Day!
","What makes the majority of the 'X-men' franchise work, except for the terrible 'Origins', and not so much with the mediocre 'The Last Stand', is that it clings to the theme about those who are different, how they react to the world, and how the world reacts to them. In 'X-men: Days of Future Past' is takes the theme again for the seventh time and makes it seem fresh. This is a film that is not only a hell of a good time to watch but also contains some great commentary.We open up with a war going on. Both new and old X-men are battling it out with machines called, The Sentinels, who are overpowering our beloved and misunderstood heroes. It is quite frightening to see these God like mutants, that we come to love, being easily taken down. These machines adapt to each individual power that a mutant throws at them. They are truly frightening and unforgiving with the punishment they put down on the X-men. In a desperate attempt to change the current events, Charles Xavier suggests that he uses time travel to go back in time and prevent the assassination of Bolivar Trask ('Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage, having a great time). Trask is responsible for the creation of the machines that are wiping out and imprisioning all the mutants around the world. On the other side of the trigger of the gun that will kill him is Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Since Charles is too weak, Wolverine (the ever reliable Hugh Jackman) volunteers to go back.Wolverine's challenge is not just stopping the assassination but also convincing the old Charles of the tragic future. Charles is not the calm and wise man that he is in the future. As played by James McAvoy, he is full of regret and anger. Though he is able to walk, through the use of a serum that calms his telepathic abilities, he has given up on life and the cause he started in 'First Class'. McAvoy gets so much to play with, thanks to a wonderful script by Simon Kinberg, and he once again makes Charles a great, but flawed, character. Ian McKellan's Magneto also gets a worthy performance out of his younger self. Michael Fassbender provides Erik, Magento's real name, with the same conflicting sense of self we have come to know of the character. He is so 'magnetic' that you can't help to actually understand him and feel for his side of the cause. While this is being sold as the ultimate X-men movie, those two characters along with Beast, Wolverine, and Mystique are the main focus of the story. Nicholas Hoult is a great beast. His nerdy and nervous side is as convincing as when he rages then turns furry and blue Academy Awards winner Lawrence is still as vicious and sexy as ever as the shape shifter. Jackman, getting up there in age seems to get more ripped and angry as ever. Unlike 'Origins' where he was just a ball of rage, he sells the urgency of saving his kind quite well. The newcomer here is a rebellious mutant teenager named Quicksilver. 'American Horror Story' star Evan Peters speaks as quickly as his mutant character runs. The character's power has a whole scene dedicated to it. It is one of the highlights of the film. Peters not only captures the coolness of the character in that scene, but the playful rebellious nature any teenager would have if they had that power.Though the time travel aspect of the story is the main gem of the story, it is the philosophy of the results of both scenarios where the movie finds its dramatic footing. The film takes a nice turn when the younger Magneto starts to question the mission. Mystique also has hesitations about what she has set out to do. Lawrence perfectly plays the ever going battle of both Charles's and Erik's philosophies doing battle in her mind. Every facial expression or expression of dialogue is captured with ease. What do you expect from an actress of her caliber being able to play in a comic book world? She is going to add so much to it, and she does.When Bryan Singer came back, the director of the first two, there was worry that he may mess up the tone that Vaughn captured in 'First Class'. It was a film that respected what Singer had set up in the originals but established its own feel and attitude. Singer pays back Vaughn by remaining true to the playful nature that this thing can be sometimes. The film is just so cool sometimes that you expect it to be wearing a leather coat and sunglasses. Singer also creates some of the most exciting action scenes in the franchise. The ending battle has Magneto stealing an entire baseball field. Yeah, you read that right. That is not to say the other action sequences aren't worthy. The action is as big as it is fun.Singer has taken the attitude of 'First Class' and combined it with his grand scale ambitions to create a summer blockbuster that is something more. It is smart, funny, cool, and one hell of a ride.",9,0,1,25 May 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Hotel Anderson
","Wes Anderson films have become events. This maybe because he has his own individual style that doesn't bow down to Hollywood or follow the pack. Even if his films aren't always home runs you can't hate on them too hard because they are completely his own. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' may not be the strongest film in the Anderson library but it is a beautiful film that has its moments.Anderson's films all have the storybook look to them and what better way to drive this point home than to start the film with a young girl opening up a book that contains the narrative to this story? A young writer, who is briefly played by Tom Wilkinson then handed over to Jude Law, is staying in the famous Grand Budapest Hotel. Though it seems very docile at the moment we find out the hotel has a rich history. The young writer runs into Mr. Moustafa who knows a lot of the history about the place. When he was a young man and looking for his place in the world he worked at the hotel. Zero, as he was referred to as a young man, works under the great Gustave. Gustave runs things by making sure his customers are taken care of in every way possible and I mean every way possible. Let's just say Gustave has a taste for older women. One of these women are Madame D.. When she turns up dead, in an apparent murder, Gustave becomes a suspect even though she left him her most prized possession, a work of art 'Boy with Apple'. Gustave, with the help of Zero, must secure the painting from Madame D's evil son, Dmitri, and find out who killed her.Ralph Fiennes is someone who doesn't venture into comedy that often. Here, he gives Gustave a a playful nature that should provide the actor enough evidence to try comedy some more. He sells the physical comedy as well as the witty script by Anderson. Much of his screen time is shared with Zero who is played by Tony Revolori. Revolori who, even though he has had small parts in other films, gets an introduction credit in this film. Fiennes and him have great chemistry together. Zero looks up to Gustave and Revolori sells it with his naive wide eyed optimism even when Gustave passively insults him at times. Overall, Gustave is hard on Zero because he sees the determination in the young man's eyes. The film wouldn't have worked without the chemistry of these two succeeding.The film's quirkiness does muddle the central story of the murder mystery. In Anderson's early works he seemed somewhat restrained in the way he revealed the oddness of his films. It seems, at times, that he purposely tries to inject each scene with some Wes Anderson-ness. Even though the supporting characters are perfectly played by some of Hollywood's interesting actors they seem more like caricatures than fleshed out people. Still, it is still great to see actors like Saoirse Ronan, who like Fiennes rarely venture into comedy, cut loose. She also like Fiennes does a great job and should do more comedy.Every shot is beautifully shot with Anderson's precision to detail present. Even a shot of a dessert treat is expertly filmed. Anderson shoots the film in different aspect ratios in each time period. The main part of the story is shot in 4:3 with black blocks on both sides of the screen. This may annoy some viewers but I found it a bold choice that I quickly got used to. The film also mixes sets, miniatures, background paintings, and real life locations quite well. When the movie does sag a bit in its narrative your attention will be picked up again by the gorgeousness shot by cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' isn't a terrible picture by any means. There are moments of greatness in it. It just lacks the natural comedic power that similar odd ball pictures like Anderson's 'Rushmore' or 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' contained. Anderson shouldn't have to prove to anyone that he is different from the pack. We have seen this in his growth over the last few years as a film maker but it doesn't seem like he does.",6,2,8,30 March 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The 'Almost there' Spiderman
","While watching 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' it is very clear why Marc Webb was given the reigns as director. When it comes to the emotional core of the story and getting performances to match those many emotions in the film he does a hell of a job. The romance between Gwen and Peter is much more believable and real than Peter and Mary Jane's in Sam Raimi's trilogy. If only the rest of the film had the precision that the love story does this film would have been a home run.The film falls somewhere in the middle of something amazing and a missed opportunity. It never does get to the lows of some of the most terrible comic book movies like 'Batman and Robin'. What is most frustrating about it is that there is greatness hidden in such a bloated film where the misses outshine the hits. The first part of the movie where we are shown how comfortable Peter has fit into his role as the hero of the city while trying juggle his feelings and guilt about Gwen and the broken promise he failed to keep with her dad is where the film shines. This goes beyond Garfield and Stone being a real couple. There have been plenty of films where the two leads were a real life item but the chemistry failed to translate to the screen. Garfield and Stone are perfect for each other in this movie. They bounce off each other perfectly with all the romance and flirtatious dialogue they are given. While the romance is the strongest aspect of the film it does crutch on a bit too much at times, which in results in it being a bit too cutsey. That said, all the rest of the relationships are quite well done. Aunt May, played by Sally Field, is still a great emotional center for Peter. She provides Peter with what Uncle Ben did before he was killed. The characters growth is sold through Field's acting ability and some interesting plot points. In this film we meet the famed comic book villain Harry Osborn, who eventually becomes The Green Goblin. Even though Harry and Peter's relationship origin has been changed and is a bit underwritten; Dane DeHaan and Garfield do give off the vibe they were friends separated by life's obstacles. DeHann is sinister, cold, and a bit frightening with the limited screen time he has. It is going to be interesting what he brings us next time with more screen time.That screen time is given to Max Dillion and is one of the mistakes the movie commits. Where Harry's story is full intrigue, important to Peter's life, and had the potential to be something really great, we are given an extremely clichéd and underwritten backstory to why Dillion turns evil when he becomes Electro. Where Harry feels like he could have been a great fleshed out character, Electro feels like a secondary villain. Foxx does his best, and he is good, but the character is very underwritten and seems to have no other purpose than to showcase the effects in the movie. Andrew Garfield's confidence in this film has grown. He captures both the awkwardness and heroism that Spiderman/Peter Parker possesses. When he has that mask on he is a man that so many place their hope in for a better city. This point is nicely done at first but kind of gets overly dramatic towards the end. One thing that Garfield is great at is the legendary Spiderman wise cracks. His sarcasm and wit are so sharp when it needs to be. This is mainly because you can see Garfield loves playing the role. The bar has been set by Andrew for future actors of the role.One thing I will give Webb is that it seems he embraces the fun of Spiderman this time around. Where the 2012 film was a tad serious, this one embraces the spirit of Spiderman and the fun it is to be him. Even the suit has lost the out of place dark eyes and replaced them with the iconic large white eyes. The colors of the film are more vibrant, especially when it comes to Electro's screen time. When combined with Garfield's spirit it creates a light hearted superhero film that has seemed to be lost and looked down upon ever since Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' franchise. Several points in this film will bring a slight smile to the most jaded comic book movie fans. There are times though the choice of making it lighter does backfire. Some scenes or lines come off way too corny or feel like they belong in a bad 90's comic book film. For the most part though, Webb understands the balance between fun and serious. His ambitious nature does hurt the film a bit. Where some parts of the are extremely well done and you want to see them expanded, the amount of material stuffed into this film prevents that from happening. The first time Webb had to search for his own identity and found it in this film. Maybe next time he will learn to trim the fat because underneath this good film is something truly amazing. Hopefully next time we will get to see that.",7,0,4,7 May 2014
Win Win," Win Win Review
","'They don't know who you are'. Lawyer and part time wrestling coach Mike (Paul Giamatti) says this to his star young player, Kyle (Alex Shaffer). The same can be applied to the young new actor who plays the troubled, but gifted Alex.Director and co-writer Thomas McCarthy, chose the real life all state champion, Shaffer, to portray a young man whose only escape from his hectic life is his love and talent for high school wrestling. How does the kid do? This reviewer thinks the kid has found a brand new career in Hollywood. More on that later.Outside of the newcomer, how is the movie? It is one of the best films of the year. It is a movie full of tough choices, laughs, and amazing performances. McCarthy, who gave us 2008's 'The Visitor', which I haven't seen, but was a critical and public success, has hit a home run. Giamatti's Mike, is a good guy, who has just had one negative thing thrown at him time and time again. He sees an opportunity to make some extra cash for his struggling law firm by illegally beating the system. He uses one of his clients, who is suffering from early signs of dementia. Even though he is stealing the money from the client, he in turn takes of the client. On top of supporting a family, he also coaches a wrestling team that is the laughing stock of all the local schools. It isn't until the client's grandson, Kyle, comes in that things start to turn around not only for Mike, but Kyle. Kyle, comes from a broken home where the mother is in and out of drug rehab centers. He wants some type of stable relationship and he finds it in Mike's family. Mike's wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan), and their two daughters take a liking to him. Just when things are looking up for Mike and his team, who Kyle helps turn into a winning team, the mother comes back and chaos ensues.Even though at first glance the movie may seem about wrestling, that is only a plot device for a movie about human relationships. Shaffer, who is much better than half of the actors his age, shows as much confidence as an actor as he does on the mat. Jackie and Kyle's relationship is very touching at times. Jackie is the mother bird mending the broken wing that is Kyle's life. It is nothing too cheesy or overly dramatic, it is perfectly balanced.Giamatti, how is he? What do you think? He has a much more restrained role in this film. Even though he doesn't have the looks of the a leading man, he has something better, something that won't fade...TALENT! McCarthy perfectly balances the comedy and drama here. It never gets too silly, but also never gets so mundane with the drama. The performances are the strong point here and they are working off a fantastic script.",8,0,1,22 April 2011
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Beautiful
","When Match Point came out in 2005, I was impressed, but no blown away like most of the public and critics. I thought it was an interesting movie that dealt with dark issues, but it didn't feel like Woody Allen. Scoop was a cute movie, but felt like fluff.I am here to tell you after going on opening night that VICKY Christina BARCELONA isn't only enchanting, but so well written. I always look forward to Woody's writing because he is the best. The film just looks beautiful from the way it is shot. Javier, Scarlett and Cruz (Hilarous) are all good, but it is Rebecca Hall who stands out in this picture; giving Vicky such depth and character.Allen is just the master. In the summer of effects and action, it is nice to have a film with such wit and smart observation in it. GO SEE IT!",9,102,179,15 August 2008
The Deer Hunter," Scary...
","My parents exposed me to horror films when I was a child, so nothing really scares me when so called Horror movies come out. Baddies like Jason, Freddy, Pinhead, Leather face, etc...never really got to me. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying I am totally bored by the horror genre, but it takes a lot to scare me.In 2005, my good friend told me I must watch THE DEER HUNTER because it was an experience I'd never forget. I took three hours out of my day and watched it. After those three hours I was speechless about what I just saw. Not only that, but I was scared out of my wits and the film actually depressed me for the next few days because I couldn't stop thinking about it.What makes this movie so scary that it is realistic and can happen to just about anybody. Have three life long friends? Have a possible scenario where you three can be drafted into a war? With a post trama happening to all three of you, you have just experienced what these three characters in the Deer Hunter face.The first hour of the movie is just a simple wedding that introduces all three men. While I was watching this, I kept thinking, 'why are they spending so much damn time with this wedding?' After the movie ended, I wouldn't have had in any other way. The wedding is what creates this bond that is true between these men. Without it, the ending wouldn't be so heart breaking.Without spoiling the ending for you, let me just tell you it is haunting. You know what is going to happen, but even when it does, it is shocking and heartbreaking. And that my friends, it beautiful film making.My final word: They do not make them like this anymore.10!",10,0,1,17 August 2008
Godzilla," A return to Scaly Form
","One of the positive things about the new 'Godzilla' is that it respects the lore of the great big guy. It shows you how off the 1998 version was, even if you liked it. Though this new version is fun to watch and gets a lot right, there still are some bumpy times to be had.Behind the camera calling the shots this time is Gareth Edwards. Four years ago he was responsible for the the small, but very effecting monster film, 'Monsters'. His skills made that film impressive in the sense that he did it with a very small budget. It was a no brainer to have him make the reboot of Godzilla. Here, his monster is more of a supporting character that gets stuck behind some of the most interesting actors in film today. While some of the story works, other parts fall flat to mediocre story telling and overly dramatic parts. In 1999, an event rocked Tokyo causing a fall out at the Nuclear power plant. One of the victims was the wife of Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston. Any qualms about the other actors are put to rest when Cranston is on screen. Even though he has limited screen time he makes the most of it. His character's motivations are crazy but Cranston makes them sincere and real. While the public was convinced by the government that an earthquake was responsible for the fall out, Joe knows something bigger was at play. One of his escapades lands him in jail. In America, specifically San Francisco, Joe's younger and estranged military son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson, is home with his own son and beautiful wife, Elle, played by Elizabeth Olsen. He is called to get his father out of jail. After he gets him out he is then whisked away on another one of his father's crazy missions to uncover the conspiracy that began in 1999. We find out that all the radiation from the nuclear tests have created a pair of monster like creatures named, 'MUTO' (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). The more radiation that is present, the more they will grow.While these MUTOS have been given a scientific reason for existing, Godzilla is given a more mythological one, even though he has been created the same way. According to two scientists, played by Ken Watanbe and Sally Hawkins, Godzilla is nature's way of fighting back against the forces of mankind. 'The ignorance of man is thinking that we are in control of nature and not the other way around', remarks Watanbe's character. It is a nice set up for why Godzilla exists in this world. It gives the character a bit of mystery. Edwards decisions on the big green guy are ace. The size and weight of him are perfectly captured. You will believe that Godzilla exists and is walking amongst the frightened citizens. The animation of the beast is absolutely breathtaking. Whenever he is on screen he demands your attention and you will give it to him. Edwards teases battles by cutting away from every one outside the final one at the end of the movie. It is a decision that may irritate some but fascinate others. When the final battle does come, it is worth the price of admission.Of course, the movie can't rely on the title character to do everything. There has to be some human element to the story. While the story, outside of Godzilla isn't as bad as some might say, it is where the movie does feel a bit wobbly. When Cranston leaves, he actually takes some of the energy with him. All the actors are good, but they are given very little to work with. Scientific evidence comes off as mumble jumble at points. Olsen's character is given nothing more than being the concerned wife who cries a lot. This isn't going to be Shakespearean and she does give it her all. This isn't a knock against Olsen because a lesser actress probably would've destroyed the role and brought the movie down. The ending to the film is very overly dramatic and reminded me of something that should have been stuck in the 90's version of the story. What is a nice touch with the film is that before that ending the movie establishes the fact that Godzilla is just doing his own thing. The movie nicely separated the events of the humans and Godzilla. They were just in his way and he was in theirs. You can't fault the film for this extra cheese final minutes though because outside of that it does do pretty okay. Some of the shots Edwards conceives are a joy to watch, especially in a big theater, because of the epic scope of it all. He films some of the action using the first person technique that adds so much to scene that contributes the danger the characters are in during the monster scenes. One breath taking shot, from the trailer, has one of the paratroopers passing Godzilla on the way down to the ground. The dark clouds quickly fade away and we immediately see Godzilla and a MUTO battling, all in the first person perspective. It really brings home the point of how big and powerful both the MUTOS and Godzilla are and how minuscule the humans are against these things. Edwards establishes the atmosphere quite well through the film. These things are scary and powerful, unlike the walking lizard in the '98 version.The action movie has evolved with films like 'The Dark Knight' where the story and acting are as good as the effects. Though sometimes it is nice just to sit back and watch a well made movie that wants to have fun doing its thing. This is what 'Godzilla' does. It never reaches the lows of some of the brainless movies that crowd our theaters. Edwards stages action with such an amazing eye that makes it both epic and suspenseful.",8,2,4,25 May 2014
The Soloist," Shows how great Wright is as a director
","The Soloist- *** This movie is a test in my eyes, showing how great of a director Joe Wright is, for those of you who were unsure. This is the man who brought us the fantastic 2005 version of 'Pride and Prejudice' and 2007's wonderful 'Atonement'. With those movies, he was working with great stories based on best selling novels. Here, he is working from the source material of an author, but it is a story that is very cliché.The author is Steve Lopez, who is played by Robert Downey Jr., who's life was changed after he meets a homeless man, Nathaniel Ayers, who sits in a traffic tunnel, with his cello, beautifully playing classical music. Lopez, in the film, is divorced, broken and lost. Even though the real Lopez is happily married and one of the L.A. Times most valuable resources, I understand why they made slight changes to the character. This is a typical Hollywood feel good story, right down to the forced moments of emotion with the instrumental music kicking in even more than usual.This movie was supposed to come out in the Fall of 2008, upgrading its chance to garner some Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor and etc. Shortly before it was supposed to be released, the movie was puled from its date and placed in a spring time slot. When this happened, many questioned how good it actually was.As stated before, the movie is not bad, it is actually well made for what it was, but it is all too familiar. The performances are even very well done, Downey Jr. and Foxx have great chemistry. Separately, they are even great. Downey, gives his character a vulnerable charm that comes across quite well. Foxx, who could of just made Nathaniel a one dimensional character, makes the role something worth the price of admission.As I write this review, I have really no desire to go into it. I know I gave it three stars, but it is given because the movie would have been a disaster if it did not have talent behind it.",6,1,2,27 May 2009
Up in the Air," A movie with so many layers
","Just like a memorable song or book, a film could be a representation of a certain time period. 'Up in the Air' is not only a masterfully written, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed picture, but it is one that is extremely layered. Look past the basic premise of the film and you will see that it shows how the world is changing through relationships, business, and technology. There is a film society called 'National Film Registry', which films that belong to it are significant to a time period. I could not think of one better than this film to show future generations what was going on in the start of the new century. This is a film that you can seriously have a great conversation about with a friend. Isn't that what great art does?",9,2,7,21 December 2009
