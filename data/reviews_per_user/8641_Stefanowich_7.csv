Requiem for a Dream," A masterpiece if there ever was one!
","After Pi I was confused, was the movie good or bad? Couldn't really tell so I had to watch it again, again and again. Finally I decided that Pi was, and is, an epic masterpiece.Therefor I looked forward to Requiem For A Dream and the wait was well worth it. Requiem is nothing short of a masterpiece if there ever was one. The atmosphere is extremely dark and your gut twitches through the whole extravaganza. Just when you think it can't possible get any crueler/darker it sure does, and then again and again until the movie ends.After watching, sorry, living, Requiem For A Dream you're left with a strange feeling in your gut. Is this possible? Problem is, it probably is!
Be happy for your own life and everytime you feel depressed make sure to load your DVD-player with Requiem For A Dream. It will make you feel a lot easier...Requiem For A Dream is up there with The Godfather Saga, Naked, Samurai Trilogy, Das Boot, Stalingrad, Seven Samurai, English Patient, Le Grand Bleu etc.",10,0,0,23 July 2001
Minority Report," great start, sucker ending...
","stupidity... spielberg gets of to a good start but halfway through the movie the whole cabang turns hollywood and american patrionism. great start, sucker standard-a-ending. stay away if you're not into tissue-hollywood-standard-stuff. peter stormare is the only thing that stands out as good in an, at best, average movie.",5,1,3,10 July 2002
The English Patient," Beautiful.
","This film is an epic masterpiece! Turn off the telephones, lock the door, turn out the light and watch this with someone you love - it's so beautiful...",10,2,6,5 October 1998
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Bad mouth musical!
","Do not misunderstand me - I really did love this film. The problem is the singing every five minutes. If I wanted to see a musical I would have seen 'Annie', NOT Southpark. Matt Stone and Trey Parker has performed well in creating a humoristic movie and some of the songs are ok too, but there are far too many of them. You'll start pressing fast forward sooner or later, probably sooner. Too bad folks. What could have been a truly fantastic movie is messed up by too much singing.",8,1,1,13 January 2000
The Last Samurai," Tom Crui$$$e is Rambo, The Last Samurai without fear...
","Pros. The Last Samurai is a nicely crafted motion picture with some truly stunning scenes, the assassin attempt come to mind as a stand out-moment. The scenery is nice as well as the photography.Cons. Fact: Tom Cruise never dies in a movie, thus efficiently removing every last bit of thrill with this ride. It's like wathing Rambo taking on the Soviets in Rambo III or the VC in Rambo, you just know there's no way he'll bite the dust. The Last Samurai without Tom, and without the (WARNING!!! SPOILER!!!) happy Hollywood-ending, would have been a superior movie. As it is now The Last Samurai is just another Days of Thunder where the wheels have been traded for horses, or a Cocktail with bamboo sticks and swords instead of bottles and drinks. Tom even gets to kiss the girl making this yet another Crui$e ca$$$h-in. BIG disappointment!",6,1,2,19 April 2004

Casino Royale," Best Bond ever!
","The screenwriters, the director and the producers - they've all taken a huge chance with Casino Royale. Leaving the comedy-style James Bond we've grown accustomed to and gone darker, grittier and most definitely bloodier than ever before. Daniel Craig is the new James Bond, and he is James Bond like no one before. James Bond in Casino Royale is impulsive and sometimes makes the wrong decisions. When he gets beaten he gets bloody and it hurts. Badly. He's simply more human and I love it! As far as the dark side of James Bond goes I simply say, stay dark James. Stay dark. With Daniel Craig, and the new dark setting, a new James Bond has been born. Casino Royale is not only the best James Bond movie ever. It's most definitely one of the best action movies ever! To sum it up; Casino Royale is James Bond joining Vic Mackey on his Strike Team and going after the bad guys no holds barred!",10,2,6,3 December 2006
