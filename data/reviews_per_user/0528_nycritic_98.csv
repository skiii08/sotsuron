The New World," The Tragedy of Time Lost
","Terence Malick and Michael Cimino should join forces, discuss fantastic, labyrinthine, Quixotic tales they've been spinning in their uber-artistic minds floating somewhere out in Pluto, buy 1,000,000 miles of film (or all the digital camcorders in the world, providing they've embraced the present century and want to make sure they have enough tools to work with), assemble an preposterous cast consisting of every major and minor working actor or actress (and why not, even a couple of skin actors thrown in for fun), get two newcomers to star, and start filming without any concern for the plot or characters or dialogue until what they have is the Tower of Babel of movies, a behemoth so unbelievable in size and scope that it would take 20 years to view in its entirety and would make Cecil B. DeMille's epics seems like 1 minute shorts.How is it possible to fail so portentously? And this isn't even pretend fail, it's not the kind of you can dismiss -- this is a major train wreck with no survivors, it's failure with a capital F emblazoned in shining red letters over Times Square in front of the Marriott Marquis. It's the kind that needs to be studied under a microscope to see if it's contagious.Whatever happened to making coherent movies that actually bothered to tell a story and not condescend to the audience in having them look at this thing loosely called a movie with the wide eyes of someone whose never seen moving images on screen? It starts out well -- the arrival of the ships to American shore, the almost hyper-reality that paints a land, untouched, and the quiet appearance of the 'Naturals' (a fancy word for the less PC 'Indians').It's just that after the first oh, fifteen minutes, which introduce this mangled, unedited mess, are over, it becomes an exercise in sheer tedium. There is no actual dialogue for the longest time, and the presences of Christopher Plummer -- among a roster of big name actors, all British -- never make more than a vague impression. It's like watching a Seurat painting up close -- everything becomes blurred beyond recognition. It doesn't matter, anyhow -- they're gone before anyone can register they've been there filling up screen time.Later on, the movie meanders like many of its dainty creeks and streams, showing how John Smith insinuates himself as a member of the Natural's tribe, how he becomes the object of love from the never named Pocahontas (even though she's little more than 12 years old). This is one of the worst exercises in poetics I've seen in a long time. Both characters endlessly warble sweet nothings to each other off-screen as they run through the forests, cavort through the meadows, look longingly at each other, and let the nature envelop them like a nightmarish angora sweater. Battles ensue, people get killed, the Naturals make their violent nature known, Pocahontas gets disowned, Smith disappears, and nary a word of actual dialogue is heard for eternal spaces unless it's to enunciate something of vague meaning, and even then, it's filled with portent and gravitas. So much, it's a wonder the movie doesn't collapse by the sheer force of weight.And on and on it goes, where it stops, nobody knows. I noticed how time began to slip through my fingers, how my apartment began to smell like sour milk, rampant dejection, and dog-hair. The Discovery Channel would have had a field day analyzing the level of abandonment I had thrown it in. I noticed that my perfectly shaved head was all of a sudden sprouting a scraggly mane like crabgrass. I was dimly aware that my bones were aching, my muscles were cramping, my bowels were roaring -- at least faster than this movie was. And then it occurred to me: I was getting old. I was losing my looks. I was becoming Methuselah with body odor so strong it could be used as a weapon of mass destruction.Until finally, like manna from heaven, Christian Bale appeared. I figured, he looks like Jesus: is he here to Save Me? He's a whiff of fresh air, a scent of Clean Linen courtesy of Hallmark candles, Archangel Michael in the flesh. But no... I was aware I had 45 more minutes to go, so he morphed into a mirage of water in an endless desert: he, too, began chirping sweet nothings to Pocahontas as she looked unto the sky, opened her hands, and called out to her mother, the Being of All Things. It was then when I shot myself.It wasn't that bad, actually. I didn't die, so I figured God had a purpose left for me in this Earth that had since seen the Passing of Time, the End of an Era. So I got up, made some coffee, made sure it was extra charged, listened to more incomprehensible warbles, was aware of a thickness in the air and realized Summer was finally here, and when I came back, Pocahontas had croaked, the movie was over -- but not over. It had more scenery. And more. And even more. And, surprise-surprise, More. I then found my inner rage, embraced my indignity, grabbed the remote, yanked the DVD out, and shrieked: 'Stick a fork in me -- I am done!' And regained control of my life that had been irrevocably lost for those nine centuries I remained captive under Malick's druggy visuals.Anyone coming into this movie, either because of curiosity, Colin Farrell, or watching an underage girl who looks like the spawn of Ali McGraw and Joseph Gordon-Hewitt traipse across an expanse of woods and streams as if she was perpetually re-discovering, and surprised at their very existence would have a more entertaining time reading the article on Wikipedia. It's long. But actually, quite exciting.",1,11,19,26 May 2006
Walk the Line," I Walk the Line
","A biopic with a romantic core is James Mangold's latest offering as he narrates the high's and lows of the late Johnny Cash and the woman who stood beside him through it all (while keeping him just out of arm's reach), June Carter.Mangold's film has a great opening sequence: the Folsom Prison, site of his famed concert. Shot from the exterior it's a cold building, but the closer the shots take us, the louder the music becomes -- the rousing rockabilly before an anxious crowd awaiting to see their favorite performer, a man who had it all at one point and nearly lost it. This man is Johnny Cash, and a crucial event as a child shaped his fatalistic streak and set the stage for family dysfunction. Seen as a boy, then as a young man, Cash remains the same: a man with the boy inside trying to make things work and be someone to please his father. He has a family of his own, and works from door to door as a traveling salesman until he goes by a recording studio and gets the notion that he too could become a music performer. However, his audition bombs: Sam Phillips, musical producer, interrupts Cash's band's performance of 'I Was There When it Happened' -- a song with religious overtones -- and tells Cash to perform his music like he feels it. He chooses 'Folsom Prison Blues' and from a slow start, the song gains momentum until it reaches a frenzy... and a legend is born.It's the stuff of every biopic: their humble start, their incursion into music and initial rejection until they strike the note which makes them famous, chart topping hits and raving concerts, debauchery, a pivotal moment which send them spiraling down, hitting rock bottom, the slow climb back up from scratch, redemption. It's all here. If it weren't for the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon and this massive fireball of energy that virtually leaps out of the screen in its many musical moments, it would be another by-the-numbers story that wouldn't even seem out of place in a VH1 'Behind the Music' series. Both of them ignite the screen whenever they are performing, together or alone, and inhabit their roles without a seam showing through. From their 'Meet Cute' moment where June shows her comedic side -- a facade hiding her own inner fears of being a failure -- to the later events in which Cash will find himself relying on her (and her family) to simply live, they are perfect in bringing this love story to light. We believe that in essence, Johnny Cash and June Carter were the couple who were meant to be, and that's what makes it worthwhile to see their lives on display in this great film.",9,1,3,28 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Leave Sensibility at the Door
","This is it: the most outrageous, offensive, unbelievably hilarious movie that has come out in the last 100 years -- since the inception of movie-making itself. BORAT isn't just a film: it's the reinvention of comedy per se. Looking at one surreal scene unfold, splatter the screen with its sheer insanity, and then gleefully move on to yet another moment that manages to top the previous one (a hard thing to do in comedy since the majority of them have the mandatory peaks and valleys -- some with more valleys than peaks), is practically a health hazard. There were times when I had to grab my stomach because of the pain of so much laughter. One particular moment was the one when the children run towards the ice cream truck as a black bear comes out roaring through the window, effectively sending the kids screaming back in terror. Is it correct? Not quite, but that's what the movie is about -- skewering every belief we the viewer hold dear and never bothering to apologize. When Borat and his camera-man run away from the bed and breakfast in terror because they're Jews, it's Borat's own clueless belief that we're laughing at. This also takes front stage when Borat gets a lesson on how to go to the bathroom by some very ultra conservative folk who are blind to the surprise he has in store for them. If the movie slows down a little, it's only when Pamela Anderson -- the object of Borat's obsession -- appears. However, by then I was spent in laughter, and oddly enough, for such a balls-out funny movie, its ending was quite sweet. One of the best of 2006.",10,3,18,26 May 2007
Alien 3," The Essence, Killed Before the Film Even Starts
","When the very glue that held the air-tight plot of ALIENS together is torn off its fabric before the film begins, proper, can any amount of 'clever camera angles' and 'moody set pieces' fill in the void that is left? That is the question I ask myself because at the time this film was released I was in awe of David Fincher's dark images and clever editing, most notably in his videos for Madonna. True, ALIEN 3 tries to bring back the dread that the first movie contained and has some very unnerving sequences, but numerous re-writes leading to Newt's off screen death and Ripley's impregnation by an alien (as forced as any life-like expression on a mannequin) killed any emotional resonance that otherwise it would have had. This is what happens when money takes over and creativity flies out the window. Everything becomes a color-by-numbers cat and mouse game where everyone is a mouse running away from an alien. Ripley makes some questionable choices which are out of character early in the film and the time it takes for her own alien to pop out raises the issue: does the chest burster come flying out only when the plot deems it so?",6,313,326,18 February 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Descending Into Junkie Hell.
","One of the anti-drug slogans in the 80s was 'Just say no,' and it was given to us by not just the then First Lady, but by a slew of actors, many of them neck-deep into their own drug-induced binges fueled by too much money and a total lack of advice. If this movie had only come out then. Darren Aronofsky's powerful film REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that ultimate slogan who never preaches its message: it just allows its presence to slowly filter itself into the images as the four people at the core of this story slowly begin to rot from the inside out as their 'dreams' ultimately become replaced by the need to get high.What begins as just another story of regular people living in relative complacency in Brooklyn, NY, each of them wearing their aspirations on their sleeves -- Sara Goldfarb to go on television; her son Harry and his friend Tyrone to make it big; Harry's girlfriend Marian to become an dress designer in her own right -- starts to go sour almost immediately. Sara, a widow living a lonely life, gets a call (or imagines it as it can be interpreted) that comes as a promise for things to get better: she will be a contestant in her favorite TV show which she watches compulsively as she downs sweets and to get slim for her Big Night she decides to take some 'diet pills' to fit into her Red Dress. Harry and Tyrone experiment a little with the drugs they are selling and that leads to more and more and more. Into that web Marian is pulled, maybe out of her own displacement in the world, and since drugs passively target towards the displaced and the unwanted, making it all seem better -- we are informed that she is on the outs with her family even as they have given her full use of the apartment she lives in -- she falls under its spell.One would think, though, that with drug usage things would change, perception would change. That we see Sara going through the motions not once, twice, but for hours and hours and hours on a stretch as the 'diet pills' -- really speed -- take a hold over her is made more frightening when her own body starts cannibalizing itself and her own mind begins to wander. Her own security, her own privacy, literally becomes invaded one night as her own TV -- it in itself a source of addictive promises -- floods her own living room with a nightmarish game show that sends her screaming into the streets, Red Dress in tatters, a hag, still looking for her dream.That we see relationships crumble -- Marian and Harry eventually become strangers to one another and any promise they will ever see each other again is hollow; Tyrone and Harry's friendship also collapses -- is only secondary to the power of storytelling and to the degrees that these characters descend in their addictions. At times it does seem too cruel to even watch: there is a sequence involving all of the character's final destiny that takes stomach to follow, but if the rot that addiction was still contained up until now, this final sequence -- the climax of the film -- lets all the pus out and sends it relentlessly out into the audience and not once are we let a moment's breath until it's over. There is a final, haunting sequence, one involving all of the characters crawling into a fetal position, destroyed beyond repair, that is heart-rending. These, after all, were once children and were safe (as Tyrone's last vision indicates).The acting here is beyond all praise and material awards. Ellen Burstyn does what no actress yet has done in film history: push her physicality to extremes to convey an ordinary woman dehumanized by what she innocently thought were diet pills. She is a woman who could be anyone's mother, caught like a rabbit under a drug. All glamor and star ego goes out the window here -- and in doing so she single-handedly assured her Place in what is called being an Actress.The same can be said with Jennifer Connelly in a role that could have been underwritten (and at times seems so) but in a move similar to Jennifer Jason Leigh she reveals herself so nakedly I'm almost sure her Best Supporting Oscar the following year was one a 'consolation' award for being overlooked here. Both Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans come through with their lost yet sympathetic roles, Wayans more so, since we get that glimpse into his past and all he dreams is of being a good son to his Momma.There is little relief but a painful compassion emerging from seeing REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. The Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell create an equally tragic score (that has been used in promos for LORD OF THE RINGS), and contains images that already can be considered classic. Some may argue that Aronofsky goes too far with his message, but in doing so he strikes a nerve to anyone who sees this film.",10,38,58,5 May 2005
The Ring," Videos Are Hazardous to your Health.
","There is a quote from the trailer for 1963 film version of THE HAUNTING: 'What does it take to prove to you that the dead don't always rest in peace?' Well, the question is about to be answered in Gore Verbinski's clever and very frightening adaptation of the Japanese movie RINGU.It tells the urban legend-like story of a 'cursed' video that, when viewed, will bring death unto the viewer within seven days -- no less, no more. As a matter of fact, the tongue-in-cheek beginning in which two teenage girls are chattering about this video sets the stage which inexorably details the unspeakable fate which is about to befall to one of the girls, Katie (played by 'JOAN OF ARCADIA' star Amber Tamblyn), the first of four victims to die in an inexplicable fashion.Enter Katie's aunt Rachel (Naomi Harris), a reporter called on by her sister to find out about what lead to her death. Rachel learns that Karie and three other friends died at exactly 10 o'clock at the same time and notices that pictures taken at a trip to a remote lodge reveal blurry, almost monstrous faces... as if their very images had been completely corrupted. She heads out to this lodge, picks up the video by chance, rents a room, views the tape -- which is a collection of disturbing, 'art-movie' images... and gets a call in which she has seven days to live.And as simple as that, the story of THE RING takes off into uncharted territory as Verbinski develops the events stemming off from the act of viewing this tape while simultaneously trying to find out about its nature: where it comes from, who made it, why does it even exist. Because Rachel only has seven days to solve this mystery, as does her ex-husband Noah who has seen the tape, and because their own son's life is also in danger, the tension is greatly heightened. Matters must be settled, because it's becoming progressively clear that this is no ordinary tape, and because things are getting more and more complicated, and the noose is tightening.Verbinski brings forth the back-story surrounding this tape expertly, a little at a time, almost casually. One is led to believe the woman in the video -- Anna Morgan -- is the person to focus on, but this is far from the truth, as are several other details surrounding the ill-fated Morgan family. This is a trick that Hitchcock used fairly regularly in all of his suspense films and Verbinski clearly knows his suspense: in not revealing too much too soon and misleading his viewers, he fools them. Adding surreal elements of imminent danger about to manifest itself at every turn only amps up the terror, and one sequence is a definite standout. While heading to a secluded island on a ferry, a horse, sensing something other than Rachel's presence (or reacting to her taint, since she has seen this cursed tape and is marked by its black energy), breaks free from where it's being kept and threatens to cause some grievous bodily harm to someone, anyone, on the ferry. What happens to that horse is as horrifying as anything committed on screen, even more so than the film's denouement, and forces us to realize we are entering into a world of true, absolute evil.The thing is, to fall right into the heart of a mystery can be one of the most awful things anyone can experience, and Rachel, here being the Final Girl, does just that. More than a reporter she is the person who penetrates the inner circle that lies within the images of the video, but also, in doing so, she is also the one who releases its will upon the world and perpetuates its existence. Like the ring from LORD OF THE RINGS, like many of Stephen King's monsters and skeletons from his own books, Bad Things Want To Be Found because pain and terror are the things in which they feed on.Relentlessly disturbing, THE RING is proof that one doesn't need to spell it out to be terrifying. The mundane has become chaos, the third wall has been broken, and the author of this hellish nightmare has come to vampirize on our very souls. An excellent horror film, made better because of its deft direction, precise acting, rich atmosphere, and the law that having no explanation for the whys is the best approach.",9,24,46,30 October 2005
Casablanca," Just Perfect.
","It has to be a crowning achievement for a movie to have entered into public consciousness to such a point that even when the average person may not even have a passing idea as to what this remarkable movie might be about, they assume, from the title, from the poster, that it has to be 'one of those unforgettable love affairs between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart'. Of course, the more you do know about CASABLANCA the clearer the in-jokes and the subtle yet potent lines become: as a matter of fact, CASABLANCA has now become one of the most quoted pictures of the last one hundred years. With a convoluted story which is really a romantic love affair between Rick, Ilsa, and her husband Victor Lazlo as well as a denouncement of the Nazis in this otherwise relatively safe haven that is Rick's cafe in Casablanca, Morocco, CASABLANCA becomes a ferociously sophisticated tale that has overtones of film-noir and that overwhelming chemistry that both Bogart and Bergman possess, their romance surpassing everything else and being the barometer for which romantic drama has been measured up against. If anything, of the supporting cast, Paul Henreid, for all his third billing, is the more thankless since he doesn't get much to do other than play the somewhat befuddled Lazlo (although he does get to find out that Rick and Ilsa have a little more than common than they'd like to admit). Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre (who also appeared with Bogart in THE MALTESE FALCON), Conrad Veidt also appear here as well as Claude Rains who has one of the most memorable supporting parts as the general who is 'shocked! shocked!' that any gambling is taking place at Rick's... as he smoothly takes his winnings from an employee. Also featuring one of the most deeply, lush ballads, 'As Time Goes By' and that powerful scene of defiance as the occupants sing for France, CASABLANCA has become an emblem more than just another feature film -- the stuff that dreams are made of.",10,6,9,16 June 2007
Chinatown," Capturing the True Spirit of Film-noir
","The seventies were the last years of great (American) films. I say films because when we speak of movies nowadays, we allude to blockbusters that generate hundreds of millions of dollars, the least amount of controversy, and are mostly inane crowd pleasers with tacked-on endings.Consider the output of influential film makers Allen during that time: Coppola, Scorsese, Altman, Lumet, Ashby, Bogdanovich, to name a few Americans, not to mention European directors Fellini, Bergman, Wertmuller, Truffaut, Argento, Saura, and Bunuel -- all household names in those days. Before Spielberg and Lucas came along, not a single one of these made movies appealing to the 'summer blockbuster tradition,' and unlike Spielberg or Lucas, they have a body of work filled in high artistic quality with minimum special effects and a lasting mark on future generations.Polanski is another one of these directors, and with 'Chinatown,' he reaches his directorial peak amidst the scandals which seemed to taint everything except his art. One can only imagine him in the forties, living his scandals, and transmuting this into high art -- when film-noir was at its darkest. Thankfully he lived in a time which did not demand the 'happy ending' or re-shoots in order to be politically correct -- else 'Chinatown' would have lost its devastating punch and conformed to the norm.A departure from the horror genre which brought Polanski to stardom, he re-creates an equally grim genre with his jaded view of 1930s Los Angeles down to the choice of the color palette, and using the acting powers of Dunaway and Nicholson to a fantastic effect, he creates haunting characters who can't be easily dismissed as film-noir archetypes without looking very closely at their reactions, listening to their words, and following their progressive involvement in a plot which threatens to swallow them whole, and ultimately does. And having Huston play Noah Cross -- who virtually took noir to its heights with 'The Maltese Falcon' -- Polanski hits the mark dead center, because Huston is the hardened heart of the corruption in 'Chinatown.' In brief scenes he creates a character almost unbearably evil with a hint of madness just underneath, and how he affects the characters around him will pervade the viewer long after the credits have rolled -- after all, he is the person who tells Nicholson he has no idea what he's getting himself into.I doubt this movie could be made today for reasons stated above. I'm thankful Polanski's vision prevailed, and not Towne's. Film-noir is a genre about human darkness, and here, the envelope is pushed all the way through, making this film, in my opinion, rank second to 'The Maltese Falcon.'",10,265,334,10 September 2004
Erin Brockovich," Soderbergh's Visuals in the Service of Roberts.
","Despite being somewhat manipulative, despite being based on true events, despite essentially being a Julia Roberts' vehicle to the extreme, Steven Sodebergh hits a home run with his David and Goliath story. ERIN BROCKOVICH tells the story of -- who else -- Erin Brockovich, a single woman who has somehow lost her way and been under hard times. Urgently needing work to pay her bills as she is close to bankrupt she hustles her way into Masry's office and gets a job as a file clerk (much to his and the entire office's resistance due to her over-the-top personality) where she uncovers some papers from Pacific Gas and Electric mixed with other real estate papers which don't add up. Taking matters to her own hands she decides to investigate further and finds that PG and E had been buying people out of their homes and paying for their medical bills because they were covering up the contamination from hexavalent chromium in the community water to which she enlists Masry to bring forth one of the biggest lawsuits in California history.Where most legal thrillers, in order to succeed, litter their stories with a slew of shady figures and double-crosses and plot twists, ERIN BROCKOVICH succeeds in sticking (like its heroine) to its 'little train that could' story from start to finish. While this curbs some of the suspense, it heightens its social aspect because we identify with the little man. We want this woman who has had a hard life to get her case across, and we also want these innocent people who are victims of the 'big corporation to get their compensation. It's like a much anticipated fight between Rocky and his adversary but without the sentimentalism: it's not so much will he win, but what will he do to win. This is the kind of film in which we already know at a gut level what will happen, but what we focus on is the battle itself.ERIN BROCKOVICH also succeeds in its performances, and with that I don't only mean Julia Roberts who with this role has found her inner actress. There is a scene in which Brockovich reveals to Donna Jensen (played by CSI's Marg Helgenberger) that PG and E have not been on her side, going so far as to pay for her medical bills to cover the fact that they have contaminated the water -- water that her kids are playing in -- her quiet horror is registered on her face. Albert Finney also brings some of his quiet to Ed Masry and in turn is able to ground her when things get rough near the end -- he and Roberts light up the screen whenever they are together without having any sexual tension, leaving it all to their acting styles. Veanne Cox is funny in a buttoned-up way as the lawyer who confronts Erin Brockovich, not knowing who she is coming up against. If anything, Aaron Eckhart is the only actor whose role seems a little like filler, or maybe the story didn't know what to do with him once he had effectively seduced Brockovich, but he has some good scenes near the beginning.Then there is Julia Roberts in a role that should have gone to a more experienced actress -- someone like Felicity Huffmann who actually resembles the real Brockovich but was not a box-office draw. Roberts fully embodies her character and is given line after sharp line to the point that almost every scene ends with a savage quip from her mouth complete with reaction shot. There are even times when her ferocious grip on her character threatens to go into scenery-chewing. However, Soderbergh brings out a complete acting range from Roberts as Brockovich the person as opposed to cartoon, and with this, Roberts can claim this as her breakthrough role which finally separates her from her trademark persona. This was the role in which she got the Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ellen Burstyn for REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Stephen Soderbergh would also win, but for a different film altogether: TRAFFIC, a film which would also grant acting nominations on its own.",9,48,65,30 October 2005
Se7en," Angel of Death Forgive Us
","If it weren't for Grand Guignol and Italian Giallo there wouldn't be a Jonathan Harris or a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. If SILENCE OP THE LAMBS had not reached the theaters, there would be no SE7EN. SE7EN in itself is a step-up from its predecessor in art-directed crime thrillers that seems to not only present the madness within society as much as thrive in its murky waters.David Fincher, a man not known for making light comedies and feel-good stories about life and love and hope plunges his viewers into this sick world which at times seems on the verge of being eaten up whole by the God of the Underworld. It's a place we could call home, but is not inviting in the least. And worse -- there is a serial killer on the loose. One of those monsters engendered by the city's own lapses into dehumanization, who have a penchant with toying with his persecutors because of the power this game grants him by default.We've seen or heard about his type before. Jeffrey Dahmer. The Zodiac Killer. Son of Sam. Ted Bundy. John Wayne Gacy. The Green River Killer. And of course Jack the Ripper, purportedly identified as Walter Sickert by Patricia Cornwell's exhaustive investigation. More in the latter's mode of killing but taking his murders into the realm of the bizarre, the John Doe who detectives Somerset and Mills are trying to catch is one of a kind. One who writes extensive passages which say a lot, but inform rather little. One who reveals himself to be uber-intelligent, almost pleasant, but twisted to the point of no return. One who commits seven of the most unnatural acts against any human being. We recoil because we never see them happening. Only the remains of systematic torture.There is precious little to know about John Doe and maybe this is the point David Fincher wants to establish. Despite his extensive notebooks, or his rationalization as to why these murders needed to occur there is little behind the soft-spoken man with the fey eyes -- and this makes him evil in an old-soul kind of way. All it takes is one look to know this is something that has been with him for years. All it needed was a progressive birth/abortion to see the light.Fincher is a master of mood, of dread. His previous film was ALIEN 3 which aside from its stand-alone nature from the rest of the franchise and conscious cruelty had excellent lighting, the darkest of sets and a feeling of overwhelming trepidation. It was an express elevator ride to hell. SE7EN is, while more colorful, even bleaker. Fincher's New York is an inferno of rain and emptiness closer to the 60s and 70s. Despair dominates the movie all throughout: there is no escape. Had this film been made in the 40s it would have out-done the best of film-noirs. His quadrangle of leads could not be better: Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills has several small scenes that indicate all is not well with her marriage to Det. Mills (Brad Pitt) who due to his commitment to his job has become estranged to her. Kevin Spacey plays John Doe like a man you would open up to, which proves to be the Mills' fatal mistake. It's up to Somerset, played delicately by Morgan Freeman, to bring some closure into a film that otherwise would sink under the pressure coming from its depravity.",10,1,2,18 February 2006
Monster," A Sordid Life: Aileen Wuornos
","What drives a person to commit murder? And then do it again and again with no apparent end to the madness? One may never know, and certainly MONSTER does not offer easy answers because no matter how you look into it, Aileen Wuornos was herself a kaleidoscope of changing, flighty emotions, ranging from occasional sadness, an unrepentant attitude, sheer rage, disbelief at what was happening to her, and basic incomprehension.People will know, at least in a marginal way, the story of the Wuornos' trial and for the eight murders she was convicted for. MONSTER attempts in a way not to romanticize her as to why she committed these murders, but to offer viewers a glimpse as to what it was like being her, living under her skin day in, day out, seeing no way of escape and desperately needing it until one day she just woke up and snapped.Charlize Theron deglamorizes herself so well she is unrecognizable as the ill-fated Wuornos, but her disguise does not overcome her. As coming from the wrong side of the tracks Theron gives this abrasive woman a soul down to her mannerisms and her harsh stare, and even a small scene in which Wuornos admires herself in the mirror before she leaves for hooking -- mannishly so -- speaks volumes about who she is at that moment. Wuornos may not ever receive sympathy from the public given her interviews and her combative parting last words, but at least in Theron she has found someone who under the guise of acting, could indirectly speak for her and somehow give clarity to the torment and the unstoppable fury that dominated her entire life.",8,15,17,20 December 2005
Underworld," Where are Bram Stoker or Bela Lugosi when you Need Them?
","If a bad film were a misbehaving pet that had just piddled on that expensive hardwood floor you just waxed to spotless perfection, the ensuing yell of disapproval would have to be: 'Bad! Bad movie!' This is pretty much the feeling I had in watching UNDERWORLD, a movie who was there because it existed in a list of films, positioned next to be shipped to my humble abode in Jersey City, and one whom I was loathe to watch.There is a fine line between a bad movie that is a hoot to watch and a bad movie that accelerates bowel movement and/or brings forth severe mental decay. I wondered if it would be better to have tapeworm cysts swelling inside my brain and giving me convulsions and glimmers of beautiful, prismatic light like Saul on his way to Damascus. At least that pain and horror would have a happy ending -- my death, or my health restored at the hands of medics -- but this was unbearable.However, before watching this wreck, I thought, 'Anne Rice: eat your heart out!' Then I quickly thought (and thus corrected myself), 'Oh. Right. She's found Christ now -- she doesn't engage in such evil, dehumanizing stories of the 'underworld' but tells happy tales of Christ as he was in life and wants us to embrace them. Now, if she'd only renege on the royalty checks she cashes in due to her globally famous Lestat stories I'd believe her total denial and repentance of such demoralizing wickedness....' Had I not run into such hasty conclusions! Even when the movie is rife in metallic colors which apply themselves quite well in conveying Gothic gloom, the movie is so chaotic I can't begin to even compare it with Rice's potboilers about vampires. At least she took the time to make me root for her characters even though the stories themselves were ridiculous. What this is, is a convoluted, uninteresting mess that happens to go on for two eternal hours.So let's see. There's a lot of stuff happening during the start of UNDERWORLD, a shoot-'em-out sequence closer to a John Woo movie than horror, vampires at war with werewolves (for what purpose? Is this a thinly disguised story of racial intolerance?), a human caught in the middle who is really more of a non-entity, a love story, cartoonish special effects, equally cartoonish action, flat dialog, heavy metal music, not a shred of character build-up, the presence of a black bodybuilder (whose already artificially low voice makes Hulk Hogan's sound like a squeak) who is prone to flexing his chest muscles instead of his acting muscles, Kate Beckinsale (reason enough not to go see a film in which she appears), some mumbo-jumbo about the origins of such animosity between vamps and werewolves... basically, enough to make you mentally sign a check releasing any responsibility in caring for the plot, popping the DVD out of your recorder, call a priest, and hope for a clean exorcism on your entertainment center. Which, minus calling a priest -- against my convictions -- is exactly what I did because I couldn't take it anymore and I'll enjoy bad movies anytime providing they give me some reason to watch and enjoy them, like FROGS, for example. But not this one -- this demanded action instead of sitting there and sitting there and sitting there. Once action was taken, my mind was restored to its former, unpolluted serenity. Until the next bad, unwatchable movie, that is.",4,0,3,12 April 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Out of Gas and Nowhere to Go
","It should have ended in 1992 with Ripley's self-sacrificing jump into the pit, clutching the baby alien bursting out from her chest, forever denying science any chances to use this species as a springboard for heinous experiments. But of course, when scientists and corrupt organizations want something they go after it No Matter What and ALIEN: RESURRECTION, like its human villains, ensures that the franchise lives on. Setting the events 200 years in the future, scientists have done wonders with the trace DNA they have found in the pit and have genetically created not only new aliens but hybrids as well: progressive clones to what they will call # 8, whom we know as Ripley. Why, that remains unclear: perhaps because it was necessary to bring Weaver back on board? Not that it matters, in no time she's being trained to speak and act human, and contrived events have her half-battling the aliens kept in captivity, half embracing them. There's not a shred of the old, real Ripley in her: not even when in horror she kills a live clone gone bad and destroys a lab filled with botched experiments. Female angst aside, Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to make the production look gorgeous and takes the opposite direction that Cameron usually does with his characters: he makes stereotypes behave like they knew what they were and reacted against it with horrible performances. Clever. Winona Ryder plays a fem-bot; Dominique Pinon is a cripple who is actually the strongest of the bunch, Ron Perlman plays a tough guy who is funny, and Gary Dourdan is the black guy who isn't as black as he seems (but gets killed off, if late in the film). Michael Wincott, Kim Flowers, Dan Hedaya, and Brad Davis fill in small roles with no substance. Not a fitting closure to a quadrilogy, but there it is, neatly packaged in your boxed set.",5,0,1,18 February 2006
12 Monkeys," Trying to Save the Future, Which Is the Past
","Stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. The fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.Terry Gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film. He gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy. His world, the world in which TWELVE MONKEYS transpires, is a place where the mad run wild, where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect, where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence, where madness looms at every corner. This is a very dark movie, but his very best, most linear (despite the plot twists which hold up under examination), and one which gets better with repeated viewings.A tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of Life On The Planet As We Have Known It leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity's fate on the Earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the Earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time, among them one James Cole (underplayed to great effect by Bruce Willis). Cole could be any person. We don't know anything about him, but in a way, that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. What we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality: he may have already been at the scene of the Event of 1996.It's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. When taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets Jeffrey Goines (spastically played by Brad Pitt, Oscar-nominated here) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction, and later Cole believes he has seen Goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? He doesn't know. Later he meets a psychologist, Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane, and that she's seen him before. This becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that Something Terrible is coming This Way, especially when she meets him six years later: she has seen Cole before. At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (Jeffrey Goines?) has apparently escaped, not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. The questions arise: have these events happened? Are they going to happen? Who is really a part of this, or better yet -- is everyone, down to the smallest player, a part of a Greater Plot? Or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which Time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again? These questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece VERTIGO in which Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton mourns her own brief existence ('You took no notice,' she says, as Cole and Railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in). Snippets of dialog from VERTIGO form a foil to the dialog between Railly and Cole and later, when Cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for Railly, he comes face-to-face with her in disguise (looking almost exactly like Eva Maria Saint from NORTH BY NORTHWEST) as the swelling Bernard Herrmann score plays the emergence of Judy Barton, dressed as Madeleine Elster. It's a fascinating sequence, more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films: Madeleine Stowe plays Kathryn Railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself 'Judy Simmons' while helping an 'insane' man named James Cole; James Stewart plays a detective who tries to help 'insane' Madeleine Elster who will later re-appear not once, but twice, first as brunette Judy Barton, and later, as Madeleine. Action and re-enaction, play and re-play.",10,82,98,29 July 2005
Au Revoir les Enfants," Friendship in Harsh Times
","Coming into Louis Malle's AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS, it seemed to me as though this was a film that was made for very personal reasons; it was present in every scene from the opening shot to that last haunting picture which displays the voice-over which tells of the fates of the characters which were developed with so much care throughout, and held the inimitable stamp of something closer to a confessional and a denouncement. Much like Vittorio de Sica's THE HOUSE OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS, this one also transpires behind the relative safety of walls, walls which belong to a boarding school where Jewish boys are enrolled under assumed names and protected by their teachers. Two boys in particular become fast friends, and the main character, Julien (Gaspard Manesse) eventually becomes the innocent bystander who witnesses and tells of these horrible events which we never see -- in an ode to the preservation of innocence, they're kept off stage even though we know they are, like a noose, tightening around the school. If the Holocaust, as a matter of fact, wouldn't be located strictly in the most remote background, this might be just another coming of age film about two boys growing up, but that gets a deeper resonance here and has a vague tone of dreamy languidness, like a prelude. A very delicately told story, it takes its time to reach its devastation, and by the end, it has left a lasting impact of silent horror.",8,2,4,7 June 2007
Shaun of the Dead," The Dead are All Around, but Does Shaun Notice? Absolutely Not!
","What could have been a complete misfire in a tired genre that now features sped-up undead monsters comes as a fresh, genuinely hilarious farce that for about an hour and forty minutes takes us on a ride that never lets up.A nice subtext that seems to say that the reason people are becoming zombies is the fact that their routines are the cause of this, Shaun emerges as the lone antihero that will confront his own dead-end existence and by way of craziness, regain his girlfriend, regain his own sense of self... and regain his routine of playing video games with his best friend Ed even when he has to be chained. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a cleverly written story full of very British humor, completely aware of its poking fun at the zombie genre, and is a great movie to watch and be entertained by without looking too deep into it.",6,3,8,3 March 2005
Hostel," Does this Hostel Have Rewards Points?
","This time it's not an SUV breaking down in the middle of the Ozarks (or the Australian outback in a little-known place called Wolfe Creek) but the siren call of sex, drugs, and partying all night. Of course -- the premise is again, as new as the latest category romance novel you will see in your local drugstore, but stories have to come out of somewhere, and this genre only has a one-way lane with little room for variation and the knowledge that it will not produce greatness but popcorn products aimed at violence queens and eager teens.Anyway, Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino, two guys who have a special, loving bond with violence taken to extremes, have teamed up to produce HOSTEL. No, it's not a travelogue depicting the breathless landscapes of Europe (where it's based), but more or less a straightforward template of young people getting caught in a situation where they have practically no control and in which they will have to resort to the same grotesque inhumanity in order to escape and never mind the missing bodyparts.The set-up sequence is slow. It is a little unsettling to see a faceless man humming tunelessly as he mops a blood-soaked floor, but this short prologue is over soon enough. Not so soon as to make you wonder what has taken place in this unknown place... but that comes later. In the meantime, Eli Roth sustains a good hand in building up his story, in which the moronic playfulness of the three twenty-somethings -- Paxton, Josh, and Oli -- in quest for sex with available women is on full display. I don't think Roth was looking for sympathy from the audience as much as just showing, in his own way, the mentality of 'boys who want to have fun'. So anyone looking for a character to hold on to may need to look elsewhere because it's not here.Now, there are some elements that stick out as unnecessary or at least, plot-questionable. In CABIN FEVER, there was this one boy who was insane and had a thing for karate moves. HOSTEL now supplies an entire gang of them, and they're pretty mean even though all they want is bubble gum. I don't know if this was meant to be comic relief but it stops the story dead in its tracks. Also unnecessary: the requisite anti-gay jokes, but that's probably not as relevant, even when it was a little off putting. There's also the misogynistic element in HOSTEL, which to me is all but invisible -- unless some women were offended at seeing so much female nudity and decided that women were being shown as bait -- which they are, and later we learn, quite willing to be so.HOSTEL is an okay film -- good, but not particularly memorable for me. It continues to help the genre survive now that the haunted house and monster movie are all but rotting cadavers. It's much more disturbing to me to see the evil within Man, and one of the most nightmarish sequences involve the man we hear at the start of the movie: the German surgeon, who seems to be in a sort of ecstatic frenzy as he gets ready to torment Paxton (Jay Hernandez). It was reminiscent of Dennis Hopper's extreme moment of sadism in BLUE VELVET, and that scene has more homoeroticism than the lame scene between the Dutch businessman (Jan Vlasak) and Josh (Derek Richardson). There is also a cute in-joke with director Takashi Miike as a customer: the man who brought ODISHON, a classic of this genre, it made me wonder what his character might have been up to within the torture chamber that he felt he needed to tell Hernandez to be careful or he might spend all his money in there. Considering the fee these 'clients' pay for their extreme entertainment, that would have been an interesting movie in its own right.",7,0,1,19 April 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Jadis, Aslan, Four Humans, and Winter Hell
","After the massive success of LORD OF THE RINGS it would be only fitting to continue the exploration of other dimensions as created by equally talented authors, so when it was announced that C. S. Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDBROBE would be given the film treatment I was more than anxious to see what would come of it. Early screenings gave it great reviews, and when I viewed I wasn't disappointed despite the Christ references.Four children are sent away from their London home to a professor's estate in the countryside in order to escape the bombings from the Nazi invaders. What they find there, aside from a severe place not unlike what V. C. Andrews would depict in FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC, is a wardrobe that opens the doors to another world -- a parallel one if you may -- in which winter is ever present, but Christmas never takes place. This is Narnia, and it is under control of the White Witch Jadis who is aware of a prophecy that four humans will put an end to her wintry empire, and sets out her minions against the children who have entered her world while bribing one of them -- the rebellious Edmund -- to join her as she holds him prisoner much like the witch in Hansel and Gretel did. Her plans are to overthrow the Lion King, Aslan, and rule forever. Parallels to her world and the world as threatened by the Nazis are striking, and Tilda Swinton's transformation into the very Aryan looking Jadis is chilling, more so in her seductiveness. At times I was reminded of Cate Blanchett (they have very similar features), but I think Blanchett is to Galadriel as Swinton is to Jadis. Marvelous actresses both, but Swinton can claim her breakthrough with her role here.With much less gravitas than the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA arrives much faster to its goal than the former does and the reason is that the books C. S. Lewis wrote are fairly slim volumes while J. R. R. Tolkien's book is a massive tome. Also, there is always the sense that the NARNIA books are more geared towards children and for much of the movie's duration there is little doubt that this is what it is: its four leads are children, many of the talking animals they meet are drawn in a way to appeal to children, and even the White Witch's castle has a storybook quality to it. Only in the appearance of Aslan does the story take a much more adult form, and its Messianic theme will not be lost on the older audience. Even so, the implications surrounding Aslan's self immolation can be interpreted in non-religious forms: if anything, it's also very similar to Gandalf's fall into the pit with the Balrog in tow in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Both character's 'death' symbolize their own necessary transmogrification, only to arise more powerful than before and take their troops to victory.NARNIA is a visually stunning film even in its quiet moments when the children, one by one, are entering its world through the wardrobe. I was reminded of Stephen King's DARK TOWER series: unless the characters believed in the world behind the wardrobe, it didn't exist, and this is true here. Narnia only exists if you believe hard enough in it, and time, of course, stops... or let's say, it marches at a totally different beat, also visible in Stephen King's DARK TOWER series.Performances are quite remarkable, especially for a fantasy film. All of the actors doing the voice overs bring their characters to bubbling life, and Liam Neeson as Aslan is wise and all-knowing. The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel, they are real people: The younger ones fare better than the older ones, but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.All in all a great film, equally meant to be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and one which should spawn a very interesting following.",8,31,42,10 January 2006
Elizabeth," Her Majesty the Queen
","A lush, textured biopic which brings to life Elizabeth's inexorable conversion from a bohemian, art-loving girl to an implacable icon who brought England from obscurity into the age of Enlightment.Shemar Kapur elevates ELIZABETH from what could have been yet the umpteenth Masterpiece Theater production full of lush costumes, elaborate set pieces, verbose speeches, and by-the-numbers story. His vision of the England at the cusp of Elizabeth's ascent to the throne is striking, dark, and menacing -- this is a country without a leader, being sold to the highest bidder. You feel the dangers at every corner. There is no guarantee that Elizabeth the Queen will survive her first years as such, unscathed. There is too much anger and hatred against her as in the way Kapur introduces every male character who in seeing her natural power recoil from it as if they had received a slap square in the face. Even when we know the eventual outcome and Kapur doesn't always present the events as they actually occurred (as when Walsingham kills Marie de Guise after a night of pleasure), Kapur is excellent in establishing a sense of wonder at just how Elizabeth opens up like a flower and outshines her competition. In having Cate Blanchett portray her in a very regal yet modern way we cease to look at Elizabeth as a painting. Watch her practice her speech in a rapid succession of scenes: this is a vulnerable woman thrown in a den of lions having to prove herself. And to think this woman, who would have preferred dancing and living a life of artistic pleasures, turned England into a powerful monarchy.A wonderful supporting cast of who's-who in British television and film, ELIZABETH the movie which brought Blanchett's talents to the forefront and established her power as an actress of her generation.",10,3,6,27 February 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," The Quest for Safety and Acorns
","Scrat, the little squirrel, is the bookend of ICE AGE and ICE AGE 2: THE MELTDOWN which opened this past Friday in American theatres. His isolated storyline is the one thing that I enjoyed because it has the unpredictability of a hairpin plot and the visual craziness of a Rube Goldberg sequence and is right at the center of the real action.This time lapse is one of the few complaints that I can have in this latest movie, but again, being a film aimed at children and young adults, no one is up for the count. No humans cross the path of the story. All ICE AGE is, is the story of just that: the warming of the Earth, the end of the idyllic valley where all these different animals co-exist in happy harmony, and the search for a boat that rests at the other end of the valley and will offer a place for them to weather the flood about to ensue. (It's an irony that Scrat is the one who first encounters the melting of the ice in his hilarious opening sequence.) Manny is still pining for his family and feels lonely despite his friends. This doesn't last long: soon he meets a female mammoth named Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah)... but there's a 'mild' problem. She thinks she's a possum. Her two possum 'brothers' don't deny it. Diego and Sid think she's not all there but encourage their acquaintance, while Manny wonders if this eccentric mammoth might be for him. In Sid's words, 'She's two tons of fun and you're no fun at all.' ICE AGE 2 makes its point to include the outsider who is really an insider in its plot. It's made the news dozens of times -- an animal of one breed adopting one of a totally different breed -- and here, Ellie eventually learns the reason she behaves like a possum in a very moving sequence not unlike Manny's in the first and I would like to see anyone who won't shed a tear watching her as a young mammoth finding her surrogate family and her own adopted identity. Even then, she's okay with that -- she is happy about herself. Manny, however, is not; he is a conformist who can't see that this bright thing stomping around the woods and being as carefree as you like it is more herself than he himself might be. No wonder he looks into his own reflection: there is the notion that when finding love, one looks into what reflects you. Ellie definitely complements him... but he cannot see it. Yet.Global warming is now the omnipresent villain. A reality today, ICE AGE remains contemporary despite its setting and brings forth the moral of what may happen if the Earth's poles melt. Everywhere they go there are signs of warming: geysers explode from the inside of the Earth, water rises dramatically, the dam retaining the ocean of water just behind it is about to give way. Water, water, everywhere, and nasty fishes await their moment.ICE AGE 2 is a good sequel. Visually it's beautiful and almost life-like and the great care of constructing the universe in which Manny and his friends live shows. One minor complaint is one which has them on their exodus, crossing what seems to be hills, only to then shift inexplicably to ice again, which to me seems to be only to add tension to these shark-like fishes who are looking for meat and to put Diego the saber-toothed tiger into his own worst fears. Then again, this is a animated movie and in following with traditions, the main characters have to travel through danger and be in danger before being in safety and in this it is effective.Overall I enjoyed it (or let's say, the kid in me did), but any adults looking for an adult story should go elsewhere because despite the material, it's not here. A dance sequence was the high point (children in the theater cheered it and laughed at its surprising denouement), and the vulture's quest for raw meat, complete with a Broadway-esquire musical, is a riot. And of course, it ends appropriately with Scrat in acorn heaven, being pulled back to Earth, and incorporated into the main story.",8,6,7,3 April 2006
Alexander," A Historical Travesty
","Leave it to the success of one type of film to spawn a sub-sequent barrage of films done in the same style, telling similar stories, some fictional, some quasi historical. In 2000, Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR brought back the Greco-Roman epics back into the forefront by telling a story Shakespeare himself would have been proud of (although having studied him I believe he would have, had he been able to, pump up the atrocious dialog David Franzoni created). In sticking to a simple, straightforward tale of a man wronged by envy who resorts to becoming a gladiator to fight for justice a contemporary classic was made and Russell Crowe, today's most intense actor, won his first Oscar and deservedly so.Oliver Stone, who has seen better times and better films, decided to up the ante and create his own version of a historical epic by focusing on none other than Alexander the Great, the young man who Did Great Things and died when he was a little over thirty. Would it that he hadn't. Everything in this film feels overdone. Colin Farrell overacts into insanity in trying to go for larger-than-life, Angelina Jolie continues to demonstrate that she's on media-fame only (although she tries to convince as Olympias), and everyone else goes through the motions, fulfilling parts that are on autopilot. This movie was so awful it took discipline for me to sit through; I might as well stayed with the History Channel's documentary on the same matter. At least they based their show on fact.Who will this appeal to? The older crowd have had their share of Ben Hurs and I Claudiuses so they might not be interested. The Greeks boycotted it when it came out because they were outraged that Alex was a queer so that rules them out. That leaves the younger set, those who haven't done their homework in studying history, who would only go see it for the hype surrounding the brief moments of nudity -- namely Rosario Dawson's --, Colin Farrell's chiseled physique, and the references to homosexuality. Maybe not the worst film of 2004, but it did try hard to push the envelope. It's still not as terrible as CALIGULA, though: that is one tough cookie to crack.",5,16,24,15 January 2006
The Others," They Are Here, Invisible, but Here.
","The Stewart household is a strange one. An isolated house in the Isle of Jersey, it's constantly enveloped in thick, blue fog, all doors must remain closed, and drapes block the sunlight because the children suffer from an illness in which they are extremely sensitive to it. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman, finally coming to her own in a story worthy of her talents), wakes up one morning screaming from what may have been a nightmare. Three strangers arrive to the house and they tell Grace they are replying for her request for domestic help -- and almost immediately, though subtly, strange events begin happening and it slowly becomes clear that there are other unseen, unwanted people occupying their quarters. This only becomes more evident when Grace discovers, to her horror, that these servants are more than what they seem to and that her own reality is not what she believes it to be.Alejandro Amenabar had already caught the attention of Tom Cruise who produced and starred in his own remake of OPEN YOUR EYES, which gave Cameron Diaz a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and here he establishes himself for the American movie going public with his follow-up. Again going for clever storytelling -- even if it takes a while to take off -- and relying on atmosphere rather than on expensively produced special effects, it's a showcase for Nicole Kidman who carries the entire film on her shoulders and who conveys furious determination to protect her household and absolute terror at the unknown forces against her with intense verve. Fionulla Flannagan and Christopher Eccleston provide some interesting foils to her dominant presence, but the real star is the film itself, who never goes for a quick cheat to fabricate its denouement (diametrically opposed to what M. Night Shyamalan's style where the twist is everything). Already a contemporary classic, it will go down in cinema history as an updated take on THE HAUNTING, with more finely tuned performances, even darker atmosphere, and a rising sense of dread.",10,35,41,10 May 2005
Troy," Alexander's Twin in Every Way
","Here we go again.In viewing TROY I kept getting references to category romance novels. Of course, anyone who reads this is probably going to on scratch his or her head and on this basis alone vote against this review but what the hell -- I can't change my points of view. Certainly not when the results are as weak as this. But I digress: see, the reason I join two genres that couldn't be more far apart has its madness.See, category romances (for those who are unfamiliar with the term) are short two hundred-page novels that publishing houses churn out month after month and all of them tell the same kind of love story with slight variations. Oliver Stone and Wolfgang Peterson, two very respected directors who have created much better work, have decided to film the same kind of movie -- sword and sandal epics -- with slight variations and coinciding in time of release and with interchangeable actors. Instead of Colin Farrell, we have Brad Pitt who is Fabio with acting power. Instead of Angelina Jolie we have... well, no female who registers, since the actress Diane Kruger doesn't have the oomph to play Helen of Troy. Speaking of Helen and digressing again, when confronted with what must have been the most beautiful woman in history, her beauty rivaling Aphrodite, it wouldn't have killed the makers of this film to leave Helen as a hazy, brightly lit but barely seen figure. Since feminine mystery is what drives the plot, why not leave it as such? Food for thought.Also adding to the mix we have Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom, both fresh out of blockbuster films, playing Hector and Paris, respectively. And Peter O'Toole, the only actor of the veterans here (which includes Julie Christie) whose part as Priam at least is worthy of something. Overall TROY felt, to me, that I could have seen any one of these movies and not known the difference (much like a romance novel) despite that one of them is a historic epic and the other a mix of history and legend which borrows freely from Homer's 'THE ILIAD' but keeps the gods at bay. At least one fares secondary characters that I could somehow attach some meaning to, but even then, this is a film which in trying to be 'epic' sinks under its pretensions, much like its twin Alexander.",5,16,34,15 January 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Finally A Film Which Gets it Right
","It was only time before a film about two men in love would get the treatment it gets in Ang Lee's BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, since up to now, films had either skirted the subject, reduced it to a peripheral, sanitized version of itself or given it the eye-candy treatment only meant at making a quick impression in the 'Gay-Lesbian' category. The simple yet deceptive story of two people who meet, fall in love, but are unable to fulfill their love has been done over and over again from the male-female perspective (i. e. IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, BRIEF ENCOUNTER), but never involving two men, and never this brutally honest.Of course, the dynamic of male love is different than male-female love only in genitalia. Jack and Ennis' first encounter while waiting for work, their isolation leading to each other's arms, is the stuff of every restrained romantic drama. The mechanism of two men falling in love here develops along the lines of homo-masculinity dictating patterns of behavior which both Jack and Ennis obey whether they know it or not. It comes to me as no surprise when, following their first sexual encounter (brutally executed with undertones of sadomasochism but true to the style of love involving alpha males), they revert to 'not being queers' but cowboys who excuse 'what happened' to liquor and 'manly needs'. Which of course verbalizes society's impositions of men having to be 'men.'Of course, things take a different turn and the heart wants what it wants. Once their work is done, Jack tries to keep their acquaintance alive but Ennis is so intensely closed and closeted to any possibility of emotions that he looks like he may implode at any moment and only once does he actually scream into his hat, bent over, as Jack drives away. The sound is a terrible, heart-rending puke of indescribable pain.What follows is a series of brief encounters that become more intense as the years go by, but at the same time destroys two marriages and consumes then to the end. Love is an uncontrollable emotion, and when two people who belong together despite their gender cannot fulfill their dreams it's only a matter of time when things reach a head. Again, the constraints of time and space interfere: Ennis cannot see a life outside what he knows, again more a product of the trauma of seeing something horrible as a child, and Jack, not having what he wants, has to take to meeting other men in sordid locations and re-create a semblance of an affair with a man who resembles Ennis. In presenting these situations as they are and not trying to pursue change in its characters, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the love story that transcends gender, space, time, and proves that love -- even when tragic -- is universal.Even so, will straight people see the message behind the story? I believe straight women (and a few enlightened straight men) will be the ones drawn to view the movie over a majority of conservative idiots who still hold the idea of two men locked in intimacy as being repugnant and are ripping their feeble brains out over the quasi 'gay agenda' that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is trying to 'convert people to homoesexuality'. Sometimes it takes a movie like this which dares to take the risk and tell an unforgettable story rife in visual and emotional power -- true poetry in motion.All of the actors in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN are flawless, and all of them have roles that in another story might have been bland stereotypes of predictable natures. Jake Gyllenhaal is smoldering longing at the beginning but becomes a broken man who explodes in rage when he realizes that twenty years have gone down the drain. Heath Ledger goes one better: his painful speech, furtive eyes, and inward body language expresses an overwhelming set of emotions which state that he'd never be able to be happy with anyone, and his final scene holding Jack's shirt comes more as an apology to Jack than an added moment of schmaltz. Michelle Williams plays a typical housewife who is witnessing something she can't understand. Linda Cardellini, who comes quite late in the film, initially appears to be just a waitress, but is the person who gives Ennis an advice about love. Anne Hathaway's role as Jack Twist's wife is much more tricky: is she aware of his gayness or is she really all about business and having a perfect home? I get the feeling her character knows more than she expresses, and her turning progressively blonde is a manifestation of her choosing to look the other way and live a life of bitter complacency, best expressed in her telling speech about how 'men don't dance with their wives.' If she only knew.",10,293,336,12 January 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Pointless.
","Roland Emmerich must truly hate New York City (and consequently, the United States). He has this thing for lovingly conveying destruction on a massive scale and setting it in the City that Never Sleeps, although his appreciation for the country that made him a household name extends to Hollywood as a tornado rips through its name and tears through the streets of L.A. This is his third time on the merry-go-round, though, and hopefully it will be his last. But I get the impression he sees himself as this Merlineque wizard, holding a wand outstretched, willing some elaborate way to get rid of New York City, and then when all would be done, outstretch his hands to the skies, reform the city, only to destroy it again. Why? Probably some perverse need to trample over Capitalism? Oh, who knows -- and who cares. Two to three years from now he'll concoct another pile of dreck from his cauldron, feed it to a dumbed-down America who will eat it as if it were McDonald's, make millions, and repeat the cycle.Am I going to review this movie, you would say? Well -- I just did. Because there really is nothing else to say about something so completely and unabashedly bad. Except that I didn't watch this over dinner, else I would have lost my appetite.",5,25,53,20 April 2005
Match Point," In the Realm of Film-Noir
","Would it that this film had been made in the Forties or Fifties when film-noir was at its high point! Woody Allen, one of America's best directors pays his homage to the genre in his latest film about romantic obsession, and if his name weren't in the opening credits you wouldn't know he directed it. Taking a break from filming in the city he loves the most, deleting every trace of the well known neurotic hoots and clicks from his main and supporting British cast, and even removing the trademark reference to his own persona from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performance, MATCH POINT becomes a very European film that starts out deceptively as a character study with comedic tones and ever so subtle moves into the darker side of love, echoing THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and of all films, FATAL ATTRACTION.A love quadrangle, the oldest plot device, is Allen's focus this time: Chris Wilton (Rhys-Meyers), a retired tennis player, becomes an instructor to Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Both find that they have similar interests, such as the love of opera and the works of Dostoyevsky. (They have another similar interest, but I'm getting there). Tom invites Chris for an evening at the opera and introduces him to his family and sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who falls for him and who later on signifies familial safety in all forms. Sensing an opportunity to climb the social ladder he starts seeing her just as he meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johanssen), an aspiring American actress, whom he openly flirts with until he realizes she's Tom's girlfriend, but an outsider in the Wilton household. A clandestine affair between Chris and Nola begins tentative at first -- she advises him against it since it would ruin his chances to become a success and she is engaged to Tom -- but turns deeper. However, a turn of events transpire, taking Nola out of the picture, having Tom marry another girl and Chris marry Chloe, and start to get complicated once Chris tracks Nola down.Like I said, would it that MATCH POINT would have been filmed 60 years ago because everything in it smolders like the plot elements of the sleekest of noir films. With a deliberate pace that begins taking a sinister shape after the second half, Allen misdirects the audience to the very core. Allen avoids any trace of romantic melodrama, though, and in showing what actually transpires between a couple ensnared in an affair -- their initial bedazzlement, their passion consummated, turning into routine and then its painful decline -- is true to life. Nola, initially seen in white much like Lana Turner in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE seems to be in total control until Allen deftly pulls the rug out of her feet and has her do a slow collapse into her own trap, dressed in darker and darker colors. Chris, at first, so lusts after her it's a question if he can choose her love over social status and this becomes the crux of MATCH POINT: whether the tennis ball falls over the net or not.There are moments when you think that a director who once had his audience eating out of his hand has gone into autopilot or entered a point of no return. Up until recently, Woody Allen had had even his most hardcore fans put through the ringer with film after film of a disposable nature. With this film, which has a strong connection to CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, he shows that he never was gone. In erasing all references to his staccatto style, he wins over a new audience willing to accept his work with ease and this is at times necessary: like Hitchcock's self-effacing FRENZY, MATCH POINT is an excellent movie showcasing a director in full control of his ability to tell a visual tale. Maybe not up there with the best of his roster but pretty damn close, and that's saying quite a wallop.",10,140,195,14 January 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Courage Under the Threat of Extermination
","Unless these tragic incidents take place in our own country, we will see them unfold through our very eyes courtesy of CNN, et. al, and go on with our lives while shaking our heads in horror and pity but not doing much else. This is exactly what a reporter played by Joaquin Phoenix tells Paul Russebagina, the hotel manager of Les Milles Collines as Rwanda begins its inexorable plight into the horrors of racial purification -- the war between the Hutus and the Tsutsis.As a matter of fact, unless you saw the news back in 1994, you didn't and wouldn't even know of these events. It was virtually kept under wraps and only revealed when the death toll was unnaturally high. What HOTEL RWANDA attempts, and succeeds in doing, is bringing forth the absolute tragedy of a country driven to the extremes of decimating its own population in lieu of establishing the eventual dominance of the Hutus over the more 'esthetically pure and therefore privileged' Tsutsis.However, where the movie really makes its mark is when Paul Russebagina, the smooth talking, subtle Hutu man who as of now has been able to get people to eat out of his palms faces the stomach-turning horror: no one will come to his aid, no one will even attempt to intervene to stop the madness that is exploding all around him. The U. N. has turned its eye away from the situation. Belgian soldiers within the country are escorting only foreign citizens. Paul and those left behind will have to fend for themselves and hope to find a way out.HOTEL RWANDA establishes the character of Russebagina as an essentially good person who gets caught in a situation that spirals out of control and forces him to face it head on: much like Clive Owen's character in CHILDREN OF MEN, or even Schindler in SCHINDLER'S LIST, his is a man who grows from being just an observer of sorts into a hero who goes beyond the call of duty while maintaining a brave face in the light of the sight of his people being massacred for the sake of genocide. Sophie Okonedo lends a strong support as Tatyana Russebagina, a role that could have been thankless but achieves a relevance all its own. Where Terry George's film succeeds is bringing a moral consciousness unto us, the people viewing this film which is a mirror of the events from over a decade ago without exaggerating the gore. It makes us aware that regardless of how distant these events might be unfolding, it's really unto us to lend a hand to those in need.",9,0,0,16 June 2007
Ocean's Twelve," The Second Time Around
","Now, the trick with a sequel to a remake of a lesser movie is this: how to repeat the magic without making it a bland retread of what's been seen before? Well. It's a truth universally acknowledged that when a film revolves around a heist that goes smoothly even when the victim may eventually retaliate, the only thing its sequel do is go the opposite direction: build momentum around another heist that will redeem our pack of thieves from their state of disgrace and send the story off some odd directions with characters who have their own ulterior motives. If you look closely you can actually feel the noose slowly start tightening itself around Danny Ocean's group. Eccentrics pop in and out, never to be seen again, leaving their own mark -- this is a light ballet gliding towards the moment when everything converges, gets messed up... and to say more would be criminal. You have to experience it on your own. See how one of the most ballsy in-jokes involving a certain Oscar-winning actress from one of Soderbergh's earlier films obliquely leads to the denouement where not one, but two double-climaxes -- one frankly hilarious, fraught with its own little family dysfunction, the other sweetly emotional -- virtually sweep the rug off of you. If that isn't entertainment, I don't know what is.",10,6,10,30 May 2007
Crash," Man Against Man, Headed for a Collision Course
","Film as media capturing a snapshot of a given moment in society: this is what Paul Haggis' film CRASH (not to be confused with David Cronenberg's much different film of the same name as it is not a remake) is all about.How many times have you gone through your everyday activities when suddenly something happens -- a car hits yours, you get mugged, you experience condescension from someone, you have a bad day which only gets worse as the day moves on, or you see even more terrorism occurring through the mirror of television and immediately start eyeballing people of a specific race because they 'look' like terrorists? I know I have, and have on more than one occasion caught myself holding my mouth before I spoke the damning words because it so happens, when seeing Jennifer Esposito's character Ria, I was reminded of my own Latino ethnicity. Her partner, Graham (played by Don Cheadle) calls her Mexican; she immediately corrects him that she is not, she is El Salvadorean and Puerto Rican. And there is a big difference. It's a little moment, but one that escalates in magnitude when dealing with people on a daily basis.Such is the story -- and series of stories -- caught in the middle of CRASH. In a city like Los Angeles -- much like in another big city -- there are people from everywhere trying to make life a little better for themselves and their loved ones. Of course, every major city has slums and bad neighborhoods and sometimes things get out of control. Authorities, in trying to maintain order, don't always employ the people they should, and then again, one loose cannon will, in his or her hatred for people who come from a different background as they -- most notably black and/or Hispanic -- step over the lines of appropriate law enforcement while a real crime occurs not blocks away from them. This is what happens to Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), a cop who's been on the business for nearly almost his life and has gone jaded. While the film presents him as the quintessential bad cop, subtle shades of his misplaced anger come through later on. It's again, something that has happened to all of us no matter how politically correct we would like to consider ourselves. In all of us there is the potential to lash out at that one person who has nothing to do with us, who was just there, who was an easy target.The people whom he lashes out to are the Thayers (Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard), a young black couple who live on Ventura Blvd. In response to the report of a stolen SUV belonging to Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock's characters, stolen by Anthony and Peter (Chris Bridges and Larenz Tate) who also have more up their sleeve than their characters suggest), Ryan and his partner Tom Hanson (Ryan Philippe) tail the vehicle even though it's the wrong one. What sparks the incident is seeing Christine Thayer (a light-skinned black woman) come up from what seems to be a compromising position. Ignoring their story -- that they were coming back from a party and that he is a television director -- her haughtiness prompts Ryan to touch her inappropriately while Cameron Thayer looks on, unable to do anything. Hanson reports the incident, but his boss, who interestingly happens to be black (Keith David) gives him little reassurance because Ryan is a model officer and he's not about to jeopardize his own career.More incidents of misplaced anger or preconceptions occur. David (Michael Pena), a locksmith, gets the short end of the stick when installing locks not only by the upper class (Bullock), but by a Persian immigrant. Cameron Thayer continues to get ill-treated by life as a television producer (Tony Danza) tells him that a black character 'doesn't sound black enough' but then again -- Thayer doesn't, either. Bullock berates her Latina maid, and Dillon has another showdown with another black woman (Loretta Devine) because his father is ill and they've already started on the wrong foot when addressing each other. Anthony and Peter run over a Chinese man standing outside his van and throw him at a hospital's door. Later on, Anthony steals the Chinese man's van and finds something surprising in there. It's only when a moment of catharsis occurs that the character's internal crises hit a head, some with good results, some with bad results. Christine, increasingly disillusioned by Cameron, sees her marriage begin to fall apart and drives right into an accident only to have her life changed when Ryan steps in and saves her from certain death. Cameron on the other hand, gets in even worse with the cops when Anthony and Peter steal his vehicle and won't leave. Hanson lets him go, but the wound is there. He's just another black man in a town that sees him as a hood and not a professional.CRASH doesn't try to settle matters too neatly, though. Even when some story lines end in a better place than they were when the movie begins, some others end in tragedy, but the slice of life look of the movie in which events take place within a two-day time frame demands a realistic approach. We eventually come to realize that many of the less sympathetic characters in CRASH act the way they do because they are either impotent to help their loved ones or because they've allowed the superficialness of life and their own prejudices to take over their outlook. Even so, like David's young daughter who puts herself in harm's way over a misunderstanding between her daddy and his Persian client, CRASH takes a hopeful approach. We as a society are in trouble, but we also have the power and the hope to make them change. It's not a sentimental approach: these things happen every day in the news, the little miracles of life.",10,11,22,12 April 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Laughing in the Face of Destruction
","Comedy is the ability of man to laugh when all he can do is cringe in terror, and Stanley Kubrick's beyond-black, so-black-it-stings comedy is at the top of the list of the funniest films ever made. Considering its subject matter -- world annihilation -- this is pretty risky stuff, considering it was made at a time when the Cold War was no laughing matter and at anytime someone could decide it was time to see if those pesky missiles would work. It shot Stanley Kubrick to the position of a Director as God, and from then on, his sporadic work would produce masterpiece after masterpiece. DR. STRANGELOVE: OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB is a fantastically cold, ironic, and masculine movie, but it's precisely this kind of detached, deadpan humor that makes it so outrageous. There are few moments that can't be considered iconic in cinema history -- truly, Peter Seller's 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room! ' quote has gone down in history as one of the most absurd lines ever uttered, but his own little rendition as Dr. Stangelove, which hearkens to the mad scientist in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS who can't seem to control his cybernetic arm is comic genius at its most bizarre. However, Slim Pickens has the best exit scene in the entire film in a scene anyone familiar with Chuck Workman's VISIONS OF LIGHT or countless film montages detailing key moments in cinema in the Twentieth Century: his riding the bomb into destruction (that brings forth the end of the world as Vera Lynn sings 'We'll Meet Again') is the stuff that nearly fifty years later has not been equaled.",10,3,6,3 December 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Guillermo del Toro's Dark Fantasy
","A stunning story drenched in symbolism (that may get somewhat lost in translation for anyone unfamiliar with Spain and/or Spanish culture), this is a gorgeous, lush dark fable that deftly intertwines myth and reality, illusion and bleakness, despair and hope, horror and ecstasy in such an intricate fashion it becomes virtually impossible to distinguish when one story begins and when one end. That in itself is a feat, because so many times the disparity of two different worlds, or two time periods, or two opposing story lines that dovetail at a singular event somewhere within the fabric can present roughness in its seams and look shabby -- almost sloppy. It's the delicate line that Peter Jackson traversed in his epic translation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings', to make a story detailed yet fluid, and it's one that Guillermo del Toro walks with tremendous ease -- he practically flits through his stories with the ease of the fairies that he devotes so much time to. And what a story this is: one that deserves to be seen over and over again, one which owes a bit to Victor Erice's EL ESPIRITU DE LA COLMENA, another bit to Stephen King's novel 'Rose Madder', yet another bit to THE WIZARD OF OZ. This is true lyricism in the deepest sense of the word, delicate yet unbreakable in its faith, haunting, hallucinating, and lovely like the blooming flower at the end.",10,2,5,6 March 2007
Alien," This Ageless, Silent, Haunted House Floating in Silent Space
","Before gore, special effects, and the denouement of the alien itself in future sequels, this was the movie that revolutionized the concept of the 'haunted house' and merged it in a seamless sieve with 'body horror' and its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space.The story had been done before, in different genres, never veering too far from its horror origins. Lovecraft (and others) had written about expeditions that had gone to 'investigate' and 'collect important data' only to find themselves being hunted down one by one, be it an unseen terror or their own fears.Ridley Scott's ALIEN looks and feels like a science fiction movie. However, it is not. Everything in its look and tone suggests horror of a more cerebral kind. When three crew members come across what seems to be a large space-jockey with a thing attached to its face, dead, we feel our stomach turn. If something that small was able to take over a creature this large, they are in deep trouble here. The scene is masterful, restrained, but a classic in the horror-movie sense: it's as if we had been witness to terrible events which had taken place and decided to get to the bottom of it. Scott tightens the noose employing age-old tricks of the horror genre and only once shows blood and guts -- one which follows a calm dinner sequence. He never allows the viewer to get a true glimpse of this sadistic killer much like Spielberg in JAWS and this becomes nerve-wracking because again, fear of the unseen is more powerful than what comes into view. The theory dictates: 'I was afraid of that thing? I thought it was bigger!' All we see of this alien are his teeth and in one memorable, twisted scene, his tail snaking up Lambert's (Veronica Cartwright) leg. Later on, as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough role), the quintessential Final Girl, makes her escape, it is possible to hear Lambert shrieking. What the alien is doing to her we can only imagine and recoil.",10,26,37,18 February 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," Post-War Angst Comes to Smalltown, USA.
","Thirty years prior to THE DEER HUNTER came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the American family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.Truly an ensemble cast despite the top-billing of Myrna Loy, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of the men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, upon returning, cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to Marie, a happy-go-lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world -- including the girl he loves and her family -- thinks he is a freak of nature.At almost three hours of length, the film never seems long and drawn out. There is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by; nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. Not a performance rings false, though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then every character has his or her moment on film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films (including the ones made around World War One, which did not dabble in such topics). While there is never any overt violence, it's all there, in the haunted expressions of the three male leads' faces, in the lot where the planes now reside, ready to be turned into junk (and therefore, forgetfulness), in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or even worse, to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for. This is the film in which COMING HOME and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are indebted to. At a time when America fled from war films, to come up with this when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film-making.",10,41,52,18 December 2005
Closer," Exquisite Cruelty.
","Mike Nichols must have a thing for dysfunctional quartets, as this is his third entry that tells a story of how four people damage each other with their callousness and emotional immaturity.With CLOSER he decides not to go loud as in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? but to misdirect the viewer into thinking he is watching a series of Meet Cutes between the four leads. This is really only the setup for something completely rotten that comes out in a crucial moment, when both Natalie Portman and Clive Owen discover that their spouses, played by Jude Law and Julia Roberts, have been quite shamelessly carrying on and excusing their affair with wordy denials as if that would remedy the situation. To see Portman express total devastation in the fact of infidelity as she asks Law how can he go on with his cheating is to see her innocence and purity of emotions taken away, turned into something that later on becomes ugly and manipulative, although of the four she is the one whom at the end rises above and detaches herself of a damaging relationship.Owen's descent into conscious perversion is also disturbing. Already apparently heavy into Internet chatting, he is introduced as someone who would innocently chat with what he thinks is a woman and actually believe 'she' would meet him later for a quickie, and this gullibility is what also has him believing his wife would not leave him for anyone else even when it's clear she's carrying on with the same person who introduced them. He later decides to hurt them both, and succeeds so, but in trying to tie Roberts to him, he is only cementing the grounds for more mental and emotional cruelty.Definitely not a date film nor one to watch on Valentine's Day, this is one of those films that takes the notion of love, sets it up on a pedestal, and them hacks away at its limbs and stabs it repeatedly in the heart until there is nothing left but hurt and more hurt and no way out. Ironically, it's physical abuse, never seen throughout the entire film until the very end, that sets at least one character free. Powerful, ugly at times, CLOSER betrays its title and makes you want to remain single for a long time.",10,45,68,22 April 2005
Battleship Potemkin," Poetry in Editing
","The power of the moving picture, focusing on creating a tightening noose that has become the blueprint of how movies are made and released to audiences today. This is the movie BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN, a film that was made in 1925 to commemorate a historic uprising, and one with images so potent that it was banned in several countries because it apparently contained propagandist images. Because of its documentary feel it has effectively led people to believe that the massacre at the Odessa steps actually did happen -- and such is the power of film, the strength of this breathtaking movie.Divided in five parts, like a Shakespearean play, BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN narrates a plot that barely focuses on one character for too long -- a technique that only enhances its symbolism. An uprising on the Potemkin takes place as a protest from the sailors from getting ill-treatment from their superiors and being fed rotting food. The leader of this uprising, a brave sailor, is killed by one of his superiors and transported to the city of Odessa, where civilians are so moved by his plight that they mourn his death (over a bowl of soup) and decide to revolt against the Czarist regime.At the height of the movie, and the film's most powerful sequence that literally starts with a bang, the Czarist soldiers appear from behind and systematically shoot down the citizens as they run down the Odessa Steps. Of the victims, a couple stand out in abbreviated story lines: a boy who gets separated from his mother who goes back to retrieve him and defiantly walk up the steps to certain death, and most notably, the death of a young mother who's baby, cradled in a carriage, crashes down the steps as the infant cries.The Odessa Steps sequence is even now a masterpiece of editing, focusing on loose elements to tie in an all-encompassing picture of mounting horror as the faceless, almost inhuman soldiers advance upon them. It creates an overwhelming sense of destructive horror even when never a drop of blood or actual carnage is seen, and because these citizens have been introduced as peaceful, feeble people, it's even more numbing. This sequence has become one of the most imitated in cinema, most notably in Brian de Palma's THE UNTOUCHABLES which had a similar sequence that was shot in slow motion and in its own right, truly breathtaking.However, nothing can come close to this movie. It's too bad that extant prints make it seem a little fuzzy here and there, but there is no denying its sheer power of storytelling even in a couple of its slower segments. I believe BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN doesn't need a musical score to be fully enjoyed; I turned off the volume of my own equipment, sat down, and was able to literally be moved to the edge of my seat when the Odessa Steps sequence began. Horror and mass destruction made poetry by the force of its own message, it's an essential movie for anyone into movies.",10,1,1,13 June 2006
Capote," Journey into Self-Obsession and Exploitation
","It would be more memorable if its author wouldn't have been so arrogant and smug about his own writing. 'In Cold Blood' was a detour in his storytelling, one which dealt into the darker side of humankind and fictionalized the true story of a small-town Kansan murder. It became a critical success, spawned a movie and series of the same name and made sure that people knew who Truman Capote was.Its creation is the basis of first-time director Bennett Miller, who begins the movie with the murders themselves, and then shifts into introducing Truman Capote in a series of scenes -- a social gathering in which he talks of a friend of his wanting to write a homosexual love story between a white Jew and a black man; Harper Lee's cute denunciation that the comment made by the assistant conductor on the way back home was a practiced criticism which Capote himself paid for; his own assertion of himself in the eye of others. Capote in learning of this murder is somehow drawn to it and has decided to write about it: it would make great fiction, he tells his editor, William Shawn.Off he sets to Kansas where while his mannerisms shock the locals, they don't stop him from getting assistance from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent in charge Alvin Dewey who has him come face to face with the killers, Richard Hickcock, and the one whom he becomes strangle attached to, Perry Smith. Here is where the film brings out the manipulative side of Capote. His relationship with Smith becomes an odd mixture of equal parts investigation, fascination, and exploitation. He isn't above telling Smith lies about the progress of his book, it seems, because like a schoolgirl, he seeks Smith out for everything but sex itself. The book, it seems, takes so long to come to fruition because ending it would mean ending his association with Smith and he doesn't want that. Even though there is a clear expiration date on their friendship.Making a film about someone not just unsympathetic but with an affected, weak speech that could invite for immediate strangulation to end the pain is a tricky thing because either the person in question gets romanticized to some degree or it becomes unwatchable. Since Phillip Seymour Hoffman is on screen in almost every scene and he has to carry the entire movie on his shoulders, his performance has to modulate itself so it won't alienate the viewer and it does so. He makes CAPOTE his own when it could have been a tiresome affair because really, the man himself was a bore who thought he was interesting. Hoffman's is no light feat considering this story is about the man who brought such light fare as 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.' Solid support by Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith, and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. Bob Balaban, Amy Ryan, Chris Cooper, and Mark Pellegrino also turn in small, fine performances and round out a dark, brooding movie about the darkness within two men.",8,0,0,24 March 2006
Lost in Translation," Lovely and Nuanced.
","I have not seen Sofia Coppola's first film THE VIRGIN SUICIDES as of this posting but I can tell that from her exquisite direction on this, her second film, she has delivered something truly delicate and rare like a mini-rose. LOST IN TRANSLATION is a wonderful, absolutely beautiful movie. There isn't a false note in this contained story in which two people with a marked age difference meet in an extremely foreign country and slowly discover their feelings for each other. Scarlett Johansson delivers a performance made more haunting and touching due to the simplicity in which she plays Charlotte who is going through an odd time in her life: married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), who may be having an affair with Kelly (Anna Faris), she feels displaced and alone in her hotel, and that is an emotion that can really hit someone, especially when so far away from home and familiar surroundings. Bill Murray's Bob Harris is an actor who is also going through his own baggage and who, in meeting Charlotte, has found a connection. His own performance is very restrained, very delicate, a man who has lived a lot who is intrigued by this young woman. Much in the style of stories by Marguerite Duras or French New Wave, or Michaelangelo Antonioni, there is a lot of subtext and implicit eroticism in the simplicity of Bob and Charlotte's affair in LOST IN TRANSLATION which comes through in its reflective but not intrusive nature, and this elevates their love story to one which will stay with the viewer long after the resolution has come and Bob has told Charlotte those last words that we are not meant to hear. After all -- it is their private moment.",9,30,56,23 April 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," Sympathy for the Devil
","It probably -- and most likely -- began as one of those tell-all books disguised as chick-lit that exposed 'the ugly, insensitive, cruel side of fashion.' After reading it last night, this was the impression I got, because as a story, it never goes anywhere. It's always on this never-ending one-note that is closer to THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE in its nightmarish, surrealistic tone than a real story about the new assistant and her boss from hell. Instead that where the main character never getting to eat dinner, in the book, she never gets to have a life while she's involved in the hellish world of haute couture.Not that there's anything wrong with writing tell-all books and then fictionalizing names, events, places, and the like. It's been done most notably by Christina Crawford after her Mother died and we know what kind of an exaggerated camp classic was borne out of that book. However, the great thing about film as a media of compressing and reshaping stories is that it can take the bare essence of a book's soul -- the characters that make the most impact -- and reconfigure them to a new story that while it bears little to no resemblance from its print version will greatly expound on the themes present there. Just look at what came out of a little-known story called 'The Birds,' for example. And no one is complaining.Gone from the movie is the excessively distorted tone that lingers within the pages of the novel. Such a move is best in order to tell a balanced story. In is the exploration of Miranda Priestly's character, who in the book was a complete caricature thought out of what seems to be the angry mind of an ex-employee, and here is shown to be have frightening depth of character and interestingly, a character that ignites the screen with her icy stares and perfect composure. Expanded from his original two over-the-top scenes is the character of Nigel who in the book was a shrieking muscle queen with a penchant for female attire (catsuit, anyone?) and speaking in capital letters. Here, he's presented as more subdued, closer to an emasculated auntie encased in Stanley Tucci's dapper persona, but no less essential to the story. And mercifully, chopped-up are sub-plots involving Andy Sachs' friends and family who in the book have their own lives and story lines and interfere a bit much with the whole story, and even then their presence could have been reduced a little more, but such is the case with having so many characters that do little to advance a plot -- or in some cases, as in Lily (in the book), force events.In any case, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is, as a movie (and using fashion lingo), nearly flawless despite such minor hang ups. Because it doesn't intend to tread risky ground in presenting an edgier story of Andy Sachs' rite of passage from frumpy wannabe reporter to an emotionally empty glamazon capable of hurting those around her with her total involvement in work (and thereby assuring her role as immediate successor to Miranda Priestly), it veers closer to the likes of FUNNY FACE. Even then, it's immensely enjoyable. Meryl Streep alone is the sole reason to watch the movie: whenever she is on screen, which is not enough, she simply ignites, especially in her character's orchestrated entrance into the movie -- one that is so pregnant in anticipation and tension that when she does open the doors to 'Runway' and begins softly barking orders to a frazzled Emily Blunt, it almost comes as a relief of sheer pressure, even though she's only begun her reign of terror. She later has a scene where she succinctly cuts a snickering Hathaway down to size as she criticizes her 'cerulean' misshapen sweater which is a way to show not only how that sweater came to her hands, but to have Hathaway show some respect to an apparently shallow world. If the intent was to make her a monster, the film succeeds: but the film's Miranda Priestly is different from the book. Streep's Priestly never overacts as much as she commands presence as well as sheer terror from anyone dumb enough to be within striking distance. Streep truly makes Miranda Priestly a snake (a reference to the book). Hers is the type that has accepted her role as such, has no intentions of backing down, and withholds a carefully hidden layer buried well underneath any prying eyes and only exposes itself at a crucial moment when her divorce becomes a reality. In short, she is empty on the outside, and tragically empty on the in.Anne Hathaway stars as Andy Sachs, and like every straight character, she has little to do but to react and follow suit. Because the actors who surround her -- Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci -- have stronger material to work with as they play people who have allowed the external take a stranglehold on their own identities and only rarely show glimpses of humanity (essentially, they are clones of their boss, but one complaint -- when will Hollywood have a gay character who has his own life and is not the sexless auntie who is every straight girl's best friend? Come on already.), they register more strongly. On the other hand, neither the book Andy nor the movie Andy evolve enough. Hathaway plays her straightforward, which is okay because this is what she is required to do as per the screenplay. Everyone else is fairly okay, but in essence, the movie is really the quartet of Hathaway, Blunt, Tucci, and overseeing them all, the magnificent Streep.",9,1,3,19 July 2006
Corpse Bride," Victor, Victoria, and the Bride from the Underworld
","A marriage of convenience goes bad and has the hero wind up in a very different place. Victor Van Dort is the hero, and he's a shy kind of guy, a little moody looking -- you wouldn't call him the life of the party. His parents are little more than annoying types, but they're not nearly as nasty as the Everglotts, who are the kind of people who would kill anyone's happiness with one glance. The mother, especially, barks about like a militant Mrs. Danvers, and considers her daughter Victoria little more than a sad otter. If that's tender, motherly love, I can only wonder what mild disdain might feel like.Anyway, the parents, Victor, and Victoria get together to rehearse their wedding vows. Both fall for each other, but Victor gets so nervous during his rehearsal that the priest cannot but postpone the event until he is 'ready' to marry. Victor decides to practice by himself in an open stretch of land, and places the ring on what seems to be a root or twig sticking out from the ground. No later than he ring is on the supposed twig that it begins to twitch and out of the ground comes a spectral figure -- a woman, dressed in her wedding gown, dead but alive. Eyeballing the ring on her finger she believes she has gotten married to Victor and carries him to the land of the dead who introduce Victor to her people. At the same time, the Everglotts plan on having hapless Victoria marry another suitor who has plans and motives of his own and they don't quite include the words, 'happily ever after' but do give new meaning to 'to death us do part.' CORPSE BRIDE looks and feels very Gothic and cold throughout except when scenes over the ground shift to scenes in the Underworld. For a place that is about the dead, they sure have life: there are musical numbers speckled with life, bouncing creatures that in usual circumstances would be repugnant but under the animatronics reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen come across as lovable. The Corpse Bride herself, also known to the real world as Emily, is a woman who while dead and looking blue and on the verge of decomposition harbors great emotion and even when she desires to be married, can't bring herself to have Victor, a man who has his life before him, to the ultimate sacrifice for her. But because she is a ghost, and has unresolved issues that must be fulfilled, chance has given her this door to get back at the person who trumped her in the prime of life and may strike again.It's a gorgeous movie, in any case. Short, concise, but rich in character development even when the depiction of the less sympathetic ones is a little broad. Children will be its core audience, and this is less dark a movie (despite the presence of death all around) than TIM BURTON'S NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas but as always by Burton, sure entertainment.",8,0,1,26 April 2006
The Passion of Joan of Arc," When Film Becomes Transcendental Art.
","It so often happens that some films take the long way to achieve their status of classics and worthy of being studied, frame by frame, by movie lovers who believe in the power of raw performance and skilled direction of cameras to depict a powerful visual set of images. When one sees films like VERTIGO which barely registered with movie-going audiences at the time of their release but after restoration went on to become one of the best films of the last century, it only shows that film, as an art, doesn't need a golden statuette to have merit, and when it's done exceptionally well, it can be seen in any context and any time period beyond its release date and will still hold its audience in awe.Carl Theodore Dryer, to me, created what I believe is, alongside Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE, the most powerful black and white film in cinema history. It would be difficult indeed to say which one is better since both films are landmark in their own cinematic styles and have been dissected frame by frame. Dryer's film has been criticized for either being a pretty collection of still images or being pure visual power: I choose the latter, because in watching THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, I felt not only the extremely uncomfortable intimacy between Joan and her tormentors, but her sublime emotions as they pass through her face as she is mocked, cross-examined, humiliated, and burned at the cross. There is an unearthly beauty in Falconetti's face as she goes through the ringer of emotions not in the overacting style typical of the Twenties but in a completely modern way, as if she were living a reality so far removed from the corrupted priests who bash and condemn her, and her reality would therefore be dangerous to their own beliefs.And what a stroke of genius, I think, to have the lighting on her face be soft, gentle, in contrast to her detractors who are always lit in harsh light which exacerbates their ugliness and betrays their 'devotion' to God as mere politics. Dryer's style of cutting from one actor to the other is also different, and makes this film a surrealist experience, an unsettling, abstract tour through transcendental suffering. There are no defining shots which tell us where exactly is the story taking place (although we don't need to know after reading the transcripts), but we never are allowed as viewers a moment of rest from this suffocating intimacy between Joan and her inquisitors. Some bizarre shots and camera angles give the ending an even more disturbing and horrifying element of what we perceive as a gross injustice to what was a person who held her own beliefs and did not need the Church to sustain it.Falconetti never did a film before this one and never returned to film acting after this. I have not read much about her, except that she lived in Argentina until her death in 1946. I sometimes wonder why she didn't act again (although she was known to be an accomplished theatre actress more known for comedies than drama) but those are the mysteries of actors who don't have the star ego and only make a few films. She came, only did this masterful performance, and left just as suddenly, and those who re-discovered this film and restored it to its full quality have to be commended for allowing us, who have come almost 80 years later, to experience the power of subtle acting.",10,76,85,2 August 2005
The Aviator," Obsessively Watchable.
","Not many directors can say that their film-making careers haven't become as predictable as the next day, and for all its ups and downs and questionable choices, Martin Scorcese, with or without an Academy Award for Best Director, can stand proud and say that he is one of those few who have made at least one stellar film per decade since he began making films in the 1970s and continues making high-quality films for the serious moviegoer. Or, as it could be said, he makes the films he wants to make whether they become critical successes or failures.Coming out of GANGS OF NEW YORK he decides to film this biopic about media dinosaur Howard Hughes at a time when the average moviegoer is more interested in the likes of Paris Hilton and her increasingly cretinous presence which has nothing to bring to society except smutty videotapes. In a year filled with biopics, THE AVIATOR is an important one, if trivially flawed, because in taking such a character and without sentiment analyzing his truly remarkable but ultimately tragic life he achieves a sharper view. Leonardo diCaprio as Howard Hughes does not have even a remote physical resemblance to the actual man, but there was no doubt in my mind that he was Hughes from head to toe. It's as if he studied Hughes through film reels because he gets him right and that makes his performance multi-dimensional. Watch a short, apparently unimportant scene with a bar-waitress early in the film and see how this establishes who he is in relation to women, what he thinks of them. Watch how diCaprio brings Hughes obsession with perfection and cleanliness to life: in film-making, in building the perfect plane. And watch those testosterone-fuled sequences in which Hughes breaks aviation records (almost killing himself at one point).It can be said that THE AVIATOR is divided into two parts: The first half, which focuses on Hughes relationship with screen icon Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), and the second half which takes off from where she leaves and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, previously kept under control (suggesting she gave him some stability), comes flooding through unmonitored. During the first half of the movie DiCaprio and Blanchett create a perfect pair of social outcasts, and had the film ended there, this would have been a powerfully tragic love story. I got the sense, without reading Kate's autobiography, that these two really loved each other and were each other's complement. Hepburn's mercurial approach to Hughes must have obviously intoxicated him, and I could perceive (through Blanchett's flawless conveyance of Hepburn) that she was intrigued by this odd man, and of course, being so cerebral, she felt compelled to getting to know him. However, their differences could not have been better reflected in the disastrous scene when Hughes meets Hepburns family and though they remained together a bit longer, his womanizing was the cause for her abandonment of him and the gut-wrenching sequence in which be burns his clothes and orders work associate Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to buy him more.The second half doesn't lag. It does feel a little episodic, but Scorcese manages to make transitions smooth, while introducing players in the latter part of his life, such as Ava Gardner, Juan Trippe, and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. As the case with many of Scorcese films, length and editing is an issue, and reducing the inclusion of starlet Faith Domergue would have been preferable, but again, Scorcese is making the film he chooses to make and this is really a quibble in my behalf, because soon later Hughes is back in action defending his usage of his own money during the war against accusations from Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, playing him like a snake). No punches are also thrown when the aforementioned OCD kicks in and Hughes starts to see things and becomes a virtual recluse, urinating into glass jars and watching the same movie over and over again (the movie in question was not THE OUTLAW as seen here, but the usage of this archive footage seems appropriate since it sums up his attitude toward women and a lost love in Kate Hepburn). Here is when DiCaprio really sinks his teeth into his role in making Hughes a broken man unable to cope with his madness and needing to defend himself against Brewster and Trippe.Regardless to minor character inconsistencies and half-told story lines and that many of the actors look nothing like their real-life counterparts (i.e. Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and a glaringly miscast Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner), THE AVIATOR is solid entertainment and highly recommended to anyone who loves old movies and old Hollywood.",9,23,31,14 December 2005
The Village," The Woods are Scary, but This is a Snoozefest.
","How does one write an intelligent, coherent review of a movie that made me feel like I was not only cheated, but done so at a shameless way? M. Night Shyamalan has, for the last three out of five movies, focused on making sci-fi/horror films that rely on only one thing: a fantastic twist at or near the movie's climax or critical point, which of course, would make you, the viewer, do a double-take and applaud him for doing something so breath-taking and original that it would, in itself, trump the big revelation in VERTIGO (1957) or the final big denouement scene in WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (also 1957). With THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) he had a honest hit, a revelation of a movie director with talent to spare, but once he made SIGNS (2002), it was clear the cheap twist is all he is about.What can one do when one has to listen to the most God-awful dialog in recent film history? Judy Greer, whom I've seen in movies of varying quality and the TV series 'Arrested Development,' decides to proclaim her love for Joaquin Phoenix with an intensity that rivals that of Peter Finch's speech (take your pick, there are at least five) as Howard Beale in NETWORK (1976), but since here her lines are so horrible, it's unintentionally funny. As a matter of fact, everyone speaks in that odd pilgrim-like choice of words and utters sentences like, 'What is your meaning' and 'I know that thing that is in your head' as if it were written by Paddy Chayefsky or Joseph Mankiewicz or even Shakespeare. It is done so totally deadpan that it becomes painful to watch and more than once I looked at the time to see how much more I would have to endure, because when a story like this is devoid of even a slight bit of humor and is equally pointless, actions must be taken.For a director to state that he has been influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, there has to be some proof in his work. Choices of takes and scenes, choices of actors/actresses, choices of stories to tell, music, among other things. Shyamalan may say he is influenced by (Hitchcock) all he wants but if he is so, I can't see it. The use of red here -- an important part of the story -- has been done masterfully by Hitchcock in the aforementioned VERTIGO (1957) and MARNIE (1964), and better still by Ingmar Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS (1972). Also, Hitchcock was The Master of Suspense: he gave us enough information for us to know what is happening at the moment, and then cranked up the mounting intensity to a fever pitch like the masterful Albert Hall sequence in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1956) or the scene in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) where Cary Grant is left waiting for his ride in the middle of a cornfield and slowly but surely, a plane materializes. We know there is something about to happen, just not what, or if it will actually take place.Sadly enough, there is zero suspense here. The events that take place in Covington, PA, fail to cause any sort of empathy or reaction, and the only real scene that introduces danger about to strike a major character seems so contrived it begs for a reason to exist. Why would Bryce Dallas Howard stand at the threshold extending her arm outward when it is clear there are things out there in the dark? Because the plot had her do so, not because there was a need for it.So many ways to have told this story and genuinely introduce the twist without cheating the audience with holes as large as the ozone layer for the convenience and whims of the 'plot.' Shyamalan decides to cop out, waste some good talent (or, if seen differently, use high profile names like Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, and Adrien Brody fresh out of his Oscar win, to ensure viewers), make some easy money, cash on his new-found fame, and produce a hat-trick that doesn't have a rabbit and basically gives no new insights. And that is a sad thing for a director to do, if he purportedly is to consider himself serious.And one last thing: Shyamalan needs to take his name off the title of the movie, since he is not at the stature of a Kubrick or the aforementioned Hitchcock. He needs a little lesson in humility and return to making actual movies, not travesties.",2,87,166,2 March 2005
American Psycho," Who is Patrick Bateman?
","There is an interesting moment during an early part of Mary Harron's controversial black horror comedy American PSYCHO that truly defines who Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is, even when hints are dropped here and there that not even Bateman himself knows who he is. As he goes through his ritual of self-pampering in the name of 'taking care of himself' much in the way cosmetic ads tells us to do, he removes an exfoliating mask from his face in a surprisingly slow way, pausing midway, as he looks at his reflection in the mirror. The camera does not flinch. What we get, for a good five to ten seconds, is the reptilian glare of a monster, a man so repulsive, so unwatchable, that he would make an excellent place as a Stephen King villain -- the Dark Man himself.However, there is nothing 'dark' about Bateman. He lives in an ultra-swanky New York apartment, all white, an ode of minimalism at its finest. He dresses himself in the finest of fabrics (the book goes to extreme detail of describing just how much of a cult of the fashion-conscious Bateman and his peers are; indeed, all of them seem to dress and look the same and are often confused for one another), he works out obsessively, he admires how he looks, and he covets. Boy, he covets! It's only implied at first, but once the mention of getting that plum reservation at Dorsia -- the Newest Place to Dine At According to the Dining Bible That is Zagat Survey -- falls on the lap of a fellow co-worker, Paul Allen (Owen in the book), Batemen goes bonkers. Literally. (And that's not even going into how he reacts when he loses in the competition of who would have the best business card.) So. Paul Allen comes to his apartment to hang out and he winds out in the wrong end of Patrick Bateman's impossibly pristine, silver axe. The scene in itself is one of the most surreal, wickedly funny, and stomach churning I've ever seen. How Mary Harron constructs it: by having Bateman doing the moonwalk over a Huey Lewis song from 1987, 'Hip to be Square' as he recited the importance about this song in pop culture while wearing a raincoat of sorts covering the length of his suit. It's disengaging, it's completely out of whack, but it's there, and it's neatly made movie history with its balls-out temerity and I love it. More so because a woman has directed it, and women aren't always given this chance to be this dark, this perverse.American PSYCHO is visceral, though it tones it down a tad from the book -- in Bret Easton Ellis' outrageous story Patrick does even more unspeakable things to ex-girlfriend Bethany and late in the novel, to a boy and even then it's still squeamishly funny, while impossibly de Sadean. Guinevere Turner maintains the novel's essence to its core, and by also adhering to the novel's ambiguity -- since we never truly know what exactly happened, what did not, and there is the question of who Patrick Bateman really is -- she creates a wicked examination of reality versus the surreal, integrity versus collapse, the American values versus complete decadence. Oscar Wilde would probably love this story, would he be alive now: this is his own 'Picture of Dorian Grey' taken to its furthest limits.",10,5,8,3 June 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," A Genuine Surprise
","I believe that the clever marketing of this fantastic movie made people come back in larger and larger crowds until it couldn't be ignored that it was a force to be acknowledged because as advertised, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE had the makings of a straight-forward comedy. When seen in its entirety however, it reveals itself as much more -- a deeply complex dramedy that burrows under the skin of these extremely dysfunctional people locked together in a make-or-break road trip. It couldn't have been released at a better time -- the height of summer, when releases have the look and feel of desperation due to the fact that they've been shelved to the end of the summer blockbuster season and thrown at the public like ragged leftovers.This one is a winner in every aspect. It's actually a rather dark movie, dealing with subject matters that are hardly the basis for laughter. Dad (Greg Kinnear) is not a nice person: he believes in winning at all costs and has this thing about self-help that borders on crazy, more so because he himself is a brittle man. Mom (Toni Collette) is trying to help her gay brother (Steve Carell) out who has attempted suicide over a romantic abandonment. Dwayne (Paul Dano) has his own issues with his family, which he hates. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) has a heroin addiction and has the subtlety of a self-conscious train wreck. Olive (Abigail Breslin), the little girl at the center of all this mess, is the glue who ties them together when they threaten to fray at the seams, is remarkable.Olive has by chance, won a pass to participate in a beauty contest. However, she doesn't look or act like any of these little girls who have been groomed since babyhood into becoming pint-sized women -- aspiring Jon-Benets. The contest is to be held in California, and off they go in a broken-down VW bus (often seen in the movies promos). Of course... this is where the limits of tolerance will come to light, and where the movie takes its incursion into much darker areas masked under the banana yellow of the van.LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE doesn't have any standout images, or clever editing to boast. Tremendous acting by the entire ensemble, although Alan Arkin gets dropped off the plot a little too soon -- I wanted more, but that's okay. There's also never a moment when you doubt this family of misfits, and the sequence when Olive takes the stage is a showstopper in its clumsiness because it's been hinted all along she doesn't fit into this mold -- not because she's not beautiful, a winner in her own right, but because she's too good to be degraded like that. Which is what the movie in its own is -- much too good to be penned into any given audience, much too good to be bogged down by merits. It's really the story of the little film that could.",9,1,3,5 March 2007
North by Northwest," What an Action Thriller Should Be.
","VERTIGO did nothing to advance Hitchcock's career in 1957 when he released it, and it's actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial, escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of Cary Grant, as an added note. This could well amount to be the first James Bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick, an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic 'boss,' a dashing hero, lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.NORTH BY NORTHWEST has one crucial difference to any James Bond film, though: Alfred Hitchcock. While the Bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff (although fluff of the better kind until the franchise ran out of gas in the 80s), Hitchcock, always the master of subtext as well as suspense, creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension, sexual innuendo, comedy, and mounting suspense seamlessly. There is never the feeling of being bored as there is too much going on, especially with the sizzling chemistry of Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant, by now a Hitchcock veteran. When they're on screen, dialog crackles and so much more is said with so little gesture -- she closes the lid on her Ice Goddess role, but gives it a nice, cheeky, knowing wink. He of course evolves from the sort of man who while looking and being slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb -- once it becomes clear he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot that only later becomes clear -- becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands. A quintessential Hitchcock Everyman, Grant has his stamp all over his role. No one can imagine anyone else running away from that crop duster in one of the movies many standout sequences, or saying the reassuring last words to Eva Marie Saint as they cuddle together in the train. When one thinks of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one thinks Cary Grant.Easily one of Hitchcock's best films, made while he was at the peak of his career in the bracket formed with THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and MARNIE. Great supporting performances are all over the map, from Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother, James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, Martin Landau as Vandamm's protégée who might be a little more than that, and Leo G Carroll as The Professor. Doreen Lang appears early in the movie as Grant's secretary; she would of course be remembered as the woman who shrieks at Tippi Hedren in THE BIRDS and gets slapped by her as the camera holds itself tight on her face.",10,164,203,11 April 2005
The Shining," A Building Without its Foundation
","Stanley Kubrick probably wasn't the director who should have taken the helms of translating Stephen King's classic of modern horror into the big screen. For that reason, neither was Mick Garris, who would go on to direct the miniseries and throw everything but the kitchen sink and re-define the concept that doing a faithful, literal rendition of a complex novel can be like being the holder of a whip and full permission to flog a dead horse into even more submission, but that's another story.However, Kubrick chose this among the heap of novels he was reading at the time and he decided to make his own vision -- which should have surprised no one, least of all King, although maybe he did not know Kubrick was known for making a story his in every respect of the word. In a lot of ways, THE SHINING succeeds, and is more unsettling than outright scary. The dark ambient music and the squealing violins bring a textured madness within the picture, a sense that things are bad from the get-go and will only get worse as the story proceeds. As a matter of fact, one of the best uses of sound that accentuate the concept of the 'pounding' that makes its appearance in the nightmarish passages of the book is the one scene when Hallorann is trying to reach through to the Overlook Hotel and senses a growing trepidation that something horrible is about to take place. That implacable heartbeat insinuates itself with deadly accuracy until I, as a viewer, could literally feel the impending disaster (knowing the novel well).However, THE SHINING is packed with missteps that detract from its punch. One of the movie's glaring flaws is the casting of Jack Nicholson. True, he's come to define the psycho with the tongue sticking out and those devilish eyebrows as his silky voice promises more mayhem and he yells his trademark 'Here's Johnny!' to the camera. However, where in the novel Jack Torrance was a deeply flawed man, one who had an enormous baggage stemming from his broken home, his drunken, often abusive father (one scene in particular pops up several times in flashbacks, as the senior Torrance pummeled his wife with his cane over dinner while little Jack and his brothers watched in horror as their mother actually did nothing to defend herself or accuse him later on to the authorities), a man who was trying to do what he could to pull through with his family, whom he himself had hurt in similar ways.The movie's Jack is nuts from the start. That's not a spoiler, it's practically the movie's premise. It was a rather novel concept, making the hero crazy from the beginning, but not making it clear until the moment Wendy discovers how long his mental instability has been going on.Another big problem is having the character of Danny turned into little more than a talking moron. The Danny in the book is articulate and smart as a whip while still being a child at heart; this one is a step away from being idiotic. Wendy in the book was stronger, less of a simp... here she's drowning in her simpering mousiness and turning it into an art form worthy of the Smithsonian Institute. Again, an issue of miscasting -- Shelley Duvall was simply not right for this role.If anything, THE SHINING holds the essence of the destruction of the American family intact in both the book and the movie version. While neither Jack nor Wendy are given back stories that might shed light into their current state of affairs, they're not a happy marriage and it's only time before irrevocable problems will arise and cause a dent within their fabric. I think that in eliminating these elements from their characters, Kubrick did want to indicate that it didn't matter; disintegration was disintegration whether one came from a broken home or Stepford. Here, it happens rather quickly; Kubrick just doesn't show it until late in the movie when Jack lets his inner crazy out and his 'Honey, I'm home' is so drenched in irony that it almost brings the message full circle: violence starts at home.So Kubrick's vision, indeed.... excellent for 2001, A SPACE ODYSSEY, but middle-of-the-road for this type of movie, especially when using the oldest fright-gags the book that will cause laughter than actual discomfort. Stick with the book, it's perfect, and hope someone will come and re-make it the way it deserves to be.",5,1,6,3 June 2007
"I, Robot"," Let's Call it Azimov-Lite.
","And here we go again with bad movies chock-full of dazzling special effects, multi-sequenced action scenes, and a story-line that while action packed, delivers little more than the routine. A crusty hero with a dark past and some inner torment in the form of Will Smith, check. A scientist found dead under mysterious circumstances and Smith is called to investigate, uncovering 'a whole lotta mystery' underneath, check. A robot with a conspicuous British accent who's the prime suspect, check. A female scientist with an initial glacial demeanor who later on becomes the detective's sidekick, check. This is purportedly an adaptation of Isaac Azimov's stories, but in reality, it's little more than a very loose interpretation of them threaded together to form a script which tosses in elements from Schwarzenegger and Stallone movies for good measure, down to the one-liners and over the top ending. The only element which truly stands out here is Sonny the Robot, voiced by Alan Tudyk, a non-Britisher with an uncanny British accent, who manages to give a heartfelt personality to an otherwise stiff computer generated image -- otherwise, this is one flat soda, faux Sci-Fi.",5,0,0,20 April 2005
Aliens," Two Mothers of a Different Kind
","So many sequels fail because they re-hash the same story and bring nothing new to the premises. James Cameron, however, decided that instead of going for a more amped-up repetition of the horror in ALIEN, he decided to reverse the situation, constrict the action to almost claustrophobic levels, and show not one but an entire colony of those nasty aliens, complete with a gigantic Queen. ALIENS is not a horror film but an all-out war movie that also manages to show how we as a race are as opportunistic as we can be. Where ALIEN implied the notion that the crew of the Nostromo was only bait to lure this elusive but highly efficient species out for genetic manipulation, ALIENS takes the premise to extreme lengths. Even then it retains credibility since it has become common knowledge how the powers of the world create their own viruses and play God to unsuspecting humans. However, this is not an existential film but a non-stop thrill-ride filled with three fully fleshed out females stealing the light out from their emasculated male counterparts (played by Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Bill Paxton). Newt (Carrie Henn) is the little girl who witness the destruction of her own security, and who regresses to an animal state in order to survive -- she is able to play the aliens game blow by blow even when her death is omniscient at every turn. Ripley, more of an unwilling survivor of the first movie, is now a rage-induced fury of a woman who will stop at nothing to ensure this species never procreates and sustains one of the most memorable (and symbolic) fight sequences against the Queen as both try to save their own daughters -- Ripley her surrogate Newt, the Queen her entire colony. Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldman), though a little under-written here and there, has as of yet been the only female to body slam an alien punch to punch.Nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Actress for Signourney Weaver, ALIENS is an excellent follow-up to its first movie and one of the best action films of the 80s. It would be followed by David Fincher's much hated but debut film ALIENS 3.",10,1,2,18 February 2006
Ocean's Eleven," The Heist that Oozed Cool
","The risky thing about these kind of films is the fact that being remakes of previous versions carrying big-name stars it faces the inevitable comparison. However, the first OCEAN'S ELEVEN wasn't exactly CASABLANCA or CITIZEN KANE. Steven Soderbergh assembles a spectacular cast -- which I don't need to mention since practically everyone who's seen the film knows it will have Soderbergh s usual suspects and some new ones -- but if there is an ultimate star in this, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, it is he. Every shot, every scene, the very construction of the heists that Danny Ocean's pack of sophisticated thieves execute, along with cracking dialog and vintage music creates not only a sizzling reconstruction: it transcends its genres limitations, and it flows elegantly with Soderberghs inimitable stamp, and that is film-making at its best -- the art of creating cinematic jazz.",10,0,1,30 May 2007
Resident Evil," This is Sci-Fi For the Cinematically Impaired.
","We have to thank the MTV and video game culture for bringing us the rapid-fire montage of seemingly unrelated images and cartoon-like sequences that came out of the AEON FLUX canon. We also have to give George A. Romero another handshake -- because of him the story of people turned into mindless, shuffling zombies whose sole intention it is to rip other people apart (and of course, always the lingering question: why not themselves and the healthy humans prevails, always without an answer) has become something of a mainstay even for more serious features (28 DAYS LATER...).So here we are in RESIDENT EVIL. Much like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, the aforementioned 28 DAYS LATER..., and a not-too-subtle nod to ALIENS, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, there is a viral plague released in the confines of an organization called The Hive which turns its corporate employees into (you guessed it) hollowed-up corporate employees. So predictable! Except there's a super-employee, call it the monster in the closet that every company of the likes of Enron has, and it's out for (you guessed it again) blood and guts. Which made me ponder, 'Don't they feed this thing?' Of course not: being the product of greed, it always wants more, and Michael Douglas did say once upon a time in a much better movie, 'Greed is good.' Oh well, telling you more about this story is frankly, fruitless. Been there, done that, not particularly shocked when the shocks arrive. Now, into some interesting aspects. Being a product birthed from a video game, the appearance of a killer laser that operates (surprise) like it would in a video game, even changing into a grid. Why is it included? Oh... let me see... Oh, I can't think straight right now. But there's something else. The never-named Alice (Milla Jovovich, proving that acting is beyond her but looking smashing) and Matt (Eric Mabius) learn that there is a conspiracy. Cut to a nifty computer image as-seen from the outside of The Hive, then to them going back to where their friends are, being pursued by the zombified corporates. Where's the transition? Some neat touches, though. The use of what could be the ugliest soundtrack in movie history provides a boost to erstwhile predictable moments of terror. Some composition shots, such as the transition between the prologue to the Mansion where Milla emerges or when Milla, walking down a murderous hallway (the one with the laser with a mind of its own), is interposed with the image of scientists performing unnatural acts, bringing back 'important details.' The revelation of what we missed in the prologue emerging later on when one character's true motives are exposed.However, there is the saying that any film can be elevated into the levels of an instant classic with a good director with a strong hand. True. But again, this is a movie version of a video game and I'd like to know if there ever has been a (movie version of a video game) that has ever been more than vaguely adequate with a good dose of shrill.",5,0,1,17 December 2005
Independence Day," The First of Roland Emmerich's Love Letter to New York City.
","And I say that swimming in sarcasm, because if vaporizing the City is love, I'd cringe to know what hate would be like. With this inane, extremely dumbed-down action movie he begins a trilogy of films that aims its ugly, brainless head towards destroying New York City (and the rest of the United States with it) as aliens decide we really would not make very good hosts and take everything with them, enveloping them in turquoise light -- somehow this color is akin to everything horror: see THE RING for another reference -- which consumes all it touches in a ball of fire. All the clichés of action films are here and just shows how empty this movie is, with all its patriotism and heroism plastered on almost every frame. But... for every great director there must be one counterpart, and Emmerich is more than willing to fill those shoes. Awful. And that's being kind.",5,34,69,20 April 2005
Gone with the Wind," Gone With the Wind
","The story that spawned the story would make a scathing parody of what goes behind the making of a movie that had, years before its inception as a blockbuster, gone hyped out of control. Margaret Mitchell could have never envisioned her attempt at writing would create one of the most memorable movies of the last century. After all, all she did was write on a dare while recovering from a broken ankle, mainly for her own amusement.The explosion that followed would be on a similar not as to what has happened with books such as 'The Da Vinci Code' (although the movie didn't fare too well, despite being a good adaptation of a convoluted tale of quasi-hermetic conspiracies for a darker purpose). Coming out in 1936, it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize which in turn caught Hollywood's eye, already an industry noted for recreating movie versions of books both of its time and classic novels.And with this, the 'legendary search' for who would play Scarlett O'Hara, Mitchell's spitfire (pardon the cliché) heroine. The story is rife with intrigue itself -- everyone but ZaZu Pitts was on the roster, generating a whirlwind of publicity of gigantic proportions. (This, in itself, brought with it a new age in entertainment: that of the media frenzy circling on a specific event or celebrity.) Of course, little did they all know that the actress slated to play Scarlett was already hand-picked, and as much as Norma Shearer, married to the convenience of Irving Thalberg, was in negotiations, or as much as Bette Davis wanted the role (having to remain content with her own version in JEZEBEL, itself quite a formidable classic), or that Tallulah Bankhead and Miriam Hopkins were indeed from the South, or that Paulette Goddard came 'this close' to bag the role in her pocket, the role was undoubtedly Vivien Leigh's. And this is the role for which Vivien has been remembered to this day in her all-too-brief career.Repercussions of a less-reported, but culturally significant nature also can be seen throughout the finished product that is GONE WITH THE WIND. Blacks, up until 1939, had been seen only as in bit parts and the occasional supporting role such as in BABY FACE and IMITATION OF LIFE. (They would still be practically unseen until the Fifties when Sidney Poitier would come along, so it shows that changes didn't happen overnight.) The inclusion of black actors in larger roles that instead of being ornaments and lounge singers were part of the plot -- even if it was in what we today see as 'stereotypical' roles -- was, for the times and posterior years, groundbreaking. It's ignited intense debates on how the character of Mammy (portrayed by Oscar-winner Hattie MacDaniel in her first and only landmark win over Olivia DeHaviland who while playing the much more understated role had years of a lucrative career ahead of her) was positive or negative, but for starters, at least she carried entire scenes with one or several of the leads, which meant baby steps. The same can be said for Butterfly McQueen who has equal amount of participation in GONE WITH THE WIND even as her character was underwritten and McQueen's own acting style did not allay any misconceptions of the dim-witted servant. I personally believe -- as a gay man living in a country that still has a ways to go in terms of full acceptance -- that it's best to have some form of representation rather than none at all.Is it a perfect movie? I'd say it is... it's too well-done for its time. It's gone into our public consciousness with Rhett Butler's final quote to Scarlett and Scarlett's own two famous lines, '...as God as my witness I'll never be hungry again,' and ...'tomorrow is another day.' Its score practically lives within our DNA. Scarlett's own character is, while a historical romance heroine, closer to the types of ladies which existed in Pre-Code Hollywood. Her behavior alone is at times unsympathetic, even flat-out selfish and deceitful, but proto-feminist in the way a woman with no means to survival would have to be. It's been one of the most-watched films of the last century and probably will be in the coming future. Even overriding its MGM gloss, it's a fascinating movie, ferocious entertainment, and simply put, one of the greatest.",10,2,3,17 May 2007
28 Days Later...," An Emotion Infects a Nation.
","A film that at time plays like a frenzied docudrama, 28 DAYS LATER... is unrelenting, grim, horrific, and completely nightmarish. Images of violence against humans dominates the screen for a few minutes, and we soon learn these are televisions mounted against a wall, broadcasting non-stop footage of the inhuman things people do to one another. A monkey lies strapped down, facing these images, helpless. There are others in cages nearby. A band of environmentalists break in, predictably to free these imprisoned monkeys, but a conflict ensues as a scientist barges in and warns them it would be completely insane to do so -- they're infected with Rage. However, since scientists normally equal evil corporations and dehumanized technology known for cruelty not only against animals but humans, they proceed to free one of the apes... and total pandemonium breaks loose as the monkey viciously attacks its freer, and in seconds we see her eyes have become red. She is an infected.And this is the simple setup for a movie that in 100 minutes frightens the pants of even a jaded person. To see shots of a deserted London magnified by shots of abandoned vehicles, overturned equipment, and a haunting collage of missing persons that recalls the scores of photos of the missing that did not survive the 9 - 11 attacks, is extremely disturbing and unsettling and made me squirm in my seat as Cillian Murphy's character Jim walks around town, having awaken about a month later from a coma. It's not reassuring for him to know he may be the only surviving person in the city, and soon he learns there are others out there... but not reasonable, frightened people as much as ferocious predators who will rip the flesh right off you, and if mercy takes over, you may die right there and then, because it only takes 20 seconds for full infection to take over and turn you into a raving monster.That he is saved at the last minute by others who have survived the madness is his saving grace. These are Naomi Harris as Selena and Noah Huntley as Mark, who brief Jim on what happened in haunting monologues, and that Danny Boyle stays focused on Huntley's face as he relates to Jim his own story is flashback enough: it only heightens the terror that swept London and that is still alive and well. This prompts Jim to go visit his parents, maybe hoping they are still alive, and after a near-fatal encounter with an infected there in which Mark does not survive (Selena, absolutely committed to survive this, hacks him to pieces after quickly noticing he's been infected), they barely manage to escape more infected before meeting two other people, a bearish man and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns). They have been listening to scattered transmissions that are indicating Manchester holds a possible refuge for survivors.Once they make the decision to leave to Manchester the movie takes a turn and becomes a road film and involved a harrowing if somewhat implausible escape from London through a tunnel, where even the rats are running away from the sheer horror these barely seen people have become. That they eventually meet this fort in an already destroyed Manchester gives them little reassurance, which proves to be true as a small band of military guys lead by Christopher Eccleston have dubious intentions with the women.And here is where Danny Boyle cleverly turns an apocalyptic movie into a study of the human race: can the people who are supposedly meant to protect us be actually worse than the ones who have fallen to a devastating plague? The answer, quite simply, turns out to be yes. That this makes Jim do a much needed transition from dazed youth to fierce survivor drives the point even more home: Rage wiped out most of the population, as a virus, but in given circumstances, is found quite well within us, and Jim becomes so filled with it at one climactic sequence it takes Selena a second before reacting that he hasn't yet been infected.This is a very tense film. There are moments of quietude in a field, where sleep comes uneasy, and even that moment to me was worse than any of the moments when the infected actually sped out and after any of the characters. Seen in stroboscopic images, they becomes even more frightening than if seen as lumbering idiots. If the ending seems a little too upbeat, maybe it's only the decision Boyle and the screenwriters took after having us gone through so much gut-wrenching tension and clear calls, that it was only fair to have Jim, Selena, and Hannah survive and see a glimmer of hope at the end. Other than that, 28 DAYS LATER compresses the battles with good and evil in a world gone wild instead of going all over the place with too many characters like THE STAND and many others do. Intelligent, repulsive at times, unbearable, this was one of the best films of 2003. The DVD release has some nice extras, like alternate endings, deleted scenes, for those into investigating further into Boyle's dark tale.",9,84,115,9 May 2005
Cars," Delectable Corn
","Walking into CARS was like opening the door into the past and reliving those Dominican festivals of corn: a contest consisting of virtually hundreds of corn-made confections and dishes, some sweet, some salty, some spicy, some thick with butter and cheese and chocolate, others with little more than the grain itself. CARS is one of these confections: a movie that is so drenched in displaced sentimentalism given to machines that it gives even the most shameless incursion into schmaltz seem like an experiment in Kubrickesque storytelling. It is tailor made for corn, for emotions, for the family, for pummeling its message with the subtlety of an A-Bomb. Anyone feeling surprised at the plot developments ought to be shot on sight and thrown into the nearest gutter. This one of the sweetest, corniest movies I've come across, so corny that when I took in its visuals I reeled back and caught myself nearly passing out. I then thought about the one fat mouse telling Ratatouille in the promo for next Spring's movie of the same name 'If you can get past the gag reflex, it's not that bad,' as he munched away at his grayish ball of... something, leaving Ratatouille even more determined to find great food in Paris even at the cost of his own life. And then there were moments when my corn-trip became real: I know it sounds like I lost my mind, but rivulets of butterscotch, peppercorn, and Mazola oil came flying out of the screen, engulfing the audience and myself as I sat near the door but could not make for it since I was firmly planted on my seat, being drowned in Life's Precious Lessons -- the Moral of the Story. It became hard to breathe and for a second or two I caught myself choking and sobbing a little. I counted the tears -- two of them, neatly creeping down my cheeks. And then the movie was over. Of course, when I met my friend for dinner, reeking of corn, she asked me, 'So what did you watch today?' I told her, 'CARS.' She asked me, 'And...?' I said, 'I absolutely loved it. It's fake as a pair of silicone tomatoes on your average Californian wannabe actress/model, pre-planned and pre-packaged in advance, but I loved it.' Of course, she didn't believe me for one second, but there it is. I do. I like it. Even if five people wrote the screenplay, and it runs just short of two hours, and the opening sequence, 'One Man Band,' is as marvelously cynical as CARS is a portentuous pile of ho-hum. So sue me, I bought it like a clotheshorse on a shopping spree at a designer store packed with fabulous sales.",8,0,1,29 June 2006
The Incredibles," Another Smash Hit for Pixar
","It's tough to be a superhero and not be allowed to manifest your prowess due to a lawsuit which has made you go into a 'superhero protection program' and live the life of an Average Joe.This is the case of Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible as he is also known. Living in marital complacency in suburbia with his wife Helen, also known as Elastigirl and his three kids, he works as a mindless office drone who needs to support his family and occasionally gets together with his buddy Lucius Best/Frozone and tries to fight small crime.Until one day when he gets called on a special assignment in a remote location which leads him smack into the lair of a former fan, now turned arch-nemesis, Syndrome, who has an interest in destroying the world and also destroying his family.What could have been a by-the-numbers story is enhanced by much of the 'performances', or rather, the way the characters are made to interact to one another as per the screenplay. Bob and Helen are clearly in love even though their glory years as superheros (they believe) are over. Bob frets that he's become this paunchy bear of a man, Helen now has to multi-task since she is raising three children, each with a personality of their own, each with superpowers of their own.I find it interesting to see how their kids also are given distinct personalities: Dash has the restless spark that his superpowers will require him to have and Violet is as close to channeling Lydia Dietz from Beetlejuice as possible -- shy, goth, and starting to develop her powers of invisibility and create force fields but beset by feelings of insecurity. Even Jack-Jack, the baby, has his moments, mainly caused by typical baby tantrums and in a crucial point, sheer fear. And this is where the script works: it never forgets that they are essentially kids who have these powers and would treat them as any kid would.Brad Bird has in his hands an excellent, humanized tale of superheroes that borrows liberally from the Fantastic Four and takes it into an Ozzie and Harriet setting. He's created a movie that is tricky: while animated, it has some elements that will not be understood or suitable for children, such as Bob Parr going through his identity crisis, for example. At the same time, this is the first time that a film has broken grounds in its background animation. While the people are seen as cartoons, the locations are something else and have the look and feel of actual scenery. It's the first time water looks like water; that made me almost feel like reach out and touching the screen.Much of the credit in establishing the characters are the voices used. Craig T. Nelson brings a beautiful masculinity to Bob Parr who would probably resemble bodybuilder Jeramy Freeman. Holly Hunter's voice makes Helen spunky, resourceful, feminist but devoted at the same time. Samuel L. Jackson brings his own star power into Lucius Best and the scenes involving his wife at a tense moment is side-splitting and cheerfully stereotypical. And what Bird himself does with his own rendition of Edith Head is nothing short of camp heaven.In short, excellent family entertainment with a smart spin on what becomes of superheros once their fifteen minutes of fame are over.",10,16,25,22 December 2005
The Game," Let's Toast the Man Who Has Everything
","Hot on the heels of his breakthrough success with 1995's SE7EN David Fincher, at that moment Hollywood's new It director, went one step further into the darkness within an everyman's life with this twisting refrigerator movie that tells the story of 'the man who had everything', Nicholas Van Orton, who gets a special gift from his tricky brother Conrad (Sean Penn). This gift is a 'game' which a company named Consumer Recreation Services provides 'whatever the customer lacks' in entertainment. Nicholas, a humorless man, reverts to his old life -- until odd incidents begin to manifest themselves, growing in severity until he realizes that this is not a game and his very life is threatened.With conscious nods to NORTH BY NORTHWEST and SECONDS, THE GAME is an underground contemporary classic that lets us is on the perverse pleasure of being mean to someone and seeing their cold veneer and control-freak nature crumble under pressure. David Fincher knows suspense and how to tighten the noose around his main character and he throws all the stops out, like the Wizard behind the curtain in THE WIZARD OF OZ. He loves making even the most seasoned film-buff try and second guess the plot, only to throw a monkey wrench into the proceedings. Not much else can be said about the supporting actors (Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger) without giving crucial elements away, but it's enough to say they're both fine as wine. Penn is playful, but a loving brother; Unger is smoldering like the best of femme fatales. Michael Douglas, however, is an actor used to this kind of role -- the persecuted Everyman -- and it's great fun to watch his control give away to frantic desperation as he breaks through that fourth wall to reveal who is hiding behind that green curtain.",8,1,2,18 February 2006
The Illusionist," The Art of Deceit
","A young man of poor origins only known as Eisenheim sits alone in an empty stage, looking blankly ahead at a waiting crowd of which two people stand out: a bespectacled young man and an older gentleman. Both men seem to be observing this moment of silence with supreme anticipation. Almost like angel dust, Eisenheim conjured a ghostly mass that flutters to the right of him and begins to manifest something that causes a massive commotion.Because Neil Berger's movie THE ILLUSIONIST begins in media res, most of what happens takes place in progressive flashbacks that slowly disclose the beginnings of a passion between two star-crossed childhood lovers. The young boy Eisenheim had become the close friend of the nobly-born Sophie von Teschen at about the same time he had had his first encounter with a wise man who had taught him the secret of disappearance. Due to their social imbalance Eisenheim and Sophie had become separated. Eisenheim then decided to travel the world, but once back in Austria as a young man (the introspective Edward Norton), he was intent of reconnecting with Sophie (Jessica Biel, redeeming herself from London) -- even though she was now engaged to be married to the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a marriage clearly borne out of social conventions. His reputation as an 'illusionist' begins to take hold, causing an increasing unrest, setting off an investigation initiated by Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who also comes from a humble background but desires a high social status. Tensions escalate as Eisenheim's presence and ability to fall on his feet reaches a breaking point... and causes the disappearance of Sophie. Working to unravel her assassin, Eisenheim takes the ultimate risk in trying to conduct a séance session -- that takes the story back to the beginning scene as Uhl and Leopold look on in anticipation. His success in materializing Sophie and having her point the finger on her murderer will be the turning point in this clever story of the ultimate deceit.Neil Berger has made quite a movie. While the trailer hinted at a lot of action and adventure, this is, like the 'orange tree' which slowly reveals its fruit, a very tricky unfolding of cinematic tricks that takes its time to reach the final push before the cliff. The way it gets there teeters between the detectivesque and the unconventional, a subtle reference to Agatha Christie stories in which all is not what it seems and sometimes people who are caught under the sign of 'underprivileged' must do 'tricks' to retain a little of the pie. An enjoyable ride.",8,1,1,3 December 2006
Children of Men," Tomorrow's Future?
","The world is falling apart thanks to us, no doubt. Society has crumbled down to its core, and to top it all, the ultimate insult -- our very own permutation, our ability to procreate -- has gown down the tubes. The last eighteen-year-old -- humanity's last hope -- has also died, leaving us to hold ourselves in horror and wonder where will We go, where did We go wrong.Theo is an observer to these events and holds no illusion, so it seems. His cousin collects priceless art and also looks the other way. It's only when he is literally shocked into being due to an explosion that occurs only paces away (as a woman tries to grab her own severed arm, a nod to the Guernica that makes its appearance here) and his own kidnapping by an obscure group with even more obscure motives that his own sense of placement in this wreck called Earth comes into progressive being.The nexus to this is one dark girl who holds a deadly secret: she is with child. She is, apparently, the only known woman in quite some time now who is pregnant, and successfully so. The group who has kidnapped Theo are a band of militants protecting the girl -- among them Theo's former wife Julian who informs him about the 'Human Project', an organization which may be humankind's last chance before total annihilation. Their task is simple: escort this girl to the 'Human Project' before others with less noble intentions will lay claim on her.I've always preferred this type of science-fiction over the fairy-tale, comic-book type where worlds are at war and spaceships travel to Far, Far Away (with notable exceptions being Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE HITCH-HIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY). Because a story set in the future, with 'futuristic elements' needs to appeal to a reader or viewer set in the now, it has to accommodate itself to what we know, what we can feel and sense, what we see every day, the familiar. This world, the world of 2027, looks very much like today -- maybe a bit of an advance here and there -- but is virtually a carbon-copy of what we know and see as today. It could even be argued that nothing has changed because we've stopped to reproduce, so technology has also ceased. Decadence rules supreme, a world gone to pot. We've created this for ourselves and now we're wringing our hands and blowing things up because all hope is lost and the government (whatever remains of it) and renegade organizations have taken their own version of action which constricts freedom to its bare essentials. A group of people decide to stand on their own and face the possibility of self-destruction in the name of saving one person who is the One Person who can save us all. This premise makes for a compelling tale.Alfonso Cuaron avoids making Americanized heroes out of his characters. Because this is a story set in the dark, Theo is not a particularly inviting character (and Clive Owen is the perfect actor to play him with his dark looks, which hint at menace and possible betrayal). He doesn't seem to care much for anything, until he gets a glimpse of this girl in all her nakedness, and slowly realizes that within this group there are interests that may turn her into a circus freak. The time that Cuaron takes to really shape Theo is priceless, because there isn't a single person who would suddenly jump at the idea of becoming someone's savior and protector, without some serious transformations. Theo's is, needless to say, gradual, but no less potent.Likewise, neither of the supporting characters feel too unbelievable: Julianne Moore's character, while being well-meaning, is not a strong person. Chiwetel Ejiofor also comes across as misguided, with deadly consequences. Michael Caine is the neo-hippie who has stopped looking at reality, and longs for That Time When. And last but not least, the one with the almost thankless role -- Claire Hope-Ashitey -- holds her own in a role which gets stronger and more determined to find her own footing despite the circumstances which grow increasingly dire.",10,2,8,8 June 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Another Subtle Story by Clint Eastwood
","Three people carrying their own injuries and baggage meet and form an unlikely friendship that slowly becomes familial. Frankie is a man who has lived his entire life in the service of boxing but for reasons left unknown, has an estranged relationship with his daughter, so he has little else to do but be at the boxing gym and train. Eddie is one of his better boxers, a quiet man who can still throw a punch, and who lost an eye in an ill-fated match. Though these two men have a close-knit friendship Frankie still bears tremendous guilt over Eddie's loss. And now, a girl of all people -- Maggie -- wants Frankie to train her. She has nothing going for her, she knows it, and boxing is a way out. While at first Frankie sees no future for her -- she's 31 and has no experience -- he gives in and decides to train her to become the best female fighter ever... until tragedy arrives and gives their lives an unexpected left turn that will change them forever.What could have been a feminist's answer to ROCKY becomes something different, revelatory. Clint Eastwood, a film director that chooses to direct his films in a deliberate pace more akin to late-night jazz, takes F. X Toole's short story and re-shapes it into visual poetry that unfolds into a tight tapestry which by the end of the film will have stirred many emotions with nary a manipulative hand in sight. Clint Eastwood finds a quiet note with his performance as Frankie, the man who could have been a curmudgeon but becomes a surrogate father to Maggie. His final words to her, in Celtic, are whispered in such a fashion, yet convey an immense gravity. Maggie herself is a complicated character: her life is boxing, she has become to symbolize the sport, and in doing so she's achieved so much in a world where all she would have been is white trash. She has a family who thumbs their noses at her career yet want her money. However, she is not an aggressive woman. If anything, she is polite, humble, respectful even when she shouldn't be. Hilary Swank strikes every note in her own rendition of the character: a soft spoken fighter who is faced with a horrific turn of events and must relinquish her love of sports. Morgan Freeman's performance is also of note, mainly because much of it happens off-screen: his measured voice, the one who tells the story, evolves into one who brings much needed closure later on.I felt that the film spoke to me for most of its run. Maggie's story was especially compelling (even if a little predictable) but what resonated with me were the reactions of Eddie and Frankie who have less 'action' and more 'reflection'. This is a much better film than MYSTIC RIVER in the way that much of the focus is on the three leads' bonding as a quasi-family in a world that doesn't care about people like them. It takes its time, then captures your full attention, and before you know it, you are immersed in these three lives because these are people you could meet in your lifetime. And that makes a great film, especially when about the little people who are looking for that special place to live out their final years.",10,23,35,30 January 2006
Garden State," In the Waiting Line
","GARDEN STATE has an unsettling opening scene. Passengers aboard a flight that is going terrifically wrong -- bound to crash as a matter of fact -- screaming, crying, the flight attendant desperate to regain control even when it's clear she might fail, oxygen masks dropping like ripe fruit asking to be picked. A young woman clutches a baby to our left of the screen, and an older woman seen to our right is also in those horrific moments of hysteria. A young man, though, smack in the middle, does nothing, says nothing, but looks straight ahead, eyes a blank.Of course, this is a dream. No such thing is occurring, and even when it could signify the terror aboard a doomed flight in the wake of 9-11 sensibilities and the current release of UNITED 93 at the Tribeca Film Festival. But the young man seen in this dream sequence awakens to an empty room, lying in bed in a stupor, ignoring his father's message (not for the first time). His mother has died, the message says. There must be some action to be taken.Andrew Largeman, the man in the dream, the man in his own dream, caught in his own world and unable to be quite there for the people around him. Much of the movie debates on where he as a man in his late twenties is going: true, he's becoming a rising success in the acting world, but as a person, he's incomplete. Zach Braff, who plays a hilarious clown on TV's 'Scrubs' which has been on the air for five years, does a muted interpretation of Largeman. He makes Largeman a shy, soft-spoken guy whom you would probably pass by the street and not notice his presence. Although, thankfully for him, someone does: a young girl who lives in her own awkward sense of freedom named Sam.Here is where the movie goes into self-conscious cuteness and throws a cursory nod to films like THE GRADUATE. While there are no Mrs. Robinsons to be found here (except in the role Jean Smart plays, but she's only in the movie for about five minutes of screen time and is never to be seen again), Sam has a lot of Elaine in her, but with an MTV feel. She's a free spirit, she loves a group called The Shin, she expresses herself as if she were from her own world, and sure enough -- she also brings life into the lifeless personality of Largeman. Natalie Portman makes this a unique role, though: there is a quirkiness about her that belies a tremendous sensibility which works for the role even when the role, somehow similar to the one Kirsten Dunst played in ELIZABETHTOWN, can be annoying.GARDEN STATE is also given a look that feels smarter than it is, but this is clever directing, camera angles, style over substance, and honest acting from even the actors in small roles. I have a sneaking feeling this got better reviews than it should have, more so because it's Zach Braff's debut film and while its pacing is a little choppy and there are one too many scenes of overall 'cleverness', and completely cops out at the end without a moment's transition, it's a good watch, entertaining, sensitive, and I hope there will be more to come from Braff.",7,9,14,26 April 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," When You Don't Want the Traditional Christmas Movie.
","Thank God for stop-motion animation and the creative genius that is Tim Burton because any other technique would have diminished its surrealistic landscape. But, however kid-friendly THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas appears, this is a somewhat disturbing tale that children under the age of ten may not like because of some of its subject matter, specifically a scene in which Santa Claus gets tortured by the Boogeyman and children have a frightening experience with Christmas presents that turn deadly.Relying heavily on HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas, the story tells of how Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown is in a rut because every Halloween is the same old thing. By accident he stumbles onto what seems to be a portal embedded unto a tree which lands him in magical Christmastown -- a place which enchants him, a place where 'Sandy Claws' is revered as its gift-giver. Here he gets an epiphany of an idea: he decides that he wants to celebrate Christmas the Halloween way, all in good spirit, and decides to kidnap Santa Claus, but Sally, the rag doll who loves him, has a strong feeling that this will not turn out well and must find a way to stop him, particularly when Oogie Boogie, the Boogeyman, enters the scene with nasty intentions.This is, quite simply, a beautiful film despite its dark and borderline disturbing tone which arrive late into the story once Jack Skellington decides to go on his frightful crusade to bring Halloween into Christmas unto an unsuspecting world. However, the film is really in good cheer and even a ghoul as mean as Oogie Boogie proves to be quite harmless. I do believe, though, this is a film to be watched closely and with a child spirit in order to appreciate its technical wizardry: Jack Skellington's eyes say it all: when has a skeleton looked so childlike and full of wonder? And who but a child could create the havoc stemming from a prank instead from meanness? Like I said -- this is a stunning film, and one the family can view on not one but two holiday seasons. If you like your Christmas a little iconoclastic and retch at the thought of singing another Christmas carol, this is the film for you.",10,25,32,10 January 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The Media Vs. Senator McCarthy
","One of the most peculiar aspects of George Clooney's film GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK is how despite its textured black and white cinematography it is also one of the most audio-friendly movies of the recent times. Situated in at the dawn of television not as an alternative to radio but a force to be reckoned with, one of the stand-out elements within its structure is how easy and multi-faceted it sounds, rather than looks. That more than likely is due to its tight script and the handling of dialog -- there is a strong influence of CITIZEN KANE in how these characters, people who work in the media, work with one another, much like in the scenes involving the reporters investigating Xanadu's deceased inhabitant at the end -- faceless, but great to listen to. If a movie can be compelling without having to be seen, it makes for a great experience.Listening to David Strathairn virtually channeling even the most trivial nuances of Edward R. Murrow in his speeches -- and there are several key speeches interspersed throughout the film -- is a wonder. There is a sneaky way in how he approaches his characterization. It's not a homage or an imitation in any way and has a hint of the sly entertainer Murrow tended to be while imparting the news and his comments about the current events. Overconfident, impeccably dressed, with sleepy eyes, a cigarette perched like an advertisement in his fingers and slicked back hair, Strathairn makes Murrow look exactly how he looked -- like a smoldering Cary Grant, circa 1940, sober, letting you know what he thought about Things. He could almost be the star of his own movie, and he behaved as such in the news world. Murrow was a man who garnered respect and authority and Strathairn in his breakout, standout performance, brings is all out, even when we never see Murrow's private life.His notorious battle with Senator McCarthy is the center of the plot of GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK. Had it not been for his steadfast confidence to face-off McCarthy -- a man of no importance wielding power where he had none, and a man who ultimately destroyed lives and careers, such as Don Hollenbeck, though pressure and the threat of exposure -- this country still might be under the fears of expressing itself, of having freedom of speech and of beliefs. True, not much has actually changed when you look at it -- the pressure is still there, but more subtle -- but at least there was one man who had enough material between his legs to confront this insanity head on.A side story gets equal treatment: Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson play spouses who have to hide this to everyone at work due to a work policy. Apparently unrelated to the plot, this actually is quite close to the state of the union back then. Clandestine marriage is given a treatment as if it were sympathizing with the Reds, and the way both Downey Jr. and Clarkson talk to each other even in the privacy of their own home is a sly indicator of the Big Brother mentality that was prevalent in the Red Scare. When it's revealed to them at the end of the movie that all this time it had been known to the entire staff that they were married, their firing comes as an added irony -- witness the many actors who lost their jobs because they were believed to be Communists. But, at least, and as Clarkson blithely says, 'It was fun while it lasted.' Not many actors, directors, screenwriters, producers, and the like can say that.Another irony is that of George Clooney. An actor who began in television, he's now definitely distanced himself from his roles in ER and it seems that it was a thousand years ago when he was on that series melting the hearts of female (and male) viewers. Now he brings a movie about the media industry and news reporters. A great reversal of roles, and a great finished product.",10,0,1,7 April 2006
Saw II," Jigsaw's Back!
","We could have seen this one coming for miles before the brown stuff hit the fan. Once the success of SAW was declared, a sequel was already in the makes before the first one had even time to exit theaters, make it into our living rooms, and sort-of scare us with these elaborate machinations Jigsaw has a knack of coming up with.However, this is not a re-hash of the original. Well, it is, but in a totally different way. Where in the first one, two men chained to a wall, there was this sketchy feel of a plot that could not outlast its 100 minutes of duration, and skipped into some completely implausible grounds, the second one has a tighter plotting, meaner settings, and is actually better than the first because of that.So we get Jigsaw, also known as John Parker (Tobin Bell), up close, looking quite frail but no less sinister or deadly -- a geriatric Hannibal Lecter. He has his reasons for why he does these things. He also has his eye on a certain detective (Donnie Wahlberg) who has done a couple of Really Bad Things in the past, but now is caught in a tight jam when lo and behold, his son becomes one of several of Jigsaw's newest victims, and may not have much longer to live because seeping in through the vents is the gas sarin, known for its rather impolite use in Japan's subways some years back by members of Aum Shinrikyo.SAW moves fast and is fast. At less time, it has to in order to set the stage, introduce us to the characters -- many of those who we never get to know past the surface, and one who returns from the first -- and stages this supremely perverse, live video game in which any false move could literally blow an eye (and your brains) out. The camera is as agitated and deft in shifting from the room where Jigsaw is being kept to the computers monitoring these captives in another place, and I loved the opening sequence where one man gets into such a predicament that any form of escape is virtually impossible, particularly because a key piece (pun intended) is lodged behind his eye.Sadistic and loving every moment of it, SAW doesn't ever go into overdrive or collapse near its end, although with a cast as large as it has, it's only fitting that there be numerous deaths, none of them peaceful and filled with sights of angels and lollipops. SAW 3? Definitely, and due out later this year for your (twisted) view.",8,2,3,5 May 2006
Big Fish," Lyrical.
","Tim Burton continues to demonstrate his maturation as a director despite having a soft spot for the fantastic and the weird.It's probably not a surprise that this film would receive generally mixed-to-good reviews but was virtually ignored by the Academy. It's a little too visually eccentric for its own good and that somehow translates as a film that uses beautiful images as its means to tell a story, and that in 2003 was not quite the type of movies that were being told with the exception of LORD OF THE RINGS which in itself is a triumph of effects serving a story, albeit deeply rooted in fantasy, but not too dissimilar to this one.Tall tales are a part of Americana. Here they come under the guise of hilarious situations and extremely poignant, compassionate moments. Essentially, this is a humanist fable dressed in deep, poetic magic realism, because it's the story of a man who is dying and who has one last thing to do.This man is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), and he's over the years become estranged from his son William (Billy Crudup) because William has gotten increasingly jaded from these tall stories Ed tells him over and over again. We can call it the syndrome of someone who has lost touch with his inner self and has accommodated himself to the norms of Society and what It considers 'normal' and 'acceptable.'In his last days he recollects his memories from his much younger days (played by Ewan McGregor) when he hadn't found his calling until he came across a witch (Helena Bonham Carter) who foretold him his future. From then on he had what can be called a 'hell of a life,' going from seemingly implausible adventure to another. These exaggerated tales infuriates William until a crucial event forces him to acknowledge the essence of the matter -- Ed Bloom's reality -- and in one overwhelming tour de force of direction, William (clumsily at first, but then more sure of himself) creates his own storytelling, which I won't talk about. Suffice it is to say that its transition into reality is one of the most beautiful and moving sequences I've seen.This is by far one of the best films Tim Burton has made in his curriculum of offbeat films. Solid performances are in leaps and bounds from the main actors to minor players -- the sad expression of a circus clown who has to shoot Ed because the wolf he is about to kill is actually Amos Calloway is a haunting shot, for example. Jessica Lange's quiet scene in a bathtub filled with water, hugging Ed and weeping. Alison Lohman caught in a frozen moment of time, which enhances her beauty. The moment when William re-enacts his own story and 'carries' Ed out of the hospital which segues into the otherworldly, emotional climax. A beautiful ensemble piece, with otherworldly images, this is only second to LORD OF THE RINGS, a distant cousin, in absolute beauty and simplicity of its message.",10,50,63,10 May 2005
Quiz Show," The Reality of Game Shows.
","A harsh look at a scandal that hit the TV industry while it was relatively still in its infancy, QUIZ SHOW tells the parallel stories of Herbie Stempel, Charles Van Doren, and Dick Goodwin, three people caught in a triangle of hypocrisy and appearances from opposite sides of the coin. The feeding of the right answers to both Stempel and Van Doren on the game show '21' did not bring the downfall to its paternal network, but made those who learned of this examine the prejudices concerning who should be on top and who should not and sadly did not exonerate those who were behind the scandal. That Stempel, one of 21's first 'victims', Jewish, should not be of what would be considered a man of 'privileged' upbringing but Van Doren, handsome, WASP-ish, successful -- a university professor -- should just hits harder even today to the kind of people network television prefers. When we see that Ken Jennings, a milquetoast white man, is allowed to make so much money on 'Jeapoardy', we question the credibility of his win, and it extends even beyond game shows: 'ethnic' groups are still looking for their audience on a television mainly 'white' in nature, and only a smattering of shows have included all racial groups in ensemble shows that have managed, through some shrewd writing and marketing, to survive.",9,14,17,23 April 2005
Annie Hall," Landmark Storytelling from Allen's Creative Mind
","At the time, no one had done this: tell a story in the manner that Woody Allen did. Even though many films up until then were talky, with minimal action, with the exception of CITIZEN KANE, nothing of the sort prepared the audience at the time for what they were witnessing: scenes that introduced dialog between two actors much before they actually showed on screen. Scenes in which actors interacted with the past as if it were the present. Scenes in which actors who aren't in the same frame even when they are on screen talk to each other. Scenes in which what the characters are saying does not match their thought bubbles and we are privy to their thoughts. The discussion of an intellectual's work which suddenly produces the said individual, among many more.ANNIE HALL is a unique film that still looks fresh, even when the style in itself is very 70s. This is a story of a breakup told in a non-linear pattern, showing how these two disparate yet similar people -- Alvy Singer and Annie Hall -- came together, shared their neuroses, went through hilarious times and then went into the slow plateau that became their eventual separation. This is not the kind of story that Hollywood likes to tell and it's quite admirable that Allen was able to not only get away with it but to walk away with the major awards (as well as give then girlfriend Diane Keaton her own Best Actress award) because this being such an intellectual film and not one where the actors all look glamorous, it broke new grounds for a novel way of presenting a film.Groundbreaking is the definite term here. Had there been no ANNIE HALL, there would have never been ALLY MACBEAL or SEX AND THE CITY, two successful sitcoms that features inner dialog, people talking directly to the camera (and therefore winking at the audience), fantasy sequences, and modern views of how people react to each other. Balancing slapstick with drama, it is also one of the saddest comedies to ever been made and anyone who has seen the final sequence -- which plays out what the film has mentioned all along, that this is their breakup -- knows the heartbreak that unfolds over Diane Keaton's haunting vocals. One of the ten most influential movies of all time.",10,79,107,23 January 2006
Blood Diamond," A Retrospective
","Personal, political, and exploitation/commercial interests clash in this straightforward adventure film, Ed Zwick's aptly titled BLOOD DIAMOND. While this title might be misleading, making unsuspecting viewers believe this is closer to a Indiana Jones' type adventure complete with human sacrifices, the entire scope of the plot revolves around a rare blood diamond -- a stone of a pinkish color used to finance terrorist organizations, hence the 'blood' portion of its moniker -- that has immeasurable value. And sure enough, sacrifices of a very human sort abound left and right, most notably in Solomon Vandy's plight to retrieve his son who in a mêlée has been kidnapped by a militant group and used as a child soldier, and the only person he can trust is the very untrustworthy Rhodesian merchant Danny Archer who wants the stone as his ticket out of Africa and will help Solomon find his missing family... for a price.BLOOD DIAMOND can be summed up as an adventure movie that has a powerful, symbolic message at its core -- that of the trials and tribulations that the African people have had to endure in the name of profit and greed. Djimon Hounsou tackles a clichéd role with an immense believability -- it's very moving, even gripping, to see what he has to go through to get something as simple as his family -- and especially his now child soldier of a son -- back. When he cries out that he cannot live without his family, knowing he was supposed to have protected them and failed, you believe it, and you root for him and hope that Archer does not betray this absolute trust Solomon has placed in Archer's hands. You want to see the moment when he becomes reunited with his son and gets back at the man who took him away in the name of this cursed stone.Leonardo diCaprio has a tricky role to play, being frankly amoral in the Bogart tradition. He looks even more rugged than he did in THE DEPARTED which helps him bring forth credibility into his portrayal of Danny Archer. Jennifer Connelly, always an actress I love to see in the small roles she undertakes, makes a lot more out of a role that could have been very throwaway. She has a great scene where she uses her wiles and her ability as a photographer to get the two men out of a very risky situation, and a rather moving scene towards the end, but the film has little use for her, being focused on the terse relation between Archer and Solomon.BLOOD DIAMOND is terribly old-fashioned, alas. It's not a bad thing: sometimes a movie benefits by going back in time and exploring the values that were prevalent then. Because of an existing conflict involving these blood diamonds, the events of the late Nineties served as a platform for the story being told here. If it weren't for the crystal-clear cinematography, it wouldn't be odd to see Bogart, or Grant, for example, in the role of Danny Archer, and/or Ingrid Bergman or Deborah Kerr or even Barbara Stanwyck in the supporting role of Maddy Bowen which Connelly plays. But, not to digress, old-fashioned or not, this is a fine adventure with a strong humanity at its center.",9,0,0,2 June 2007
The Graduate," Youth and Alienation in the Late 60s
","It's funny how THE GRADUATE has become to symbolize a dissatisfied generation. Benjamin Braddock, the hero, the boy who came home flooded in early achievements, the boy with promise, walking around in a complete daze while his very suburban parents coo and squeal like gushing teenagers about his success and predict more to come. Benjamin Braddock, the boy who has been given an abstract prediction of the future by a family friend in the film's landmark quote: 'Plastics.' But will he act on this word? Will he act on anything? This is the crux of the matter: Benjamin, it seems, is one of those early over-achievers fulfilling other people's dreams, while he basks under the sun, literally suspended in his parents' pool, caught between security, complacency, and the uncertain future.The thing is, Benjamin is virgin to life itself. Forget that a certain Mrs. Robinson has gone into infamy as the older woman who seduced a boy half her age for unexplained reasons other than a perverse, predatory attraction which hints at matters left unexplored not only between the two -- their affair seems to happen with the passion of lovers engaged in the mechanics of sex. Her appearance in the movie, so aggressive it almost emasculates Benjamin, is a suffocating reminder of those Oedipal ties to the past -- the female womb (notice the physical resemblance between Mrs. Robinson and Mrs. Braddock) -- that demand dependence to its whims and decries any chance of true rebellion and severance.Mrs. Robinson is THE GRADUATE's most interesting character. In fact, her villainy should be taken into note because she literally does two things: robs Benjamin from his cradle in what can only constitute as sexual harassment, and by hooking him onto her she also makes him the fall guy for no reason than her own empty life, her shattered dreams, and a need for repetition going down to the next generation. For the most of her initial appearances, she is seen speaking in haughty, sophisticated tones. She looks down at Benjamin, whom she has chosen as her boy toy. He is to fall for her allure: indeed, she is very beautiful and self-possessed. It's only when the focus threatens to leave her high and dry because of suburban complacency and shifts to Elaine, her daughter, that her true self comes out.Elaine is also an interesting character but for reasons that have less to do with her presence as a sacrificial lamb late in the movie. I believe she and Benjamin are little more than pawns for their parents' self-congratulation as if they were marveling at how wonderful their children turned out. Her affection towards Benjamin is weakly displayed, and makes her horror at learning of his affair with her mother the only flaw. I felt that while she did like Ben, she hadn't precisely fallen in love with him to be that hurt. Also, her reaction to her mother's betrayal is never seen so it must be imagined, and when she finally does take the stand against her marriage of sacrifice/convenience, it looks more like a need for a satisfying conclusion.However, THE GRADUATE, while it does satisfy, it also deceives. What awaits Ben and Elaine as they ride off together in this bus? They are separate even in the end, which leads me to believe that they've got even more problems ahead than merging into a unit. With so much shared personal history together I can't see them maintaining a happy end -- but since the story embraces its own iconoclastic conformity in having Ben get the girl his parents wanted him to marry in the first place, a wobbly life together is what they can face. After all, they're barely kids escaping their homes and about to face the real world for the first time. No film had told this story about leaving the nest for good up until then.This is a fantastic film that broke the standards of transition from scene to scene, has that haunting score by Simon and Garfunkel, and has incredible, hallmark performances. Anne Bancroft, not a glamorous woman, is as mentioned before the film's rotten heart concealed in that husky voice, those dark eyes, and that aura of pure, frigid sex. She's a reminder of the perversions that can arise when you do not know yourself and allow a mistake to taint your life. Dustin Hoffman, also not a handsome matinée idol and having a frog-like voice, lent a degree of credibility to his character who could (at the time) be your next-door neighbor and is great in showing how displaced and limp his character is against what a world wants from him, how the world sees him, and how the two women in his life affect him. Katharine Ross also has a difficult role: her character is less defined and has to convince that she's about to 'graduate' from being a girl and becoming a woman in love for the first time.",10,4,7,21 May 2006
Pride & Prejudice," The Movie Version
","Whenever there is a version of a novel that has come to be accepted as the definitive one, making a new one brings the usual baggage as to 'will it live up to the expectations' or 'will the lead actors symbolize the characters in the book', among other 'will there-won't there' questions and people will make the inevitable comparisons, if at all for the sake of the comparison itself.On having read Jane Austen's novel repeatedly since 1985 and knowing it by heart, and not having seen the miniseries starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle (and half of England's top actors), I was open to this interpretation, knowing it would be much shorter and that there would be the inevitable excising of plot elements in order to maintain interest in the principal story.The story is exactly the same. The Bennets learn that Netherfield is to be let at last to an eligible bachelor, and all five daughters rejoice at the thought of meeting such a single bachelor. Having no sons, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have nothing to offer their daughters except an uncertain future, and at a time when women were not professionals and were married off in a hurry before they were even 20, security does become the principal issue not just within the Bennets but the Lucases.But this is a story of romantic suspense in the classical form. The meeting of two people who whether they admit it or not, are very similar to each other, who due to circumstances look at these social gatherings with a turned-up nose, who due to misunderstandings and not really knowing each other come to repel each other while thinking about each other at every passing moment: such is the thing of romantic suspense at its purest. Austen, whether she was aware of structure or not (and I have reason to believe she did), knew she had to place the moment of crisis exactly in the middle of the novel, and in the film it occurs just a little past mid-point. Joe Wright brings a more turbulent feel to PRIDE & PREJUDICE -- many have said it's a blend between Austen's novel and Emily Bronte's 'Wuthering Heights' but I think not. Only because Darcy and Elizabeth's scenes are taken out of their tidy settings and out into the open where mist and rain are ever present, and in one scene Darcy is seen riding a horse at full speed ahead, does not constitute an imitation of Bronte's novel. It would have, however, made for a very boring film to set it perpetually indoors; indeed, Austen has quite a number of external scenes, and even when she rarely mentions the weather (except when Jane Bennet makes her trek to Netherfield and falls ill there) it doesn't mean it doesn't occur.It's also why the moment of release, when Elizabeth has undergone so dramatic a change, looks best at dawn, with Darcy walking in his nightclothes, all masculine longing, coming for one last time to talk to her even though he knows her answer will be yes. This specific scene would have been awful indoors, and notice Matthew MacFadyen's piercing blue eyes telling -- pouring -- emotions about to be released once Keira Knightley's luminous face faces his, and wordlessly accepts him. Just like in the novel, their declaration of love is one paragraph and as emotional as 'Wuthering Heights'. When Jane Austen writes, 'They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, to pay attention to any other objects,' I imagined this to be pretty much as it occurs in the film. It is one of the most emotional climaxes in the history of romantic dramas and says so much more than the most dizzy, violent depiction of romantic love from writers of her generation.PRIDE & PREJUDICE should be a staple for writers of romance. In keeping the two leads within touching distance from each other, not quite getting what the other is about, there is a sense of urgency -- we want them to make it into each other's arms, even if it happens in the last page (or the last scene, this being film). This being one of the most well-constructed novels of romance and one who gains more weight with every passing decade, it has also embedded itself into modern culture. It wouldn't be hard to find references of this type of story in SEX AND THE CITY, for example, in which Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big, two polar opposites, meet, fall for each other, then argue, then get separated, meet again, can't get along, can't understand each other, go on their separate ways until Mr. Big undergoes such a change towards the end of the series run that when he comes for her, we absolutely believe it and want him to rush after her, snatch her up, and bring her back home where she belongs.Definitive version? Watch for yourself. But it's always best to read and enjoy the language, the texture, the characters, the urgency of the Bennet's situation, laughing at even the ridiculous characters, cheering when the deeper plots get resolved down to its epilogue when even Lady Catherine de Bourgh -- a relatively powerless dowager -- has to relent to her nephew's wife. Boy meets girl, loses girl, wins girl back has never looked so well as it does here.",10,16,26,12 April 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Would You Erase Your Mind to Kill the Heart?
","That is the question underlying this entire movie, since two-thirds of it is the process of elimination of a man's memories in order to forget the person who caused him some hurt in the recent past.This man is Joel Parish, played (or underplayed) by Jim Carrey who on a train ride to Long Island meets Clementine Krucyzinski (Kate Winslet). Both strike up an uneasy conversation: she being brash, aggressive, he being almost demure. There seems to be something there lingering between them, some connection even when they're totally different, and later we learn, when their affair ends, that she has decided to erase her memories of him and move on, which prompts Joel to do the same.Except he decides he doesn't want to at the last minute.So begins a roller-coaster ride where he tries to salvage anything he can as one by one his memories are being zapped away from him, and to see how he goes from one to the other, often with the surreal assistance of Winslet herself (as she is an integral part of his memories), we definitely get bombarded with frenetic images of Joel's mind literally coming apart at the seams, but we never forget that this is his heart that we're talking about, and in a small performance, Kirsten Dunst reveals just how heartless the procedure can be in a revelatory moment, one that makes us totally root for this odd couple right down to the last scene. One of the most original stories which hit theatres in 2004 and which deservedly won its Best Original Screenplay Oscar even if it lost in acting categories, this is the Movie of 2004.",10,33,49,22 April 2005
The World's Fastest Indian," A Remarkable Man: Burt Munro
","There comes a time when an actor who has been known for giving performance after performance that has gone into the levels of classic acting, chooses a project that is smaller, less showy, but equally (or even more) rewarding than if he were involved in an Award-studded affair. Sir Anthony Hopkins is one of those rare actors, who throughout his celebrated, nearly 40 years in the business, has given so many indelible characterizations -- particularly come the Nineties when he immortalized himself as Hannibal Lecter -- that now, as an older man, he's chosen this unassuming story of an equally unassuming man much stronger than what he initially appears.Burt Munro wouldn't be the type of man you would consider pleasant to be around with. Living in Invercargill, New Zealand, he's fooled around with his favorite motorcycle, whom he's dubbed the Indian (hence the title of the movie), for the past 40 odd-years or so, and has a heart condition that might make you wonder if he weren't better off taking a break. Of course, that is something he won't settle for, and later in the story one man calls him the most determined person he's ever seen. That this minor character does so a world away in Bonneville, and that Munro has gone through a wallop of misadventures just to get there and race his bike, speaks pages about the man.Much of Munro's life can be researched through the Internet, which makes this a de-facto biopic of a remarkable old fellow, soft spoken, a little dotty, who clearly loves his bike and on his way to race it meets the most interesting variety of characters this way of Weirdsville. Hopkins is the perfect actor to play Munro because he essentially sheds any vestige of his personality and literally becomes this dizzy old man who has a dream and follows it. He's given some pretty extraordinary support by Chris Williams as a transvestite named Tina Washington, Diane Ladd as a widow, Saginaw Grant as an Indian who helps him along the way, Christopher Lawford as a man who somehow believes Munro is the real thing (despite his clear dependence on heart medication), Patrick Flueger as a soldier who shares some stories with Munro, and little Aaron Murphy who plays Tom, the neighbor's son, who might as well be a surrogate boy to Munro. Bruce Greenwood, Paul Rodriguez, and Jessica Cauffiel have small parts which round up the cast.THE WORLD'S FASTEST Indian is a beautiful movie that went unnoticed (as many high-quality films do when released in limited movie screens) earlier this year, but deserves to be seen and enjoyed for its honesty. Some of the vignettes seem a little too much for the viewer who wants Munro to get to his final destination and make magic with the force of speed, but when you have a project you believe in -- as Munro did, with his precious bike -- you wind up with a end result that is transcendental from its material. Roger Donaldson clearly believes in this man, and has brought forth a truly moving story.",10,0,0,9 August 2006
Saw," Takashi Miike and Giallo Films Channeled by way of David Fincher
","Once the extremely improbable ending comes any viewer will feel sucker-punched in what I believe resembles any David Fincher film, most notably SE7EN, with a Takashi Miike spin. Which doesn't detract that for the most part it's claustrophobic, depressing, bleak, and filled with a growing sense of stomach-turning dread as the omnipresence of an unseen killer comes through, making us known anyone could be killed at any given moment, if his plans are not carried out to his satisfaction. Plans that largely include doing something unspeakable to solve a puzzle and thus, be set free.The problem with SAW its in the script itself, with plot holes galore, and character motivations/reactions completely unclear. The two main characters undergo the suffering victims are meant to and do so down to the end, but the supporting characters fair poorly. Danny Glover's character goes through being a broken man through the death of his partner to being badly obsessed with the Jigsaw Killer, and not once could I believe he would do most of the things he does throughout the film, like not requesting backup as he enters a deserted warehouse (in a flashback sequence), or allowing a clearly wimpy killer to get the best of him later on. Monica Potter plays Cary Elwes' wife who witnesses the killer point a gun to her daughter's temple while listening to her frantic heartbeats, but when she gets the chance to give him his just desserts she fails to do so because she was on the phone with her imprisoned husband. (It was a 'Huh?' moment where motherhood somehow didn't enter into the plot logic, but then again, not many did.)Another thing which works against it is the fact that that for a genuinely interesting and even innovative premise like this one, SAW would be best as a film 20 - 30 minutes shorter with an equally shorter time span (the plot extends for an approximate five hours from start to climax), and then would the shocking twist at the end make some sense. As it is, it has the look and feel of a video game in which the menacing growl of a voice orders the victims through audio/videotape to commit a horrible and nearly impossible act in order to survive, with some rapid-fire MTV editing to add to the viewer's disorientation and Giallo overtones (which do work here if you think of Dario Argento's PROFONDO ROSSO or Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE). Here's hoping James Wan will make a much better film as he does have an overall good technique with his visuals.",6,35,53,7 March 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick and the Art of Violence.
","Stanley Kubrick has a way of telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them, or going into exaggeration. In DR STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE THE BOMB violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song 'We'll Meet Again' lovingly played in the background. In 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.Alex DeLarge is the leader of a band of 'droogs' who move from location to location terrorizing their victims, putting them under outrageous acts of violence. When two of his 'droogs' refuse to follow Alex's path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them, until an act of reversal turns against Alex and he is brought down by the medical industry who decides to 'reform' his heretofore sociopathic tendencies. One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness. Karma is a bitch.Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has a look and feel completely out of its time, closer to sometime in the future, and its torture sequence in which Alex is regenerated also looks straight out of a science fiction movie. However, this is not a science fiction film. It's actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it's something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted. It's this approach that makes the work the product of a master of direction -- it can be seen multiple times and every time a different perspective arises, and all one can be left with is with the notion that this is pure, ultra-modern cinema.",10,99,136,6 November 2005
Pretty Woman," Romance as Fantasy
","Garry Marshall is something of an anomaly in the film business: his movies tend to eschew the extreme, 'quien-es-mas-macho' bravado found in the works of many of his peers (Martin Scorsese and David Mamet, to name a few), and in turn they embrace the type of sentimental maudlin that sums up the term 'chick-flick' with pride. And he's clearly getting away with it -- the only other high-profile directors to sculpt their entire careers on the plight of the female sex have been Pedro Almodovar, Douglas Sirk, and George Cukor, all in their distinctive directing styles. All the rest have occasionally dabbed in high-powered drama, but never as soapy and drenched in Lifetime television glitter as Garry Marshall has.PRETTY WOMAN continued his venture into the world of opposites: here he goes for a modern take on MY FAIR LADY, itself a version of PYGMALION, and amps up the fairytale aspect to eleven until there is really nowhere else to take the concept, already convoluted to begin with. Richard Gere plays a high-powered executive who crosses paths with (the unrealistically named) Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts in her first starring role) and takes her in as his companion (i. e. escort, kept lady, etc.). This of course comes with his re-imaging of her: he gives her a massive wardrobe, polishes her act, and transforms her into a quasi-society woman. It doesn't come with a few set of complications, one involving Jason Alexander's lecherous character, but these are less of interest to the focus of the story, already deep into establishing what Roberts and Gere are to each other.PRETTY WOMAN has become a classic in its own right even when there are people who hate it and call it dated, or downright misogynistic due to the fact that purportedly it is 'telling' people that 'a woman needs a man to survive.' I for one, don't think so. It would mean that every movie made in the vein of the aforementioned MY FAIR LADY or PYGMALION is a blast against women who are objectified to the point where they aren't even human anymore, and that is plain ridiculous. PRETTY WOMAN is romantic fantasy, no more no less, and is meant to be enjoyed as such. Nothing that happens here would happen in real life -- as a matter of fact, big-named male execs and celebrities have been on the wrong side of publicity once their liaisons with hookers have been publicized. Vivian isn't even a true person, but Julia Roberts plays her as if she were made of sheer velvet and longing and innocence. To see her getting her revenge on the snobbish women of that Rodeo Drive store is a hoot -- because we've rooted for this character. Again, good storytelling and characterization made into a commercial smash.",8,1,2,9 March 2007
The Descent," Down Into the Bowels of Hell
","One of the aspects I find interesting whenever I read reviews about certain movies is the fact that sometimes I'll see similar terms used to describe them, be it in plot, style, its high quality or dreadful mise en scene. Terms like 'Hitchcockian' have become so intricately linked to a specific style of films the very mention of it brings forth images of a shower, crashing music, thrilling set pieces, blondes in danger, and irresistible suspense.The term that keeps popping up here is 'spelunking'. It has nothing to do with the quality of THE DESCENT, which is high in thrills, but practically everyone seems to be using it like the word's existence depended on it. I dreaded reading any more about this movie because just the thought of viewing that odd word, which sounds like something speed freaks would take in order to come crashing down to a halt (well, at least to me), would make me yip.So let's see: the definition of what it means to 'spelunk' isn't being the action a fat lady takes when she missteps and comes crashing down a flight of stairs, landing in an extremely awkward position somewhere between the radiator and the boiler in the basement. Spelunking (and this, the third time I write it): a person who goes exploring a cave as a hobby. Okay. That being out of the way, I can say I finally know what the hell that strange, whiskery word means, and I can move on into what the movie THE DESCENT is about.So. Six women, of which several have some unfinished business, go into a dark place deep underground. It doesn't bother them in the least that there's a deer with its throat ripped clear off. They want to go exploring and that's that. What they ignore is that -- surprise, surprise -- there's Something Down There, And It Ain't Nice.Neil Marshall has made himself quite a picture with THE DESCENT. He takes an old, old, Really Old premise and making it nearly a war movie where the women are more than ready to do battle instead of do the weak flail of arms and yelling help in the hopes that Prince Charming will come and save them. There isn't a single weak woman in the bunch -- these might as well be Amazons from a different tribe, since the only significant male in the bunch is killed cleanly off during the film's introduction sequence -- itself gruesome as it is brutal and brief. Shauna MacDonald, as the emotionally and mentally frail Sarah, carries the weight of her baggage through the entire run and evolves into quite a character.As for fear factor, THE DESCENT is relentless once it takes off. It creeps and creeps and creeps until what seems to be a hallucination in Sarah's eyes explodes in vicious ferocity. This is a pretty sharp horror movie that is awash in gore and frights and uses them to their full advantage and even when the story moves in flatly predictable ways, you will be on the edge of your seat. A winner and a back-to-basics, with a good dose of Seventies' despair thrown in.",9,2,4,30 May 2007
Inside Man," The Heist With a Trick Up its Sleeve
","Spike Lee wouldn't be the kind of director who would be called on to do this kind of film. INSIDE MAN is more on the vein of the works of David Mamet, who has tackled this genre several time with fairly clever results. However, the story of INSIDE MAN, while on the surface a basic heist inside a bank with all of the elements present, is interested less in the eventual shoot-out between cops, marshals, and the criminals, or even in a deep, co-dependent relationship between the Main Guy and the Main Cop as was the bulk of the story of DIE HARD back in 1988. INSIDE MAN is an excellent crime thriller, a puzzle that practically gives its solution in the way it's own narration evolves, but one that is strong on plot, stronger still on acting, and strongest on its gradual build-up, in which nothing is as it seems at first glance and a group of criminals may have concocted the perfect bank robbery. Clive Owen essays yet another of his dark villains (maybe his own physique is to blame; I can't see him playing a lightweight role in the vein of Cary Grant, there's just something brooding underneath that every so often explodes in dangerous rage, and I've seen it happen since CLOSER). Jodie Foster, cast totally against type, plays a powerful woman who has a degree of mystery about her and who has reached a point in her life where she can make deals with the Devil, call it a monster, and walk out, smiling. Her Madeline White is anything but -- she's a sneering, calculating, bitch with her hands firmly planted in the steering wheel of power -- and it's great to see Foster finally break out of her 'altruistic heroine' or 'victim' role for once! Denzel Washington, however, is the drive of the movie, and practically skips his way through his scenes like it was recess and he was impersonating Shaft -- and his character is given quite the kinky side, a rarity in crime dramas, but a nice touch courtesy of Lee himself. Chiwetel Ejiofor (KINKY BOOTS), Willem Dafoe, and Christopher Plummer have small but noteworthy parts.",10,2,4,18 August 2006
Three Colors: Blue," Liberty as Freefalling Through Life.
","For a film about mourning, there are two moments in Krsyztoff Kielslowski's THREE COLORS: BLUE that seem divorced of anything that is happening at first glance. Both are seen through the impersonal medium of a television. The first occurs early in the film: as she recovers from an automobile accident which claimed the life of her husband, composer Patrice de Courcy, and her daughter Anna, Julie is given access to witness their funeral, but as she turns the channel, there is an image of a man bungee jumping. It will be seen again when Julie visits her mother (played by Emmanuelle Riva) who lives in a home, disconnected from the outside, watching television. This image of a person seen in free-fall against a pale blue sky (blue is indeed prominent in this film) seems to mirror Julie quite well: her loss has given her an empty outlook on life. She wishes to do 'nothing', to just exist, divorced from human contact. However, that same cord which is a life-preserver will eventually pull her back.It's the slow but sure pull of the cord that Kieszlowski wants to tell in this beautiful but tragic story. In Juliette Binoche he has found his muse. With that face that expresses a complex set of emotions and her internalized body language that at times threatens to break through outbursts (as when she plays a piece of the concerto for the unification of Europe her husband was creating and suddenly slams the piano, or when she leaves her house carrying only a box and almost mauls her first against a stone wall). She cannot feel and is trying to make herself do so, but realizes it is better to just be, without ties, love, meaning.BLUE is filled, almost drenched, in subtle meaning which grows stronger at every frame. Kieslowszki's bungee cord begins to make its presence at every subsequent scene. The box Julie is seen carrying contains a mobile which formed a blue sphere -- her only link to her daughter. The musical score, which in one scene she had ordered destroyed, makes its appearance in none other than the streets of Paris under the sad flute of a deadbeat who says, 'We all must hold onto something.' People inevitably come into her life -- for what reason we aren't told up front, but there is the feeling of matters left unresolved and new elements which will force Julie to come full circle and finally open herself to herself.There are three sequences in which Julie immerses herself in water. Water allows herself to go under, to dive into what she has been avoiding for some time now. In one scene, she is seen in a fetal position as if this is a return to her primal state of floating -- free-fall -- and is 'safe'. However, the next-to-last time she swims she is confronted by her new friend and neighbor Lucille (Charlotte Very) who is an exotic dancer working in the red-light district in Paris (note the implicit link to RED) and then she, and we, hear the noise of little children who all jump into the pool dressed in reds and whites which make her instinctively recoil and maybe cry. After all, this is an oblique reference to Anna and she may not be ready for this kind of information. The memories come back (even when we do not see them) and even correlate to a decision to have a neighbor's cat kill a litter or mice in her apartment because she needs complete aloneness.But this will not happen: there are still serious matters which she is about to discover and Lucille, the least involved person in Julie's tragedy but whose progressive insinuation into Julie's life, similar to Valentine's reaching out to the old judge in RED, will be the link to facing them.Music is also an important part of BLUE, and whenever Julie is about to make a decision that will take the story to the next level we hear the haunting Preisner score which permeates the entire movie as its soul. American films don't seem to give music such a prominent position in a film, quite possibly because there is always the element of consumerism that is at the heart of every movie -- even serious films. European films, I've noticed, have a different approach to storytelling. BLUE is a very oblique mystery contained within itself from WHITE and RED, but one that demands listening to as well as subsequent views: it opens and reveals its petals very slowly and contains a surprise at the center of its bud, one that again, American film-makers would not have known how to resolve unless there was some form of catharsis and maybe even violence. Not here: for a movie that gives music and its relation to a truly spellbinding mystery, BLUE and its score are stunning, particularly at its climactic sequence where all of the people Julie has crossed paths with are seen in one last, flowing shot -- Emmanuelle Riva's being the most emotional, seen reflected twice in what can only be a haunting death scene, or is it? -- and returns, full circle, to another reflection of Julie, and Julie herself, open, and weeping in an enigmatic, Mona Lisa smile, free at last.",10,129,147,14 December 2005
The Untouchables," De Palma as Hitchcock and Eisenstein
","Arguably one of Brian de Palma's best films, THE UNTOUCHABLES tells the stories of Al Capone and Elliot Ness, both men who were on the opposite sides of the law during the Prohibition years. With a beginning that literally explodes (and is a homage or rip-off or both to the key scene in Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE), De Palma weaves his tale around the eventual moment these two men's lives will dovetail even when such a thing never happened in reality; however, the story is so well done up until that moment that you walk out of the movie thinking both men had that one moment where they told each other off. And that's again, the power of storytelling -- to tell a story with fictitious elements in a way that will make you believe such a thing has happened. With one of the mose masculine characters ever committed on screen during the Eighties and a readily identifiable screenplay by David Mamet, THE UNTOUCHABLES should have taken Brian De Palma's film career to even higher levels -- more so with Sean Connery's Oscar win -- but somehow his career went on a rapid decline. He went on to direct the awful and chaotic THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, the confusing but intriguing RAISING CAIN, and the so-so CARLITO'S WAY, only to make a slight rebound with MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and SNAKE EYES before plummeting again with MISSION TO MARS. However, if at all, and for anyone who enjoys De Palma's liberal borrowing from cinematic masters such as Hichcock and Eisenstein, this is a great movie to watch, particularly for its breathtaking sequence at the train station where Ness' and Capote's men have a fantastic face-off as a baby carriage careens out of control in the midst, barely avoiding bullets.",10,2,4,14 June 2006
Mystic River," Character Study in a Minor Key.
","Most murder mysteries go the way of unleashing tension and a mounting sense of suspense and danger as the plot originating from the murder in itself reveals red herrings and a more sinister plot underneath just waiting to be discovered.Clint Eastwood's thriller goes a completely different direction: while the identity of the killer is still at the center of the story and is revealed in almost surprising -- but plausible -- sequence, this is more a powerful character study of three childhood friends joined together by the very horror of a life extinguished. All three actors make their roles their own -- Sean Penn is quietly intense and devastated, Tim Robbins is the ultimate broken man through circumstances not of his control who still relives his own tragedy every day, and Kevin Bacon plays a stoic detective who also has some relationship issues of his own.If there's one weakness in the movie it's the way the women are written. While Marcia Gay Harden fares better in her portrayal of a housewife who discovers what she believes to be a deadly secret involving her husband (Tim Robbins), Laura Linney, while being strong in her own role, is a little underwritten throughout and her sudden change at the end is a little inexplicable though chilling and recalls Lady MacBeth's speeches towards MacBeth.A very bleak take on the notion that some people never learn from the mistakes they make in life and how those mistakes come back to rip their own life apart in the most subtle of ways, one of the most emotionally dark movies of 2003 and completely deserving of its Oscar wins (for Best Actor and Supporting Actor, a feat repeated in this years Oscars for 2004) and nods.",9,83,122,23 April 2005
A Beautiful Mind," A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Lose.
","The story of John Forbes Nash doesn't seem like the subject matter anyone would want to make a film of, but Ron Howard brings forth his life-story in a way that makes one forget he was also the man behind 80s fluff such as SPLASH and WILLOW.A life destined to excel once he discovers and cracks his 'game theory,' John Forbes Nash is, however, a man disconnected with his surroundings and reality. He can't even approach a girl without fumbling his way through an especially creepy introduction, and at the same time he can't stand losing a simple mind-game with his friend. At the same time, four other people make their appearances in Nash's life and all three are destined to change his life forever.The first of them is a college friend Charlie (Paul Bettany of GANGSTER NO. 1) who later introduces Nash to his young daughter Marcee, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), whom he marries, and a sinister figure: William Parcher (Ed Harris). Parcher has special designs for Nash: he wants him to use his keen code-cracking skills for special top-secret assignments involving the Russians and other obscure elements and on one night Nash gets to see just how dangerous the enemy is as he and Parcher are shot at after Nash delivers some information to a strange mansion posing as an intelligence office.It's not long before Nash becomes consumed with finding the perfect code and aided by the omni-present Parcher, who supplies Nash with a security code embedded into his own skin, he dives headlong into a nightmare of numbers and codes and soon enough collapses into full-fledged schizophrenia which will require shock treatment and an arduous recovery period. Alicia, instead of moving on, forcefully stays by his side even when he has a dangerous regression and almost kills their baby child.Stories like this require a tight script and thorough knowledge of the circumstance of mental illness as well as the person in question, in this case Nash. Howard directs Nash's progressive descent into his mental breakdown with ease and in a way where we're not sure if anyone who surrounded Nash is real -- the way he introduces Charlie, Marcee, and especially Parcher and the covert office is spectacular and shows just how strong schizophrenia can be in inducing its victims to completely believe what they are seeing and hearing.And then there are the performances. I don't think I need to say anything which hasn't been said of Russell Crowe. He is, right now, the only living actor who has the guts and balls to put his masculinity aside and dive head-first into the roles he plays. His screen presence oozes a magnetic, masculine power (and in one scene it's clear the man is built) but that doesn't overcome his characterization of Nash. If anything, he uses his physicality as an asset to clumsily walk around, and there is one scene later in the movie when he has returned to teach classes. He walks with the shuffle of someone who's lost in his own world. It would be hard-pressed for anyone to see the staccato waddle and the glazed eyes that he wouldn't be talking to himself in full-fledged conversations, and the hippie who mocks him, unnoticed, expresses Anyone's reaction. We know this is a genius, but one who has become damaged goods.Then there's Jennifer Connelly. An actress who as of yet has avoided selling out to blatant commercialism, her presence is as powerful as Crowe's. Quiet but intense, she is the foundation of which Crowe's feet rest on and without her he might as well be dead. Just one scene, when she is about to discover just how crazy her husband is and his colleagues are trying to stop her: just watch her reel around and casually but with authority slap one of them squarely in the face and continue on, undeterred. Marvelous acting. Her Oscar is justified.The entire supporting cast is uniformly brilliant. Ed Harris nails his creepy role as the imaginary Parcher. Paul Bettany gives off friendly dependency -- the friend who won't go away, even though he, too, isn't real. Judd Hirsch, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer provide solid support in small roles.A complex movie about mental illness as well as the power of love and the triumph of the soul (even if love -- the devotion between Alicia and John -- is excruciatingly strained at times), A BEAUTIFUL MIND is truly, a beautiful experience and justly won the Oscar for Best Movie and Director and should have also won Best Actor, but Russell Crowe will stick around for quite some time giving powerhouse performances. He is one strong actor to follow. I know I will.",9,50,64,25 August 2005
The Departed," Scorsese at the Top of His Game
","He's one of the few directors who have at least one movie within the top of the critics' lists during the Seventies, Eighties, Nineties, and now this decade. That's consistency in the quality of work, especially in an industry where directors come and go with one big hit, where they suddenly have slumps -- some lasting years and years --, and others make sporadic movies here and there. Martin Scorsese is also one of the few directors to tackle a theme that by now would have run its course: the Mafia movie because there can be only so much you can do with this type of film; however, Scorsese proves that there's still a lot of material that can be molded into compelling, edge-of-your-seat tales like the one he weaves here. Certainly not a 'B' picture as he called it, yet it has all the elements of a B-picture: the seedy criminals, the sordid locations, the femme fatale, the overall feeling of despair and doom. It certainly is high noir, especially in the fact that all of the characters, to a degree, are under the shadow of this ultimate evil man, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and pretty much there is no escape, especially when Costello's deep ties that corrupt law enforcement come to light. The world of the men in THE DEPARTED is one where everyone is suspect and everyone is at danger of being 'next'. Even golden-boy Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a pawn of Costello since he was a child, can't escape this fact. Moving upwards, propelled by his good looks and extreme good luck, he's the ultimate patsy who is set from the get-go even as he tries darned hard to elude all evidence that links him to Costello and invisible man William Costigan (a hardened-looking Leonardo DiCaprio).Scorsese moves throughout his multiple plots with quite a bit of tentative yet explosive meandering. There is a lot going on through the initial portion of THE DEPARTED -- the first 15 minutes, approximately -- I became somewhat baffled he is setting up the intricate tableau which details those who are on the side of Good (represented by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) and those who are on the side of Evil (Nicholson). Minor characters pop up here and there and at first there is no real reason as to why they are even there, but that becomes rather clear later on in crucial moments. It's fantastic, wickedly suspenseful, compelling storytelling that draws you in from its opening scenes, and its style indicates that somewhere within the folds of narrative, Sullivan and Costigan, opposites in every sense of the word (Sullivan has led a life of privilege under the aegis of Costello and is now the poster boy of success, rising fast within the police department; Costigan comes from a broken family and is trying to make amends with himself even when he will never become an official law enforcement entity -- he is 'no man') will have to meet. The crux between them lies in Vera Farmiga who plays the woman caught. She is Costigan's therapist, but is also Sullivan's girl, and her character is tricky, since it balances being the girl who suspects something is wrong with her boyfriend and the professional who feels anger, then pity, and finally desire for her patient.Stylish, darkly funny (much of the humor coming from Nicholson's deadpan performance), extremely masculine (and what a cast of actors!) with an outstanding soundtrack (can anyone select songs like Scorsese for their movies?), THE DEPARTED is deservedly a winner, a masterpiece. It's exquisite to slowly chew on and then wash down with the most expensive wine.",10,3,5,6 March 2007
Rosemary's Baby," The Horror Underneath a Pregnant Woman's Belly.
","Pregnancy is the time in a woman's life that, despite the hormone imbalance and the emotional changes, is charged in an overwhelming among of love and support and the notion that she is slowly gestating a human life, male or female, a child that will bring her (and her family) happiness. Motherhood has been depicted as beautiful, symbolic, Woman being Creation in progress in ancient cultures, a Thing to venerate and respect and even worship, Something capable of ensuring the continuation of a family line, a tradition, and hence, life and culture for an entire strata of society. Nothing is supposed to go wrong, or at least, not at the level of what happens to Rosemary Woodhouse's pregnancy, which is the ultimate wrong thing.What Ira Levin seems to want to tell us in this 'plot' surrounding Rosemary's pregnancy is that society and its religious tradition can be substituted by something much more sinister, as-yet unseen but gestant -- the force of will, the creation of Man's own version of what he believes will be the new wave of humanity. Is God dead? Well, considering the timing of the novel and the movie with society's disillusionment with Establishment, the onset of Vietnam, the loss of innocence of a country just years ago with the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, He just as well may be. Religion and religious figures pop up during the movie, but seem unable to bring any comfort and only add to the vague sense of unease that permeates ROSEMARY'S BABY.And this nagging unease is precisely what both author and director give us: something not quite, completely there, something that seems to be happening just off-limits, barely overheard through the flimsy walls which divide these prewar apartment buildings converted into chic, livable spaces. The way the banal elements that are so much a part of our lives are overthrown so subtly makes the horror that is the movie's denouement even more tragic. Surely the nice neighbors can't be more than just that -- they're so helpful... well, maybe a little too helpful. Surely the death of that girl Rosemary befriends was just a freak suicide. Surely the doctor's recommendations for Rosemary are the best -- don't doctor's always know what's good for us? And surely, one's own partner would not have done the unthinkable in order to advance professionally now, would he?Paranoia of the unseen is a powerful way to tell a horror story without ever giving away any shock cuts or showing the boogeyman. While it becomes abundantly clear early on that this is a story of witchcraft of the worst kind, the only time some of it makes its way in front of the camera is in the extremely stylized ritual/rape scene, and even then, since Rosemary is having what might be the worst nightmare of her life, one isn't quite sure of what is happening, and of course, in the end, when all is revealed in a comic yet horrific way. That takes skill in a storyteller and what makes ROSEMARY'S BABY so completely disturbing even now, almost forty years from its release unto the public. Also the fact that it never relies on a twist ending so common today but on the nuanced performance of the actors portraying real urbanites enhances: from Mia Farrow who carries the movie and even at the end retains a resigned innocence to her fate once her suspicions are facts to John Cassavettes who plays his part slimy straight, and supporting actors Ruth Gordon and Sydney Blackmer who have the hard task of making kindly and eccentric hide sinister just underneath. Their performance makes you wonder who exactly are your neighbors, and if they might be harboring some deadly lifestyle, and makes you feel uneasy being alone even in an empty hallway or accepting anyone's offered smoothie.",10,71,87,13 March 2005
Love Actually," All You Need is Love
","London, and its citizens, are in love in Richard Curtis' debut film LOVE ACTUALLY, which tells the intertwining stories of about a dozen characters, all experiencing different forms of love during the course of the Christmas holidays. There is the love between siblings, love that isn't reciprocated, love amongst friends, young teens, lovers, spouses, family members, politicians, co-workers, and the list goes on.This, of course, is not a bad thing -- Curtis manages to fill his story lines with a large cast of mainly British actors who have all in one form or the other been in successful romantic comedies, but with so many stories, one gets the feeling that at times, either the film should have been longer, more episodic, or made into a two-part miniseries.But as it is, LOVE ACTUALLY is a pretty good feature film that managed to bring more smiles and tears than anger and frustration. Most of the story lines, if not all, resolve themselves much in the tradition of feel-good films and while sometimes a bit much on the sugary elements, it entertains, especially in one sequence where Liam Neeson's character's son runs through security at the airport in order to get a response from the girl he loves.Maybe not the definitive romantic comedy of the year as it was touted, but one that tugs the emotions in all the right places, and sets out to do what it's supposed to do: make you cuddle up with your partner, sip some hot tea, and enjoy.",8,2,5,11 January 2006
Ice Age," The Quest to Return a Lost Child
","I have a soft spot for animated movies because even the lesser effective ones (HOODWINKED) have their own magic even when either their very story, overall composition, or continuity may bog it down. And due to the fact that they're aimed at the younger audience, it's become a staple that these films -- deemed 'safe' -- have a simple plot allegorical in nature with clearly defined characters, comic interludes, a frightful chase sequence involving the main character(s), and a character that either switches sides from bad to good or from weak to strong which comes in at the crucial climactic, dramatic moment where a resolution is needed. It goes back to the days of Disney and BAMBI.ICE AGE is no different. It follows these elements closely in the story of Manfred the woolly mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego, a saber-toothed tiger, who due to circumstances not of their own making come together to return a child back to its parents. Throughout the way they will come closer even though the tiger may not have clear intentions with the child, and there is a truly beautiful scene when Manfred comes upon some cave drawings made by humans in which he sees the tragic story of his own breed. We see it too -- from Manfred's point of view. Both we and Manfred react the same way: with a sad feeling of irony.A very good movie that may appeal to young and old, ICE AGE benefits from the vocal personalities of its cast: Ray Romano brings likability to Manfred, John Leguizamo is great as the goofy Sid, and most of all Denis Leary, with his gravelly low menace of a voice, does a sharp turn as the conflicted, dangerous Diego. A cute story adds a little padding to the movie and exists in its own universe: a little squirrel trying to get his nut -- watch the end credits, which intended or not, sort of foreshadow the title of its sequel.",9,0,0,3 April 2006
The Last King of Scotland," The Man Who Became a Monster
","Much like the story of every man who has risen to the top of a country and has misused his power for the sake of power itself, the predictability that he will be of unstable mind, less stable hand, and eagerness of executions that will ultimately be the cause of his own demise -- physical or political -- is a perennial theme. Idi Amin Ada is no different from the heap -- born into abject poverty, slowly making his way rung on rung until he reached the level of ruler of Uganda in the 1970s and let loose a reign of terror in the name of assuring his own hand in a nation that was brimming with restlessness. Loosely based on Ada's short rule is the riveting movie THE LAST KING OF Scotland, which traces Ada's period in power from the point of view of an Everyman, Nicholas Garrigan, who from being a simple adventurer looking for experience wound up being an insider into Ada's own machinations (to which he ultimately would find himself implicated). It tries not to expound on the gore that must have prevailed at the time -- Ada's means of execution were notoriously hairy -- until the crux of the action where Garrigan's own mortality comes into play, and for the most part the movie is a tense battle of wills between Garrigan and Ada who foil each other like dancers in a shifty ballet. James McAvoy and Forrest Whittaker balance each out like a ying/yang, both men containing bits and pieces of the other within, although Whittaker's is the clear winner for the showier role (as is the case when there are two strong egos involved; one half has to be the balanced role which can at times be underplayed and thankless, McAvoy having to settle for this role).

","When one looks at the works of director Francis Ford Coppola, horror-opera doesn't quite enter the mind, but in 1992 that's just the route he took and it paid off in some ways, while in others, not quite.Coming off the critical and commercial failure of THE GODFATHER III, which itself closed a decade peppered with cinematic ups and downs, the decision was considered controversial. Throughout the film community (if it may be called so) there was the thought he'd either run out of material or that maybe this was going to be another of his incursions into insanity much like with APOCALYPSE NOW. Either-or, he made the film he wanted to make, and the results are of a director in full command of his talent, his vision, his cast, and even his excess.And thank God for Coppola's dramatic excess, which is his view. This is the first time I've seen Dracula treated as an opera in which every moment held sway the power of flourish. I enjoyed it. It's very close in style and substance to Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in lush atmosphere, shadowy visuals, grand gestures, and over the top music. A definite feel for silent Hollywood in which effects were made the hard way, from exaggerated postures, sequences filmed backwards -- every trick in the bag is present, and every one of them is a stroke of brilliance.I loved that throughout Dracula there is a strong element of Fate, not Chance, from the very moment we see Vlad and Elisabeta being separated through actions not entirely of their own accord. This is vital for a story about romantic horror to work, because it's clear that at some point in the future they will cross paths again, even if the road to this re-encounter will be a bloody one. Had matters been left as they were in the novel -- Dracula being this one-dimensional evil -- this would have been a much darker, grim monster story. Under Coppola he becomes human, the true romantic anti-hero.And as is with many anti-heroes, he comes with so much baggage and centuries of marinating in his self-absorbed ego within the ruins of his castle in Transylvania it's a wonder he's able to seduce Mina Harker when he catches up with her in 1897 London. Of course, not being quite human in flesh, he is able to manipulate his own energy into the form of a beast or a mist. Knowing his Elisebeta is out there after all, he begins extending his subtle self by one hapless Jonathan Harker (Mina Murray's fiancée). He creates a storm while being transported on the Demeter from his native land to London. As he approaches the new land, Mina feels a shadow move around her, and soon Lucy Westenra, her best friend, is a victim (in more ways than one) of a horrible vision equal parts lust and terror. Mina of course will not see Dracula until later in a beautiful sequence where both meet on the streets of London and converse in a museum where chaos erupts around them, maybe in reaction to his own dark nature. Even so, their acquaintance is formed and evolves until Mina can almost see herself in her prior incarnation. Yes, it departs from the novel but Coppola knows what he's doing: making this horror accessible. Making Dracula a tragic figure, and resolving that which was left in shambles.At times, though, Coppola's love for grandiosity turns shrill. Scenes in which Winona Ryder must express difficult emotions -- such as her realization of who Vlad really is, and that he killed Lucy -- falters. Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing overplays his role and in trying to bring the wry humor his character was written as possessing he hams it up. Keanu Reeves... well. Could he be more bland?Adding to this, there are one too many emotional/visual/musical climaxes: deleting just one would have been more than enough as long as they were not Lucy's death scene intercut with Mina's wedding or the tour de force that is the actual climax in itself as the blood-red Sun hurdles down to Earth while two parties race towards Dracula's castle. Just on this basis, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula as per Coppola is a great tale of star-crossed lovers bookended by his forbidding castle.",9,0,2,21 March 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Beauty and the Self-Absorbed Anchorman
","I came unto this movie only for the scene in the trailer that showed Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) leaping into each other's arms, right on top of a conference table, as Ferrell yelled, 'Let's make a baby!' Which is essentially saying I decided to give it a chance out of vague curiosity, not expecting an even remotely good collection of skits straight out of Saturday Night Live. And, I'll say this: I was proved wrong.The story that THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY tells is simple, but deceptive: while having Ron Burgundy (San Diego's Channel 4's main anchorman) as its main character, it's actually the story of how Veronica Corningstone came unto this TV station and on the way to becoming the first female news anchor confronted massive opposition from her male co-workers who wouldn't even assign her a decent office on her first day of work, much less give her the chance to report the news. That she is quoted as being an ice queen after she aggressively rebukes the sexual advances of Burgundy's clique (recalling in a much lesser way Faye Dunaway's emasculating Diana Christensen) is part of her charm, and it's this charm the reason Burgundy eventually falls for her, and part of what belies her true nature once she decides to climb her own ladder to success. Applegate is great in her role because she never tries to make her character too harsh even when her own mean streak comes out late in the movie and gets Ron Burgundy fired from the office. While still not having a breakout role, her interpretation has the right element of spunk and humanity, and her chemistry is very palpable with Ferrell whenever they're on camera together which is often. Ferrell, on the other hand, let's loose, but because he's so good, his role doesn't become something that belongs strictly on Saturday Night Live and I think he has the potential to do with his career what Tom Hanks has done with his own which is transcend broad comedy and move into power-acting. His Ron Burgundy is, quite simply, a deluded clown, but a likable one, much like the Ted Baxter was on THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.Much credit has to go to the writers who devised the hilarious jokes. The names of the characters alone are exaggerated, as is the scene where the news anchors from rival stations collide in a bloodbath (which features cameos from Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Tim Robbins), and another great moment when Burgundy encounters an angry biker (Jack Black) on his way to work, and who kicks his dog into the bay. We can see the dog is clearly a doll, but the temerity of the scene which recalls a similar scene in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY stands. I think the essence of the movie can be summed up in one scene, though: who can recall growing up in the 70s and seeing the credits roll as the news program came to an end and the two anchors were seen chit-chatting amicably? There's a great inter-cutting between what a television (in Any Home, USA) is showing to the open verbal war that both anchors (Applegate and Ferrell) are engaging in. It makes one think of what actually happens once the newscast is over.",8,30,51,18 July 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," The Moebius Strip
","Metafiction, since the arrival of Charlie Kaufmann, has become the driving force in cinematic storytelling. Consider that ADAPTATION and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND ar the types of stories which evolve within themselves and turn logic inside-out by breaking the thin layer of fantasy and bringing it into reality. Not that this was groundbreaking, Luis Bunuel was there first, happily deconstructing the art of plotting from BELLE DE JOUR to THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE.However STRANGER THAN FICTION is less a surreal experience than a blend of what is happening as opposed to what is not, and even what might be implied. Harold Crick has started to hear a voice within his head. It's a voice we hear, too: a woman's voice -- the Narrator. He wonders if there is any meaning to this voice who tracks his every move and peppers it with bon mots. It begins to get intrusive and frankly, he gets fed up with it: what does this woman want? Can anyone outside of him hear her narrate his life? Is he on some perverse reality show? At the same time, Karen Eiffel is experiencing writer's block. She fantasizes constantly about death -- then again, death is ever present in her novels, and the protagonists (regular folk, good people as she later calls them) die senselessly. But, in their death, beautifully written by her hand in narration, they achieve a certain immortality that becomes a work of art in itself. Her public, her success, her reputation depends on their death.How director Marc Forster blends both the life of Harold Crick with the writing of Karen Eiffel is really what's at stake here and this is the kind of movie where a review about it would destroy any expectations a viewer would have of the revelation that is STRANGER THAN FICTION. Adding to this, its mismarketing as a comedy actually makes it the better picture: the trailer teeters only on Harold's apparent crack-up as he yells and goes berserk at the voice that he keeps hearing but it leaves out the meat, which is a wise move. Harold is much more than a Will Ferrell comedy-sketch: he becomes fully realized as a man caught in a completely surreal experience. STRANGER THAN FICTION has some excellent acting from its entire cast which is of the likes of Dustin Hoffmann, Emma Thompson (in a rather darkly funny role as Karen Eiffel), Maggie Gylenhaal, and Queen Latifah in a role that seems to have been conceived as larger but got lost in the scissors that is the cutting room floor.",9,1,1,16 June 2007
Ray," Jamie Foxx's Tour de Force
","The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four pictures tackling real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four pictures to make it to the race to the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles.And it was well-deserved despite that Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that Charles' had penned. It did help that Jamie Foxx rose well above the movie -- itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a TV biopic -- and his portrayal is detailed as it's ferocious. He has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real Ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young Ray but her facial and body language is gut-wrenching, especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have Ray find his way around the house. Such intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. That alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. I would have, though, loved it if they would have used his last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993, 'Sing my Song for You' in the closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art.",7,28,31,11 January 2006
The Queen," The Lady Named X
","Towards the end of Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN there is a scene in which Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren, at her acting finest)gets a visit from Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, a great foil for Mirren). Two months have transpired from the events following Princess Diana's tragic death. Blair inquires if it must have been hard for her (as they take a walk which will take them out into the gardens). The look that Mirren as the Queen gives Sheen as Blair is unique -- the stuff that elevates simple acting into something truly transcendent. It's the look that conveys pages upon pages of untold, unexpressed words, the gesture which says, 'You have no idea how it's been for me. Not just that awful week last year, but all my entire life.' And true to fact, neither can we. Never in the history of reigning monarchs has there ever been a less popular, more thankless person. It's as if she had devolved from being little more than a decorative figure maintaining a dying tradition, into worse than a relic, or the painting she is posing for at the opening credits. Diana, the rival, roams throughout the movie, unseen but clearly the Rebecca everyone -- variations of Mrs. Danvers, all of us, the vox populi -- rooted for and loved and expected to see carrying the ultimate Title, whereas all Elizabeth II could aspire to be less than X, blotted out, a brittle old woman with bad fashion taste frozen in the Fifties, on standby as to how she should react to Diana's death -- and this is the crux of the action. One hellish week, a battle of popularity, and a moment of indecision as to what would be the right action to take in regards to mourning The People's Princess.A stunning movie made by a consistently remarkable director, THE QUEEN is a subtle little game of wills while it takes a darkly perverse time in skewering the monarchy, particularly in scenes involving arguments between the Queen's husband, Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) who dissect their reactions, none too pleasant, about the rituals of mourning -- you wonder if these people actually exist and the headache it must be living with them. The feat that THE QUEEN manages to pull off is that it makes the viewer commiserate with Queen Elizabeth in the end and the fulcrum happens to be that surreal scene where she gets stranded in her own grounds and comes upon the stag her husband has been trying to hunt down. That she is, through this stag, able to finally come to terms with the fact that the world has moved on and she is in her own island is the best scene in the entire picture.",10,2,4,14 June 2007
Blade Runner," Taking a Cue from Fritz Lang
","Even when the date that the story takes place in is only 14 years in the future and automatically cancels much of the technology and events shown in Ridley Scotts sci-fi noir film BLADE RUNNER, it's still a stunning movie that has more than enough elements to make it compulsively watchable. The story of one Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter out to eliminate a handful of renegade replicants (i. e. androids), and how he fell in love with one of them, was adapted from Philip K. Dick's short story 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and is extremely claustrophobic. One would never know that this was Los Angeles; the sun never shines, colors are muted, and there is an element of sick-green corruption all around. Stylistically it moves at a steady pace, never pausing for cute moments. Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, Sean Young, and Joanna Cassidy are quite impressive in their renditions of the replicants -- particularly Hauer and Hannah who have some truly memorable sequences of extremely disquieting violence, violence that is a reaction to their one dream, which is to live. One poignant sequence involves Harrison Ford explaining to Sean Young that her memories were implanted to her and thus, are not real. I thought that was the cruelest part of the movie, because it was like telling your own creation that he or she did not have a 'life' until you gave it to them, and somehow that carries an undertone of inhumanity about it. There has been the speculation, by the way, that Ford's character could also be a replicant, but somehow that doesn't seem to be the case in the movie: he's just a cop with a mission to complete. That he decides to spare Rachael's 'life' shows a human aspect about him -- that he wasn't all orders, even when the romance in itself is perfunctory to say the least. A sad, but beautiful nightmare of a film, it works whether you see it with Ford's voice-over or not.",10,0,1,9 June 2006
Casino Royale," The Franchise is Back
","CASINO ROYALE does what no Bond movie has ever done before and it's a simple thing: it goes back to the basics and details the creation of Bond per se with its fits and starts as Bond has to fight against his own worst enemy -- his own ego -- before he can successfully complete any mission involving spies, counterspies, terrorists, and the like. A fantastic opening montage that intercuts the present, filmed in the style of noir, with a flashback killing, filmed in gritty, scratchy images, and Bond has pocketed two killings in less time than you can catch your breath, earning his double agent status. Then he's off on a chase through the African landscape as he tries to intercept a runner carrying a terrorist device linked to a code in a cell phone ('ellipsis') that ends rather badly and, due to the fact that now we're in the age of the Net, immediately disseminated, a thing that displeases M (Judi Dench) who knows Bond isn't ready to assume his role -- he's too much of a hothead. However, there is still the issue of his pending mission, and this takes Bond into the (customary) exotic locales and closer to the man he is supposed to beat in an all-stakes card game -- Le Chiffre. In fact, nearly the entire movie is spent at Casino Royale and is virtually devoid of exaggerated action. All of the tension relies in the fact that Le Chiffre and Bond are pitted against each other and within them there are other double agents and possible betrayers who are out for their own material gain and personal reasons.So other than the African chase scene and one involving Bond trying to stop a suicide bomber from hitting a plane -- itself, again, keeping up with the times -- CASINO ROYALE is actually quite somber with snippets here and there of humor, and a third act that goes somewhere completely different and shows Bond in a more human light -- and explains his later treatment of the women he's crossed. There is a dry element to the scenes of violence, however, that CASINO ROYALE presents -- it's less cartoonish, for one, which is a good thing. It also has a lot in common with the type of violence shown in Melville's ARMY OF SHADOWS -- sparse, to the point, without relying on the swell of music and the extended scenes where the bad guy just won't die and Bond can seemingly go on forever. This Bond will kill at the drop of a hat; he's totally unpredictable, he can take quite a beating himself (in a scene where he gets tortured in a man's most vulnerable place) and make it look like he's enjoying it. Daniel Craig, with his cold yet sad blue eyes and steely, chiseled looks (and impossibly honed physique) makes him look dangerous yet compassionate at the same time, still not sure of what his role is supposed to be about. He's, quite frankly, what Bond is meant to be.Now, there's the issue of how relevant the character is in a time when we have the plethora of terrorist events taking place all around us. I think so. The traditional Bond fought battles over nearly inhuman villains and that took 90 % of the story's credibility -- you knew you were watching 'another Bond flick' and that was a big whoop, wasn't it? This time, none of the identifiable elements of 'the Bond movie' are present. It's as if this is the first time Bond as an agent was introduced to us and none of the previous stories ever took place. Bond himself speaks his most well-known line at the end of the movie, which is nearly 150 minutes long. The Bond women aren't glamazons -- Eva Green, while exceedingly beautiful, is accessible: earthy but sophisticated, and Caterina Murino has the dark looks but registers little and she is out after one scene. Le Chiffre is less a monster, more a corrupt politician. This is quite a gritty movie, using CASINO ROYALE from 1967 as a template to re-configure it completely and make it into a powerhouse action-drama-romance adventure for our times, where instead of the deadly machines seen in GOLDFINGER (and the rest of them, each successive one more lurid than the previous) we have cell phones running terrorist rings and implants that allow 24 hour monitoring of Bond's whereabouts -- relevant to our times. This is, simply put, Bond for the new millennium.",10,0,6,25 March 2007
Identity," Smart B-Movie Thriller
","As the norm, B-movies have a certain freedom to show on-screen what big-name productions shy away from, and thanks to this, they can retain a near 100 percent truthfulness to what they're trying to tell. IDENTITY, an effective little movie that became the sleeper hit of the first third of 2003 is one of those clever stories. Taking a cue from Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians', one of the few of her stories which have failed to make an impression on the big screen, director James Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney bring forth this apparently predictable but surprising slasher-thriller about ten strangers, neither of them related to each other, who during a heavy storm converge in an out-of-the-way motel in the middle of nowhere. That it becomes evident that there is more to every one of these people than first value would suggest is just the icing on the cake. When they start getting picked off one by one, paranoia sets in and the remaining survivors try to uncover the killer's identity.Waving in an out of this suspenseful story is the tense battle between a psychologist trying to save his patient from certain death. It becomes known to us that he's a mass murderer, and a former cop, but to talk more about this would be 'murder' to anyone who hasn't seen this clever story. More so because there is a crucial plot point which ties both the events in the motel and the inquisition. As a matter of fact, much of IDENTITY occurs in a deceptive non-linear way. The manner as to how the main players are introduced, with the actions of one affecting the course of action of the other, going back and forth before getting into the meat of the plot, is downright tight.Mangold is one of the newer directors whom I'm getting acquainted with and in the process, enjoying his work. His rendition to the slasher genre is hard to classify at times because a lot of the movie is an intense character piece where every one of his players are people instead of plot-types (while initially appearing so). Having a large roster of big names and lesser-known names helps, too, because it misdirects the viewer into believing that an actor known for playing a certain type of role will repeat a performance here, but Mangold is looking for something else aside from entertaining. It seems to me that his intentions are to twist a well-known genre and take it to an unexpected ground without cheating his audience a la M. Night Shyamalan. And because all the little giveaways are there, cleverly hidden in their plain exposure, no one can say he cheated for shock value. I loved IDENTITY, with its dark colors and late-night horror movie values, and can't say there wasn't a moment when an actor didn't nail his or her presence.",8,4,7,4 February 2006
Munich," Terrorism, Then and Now
","What should have been an uneventful Olympics in Munich, 1972, became the bloodshed that unfolded like a Moebius strip and unleashed even more blood unto the world. On September 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists killed two Israeli athletes, kidnapped nine more, and asked for safe passage out of Germany and the subsequent liberation of Arab prisoners in Israeli and German prisons. Once at the airport they encountered resistance from the German authorities, and in a scuffle, all of the other nine hostages were killed.This led to the Israeli government to have the Mossad -- Israel's intelligence agency -- track down and kill every terrorist responsible for the killings. For this they hired one of Golda Meir's bodyguards, known as Avner, put him in a special ops team, and gave them minimal information about these terrorists. Avner on his own is able to strike back at the 'supposed' terrorists via the appearance of a shady Parisian named Louie, but as the assignments become more and more difficult, he wonders if it is all worth it, and once his own team gets decimated by counter-agents, he wonders if behind every terrorist there is a even more dangerous one just waiting in the wings with ways to get back at him and his family.Steven Spielberg is at his best when not directing sci-fi movies. The world of 1972 hasn't changed a bit then from now: when one sees the events of September 11, 2001 (and the World Trade Center inserted into the New York City skyline right at the final scene), and the political interests which led to their horrific unfolding on American soil -- once a concept thought unthinkable -- it becomes food for thought if behind every Saddam, every Osama, there aren't tens, if not hundreds, waiting, with more reasons to hate the Western world for butting their heads in their business. Avner, while a minion of Israel, ponders these things, and is himself terrorized when he comes to America to live a life away from the madness he was involved in: namely, the never-ending conflict between Israel and Palestine, both fighting for what they consider home. As one PLO member effectively says: 'Home is all we know.' No right, no wrong, but a grey middle is the prevalent tone in MUNICH. While re-enacting a swift retribution against those who destroy order would be the thing to do, what does it solve? Spielberg doesn't say. What he does do is create an increasing, nail-biting suspense that Hitchcock himself would have loved -- and this film, reminiscent itself of SABOTAGE, is proof that terror and mayhem at the hands of subversives is still a thing of now as much as then and that innocents are always on hand to pay with the intended victims. One sequence, as the foursome wait for their first target to pick up the phone but find that his young daughter has not left the house yet, is incredibly powerful. Another one is when Avner waits for a bomb to go off in the room beside him. Nothing is ever clean and easy in the real world, and even bombers can never really know what to expect from their toys, and all one can do is wait and wait and wait.MUNICH has strong performances all throughout. Eric Bana is tortured as Avner, a man who only wants to be with his wife and young daughter and cannot escape the horrors he has seen. Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz, Lynn Cohen, Hans Ziechler, Michael Lonsdale, and Mathieu Amalric all supply great support in a well-rounded cast and flesh out great characters in this excellent, if morally ambiguous story.",10,84,130,30 January 2006
The Birds," Obsessions Under the Strobelight.
","Some films are so well made that watching them unfold sequence by sequence creates the feeling of surrender to a higher force. Hitchcock, no stranger to spellbinding his audience, was known for bringing a sense of intense masochism into the viewer's eyes. In THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH the Albert Hall sequence is a perfect crescendo of images and music in which Jo McKenna sees a man who is the key to her son's safety prepare to commit a crime with deadly slowness. In PSYCHO, Marion Crane takes a fatal shower and gets a vicious visitor. In VERTIGO, Scotty and Judy begin a dizzying affair which itself is as obsessive as narcotic and culminates high above the bell tower, filled with revelations upon revelations.THE BIRDS is by far one of Hitchcock's most deadly incursions into cinematic masochism. In itself, it's a masterpiece of misdirection. Hitchcock has no wrong man in his story, no chase sequences (or at least, none that involve Cary Grant and some Bad Guys), and no double-crosses. All he presents here is Tippi Hedren's arrival to the small town of Bodega Bay, a series of Meet Cutes between her and Rod Taylor, what could pass as romantic suspense, and the most impressive sweeping of the rug right out from under the audience's feet at precisely halfway through the movie when the plot makes a left turn into uncharted territory. Who else can lay claim to that feat? Hitchcock, in revealing the black petals of his deadly flower revealing themselves, opening up, and swallowing the viewer whole at this precise mark is one of the un-topped achievements in cinema history.And so begins a sequence of events that proceed at the vertiginous crescendo of domino's falling. We've seen the birds amass and attack in increasing ferocity. We've seen the damage they've done to the little city. Hitchcock, of course, has one better on the viewers during the film's overpowering climax: making their presence oppressive and omniscient through the use of sound imitating their shrieks until it becomes deafening and everyone is twisting and turning in revulsion among the corners of the house in reaction not only to their fury but to what they might imagine as their horrible deaths. Hitchcock never once gives an emotional release, and then he outdoes himself in using the most hackneyed excuse for a plot device: Melanie ascending the stairs because she heard a rustling noise, the quintessential 'Don't go there,' which is the oldest trick in the book. Because we know what lies on the other side of the door....The stroboscopic effect of the last attack is petrifying as it is unflinching. Melanie, waving the flashlight in a weak signal for help, being slammed against the door, as Mitch tries to get inside but finds he cannot. As Melanie begins slumping and surrenders to the birds' attack, she has an odd mixture of horror and pleasure. We, of course, can't do anything but watch and watch and watch.Hitchcock had always been attracted to the theme of rape. Because his (professional) relationship with Tippi Hedren was brittle at best, this sequence, somehow out of place and character, seems more in tune with his love-hate attitude towards blonde women and his need for their total submission. Beginning with the emotional rape Jo McKenna suffers with the disappearance of her son, the psychological stripping of Madeleine's identity in VERTIGO, Marion's violent death at the Bates Motel in PSYCHO in and culminating in the barbaric rape sequence of FRENZY, he possessed a desire to destroy that which he loved or desired the most. I notice how he makes Rod Taylor's character suddenly incapable of saving Melanie right at the end (which heightens the viewers agony -- they want, they need her to survive the birds' attack). It's almost as if he, the Director as Ringmaster, were pushing the Heroine right to the edge of the abyss for one last moment before bringing her back to the (relative) safety of family. Even then, with the vague ending, Hitchcock seems to sort of wink at the audience and tell them that it's still not over -- and this is the sort of thing only a sadistic imp of a personality would do. THE BIRDS is his obsessions at its most explicit (as they were implicit in VERTIGO) and is the kind of cinematic experience that can always be rediscovered even when its tricks become evident. It's been considered Hitchcock's last masterpiece before returning to almost full form for FRENZY, and in many ways, it is the setup for the more graphic, cruel violence of the latter film.",10,157,277,19 January 2006
Cinderella Man," Shameless, Manipulative, but it Works
","Yet another movie about the triumph of the spirit, filtered through the lens and overall vision of Ron Howard, and acted superbly by today's most masculine actor, Russell Crowe. This is the story of Jim 'Jimmy' Braddock, and his rise from being down in the dumps during the Depression Era and becoming the biggest man in the world of boxing thanks to the solid support of his fierce manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti).If it weren't such a well-told story and did not have the presence of Crowe and Giamatti, this would probably by a color-by-numbers tale of redemption. Ron Howard knows an audience and establishes a quick relationship with Braddock. He is seen as a stern but loving husband and father, a man who at the start of the film has to step down from boxing due to a hand injury which made him unbankable for business. In seeing him work the docks and in one painful scene, beg for money, we feel for him and root for his eventual success (even when many of us who may have read his bio know he went on to bigger and better things). The thing is, this story has been done one too many times to garner a moving outcome, so when the decisive fight between Braddock and Max Baer (Craig Bierko) takes place, there's the predictability of emotions but no real suspense. Our hero is a very good actor playing a dead role.Even so, Cinderella MAN is a good film. Renee Zellweger brings in her own gutsy persona as Mae Braddock, which also benefits the film, but has little to do throughout. However, as a whole, there is less weight here than in A BEAUTIFUL MIND, and a little pigeon-holing in regards to the role of Max Baer -- seen mainly as a one-note baddie, again an old-trick of the hat to give the audience its Big Moment climactic villain (even when the real man was much different) -- but Crowe keeps on demonstrating just how powerful an actor he has become over the years of playing in American films.",8,3,4,24 March 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Finding Her Way Back Home -- To Our Hearts.
","Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ, with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new, it can't be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives, especially as children, has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced, the terror of entering the Wicked Witch's lair, her transition from little girl to wise young woman, and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.What makes a great movie? The experience that you are watching it for the very first time, whether you were seven years old or an adult living in an adult world. This film is one of those. Even when as an adult I can see some of the cracks peeking through and some lapses in continuity, who cares? The tornado ripping through the cornfields is as real as the real ones I have seen even though is was really muslin. The moment that the sepia-tones from the Kansas segment peel away and Dorothy opens the door of her house and I saw the bright colors of Oz I knew I was there. The story had enveloped me now, as it had did back then. In my world, this is an utterly, fantastic film.And what is Oz, by the way? Well, from a little girl (and the child in all of us), it's that place where our imagination runs wild, where everything is perfect, where there is no tomorrow and a yellow brick road will take us to that perfect place filled with song. It's that place where we feel we will belong, and who as a child didn't feel like we were out of place? Notice I repeat the word 'place' because this is so much about placement, places, our place and therefore, our own self-expression, our own sense of self. Who hasn't wanted to 'seek a place of one's own' where light and love prevailed only to return back to where we came from, stronger and wiser? Its message is so universal. Truly, there is no place like home.Timing is crucial for the symbolic success of this movie as well. Still in the middle of the Depression years, when unemployment was at an all time high, it focuses not just on the harshness of keeping a farm, but then throwing a parent-less girl into a strange land who finds a foster mother of sorts who would tell her that the way back home would not be an easy one. Glinda the Good represents this character, the same way, the Wicked Witch of the West represents the darker forces that watch her every move and aggressively try to trip her up. This is quite a lot on the shoulders of a little girl, and having Judy Garland -- not yet the major star but just on the brink of becoming one -- play Dorothy Gale has become casting history. In 1939 she was about seventeen, fresh-faced, innocent and vulnerable: she is Dorothy, and we can't imagine anyone else, not even nearly 70 years later.And speaking of casting, it was genius to have the actors playing Dorothy's friends and enemies in Kansas also show up in Oz. Since the movie is so much like a dream, it's more than logical: many people in our lives sometimes show up in dreams -- it's even in books about dreams. That they also represent that which not only they, but Dorothy most of all, lacks -- courage, love, and wisdom -- makes their appearances even more intrinsic to the story, so when they grow as characters, so do we, and of course, so does Dorothy.THE WIZARD OF OZ is timeless. So simple, so honest, but so deep in its messages about love and self-discovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook; all that is missing are the page frames. There isn't a false move here, and all those back-stories... well, their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic, it's all here, in about two hours of pure entertainment.",10,66,79,13 November 2005
Evil Dead II," Fantastic Lunacy!
","While the original EVIL DEAD was genuinely a horror film, this one went completely the opposite direction and decided to amp up the gore factor to make it basically a demented cartoon show. EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is really a re-telling of the same events from the first story, but in this case, only Ash and Linda (Bruce Campbell and Denise Bexler) come to the cabin and less than 10 minutes into the movie he has played a recording from a professor who mouths the infamous lines from the Necronomicon and unwittingly brought his girlfriend to an untimely death, though she herself becomes re-animated and returns to torment him as a severed head and a body with a chainsaw in its hands who unwittingly slices itself in two.And this is only the beginning of a movie that will not let down the zaniness, as the professor's daughter makes an appearance with her partner and two locals and get sucked into the madness that ensues. Raimi uses a hyper-kinetic editing to make the essentially silly story even sillier -- the POV of an eyeball flying into the screaming mouth of a woman is a (pun intended) scream -- and distorting the dead into stop-motion figurines only adds to the lunacy. Looney Tunes gone berserk (even the furniture becomes possessed), not precisely frightening, but swiftly paced and with great use of Bruce Campbell's over-the-top acting and slapstick humor. Hilarious, entertaining stuff.",10,23,30,6 March 2005
