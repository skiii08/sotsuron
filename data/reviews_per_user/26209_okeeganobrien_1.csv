The Hangover," So far, the best film i've seen this year
","Funny stuff. To be honest I wasn't the biggest fan of 'Old School' or 'RoadTrip'. I thought both film were overrated. But after seeing this i'm now a Todd Phillips follower! The movie has a very simple plot line. Four guys go to Vegas as a bachelor party and wake up hungover. The thing that I liked about this movie that really had nothing to do with how funny it was, was that it was well made. Some comedies have horrible lighting and visuals and only focus on the jokes. But this movie looks great, sounds great and was edited fantastically. Having said that, it was naturally funny. It didn't feel forced at all and and there was no political agenda behind it unlike shows like Family Guy and movies like Harlod and Kumar. Overall this movie was one of the funniest, well done comedies I have ever seen. Everyone in the cinema was laughing and having a great time. If you like to laugh, which everyone should, you will love this film.",9,1,4,28 June 2009
