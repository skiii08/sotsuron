Angels & Demons," Good for people who don't read the books...
","First of all , let me start by saying : This movie is very entertaining both action wise and adventure wise .Second of all , for the people who didn't read the book : It promises a good plot and keeps you in your seat from the start of the movie till the end . For the fans who enjoyed DA vinci code , it will be a thrilling sensation .Last but not least ! FOR the REAL fans !! : For those who read the book , i suggest that you enter the movie hall with no memory of the book cause you will be dumbstruck from the start till the end . And i mean it in a BAD WAY ! They changed the plot drastically , and it really hurts me to say : WHAT THE HELL WAS DAN BROWN THINKING WHEN HE HELPED !! .The movie was good , but for the readers : Please be gentle when you rate this film .It deserves a 9 / 10 , but as a reader i grade it a 7/10 .",7,6,12,13 May 2009
