The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," True to the book
","I loved it kept very close to the book. The year wait till the next movie probably isn't necessary I don't understand some of the bad reviews? i think people are sometimes looking for thespians and an art-house bore, and it wouldn't be fashionable if the truly enjoyed it (I find those people bores and their in a world of their own) Its not an academy award winner, but its everything you could want in a twilight movie. Also visually beautiful found it to be the best installment of the Twilight Saga. This is a love story not an action film. I think a couple of the previous directors forgot that fact.It had a good cross section of both. Bill Condon understood how important these moments were for the Twilight audience.",10,4,13,21 November 2011
