Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Watched again with no expectations
","Ok, I watched this movie again Sunday.  I really wanted to like it.  I am a huge fan of the first three (or last three). I have to say that I was more irritated now than I was in the Mann's Chinese Theater on opening night!  Jar Jar binks drove me so crazy that I had to change the channel every time his baby ebonic speak touched my ear.  I know the Jedi's are supposed to be serious, but heck, it was like the life was sucked out of them.  Could they possibly crack a smile? A smirk? I know Natalie Portman is a good actress, but what happened in this movie? She is more monotone than my 6th grade math teacher.What I miss mostly compared to the original films, are the likeable characters.  This movie generated no sympathy, empathy or any other trait that would tempt me into being emotionally invested in these characters (scriptwriting 101). Instead, the movie spent so much time on exposition of the complicated plot and special effects it forgot to tell a story about people you like and root for.Of course I will see the next one, but I hope and pray that it gives me rooting interest.  It's important for every movie.",Null,0,1,27 November 2001
