The Incredible Hulk," My review: THE INCREDIBLE HULK
","Take a deep breath when you enter the cinema to see this one because it's just downright breathtaking. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an amazing summer blockbuster movie. This reboot has made Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 seem like it never existed. Edward Norton's version portrays what Hulk is supposed to be on the big screen. Do not bootleg this one, do not wait til it hit DVD, Go watch it in the theaters because I guarantee you it is worth every penny. This movie is spectacular and superb in every way. It's a rock 'em smash 'em, jaw dropping thrill ride.Let's just start with the acting, what a perfect cast ensemble. Edward Norton is a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana because Edward looks more convincing as a skinny nerd scientist. He embodies the pain and the struggle that his character has to go through. Always running, always hiding, always trying to come up with ways to get rid of the monster in him. William Hurt and Tim Roth have no problem being the bad guys, having played so many other bad guys in many other movies in the past. Tim Blake Nelson giving us hints that he'll become the next arch nemesis The Leader is pretty cool. Liv Tyler is so damn cute. That girl can melt your heart.Now to the best part. The category that makes this movie a winner is its awesome CGI visual effects. Bravo to the brains behind this brilliant technological accomplishment. When Hulk breaks a cop car into half and uses each part as boxing globes, that's just plain badass! The images are so much better and more believable,.. the timing could not have been more right to revamp this character. The storyline helps us understand the characters and their development as they progress but it wastes no time at all on any boring moment.Magnificent stuntwork as well, especially the chase scene in the small town in Brazil. The whole jumping from one roof to another at high speed with bodies bumping into walls or falling down from a considerable height. I have much respect for the stunt people who broke their bones daily for this movie.The story has three main long action packed sequences and the last fight scene is just phenomenal. They weren't kidding when they said that it would last for 26 minutes. Hulk punches Abomination, Abomination, kicks Hulk, Hulk strangles Abomination, Abomination slams Hulk onto a couple of buildings.. Your inner kid will be happy.All the elements of this movie have but one purpose only to entertain your senses to the fullest extent. Your sight and hearing will be treated with the utmost incredible experience of your lifetime. You will find yourself cheering at how great this movie is.The cameo by Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, who plays Hulk in the old TV series are memorable. The plot also has some punch lines here and there that are silly funny but effective. I'm glad Lou Ferrigno got to voice the Hulk because I can't think of anyone else more perfect for the job. The movie even includes the main theme song from the old TV series starring the late Bill Bixby. What a heartfelt nostalgic tribute.The teaser at the end when Tony Stark meets Gen. Thunderbolt Ross, that part is a show stopper. Director Louise Leterrier and his crew deserves a standing ovation for successfully making an excellent superhero movie which some people thought was going to be as bad as the first Hulk movie. Well, Louise has proved them wrong. Summer 2008 may quite possibly be the best summer movie season ever.",10,117,191,7 June 2008
The Rocker," Thank you, Cleveland
","I've always wanted the movie School of Rock 2 but I never expected it to appear in this form. THE ROCKER isn't original but it is entertaining. It's another story of a middle aged man who wants to feel young again, who's been wanting a second chance because he didn't get it the first time around but then he learns something valuable along the way. THE ROCKER has enough humor to make you laugh and leave you smiling at the end of the movie. Look at your rear view mirrors, comedy movie stars everywhere because Rainn Wilson is drawing near and he's catching up.It is a funny movie. Don't get your hopes up and don't have low expectations either, because one way or another, you're going to end up liking this movie. The jokes aren't that raunchy but some are in the borderline. Some scenes are cute and sweet and will make some audiences go 'Aww'. The self-realization moments are not cheesy or too sentimental. I'm glad the movie is still determined to stay cool and rock n' roll throughout the whole thing.Here you can definitely see the drastic difference from what the 80s thought was awesome and what the present time thinks is awesome as far as music, hairstyle, and clothing go. It's about knowing when to grow up but at the same time knowing not to let go some things that make your spirit feel alive. It's about what it means to be in a band and have each other's back. And it's about appreciating oneself without letting what others say mess with your heads and what it means to Rock! All that and more already covered in Jack Black's School of Rock but instead of kids, this time it's geared toward teens.I like how this movie promotes Rock n Roll Hall of Fame museum in Cleveland, Ohio. It sure receives some publicity from this movie. Despite the fact that I've been to Ohio twice in my whole life, I have yet to visit the site. It will be my my purpose for living.I just wanna emphasize that THE ROCKER wouldn't have been what it is without Rainn Wilson's excellent performance. His charm and persona is what gives this movie its soul. His comedic timing is as on the target as his ability to endure slapstick physical humor and to change moods and expressions from a careless immature adult into a compassionate, and responsible team player. Maybe Will Ferrell could also do the gig but I don't think he would as good a job.",9,3,6,22 June 2008
Milk," Got MILK?
","MILK is about as powerful as a great drama can be. It aims straight for the heart and moves you. It targets your mind and challenges your way of thinking. We've seen so many drama films about civil rights and racial tension and now MILK brings you something similar but with an issue that will rattle your comfort zone. No matter what your position is on gay rights, you will feel like the cause that MILK is fighting for is your cause too. That said, this is Sean Penn's movie. Another magnificent achievement by an actor who's sharp, brilliant and a perfectionist when the camera is on. Definitely one of the best on-screen performances I've ever seen in my entire life.Director Gus Van Sant who brought us Good Will Hunting proves that he's a cunning filmmaker who's good at what he does whether it'd be mainstream or art-house projects. With his crew and especially Cinematography by Harry Savides, he manages to deliver a presentation that doesn't only look and feel like the 70s and but it also goes side by side in harmony with every archival footage taken from that era.If you're homo-phobic, then you'll find it tough watching this movie because the camera does not away from what the actors are willing to do to be convincing. Some scenes are done in a very artful manner, it's not afraid of dealing with the lack of light and trying new angels of capturing a view or a scene, and at the same time, it's also surprisingly brave enough to go all the way blunt. On top of that, I think Gus Van Sant's elegant direction gives the actors the freedom to go the extra mile. I especially respect how he orchestrates the final tragic scene and make it seem very shocking and touching at the same time.The script by Dustin Lance Black is brutally honest and it's got what it takes to be one of the best this year. The lines are memorable, often funny, with a certain intelligence and smart remarks that will easily be embedded in the minds of the audience. The story flows nicely with the timeline and the characters and it doesn't drag at all. This is the work of a man who did his research well.I gotta give credit to all the actors.. I remember years ago, there were some in the gay community who was a bit upset that a straight man like Tom Hanks played a gay man in the drama Philadelphia but after watching how excellent he was in it.. the criticism turned into praises. Most of the cast in MILK are straight and that's what makes them good actors. Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and James Franco dive into the roles they play, you will never see them the same way anymore after this. Impressive performers, great ensemble cast. And Josh Brolin who has the nag for choosing good gigs to do, gives a haunting performance. There's one scene where his character, Dan White, sits on the couch and you can see from the looks on his face, that all his frustration, anger and jealousy just clouding him, coming down and taking over his soul. A performance worthy of a best supporting actor.We know that Sean Penn is one of the greatest actors of our generation but that whole sentence will mean even more after you've watched MILK. It's unbelievable how he successfully becomes Harvey Milk, it's like Sean Penn is not who you see on the screen, his transformation is simply extraordinary. Penn's got the charisma and the astounding ability to make us connect with his character. I'm glad movies like this are made, and I think more movies like this should be made. By that I mean, inspiring, heartfelt, mesmerizing, real human drama that won't hide in the closet but instead, would dare to go out to show the changes that need to be made.I don't believe in Gay Marriage, when it comes to that issue, I'm an old-fashioned guy but I do believe in equality, in human rights and treating your fellow mankind and neighbors without prejudice and discrimination no matter what the race, religion, ethnic, and sexual orientation may be. My old man once said that if a person has the balls to start a revolution, to change something that most other people would disagree with, then that person is as good as having signed a death wish by assassination. I guess that's how you distinguish a good leader from a great leader, to what extent would you be brave enough to believe in the cause and start something drastic and new only because it's the right thing to do?",9,6,15,28 November 2008
Wanted," Way Cool!
","'Shoot this MothaF**ka!' a catchy line said by Morgan Freeman's character is going to go down in history as one of the most memorable taglines in the history cinema, up there in the same level as 'Say Hello to My Little Friend'. WANTED is as ridiculous as it is awesome. The concept is so far fetched, and yet the visual effects are very well done, you won't mind seeing those curving bullets some more. It is a high octane, eye candy, entertaining action flick.Based on a graphic novel I've never read, so I can't really do a comparison, but seeing that it's got plenty of silly, off the wall sequences, I can imagine that something like this could only exist from the vision a graphic novelist's creative mind. A bullet crashes in a head on collision with another bullet that kinda stuff will leave you saying, 'Come on, Get the F outta here!' But the truth is WANTED doesn't care about people who think too much, this is a movie for those of us who choose not to over-analyze it and insteadwe need to just let the movie show us what it's got, for everything that it can offer.The storyline is decent at times, it's very predictable. But that's no surprise, in fact besides the curving bullet dealI don't think it's completely an original thing. I think they're right when they say that WANTED is like Matrix on Steroids> And thenThere's a part where James McAvoy's character jumps into a window of a warehouse and starts killing everybody, that reminds me of Christian Bale in a scene from the movie Equilibrium.You gotta hand it to 'em thoughCinematographer Mitchell Amundsen and Director Timur Bekmambetov have made the movie look as thrilling as possible. Danny Elfman's upbeat, catchy, original score does help a lot in getting our mood into the adrenaline rush. And I think every action movie fan everywhere will not get disappointed, some might just say it's all right but I doubt that many would say it's a failure.My friend who watched the movie with me, Screener Yara made a very good point, concerning the underlining theme. Despite the strong violence and the slo mo bullet time, it does to a certain extent has a lesson to learn. Why do we live day by day being bored and miserable when we know we have the talents to be and do so much more.Angelina Jolie in this movie is more of a supporting role. She doesn't get much line to say, her presence is more for looks so that the movie would have one badass killer with killer looks. James McAvoy is excellent at playing a guy who's scared Sh**less. Morgan Freeman has played a bad guy before (Lucky Number Slevin) so it's good to see him not playing a good guy again. He'll have that cold stare like something bad is about to happen if you keep eye-balling him.We're not saying you should go out there and start learning how to become an assassin. The point is, if you have what it takes to speak your mind and do something you know you're destined to do but you choose to get stuck being pushed around because you can't stand up for yourself, that's just as pathetic as not doing anything at all. What have you done today? And if it's the same thing you did yesterday and the same thing you'll do tomorrow,.. then there's definitely something wrong with the picture",8,13,28,21 June 2008
The Love Guru," Prepare to laugh... and be Enlightened : )
","A new Comedy movie by Mike Myers that will tickle your funny bones in a silly way. It won't make your side hurt from laughing too much but it's funny enough that you won't mind seeing it again just to be entertained. Not all the jokes hit the target but the humor in general is meant for those of us who are familiar with Mike Myers' type of comedy. In times when it seems like a comedy movie has to be vulgar or show genitalia just for the shock effect, it's cool to see something like this that has some suggestive sexual elements without being unnecessarily graphic about it.I can understand why the Hindus and India people everywhere keep e-mailing me asking me to boycott this movie. THE LOVE GURU does contain some stuff that might offend certain ethnicities or beliefs. Especially how some names are made to sound like Indian but they mean something funny in English.But I don't think it means to make fun of a culture if you notice carefully, I think the movie makes fun of Bollywood movies. I grew up watching Bollywood movies, so it cracks me up when Mike Myers and Jessica Alba start to spontaneously sing a silly song in the middle of a field, song that sounds just like the ones I've heard in Bollywood movies.Not to mention this movie also features popular American songs accompanied with Indian musical style and instruments.I'm not sure how Mike Myers does it, but he always seems to manage to get celebrities to do cameo in all his movies.You'll notice some famous faces show up, not for the money, but for the surprise and for a chance to be in a gig with Mike the Myers.I find it hilarious how the characters would greet one another by saying the name of a famous TV actress, Mariska Hargitay.The special effects are okay, the best one is Mike Myer's character as a child.The self-help storyline is very complimentary, it's not preachy and in fact, it's comical and profound at the same time it sure means a lot that this movie is approved by Deepak Chopra himself.I'm not a fan of Jessica Alba's acting I think she needs to take lessons again, but I have to admit, she's never looked so gorgeous.Justin Timberlake's performance in this movie is rather annoying. When I saw the trailers months ago, I thought man, JT looks like he's going to to be hilarious. But in fact, his fake Canadian French accent and his mannerism and the whole joke centered around him being supposedly endowed are more irritating than amusing.Ya know how some comedy movies would start out with a bang but then it dies down halfway through the end. This one kinda has some unfunny, dull moments in the middle, but then it picks up again and it ends with a joyous celebration literally The force that holds it together in the end is none other than Mike Myers himself who's got the charm, the wit, the outrageous facial expressions and the comedic timing that are all in harmony with the ultimate enlightenment that is THE LOVE GURU.",7,17,38,14 June 2008
Twilight," Rated T or Teens
","Let me just start by saying that I've never read the book that this movie's based on but I now can see why teen girls everywhere go ga-ga over this. The movie itself is done in a way that it makes you feel like you're watching... a theatrical CW network episode, it's hard not to remember series like Smallville or Supernatural when watching TWILIGHT. It can be clichÃ© at times, but it's to be expected when telling a story about high school romance with complications attached. No matter what you may say about this afterward, you know in your gut that you've just watched an instant teen classic.Just to give you a heads up, if you're going to watch TWILIGHT in a theater room jam-packed with teen audiences, better prepare some ear muffs because they'll be screaming hysterically every time the stars of the movie show up on screen or do something that reminds them of a plot in the book that they've read repeatedly a thousand times.Just as I've implied earlier, TWILIGHT has all the right ingredients to get a teen audience hooked and seated for the whole duration of the story. From the typical dialogue and the typical humor plus the extravagant showcase of super power abilities all the way to the idea of mysterious man with mysterious past would come by and sweep you off your feet with his savior complex. Today's generation goes crazy over that kind of stuff and the movie feeds into that frenzy, if you will. It knows its target market and it does a satisfactory job.I admit, there are times when this movie makes me laugh unintentionally and by that I mean, some of the scenes are so cheesy and exaggerated while other scenes could've done more to entertain but it fell short, I'm guessing it's the same reason with all book-based movies that try to pack everything into one presentation without hitting a 3 hour mark. What you get in the end, is an attempt and hope for the best.Director Catherine Hardwicke has done a lot to make sure that even if the teens could notice flaws or changes in the adaptation, they could still enjoy the chemistry between the characters and the escalating intensity that it promises from the beginning to the end of the story, not to mention also some hints of 'cliffhangers' that suggest a sequel is underway.But I'm betting my money that the thrilling cinematography by Elliot Davis is going to get millions to visit the locations of where this movie was filmed. If the landscape doesn't capture those teens, then the way the camera often does close up focus on Robert Pattinson's face will. That's another thing that also cracks me up, how the movie goes the distance to weld into teen's minds that Pattinson might be their next Greek god.So overall, I wasn't fully disappointed but I wouldn't consider it an incredible movie-watching experience. As long as it has decent visual effects, I'm there for the next installments. TWILIGHT serves its purpose and it goes to show that an unlikely romance story between two different characters from two different worlds, to some, will never get old... in a funny way, it plays on the stereotypical assumption that some girls fall for interesting bad boys no matter how risky the relationship could get. At one point, Bella is so head over heels for Edward that she's willing to be vampire too while Edward tells her that she doesn't know what she's talking about. Love at such a young age does tend to get some people to do things without thinking clearly about it first. TWILIGHT should've been rated T for Teens.",7,2,8,22 November 2008
Revolutionary Road," We Can Be Happy Here
","Sam Mendes who likes to accompany his movies with the simple yet soul-searching tunes of the piano by composer Thomas Newman has come up with another heavy emotional drama that brings out the best in each of the actors involved. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD gives the utopia 1950's suburbs its dark and hopeless mode, a trap of all things ordinary. It may not be a feel-good movie but it has a certain fine art to it.I don't believe there's such thing as a perfect marriage but I've never seen such a dysfunctional marriage as messed up as portrayed in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD either. The story based on Richard Yates' novel is a bit twisted, in my humble opinion. Having said that, I think Sam Mendes does an magnificent job at directing, and just like American Beauty, he once again successfully uses the small spaces of the kitchen or the living room and turn them into a war zone or a battleground between a couple whose love for each other has grown cold. I'm not sure what attracts him to these kinds of stories and characters but it seems like Sam Mendes has found his specialty. Once again, Sam Mendes' go-to guy for original score and music selection, Thomas Newman doesn't disappoint, he picks the sound of the 50s that fit into every scene, emphasizing piano as the lead instrument, especially the silence between the notes capturing the state of mind of the characters when they re-think what just happened and think about what they're about to do.Leonardo DiCaprio will floor you with his explosive, raw performance as Frank Wheeler, the husband who for some reason is too afraid to leave his comfort zone, he lets people's talk to mess with his judgment, he's too proud to make any drastic change. Kate Winslet who is attractive and marvelous in every movie she's in, radiates greatness as the wife, April Wheeler, who can't stand living an ordinary life anymore but is sick and tired of not being able to get Frank to buy into the idea of moving away for a better life in Paris. Frustrated and angry, she's a tough cookie that finally reaches her limits. Michael Shannon who plays John Givings, a man fresh out of the psychiatric hospital, does an excellent job as the unlikely voice of reason. In a mad, psychotic, unconventional way, he serves a harsh shrink to the couple who may not want to hear what he has to say but somehow they know that his opinions are true, his words are insensitive and hurt like hell but they're true, every single word. Shannon has always been good at playing a character who seems like he's lost a screw in his head, another actor I can think of who's also really good at that kind of role is Gary Oldman and young Jack Nicholson years ago.This is not just a movie for married couple, this is for those who have the misunderstanding mentality saying that once you've settled down, that is it, You can only build your idea of happiness around that one enclosed environment and anything beyond that would be considered unrealistic and immature. This is a movie for those who are cowards and can't seem to take chances in life other than what's given to them in the most usual setting. This is a movie for those who have forgotten that being in relationship means being able to make big leaps with your loved one based on faith and love. You are not going to get mushy happy feeling after watching this movie, some of you might come out feeling a bit empty and depressed but I hope this story reminds you that your happiness is what you make of it, and not some norms that the world requires you to follow.",9,20,35,27 December 2008
Bolt," Lightning BOlt
","BOLT may not be in the same class as WALL-E but it's still just as entertaining, touching and genuine as any other great animated films that have more than meets the eye. I like watching movies like BOLT because you're bound to not only... have a good time but you'll also get that mushy feeling from its heartfelt story. No matter how tough you think you are, the themes of friendship, family, loyalty will always get you every single time. Definitely a must-see! Especially if you have pets If I were to say anything against BOLT's graphics and animation, it would be like having watched the movie with my eyes closed because the fact remains, the amusing 3D visual effects that this movie treats you with will guarantee the most absolute thrilling, adventurous fun a family can enjoy. They say God is in the details, you'll be hugely impressed at the extent that this movie is willing to go to bring us the most surreal looking dogs or cats or pigeons, just as good, if not better than some of the other CG animated movies I've seen in recent years.Once again, the story will keep you at the edge of your seat. The fast-paced action sequences when BOLT is the show's superhero dog or even when he's not the superhero dog he thought he was. It can often be silly and yet you're glad it is.There's one character, the hamster named Rhino who is just the funniest sidekick since Dori in Finding Nemo. Rhino will get you laughing and laughing and you will beg for more.I gotta give props to John Travolta as the voice of Bolt, Travolta's got the ability to connect with his character and the audience, I'm aware it's just voice work but it's still hard work to make it convincing, he's got the comedic timing and the determination that is BOLT, the dog who is in total denial,.. motivated only by its hope that its person, Penny, will love him back.Watching BOLT is a lot like watching TOY STORY 2, there's that unlikely friendship and teamwork themes to it and at the same time, it's also about how the toy/pets' owners or the humans often would get to a certain point where they'd abandon their toys or their pets resulting in... stray animals walking the streets. The network show that got Bolt famous easily replaces him with another dog, that's how much one can take something for granted. BOLT could be like a spokesperson for animal shelters and adopt-a-pet organizations everywhere. It is truly a movie that's good for everyone of every age.",9,11,17,22 November 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Some Things Last
","Director David Fincher has crafted a masterpiece. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a an artful drama that soothes your soul and makes you ponder. This movie is remarkable in every way. What starts out as a period piece becomes... a journey of a lifetime filled with love, life, death and the search to understand and finally embrace the meaning of age and the wisdom that comes with it. Eric Roth's adapted screenplay is perfect, the style of language chosen is well-written, F. Scott Fitzgerald would be proud.You'd be surprised how gentle the direction is considering David Fincher usually associate himself with conflicts and thrillers (Se7en, Fight Club). When it comes to movies like BENJAMIN BUTTON, names like Steven Spielberg or Richard Attenborough might be the first to come to mind as the ones possibly helming such a beautiful film, but nope, it's David Fincher who proves how versatile he can be.Eric Roth who won Oscar for adapting Forrest Gump is definitely one of my favorite screenwriters of all time. And in a way, he makes BENJAMIN BUTTON seem like a much calmer version of Forrest Gump, both characters are often naive, trying things for the first time ever, both stories span across many years, but Button goes grows mature in mind over time even though his body ages backward while Gump, well, still as naive as ever.I really enjoy Roth's choices of dialogue, those memorable quotes that sound so poetic and there's power in the subtlety of it all.Original score by Alexandre Desplat is magical, it gives you the feeling like you're listening to a classic tale or nursery rhyme. Cinematography by Claudio Miranda makes every shot breathtaking, it's like looking a painting and you can't seem to keep your eyes off of it.The production design, art direction, costume, the editing, all of those aspects compliment each other and go appropriate with the timeline of the story. Gotta give the most credit to the make-up dept. The way they make Brad Pitt look old and and grow younger each year as Cate Blanchett would grow older and older instead, it's excellent and mindblowing. You'll be in awe.Great casting decision. Who on earth can look like a teenager even when he hits his 40s other than Brad Pitt? That man is like Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, they never seem to age at all. Brad Pitt, in my opinion, has always been just an okay actor whose image and acting don't necessarily leave with you after you watch his movie but BENJAMIN BUTTON is not his usually movie. The New Orleans accent might be a little rough around the edges but I think he does a fine job here as a man who doesn't force his ways in this life, he shows his intentions but then he'd also things happen as they may, if time allows. His character lives in a place where he sees death frequently, so he learns to accept and never dwell in self-pity and just live, and live to fullest is exactly what he does.Taraji P. Henson who plays Queeny, Benjamin's step-mother, if you will, she gives the performance of her lifetime. She gets my vote for Best Supporting Actress. And who can deny the elegance of the great Cate Blanchett who plays Daisy with such beauty and grace. What an incredible talent.This movie makes you think about how to deal with the fact and fear of growing older. We can either be depressed about it or make the best and enjoy every single minute with the ones you care about and accumulate as much memory as you can because despite what you may think... some things last.",10,2,5,26 December 2008
Defiance," The Fighting Jews
","Most WWII drama would have the Jews on the victim side, DEFIANCE is one that has The Jews level the playing field. It's a deep, emotional, and riveting tale a true story that deserves to be told. Director Edward Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond) once again returns to what he knows best by dealing with a group of underdogs, outnumbered but putting up a fight. DEFIANCE also proves that the blond James Bond, Daniel Craig, indeed has so much more to offer as an actor. This is the story of The Fighting Jews.The script is well-written, in my humble opinion. The way the story begins, what motivates the characters and the conflicts along the way. When brothers try to decide what happens next, there's bound to be clash, disagreements and temporary separation. I don't mean this to be bad but the story is about Jews who are walking into the wilderness, trying to stay alive. It sounds a lot like Exodus, and just like that book in the bible itself, DEFIANCE shows how tough it is to stick together. There's a group trying to discourage a number of people, some are complaining, some think it's best to go back to the ghetto, some start questioning the leader, and some decide to take power into his own hand and try to divide and conquer. Edward Zwick's direction makes sure the audience can see that the struggle they face is not just about running away from the Germans, but also the threats from within caused by frustration, fear and lack of good judgment. And just like his previous movies, it ain't a Zwick movie if you don't have a final ultimate battle at the end scene, between two opposing sides, in the middle of a vast field. Another amazing work on the original score by James Newton Howard that gives us an intense, pulse-pounding feeling during the battle and the sad, dramatic mood during their travel. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra beautifully captures the surrounding nature and displays how it takes its toll on the characters.The story is disturbingly profound and compelling. There's one lead theme that resounds throughout the entire movie 'We may be hunted like animals, but we will not become animals'. As the leader, Daniel Craig's character, Tuvia, keeps getting confronted by this. He tries to be an idealist, and his brother, Liev's Schreiber's character, Zus, thinks that kind of mindset would only invite threat and danger. But as the story progresses, Tuvia gradually realizes that they're in the middle of war and the lines between justice and humanity have become uncertain in these desperate times. A German officer is caught by the group and he just stands there as they beat the German to death. At one point he's even forced to kill one of his own. What separates us from animals? The ability to have remorse after we commit vengeance and do our violent bidding? Zus believes that Jews, Russians, whichever, are all the same when fighting a common enemy but he comes to terms with the fact that he will never escape the fact that he is a Jew and it's the only values he has left to hold on to, its what kept him from becoming less than a human being.Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell both give excellent performances and are just right for the role but we can agree that this move belongs to Daniel Craig. He seems to like playing a Jew who kicks ass. As I watch DEFIANCE, I'm reminded by his line from Munich, 'Don't F*ck With The Jews' Years from now, he won't be remembered just as another James Bond, but also a talented actor who likes to take on challenging roles and complete them with the utmost respect. Craig in DEFIANCE shows a wide range of ability, you can see through his eyes the burdens of leadership, the not knowing what exactly to do but he's got all these people looking up to him. I wouldn't have thought Craig to be this versatile when I watched him in the movie Lara Croft: The Tomb Raider, years ago.",9,65,112,31 December 2008
WALL·E," A Masterpiece!
","Pixar has done it again! Writer/director mastermind genius Andrew Stanton and his creative crew have crafted yet another masterpiece. I can't even think of anything bad to say about WALL-E. This a movie for all ages, it's cute/adorable and it's got adventure written all over it. You will find yourself cheering for WALL-E. An Instant Classic! This is an achievement that will still be remembered and admired 700 years from now.Let's start with the visual, shall we? Pixar is a brand name for great quality and this one will serve your eyesight perfectly. All the little details, they got 'em down to a T, I meanit's an animated movie, but some of the images appear so close to what they might look like. The desolate earth, the sand storm, the surface of the sun, even the buttons on the control board. I love how they make it seem like there's a camera following WALL-E. It captures certain views from difficult angles that would give you that theatrical feel. The guys who are in charge of the animation and the special effects have outdone themselves. Brilliant.God, I love the music. Composer Thomas Newman (Finding Nemo, Road to Perdition) has been nominated 8 times. I think he deserves another one.Legendary Sound designer Ben Burtt (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) is clearly the right man for the job. We should definitely thank him for every little thing that we hear in this movie. He definitely has the right stuff to assume what a robotic movement might sound like and the rest of other sounds that would take an imagination to create and enjoy ya know.. since those things only exist on the screen.I respect how Pixar does not depend on big stars to voice their characters whereas Dreamworks and other studios' animated movies would depend solely on big A-list names as the voice stars so much so that they neglect the importance of visual, sound, and the story, which often comes off weak. Jeff Garlin is perfect as the Captain who seems incompetent at first but eventually knows exactly what he has to do. Comedian Fred Willard, though only shows up for a few scenes, is excellent as a man who owns a big corporation but he actually has no idea what he's doing.Last but not least, the most powerful element of this movie is the Story. Yes, it's another environmental themed movie, but it's not a lecture, it's not a shove-it-in-your-face reality check.It's a family movie about reminding ourselves what's important in life. We tend to come up with ways to make thing easier for ourselves, we forget that in the process.. not only are we ruining the very planet we live in, we even create distance between us and the very things that make life worth noticing.. the relationship, the firsthand experience, the joy of working and feeling the joy of reaping the fruits of our labor.Let's not focus on surviving, let's focus on living. Why does Al Gore have to tell us that the earth is in trouble, when all we need to do to beware of it all is get off our lazy asses and look around.",Null,1,5,26 June 2008
Valkyrie," Operation Valkyrie Is In Effect
","VALKYRIE is an intense thriller despite the fact that it stars actors who don't do German accent. Having said that, it does have its flaws but Bryan Singer's sharp direction puts you in this race against time that is so well-played, those few flaws can be considered as collateral damage. From beginning to the end, it wastes no time on drama, everything is fast-paced. Entertainment is what you'll get.I didn't like Superman Returns, so VALKYRIE to me redeems Bryan Singer who I think is better off doing thriller/action gigs like this one. He has the sixth sense to orchestrate each scene that is bound to keep you on the edge of our seat. It makes you wanna know what's going to happen next. And just like the assassination plot itself, every little second counts. The key is to remind the audience that nothing ever goes according to plan, there's always a change beyond our control, whether it's the weather or any type of element. What Bryan Singer manages to do is display and escalate them in a way that would get your attention fixed on the screen. We all know how it's going to end, it's based on real history, so it all now depends on showing how they may have pulled this off, it's about the process. Having said that, I gotta admit, this is one hell of a production.Tom Cruise does look like Colonel Stauffenberg, we've seen the comparison photos over the web, but I still think someone better could do the job. Is it just me or does Tom Cruise often seem like he's mimicking Jimmy Fallon where he tries to look serious but you can tell there's a hint like he's about to laugh. But, every time Cruise expresses his anger, I am reminded of how awesome he is at showing mad temper ala Bourn on the Fourth of July. So there is still that good point, if you will. The eye-patch thing looks a bit silly but I'd rather have that than the creepy eye-ball he carries around. I think the movie could've done without it. In my humble opinion, Thomas Kretschmann (King Kong, Wanted) who's also in this movie as the leader of the reserved army, should've been the one to play Stauffenberg. Casting so many well-known British actors to play German officers probably won't throw you off but there has got to be some German actors who can speak English out there who should've gotten the shot at playing these characters.Their plan seemed so perfect at the time. Can you imagine if it had worked?! If only they'd done it the first time around, if only the explosives were more powerful, if only they didn't rush into action without confirming every single assumed information. German people might think their heroes are being exploited by this American-made film but it's obvious that VALKYRIE does intend on doing them justice.",8,5,10,26 December 2008
