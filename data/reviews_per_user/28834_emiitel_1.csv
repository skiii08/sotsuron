The Blair Witch Project," WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!
","*** WARNING **** Spoilers ahead!Don't believe the hype about this movie... it sucks.There is *NOTHING* scary about it.  It is actually ANNOYING. Its about these three 'film' students doing a documentary on the witch.  THey go into the forest looking for her, get lost, and presumably die.  By half way through the movie I wanted to kill the students.This movie is about 90 minutes of pure crap.  It had a great marketing campaign, but that's about it.  There is no real story, per se, just the stupid students swearing, bickering, and whining like babies.  Not to mention the fact how totally IMPLAUSIBLE their situation is.  They are supposed to lost in a forest in MARYLAND... the state isn't big enough to get lost in!!!!  If it was the middle of northern Ontario, then *MAYBE* it would have been more plausible.  All they had to do was pick one direction and walk in it, or follow the river downstream... they would have eventually (and probably within a couple of hours) found civilization.  And one of the students throws away the map... and they even had a compass!  By using the river, there would have been NO CHANCE of them walking in circles.  And ooooo scary piles of rocks, noises, and twigs in the trees... gimme a break. I've seen kids at summer camp make scarier things in arts and crafts and heard scarier stories by the campfire!  As I said earlier, I wanted the students to die (or kill them myself) because they were so STUPID!  If this were real, and they did REALLY die... good riddance and thanks for improving the gene pool.DO NOT BUY THE HYPE ON THIS MOVIE!  You will be disappointed... if you value your money, don't waste it on this film... even for a rental.
This film is no classic... it was a huge SCAM!  Anybody who says otherwise is a FOOL!",1,4,8,14 January 2004
