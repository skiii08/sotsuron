The Avengers," About as Exciting as Watching 'Frosty The Snowman' for the Tenth Time!
","Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares, anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next,Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation! But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes 'wrecked Manhattan.' That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to 'blame' for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter 'D' next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a 'R' after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air! The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time! The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck!",1,102,215,11 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," What A Disney Disaster! Another Sterile Movie For the Masses!
","There's so much wrong about this pitiful film I don't know where to start! As an adult, I found National Treasure: Book of Secrets the most boring movie I have seen on the big screen all year. I had to use every ounce of will power not to walk out of the theater and demand my money back!Before the movie even started, I was forced to sit through an infuriatingly dopey Disney cartoon, which was nothing more than a not-so-subtle commercial for expensive T.V. and stereo equipment. It went on and on and on. Finally I had to close my eyes in order not to get overly aggravated! Wow! How low Disney has sunk to make a buck.The story was written to the level of a 10 year old! There's close to nothing to entertain an adult. It's a blatant and poorly done rip-off of Raiders of the Lost Ark.I can deal with a story that's preposterous if it's enjoyable. But kidnapping the president by walking him through a tunnel. How exciting! Finding a Central or South American city hidden thousands of miles away in the Badlands of South Dakota! Yikes!, how insulting to all the Plains Indian tribes can you get? Or, how dumb do you think the American movie going audience is? Can at least a modicum of reality seep into the story?The special affects are so trite! The props look so fake that I thought they were using an amusement park to film this movie. I was waiting for a water slide to show up any moment! The acting was pitiful! Nicholas Cage had such a painful look throughout the movie I though he must either be embarrassed or ashamed of himself for stooping so low. I realize actors need to make a living. But he, of all people, can pick and choose his film projects. The only good thing I could think of is the scene with President and a cameo of a Hillary Clinton look-alike at the President's birthday party. Since the Hillary cameo was having such a good time at the party, it can be assumed the Democrats won the 2008 election!",1,54,87,28 December 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Do You Hear The Thud Of A Dud?
","It's a bad sign when you hear members of the audience groan! But its not hard to figure out why! This movie was marketed as appropriate for adult audiences, but if the filmmakers were honest they would have marketed The Incredible Hulk strictly as a child/young teen flick, instead.It's been a long time since I seen such a boring and tedious film! Even Iron Man with all its many flaws was better than this sorry story! And what's up with Edward Norton? His acting was so bad it felt like he was reading off of a teleprompter! It was incredibly distracting. Was he drugged, or something? - One thing is for certain: Bill Bixby, he ain't!I also got a laugh out of Hollywood thinking an American audience is so dumb about world geography they would believe the teeming slums of some major city in Brazil is next to the Guatemalan/Mexican border! - Let's say you are in Northern Brazil. To make it to the Guatemalan/Mexican border you have to go through either Venezuela, Columbia or both! Then you must cross through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and then Honduras. Quite a distance! But the Incredible Hulk, who has neither wings, nor magic, nor teleporting abilities or a private jet, makes it all the way to the Guatemalan/Mexican border in less than a night!Memo to Hollywood: I know your going for the quick buck after losing so much money during the Writer's strike! There have been so many awful movies this past Spring (2008) that I'm getting worn out! But I'm an optimistic person. Could you please, please, make you next Comic Book related film as brilliant as Spiderman #3, X-Men #2, the last Superman film or as good as any of the six Star Wars films? Is that asking too much? There are adults who like a good story just as much as you (Hollywood) like to make a ton of money!",1,15,32,20 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Story Written In Gibberish! Tom Cruise Is A Has-Been! Dull, Duller, Dullest!
","This is my third, and final, Mission Impossible! Why? Because the magic from the original 60's series has not once reappeared for more than a split second. I'm now a firm believer that Corporate Hollywood does not have a clue as to what made the original series a hit! Okay, what do you expect from what is essentially a comic book story? A lot! First, I want to be entertained! Is that asking too much from Hollywood? I don't want to groan, or laugh, because of sheer camp stupidity! If I'm in the mood for dumb, I'll go see a comedy! Exhibit A: Tom Cruise stops his heart with electrical wires running on household current and a bowl of water. When he's finally revived, he jumps up, gun in hand, looking for a target, as if he got nothing more than SCRATCH! The audience thought it was a hoot, but this dopey scene belongs in a slapstick comedy, not in an action picture which tries so hard to be taken somewhat seriously!Next, I want some character development, so I can care about some of the characters, just a tad bit. For example, I'd like to know something about this relationship between Ethan Hunt and his newly wed wife. In MI3 romantic love comes across as maudlin and forced. Like a bad 50's movie. Nothing lifts the heart. There simply is no satisfaction on any level! Now comes the acting. When I start yearning for Arnold Schwartzenagger, I know Tom Cruise has hit rock bottom. His acting is not the least bit convincing. He almost comes across as uncomfortable madly kissing his 'wife'. All I can hear in the background is, 'where's my contract', 'I want more money', or 'I got places to be, people to see.' Memo to Tom: What happened to the depth you have shown in Risky Business, Born On The Fourth Of July or Jerry Maguire? If your hearts not in it, don't do it, Tom! Stop treating yourself like some commodity on an exchange! Otherwise, you will wreck your career all that much sooner! It was Friday night, and only about 25 people were in the audience in a theater that easily sits 500, and MI3 has only been out for a couple of weeks! Lastly, I would love it if the story made some sense. Here's one good example: What's the connection to the Vatican City? Nice film-making, too bad it wasn't a travel documentary! Oh, it's so 'cool' when the MI3 crew gleefully blow-up their $100,000 sports car, like any garden variety terrorist, while still inside the tiny Vatican City's walls. But I hope the Pope, or anyone else, for that matter, was not passing nearby! How stupid, on so many different levels, can Corporate Hollywood get? If you need to take a swipe at the Catholic Church, can it at least have something to do with the story? If I have deterred a single person from spending their hard earned money on this trash, then it was worth the effort to write this review. Vote with your pocketbook so Hollywood is not tempted into making MI4! If you got to see it, wait till it comes out on DVD and borrow it from your local public library for free!",1,8,15,6 March 2007
3:10 to Yuma," This Powerful Film Will Give You A Lot To Think About
","Wow! Finally a Western made for the adult mind! Thank you Hollywood for a job well-done! What a delightfully complex film about motivation, relationships and values. It's about a father and a son on the verge of manhood, and another son with an illness; a bad guy who has a strong sense of self and truly knows how to lead; about a society that condones the mass murder of women and children as long as they are Native Americans but not of armed robbers stealing from what was then one of the most powerful corporations on earth - the railroad industry.It's also about a society which tolerates racism towards hardworking Chinese laborers building the railroads; and at the same time allows working-class farmers to be brutally pushed off their land in order to make the powerful even richer. But the only real 'bad' guy society is organized against is the one who steals from the rich and powerful! How incredibly convenient and ironic! This story is also about pride, self-respect, intelligence, courage and even self-confidence. We are also confronted with senseless violence committed by evil men on one hand and the immediate need for self-defense on the other. What's worth risking your life over? Is the central question 3:10 to Yuma asks.There's so much going on this amazing film, there's no way to absorb it all the first time around! What a breath of fresh air to watch such a clever story!",10,4,8,15 September 2007
The Hangover," An Incredibly Boring Film For Brainless Audiences!
","I love humor, it's one of my favorite film genres. And I like all kinds of outrageous comedy ranging from 'Borat' to 'There's Something About Mary' to Spike Lee's 'She Hate Me'. I laughed so hard during these films I thought I would fall out of my seat! This proves I'm certainly not a prude or squeamish! But The Hangover is such a bad film I barely chuckled or even smiled! Anyone who has ever experienced - or dealt with people who have been physically and/or sexually abused will probably feel a bit disturbed by seeing simulated sexual abuse, and calling it funny! I have to admit, I finally walked out of the theater because beside being depraved in a bad way the film was also desperately boring! I could care less about any of the main characters! And the humor was so unimaginative and forced! The film's trailers fooled me into thinking The Hangover would be worth checking out. It's not the first time a trailer was much better than the film, nor will it be the last.Unfortunately, I wasted $10.00 during a recession. The next time I see something as bad as The Hangover, I intend to get a refund!For those who think child abuse is NOT funny read: 'Licensing Parents: Can We Prevent Child Abuse And Neglect?' and 'Raising Safe Kids in an Unsafe World: 30 Simple Ways to Prevent Your Child from Being Lost, Abducted, or Abused'.",1,22,48,7 June 2009
Deja Vu," The Dumbing Down Of American Film!
","I kept my hopes low for this mediocre time machine movie and my expectations were not exceeded! I realize the filmmakers are solely in it for the money. Film is now, for the most part, a commodity like toothpaste and paper towels - and it shows! I wouldn't even be surprised if Hollywood stooped so low as to hired Public Relation firms to write fake positive reviews on internet sites like this one! While I have no complaint with the acting, the storyline is just utterly ridiculous, and boring as tears. I don't think it is asking too much for a story to make some sense, instead of treating the movie going public like a bunch of teenagers looking for some cheap thrills!Where do I begin? This highly professional terrorist has no motive for his madness. He pops out of the blue, belongs to no organizations or movements, and has no ideology, no allies, and no one helping him. Our meany terrorist quotes Thomas Jefferson, claims he's not killing people because the U.S. military hurt his feelings when they rejected him for being 'too much' of a patriot (I kid you not), and all he wants when he's captured is to confess like he's talking to a priest. (Plus a cigarette, of course - don't all bad guys smoke these days?) Oh, please, give me a break! How sanitized a story can you get? The filmmakers and screenwriters of Deja Vu have absolutely no guts, whatsoever, to make any kind of statement other than that terrorists are crazy and get hurt feelings! Wow! What an interesting insight! Next, The U.S. Government has a time machine that uses so much energy it caused the last Canada to New York blackout while doing experiments with just small animals, which, in-turn, all end-up going into cardiac arrest, and dying. But when our fearless hero, Denzel Washington, goes back in time the energy problem miraculously disappears. Keep in mind a single piece of paper was sent through time a couple of days earlier, and it knocked out a whole city's power! The dying problem is also solved too, with a full recovery taking less than a day. Keep in mind, when most people recover from going into cardiac arrest, they are usually not strong enough to waltz out of the hospital a couple of HOURS later! But Denzel is special, and he doesn't even have super powers! When Denzel is shot by a rather large caliber bullet, he begins losing blood fast. So fast in fact, that it's obvious to everyone he needs to make a trip to the emergency room, pronto! Instead he goes over to his women's home because of time constraints. There they wash his wound with water and dry it with paper towels. He miraculously stops bleeding because he washed his wound. No need for stitches or compresses, just soap and water stops bleeding from gunshot wounds. Imagine what other miracles would have occurred if he had the time to wash the rest of his body!I think you get the picture. This is such a dopey film because the stupidity is non-stop! It's a shame films are not rated based on cleverness and intelligence. If they were, perhaps filmmakers would start making more interesting movies!",1,136,230,16 February 2007
Star Trek," Left Me Feeling Flat As A Pancake... But
","I love the Star Trek franchise so much I want to see a new Star Trek series! A lot of fan hopes are riding on this film! The reason for a ten star review! To drive this point home - I actually stopped watching television programing completely once Enterprise (the last Star Trek series) went off the air about 5 years ago! And, I have literally watched every TV episode (and film) of every Star Trek series, in real time, since its inception in 1966! I also collect rare vintage Star Trek memorabilia, have heard Leonard Nimoy, and many others involved with Star Trek, speak at various Science Fiction Conventions from the early 1970's to the present, and I subscribe to a Star Trek fanzine, 'Trexperts,' edited by a one dedicated Star Trek fan, which is still mailed all over the world! Needless to say, the Star Trek universe has had a huge impact on my life!I sincerely hope someone from Hollywood reads this review! In the long run (and that's what Star Trek is all about) you're not going to win new fans by dumbing down Star Trek Into a comic book story solely to satisfy the fickle teen market! I realize a lot of the previous 11 Star Trek movies have been box office flops (and for good reason!) because IT'S ABOUT THE STORY, STUPID! Sure the special-effects-eye-candy is spectacular, the cinematography does not disappoint and the design of the sets are absolutely amazing! The acting ranged from perfect (the New Captain Kirk & Leonard McCoy) to sufficient (the new and original Mr. Spock). And, all the supporting cast certainly held their own! But the story was so unimaginative and preposterous, it came across as nothing more than contrived cardboard drivel.It kind of boggles the mind! There are absolutely an endless number of Science Fiction themes that run through all the various Star Trek episodes. What more do you want? You have about 26 YEARS worth of episode ideas to choose from! Then there are plenty of ideas Star Trek has not explored which is summarized in a single 900+ pages book covering all Science Fiction ever written in any language in the world: 'Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction, Fifth Edition.' It doesn't take a rocket scientist (pun intended) to do the research to come up with new and wonderful ideas! But no! The Spineless Chickens at Paramount had to make a film with as much delight and imagination as the last Star Trek movie dud! What an incredible insult to all the Star Trek fans that have spent their time and money supporting Star Trek over the years by watching only God knows how many vapid TV commercials or spending their money on film tickets, videos, DVD sets, books & fan magazines, convention tickets and Star Trek memorabilia! Ironically, just two days a ago I rushed out to see the brilliant science fiction animated film, Battle for Terra, before it was yanked out of the theater to make room for 'Star Trek.' It's hard to believe, but it was showing on a mere single screen in a metropolitan area with about 1.5 million people! Despite the magnificent animation, storyline, and acting - staring both Danny Glover and James Garner (of all people!), it was a miserable flop at the box office. Why? Because the story was both too imaginative and gutsy! Something the Star Trek franchise once was like - a long, long time ago! I can only pray that in the future Hollywood's goal of maximizing profits does not win out over substance and delight!",10,3,14,9 May 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The Perfect Antidote For A Cynical World!,
","I have to admit, The Chronicles of Narnia is an fascinating story that will stand the test of time! It's a true saga, like the Lord Of The Rings!What moved me most was how each of the four children & teens grew, as individuals, and as a family unit. It's so easy to be selfish and only think about one's own needs. It's refreshing to see characters not only being concerned with each others well being, but also with the the community-at-large. One, which happens to be so incredibly alien, it takes a lot of courage to care!In the world of Narnia, these four young people have real power! Their decisions have incredible consequences! One choice is to take risks, the other to retreat into safety and comfort. The adults in the audience, I'm sure, can identify with this tug-of-war. This quandary effects us all at some point in our lives.Another theme addressed is War. The opening scene shows the bombing of London during World War 2. I knew someone who actually lived through this experience as a child. It left lifelong scars. In the very beginning we see train loads of children being evacuated to family, friends, or even benevolent strangers in the much safer countryside. I said to myself, this is what war is really about: desperation and separation. It brought tears to my eyes. If anyone had experienced what my English friend did, first hand, as a child, they would think twice before starting or supporting war, period! While a war is fought in Narnia, this one is to prevent the collapse of civilization, at the hands of evil geniuses, just like in Lord Of The Rings or World War 2. Perhaps, if that was the standard the human race could agree on to wage war, then this ancient scourge would, indeed, finally become a thing of the past!The filmmakers should be congratulated for bringing a fairly complex story to the big screen with dignity and inspiration. I'm sure C.S. Lewis would be proud! P.S. I saw this magnificent film a second time on the big screen, and I'm glad I did! The feelings of elation and awe are much appreciated! Memo to Hollywood: Start making more movies which are uplifting and your bottom line will uplift, too!",10,0,2,2 June 2007
"I Love You, Man"," The Rebirth Of Platonic Love Between Men!
","The United States, in general, is quite a homophobic country. Men are expected to have platonic feelings of love only for immediate family members, such as parents, grandparents, siblings and their own offspring. Sharing one's nonsexual feelings of love outside this tiny world is basically considered taboo. In other cultures this is certainly not the case, something I had the good fortune to experience first hand!I Love You, Man does a superb job of comparing and contrasting heterosexual women's emotionally rich, same-sex friendships with heterosexual men's typically barren, same-sex friendships. It exposes the hypocrisy that it's okay for women to hug and be emotionally close and talk in graphic details about their sex lives amongst themselves, but NOT for a man to do the same exact thing! What a refreshing and insightful film! This brilliant story also compares male homosexual and heterosexual same-sex relationships and on the surface, at least, they are indistinguishable! This might be news to some people - but all well-adjusted human beings have a yearning for emotionally rewarding relationships! And, one person can not fulfill ALL your emotional needs! It's really that simple!Thank you Hollywood for taking such a risk in making such a profound film with a great sense of humor! It shows you believe a certain segment of the American public is mature enough to want to explore the meaning of platonic love between men!",10,2,6,31 March 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Folks Will Be Watching This Film A 100 Years From Now!
","I'm glad to have lived long enough to see a movie of such pure greatness! Mark my words, this film will go down as one of the top films of the 21st century! Imagine! A love story between two men that will probably sweep the Academy Awards in one of the most homophobic countries in the Western World! Gay people have more civil liberties in Greenland than they do in the vast majority of the United States! How ironic! I have had the good fortune to have seen a few extremely wonderful gay themed movies, like Common Ground, starring Ed Asner. But Brokeback Mountain transcends sexual orientation and all other classifications we like to lump people into! It's about ultimate erotic love, mutually shared, between two adults. Something many of us will never truly experience in our entire lives. This brilliant story is a wake-up call to all of us, Gay, Bi-sexual, Straight, or any combination thereof. Life is too short, nothing, absolutely nothing, is more important than experiencing this kind of passionate, loving relationship shown in this mind boggling movie! I thank the author, screenwriters, producer, director and the actors for all sharing their genius, passion and greatness with the rest of us! You have changed my life forever!",10,22,25,1 June 2007
The Prestige," What A Dark, Dreary and Dopey Story!
","Is it a sin to want have an enjoyable time when shelling out my hard earned money? Is it too much to ask to have the story make a tiny bit of sense? Am I being unreasonable to want to at identify with, or even like, at least one of a story's characters? In my humble opinion - that's not really asking for too much! When driving home from the theater, it crossed my mind that the two magicians are like Karl Rove, (the Republican party strategist and America's #1 Faustian) - they will do absolutely anything to 'win!' As far as the story's two main character's are concerned, that means even commit murder (repeatedly in one case), or drive one's wife to suicide! Perhaps the filmmakers were attempting to drive this point home - there are people like our two magician madmen in the real world! While the word 'obsession' is mentioned about a hundred times in this godforsaken story - it's misleading, like a magician's trick. What this film is really about can be summed up in four words - 'the banality of evil.' How ordinary people can lose track of the simplest of concepts - 'right and wrong. 'The ends don't justify the means. Being famous, powerful, 'and the best' is not more important than love, family, community, friendship, or even one's soul! What a terribly demoralizing story! The only very small bright spot in this entirely dreary film, was bringing Nikola Tesla, the great inventor and energy theorist into the story. His genius is absolutely fascinating. Too bad most viewers will think he's a fictional character like the rest of the story, instead of an important historical figure! It's a shame the story didn't evolve around him! It would have been a tad bit more entertaining! (Put his name through any reliable search engine, and see for yourself!)",1,18,48,17 February 2007
Cloverfield," This Film Is So Rotten I Got My Money Back!
","That's a first for me, and I've been going to the movies for close to 40 years! The film jerked around almost constantly throughout the entire movie! It was so bad that a warning was posted all over the place at the movie theater I attended. The sign read: ' Warning! This film will can cause motion sickness similar to that of a roller coaster ride!' I have to admit, I thought at first the theater must be kidding, but when I ended-up getting Sea Sick, the warning was a gross under statement!The acting was so bad that you end-up caring absolutely nothing for anyone in this pathetic film! All the characters came across as two-dimensional cardboard, with a pretty face! The beginning of the story reminded me of a dull soap opera until the monster strikes, then it reminded me of a campy, Made-in-Japan, 1950's style, monster movie! How dull and unimaginative can you get? I guess the worst part was how much the destruction was made to remind anyone without amnesia how horrible the 9/11 disaster was! What a filmmaker will do to make a buck! Members of my own family missed being killed or injured by the skin-of-there-teeth, or from dumb luck! Do I, and tens of thousands of other movie goers, who were directly affected by 9/11 need to be reminded of this real life horror when we go out to be entertained? Memo to future filmmakers: Try and have a little imagination and wreck a different city next time! And to think the director of this film, J.J. Abrams, is the same director working on the new Star Trek movie. I can just imagine what a muddled mess he's going to create if Cloverfield is the best he can do!This is, without a doubt, absolutely one of the very worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life! What ever you do - don't bring your children, or someone with post traumatic stress issues, an inner ear infection or prone to migraine headaches to this movie! You'll be doing them a very big favor, indeed!",1,21,84,30 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Gruesome Violence Ruins What Could Have Been A Great Movie!
","After the movie was over I felt outraged and shocked. The violence in this film is so morbid and intense it was overwhelming. In this movie you will literally learn the how to torture someone with the correct tools. You will see so many people have their brains blown out, most at point blank range, you will lose count. You will see the brutal murder of a father & son, a kindly teenage girl, a benevolent doctor, a man with a handicap, not to mention numerous young men. We get to see a rivers of blood while a women bleeds to death from childbirth. A man have his leg amputated due to gangrene. Another man (who is merely human, in case your wondering) is brutally stabbed in the back, heart and face, and he gets up a few minutes later as if he just stepped on a tack. (Some guys have all the luck!) We even get to see him stitch his face back together again in graphic detail. (Sorry, I can't tell you more, at this point I was looking away).The world of 'fantasy', on the other hand, is virtually devoid of all violence. This ancient Pagan world is, for the most part, quite loving and sane. A very sad commentary on Franco Spain during the early the 1940's. Unfortunately this magnificent 'fantasy' world makes up less than a 1/4 of the movie, while the constant brutal violence and turmoil of the 'real' world makes up the rest.Here are some of my conclusions: If you bring a child or an emotionally fragile person to this particular movie they may end up needing the services of a psychiatrist. THIS MOVIE IS RATED R FOR A GOOD REASON - EXTREME VIOLENCE! The critics who raved about how great this movie is should be on the front line covering the war in Iraq. Pan's Labyrinth is a fantastic example of lazy film-making. It's cheaper to show flying brain goo than it is to create a magnificent fantasy world in all its complex beauty. Many of today's filmmakers and screenwriters think the general movie going public are idiots - nothing can possibly be left to the imagination. We need to be shown everything like a five year old child. The general public is divided in two very broad groups: One that either enjoys and/or could care less about watching intense violence and suffering - and those who find it troubling or annoying and do not enjoy watching people being maimed and murdered.The movie ratings system in this country is a joke, and an extreme example of hypocrisy. When Al Gore's brilliant documentary, 'An Inconvenient Truth,' received an 'R' rating for an under five-second scene of a Katrina victim's corpse floating on his stomach, and a movie like Pan's Labyrinth gets the same exact rating - then it's time to radically change the movie rating system in the USA, pronto!! Perhaps, instead of an 'R' rating we could have two new ratings: XV for extreme violence and XN for extreme nudity & sexual situations. P13 would become MV for moderate violence & MS for modest nudity and sexual situations. Meaningless PG would become G. Then those of us who don't want to read opinionated and biased reviews picking apart a film before watching it could get an honest indication of how much sex & violence one could expect. ( By the way, there is absolutely ZERO nudity or sexual situations in Pan's Labyrinth! I guess sickening violence is more profitable!) I know we don't live in enlightened times, and present day film-making is a graphic indicator of this unfortunate fact of life! But I have learned a valuable lesson - Expect an 'R' to mean gruesome violence except if you are doing a documentary on Global Warming!",1,25,56,12 February 2007
Watchmen," A Sobering Story About The Stupidity of the Human Race!
","This story was written back in the 1980's when the Cold War was still unfolding. Those who are too young to remember the fear of nuclear war and that the Commies would someday be knocking on our doors -are lucky! It's sad to say, but ALL wars from the Korean to Vietnam, and every other war American's funded throughout the world - in mostly poor, Third World nations - were all caused by the never ending Cold War! Keep in mind these numerous wars cost millions of lives and many billions of dollars! Watchmen, while a fantasy, is certainly realistic when it comes to the fear many people around the world felt. (And, this is an era, which should be carefully studied by every student in the United States before graduating high school, but I digress....) In Watchmen there are very few good guys! The violence is so gruesome at times I had to repeatedly cover my eyes! And I'm in my 40's! I WANT TO WARN PARENTS THIS FILM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG TEENS! If the gruesome scenes of violence don't disturb them, they need to get some help! While the Watchmen is a fantasy/science fiction/drama/chick flick -it's also a horror film! This is NOT some cutesy Super Hero story! Watchmen is an important film, which will soon be forgotten because of the extreme violence and, at the same time, for it's deep political message. This is also an anti-Republican and anti-conservative film -as blatantly political as you can get! This is the part of the story I love! While Richard Nixon and the toady Henry Kissinger were no dummies by any stretch of the imagination, they both were accurately portrayed as morally bankrupt and plain crazy! But the bottom line here is that the majority of voting American vote these monsters into office and then collectively shrug their shoulders when rotten things happen! To say that the Watchmen is a sobering story about the sheer stupidity of the human race in general - and the American people, specifically, is an understatement!",5,1,6,8 March 2009
Knowing," A Story So Profound I Started Sobbing!
","What a deeply spiritual film about love and trust! Love between parents and children, and the mercy extraterrestrial aliens have for human beings. It's also about trust in a Supreme Being (God). My favorite line in the entire movie is: 'This (Life) is not the end! and the reply,'I know!' It's also about the ultimately ridiculous dichotomy between spirituality and science! What a brilliant and cathartic story!One must be patient while watching Knowing. This is NOT a film for children, the faint of heart or someone looking for a good time! The story does not come together until the very end. There's also a lot of hysterics! How would any us react in such a desperate situation? Knowing, is about making personal sacrifices! It's not a story to make the viewer feel comfortable! I could have done without the graphic violence of one disaster after another! But Knowing makes a point of not taking this life for granted and that one should live in the present as much as possible! The other obvious message is that loving relationships between people is the most important part of being human! I was reminded while watching Knowing of my Astronomy professor, who said, 'Human beings would be like ants to an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Why would they care about us?' Maybe they would care about us! Knowing makes it's case that it's certainly plausible! Thank you Hollywood for making a mature Science Fiction film for an adult audience! It took a lot of courage to make a movie so deep in a world so crass and shallow!",10,7,18,22 March 2009
Dreamgirls," Tedious Soap Opera Musical! Chicago It Ain't!
","Full Disclosure: I forced myself to see this film at my historic, 63-year-old, locally owned theater because they are facing a bank foreclosure in 11 days. (If you ever lived in the City of Baltimore - The Senator, with probably the single largest movie screen in Maryland, is in danger of closing it's doors forever.) However, I did enter the theater with hope, no matter how slight, that I would leave feeling entertained! Call me old-fashioned, but I like to care about at least one of the characters in a story. Even in a godforsaken, awful movie I will sit through the whole tedious thing, if I can empathize with at least a single character. In Dreamgirls, I literally felt like I was watching an obnoxious soap opera with very shallow two-dimensional characters. Who cares about a bunch of rich & famous show business losers? For example, after hearing one character say: ' I spent half a million dollars (in 1960's dollars) on drinking.' I practically groaned and said to myself, 'as a young adult, you had nothing better to do with your money during the height of the Vietnam War & the Civil Rights movement then spend it on booze? How inspiring! Granted the cinematography and costumes are absolutely magnificent ! But that's icing on the cake. After a while it wears thin, and it certainly does not carry a story to its conclusion.This movie is all flash and no substance. While there is certainly nothing offensive in this overblown production, having a wry sense of humor, like the very clever Chicago, would have done this film wonders. Also having fewer characters, and better editing, would not have hurt either.I found it quite ironic that one of the songs performed in Dreamgirls was along the lines of 'I've got soul,' something this shallow film sorely lacked!",1,0,3,12 February 2007
District 9," Great Story Ruined By War Porn & Medical Torture Gore!
","I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares! A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that? If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!",1,17,39,18 August 2009
Twilight," A Wonderful Love Story About Ethical Vampires!
","Why can't Hollywood make more movies like Twilight? A fantasy love story that more than satisfies the adult mind and heart! Without a doubt, this is the best vampire film ever made! I can't praise this story highly enough! It is, also, by far, one of the best movies of the year! Wow! I didn't want it to end!! What makes Twilight such a hit? First, it turns the Vampire myth on it's head. Vampires do have choices! They don't have to be evil! In fact, they can form cooperative families to protect themselves from being discovered and from fellow malevolent vampires. Vampires also can love just as deeply as a any human being! In other words, vampires can feel tenderness, appropriately adapt to their surrounding environment and follow a demanding ethical codeBeside the delightful love story, there's superb acting and mind-boggling cinematography. I've never been to the American Northwest before, but seeing this amazing part of the world up close and personal - it's now on the top of my places to vacation list!Thank you Hollywood for a job well done! It just goes to prove you can make films that are both touching and profitable!",10,3,15,23 November 2008
Peaceful Warrior," One Of The Most Profound Films I Have Seen In A Very Long Time!
","What makes this great flick so unusual is the moviegoer can actually learn something tremendously useful and be entertained at the same time! Dan Millman has written several books on his life transforming experiences, I'm so glad he was able to make his story come alive on the Big Screen! What a sheer delight to watch from beginning to end! Scott Mechlowicz, of Odyssey 5 fame, is a wonderful actor, and plays the star role with great passion and conviction. If there's any justice in Hollywood, he should be getting some bigger acting jobs! He's a rising star! Tom Cruise watch out! He may soon be nipping at your heels! Unfortunately, this movie lasted for only a week, or two, at one of my very small, local independent theaters! Where was the P.R. budget? It hardly made a blip on the radar screen! It's outrageous that one of the year's best movies will be a very well kept secret, indeed!Other than Superman Returns, I can think of no other 2006 release that moved me so deeply. While Peaceful Warrior maybe a flop in the United States, one can only hope the same mistakes are not repeated when the movie is released internationally!!",10,1,4,25 February 2007
Ghost Rider," An Entertaining Film Which Does Not Take Its Self Too Seriously!
","Ghost Rider has one very profound line: 'Look into my eyes and FEEL the pain you have caused others!' It was cathartic to see violent criminals being forced to feel the pain others experienced because of their brutal and selfish actions! Something I personally believe we will all face in the afterlife when we experience our own life review! But I digress...This film did not take its self too seriously, nor was the violence gruesome, or excessive. It clearly shows the power of good versus evil in a new and refreshing way. But is still edgy enough so not to be boring.It had plenty of occult symbolism, even touching on Faust! In other words it had something for everyone - older children, teens and adults! If you like a movie where you can turn off the critical thinking part of your brain - than this refreshingly entertaining fantasy film is for you!",10,15,25,27 February 2007
Across the Universe," The 1960's Counterculture In All Its Glory!
","As someone who was literally a child of the mid - late 60's & and a student of the time period, I first want to thank everyone who had anything to do with the making of this film! Your timing could not of been better! You helped me to remember the fervor, passion and idealism that made up the mid-late 60's. It's been many years since I have burst out sobbing in a movie theater! Thanks for helping to lift the fog a bit! As an activist, you have collectively given me some badly needed renewed vigor! I also feel so very, very sorry for all the critics of this movie who don't have a clue about what it all this means, or whose hearts have grown so hard with such bitterness, cynicism or despair; or have just simply sold-out; or plain no longer care! All your ranting and raving and nay saying won't do a thing to take away one moment of the adventure, creativity, experimentation, excitement or passion that made this time in history so great!I also what to thank the brilliant filmmakers for paying homage to so many great cultural icons, organizations and events of the period: Walter Cronkite, the greatest broadcaster of the 20th century. Baba Olatunji, the Nigerian Drummer and social activist, his double looked like he came right off the Drums of Passion album cover! I can now see him smiling from heaven! The tremendous scene with Bread and Puppets, a living, breathing, direct link to 1960's radicalism, warmed my heart! You even went up to their stronghold in Glover, Vermont, to film part of the scene! Bravo! The SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), which did not advocate violence, and the much smaller splinter-group that morphed into an organization advocating extreme measures, called the Weather Underground. The brave Martin Luther King, Jr. and his intervention in a labor dispute, which cost him his life. The historic occupation of the Ivy League, Columbia University by its students protesting both the Vietnam war and the intense poverty that surrounded the school. Ken Kesey and his legendary bus. The Jimi Hendrix & Janice Jopplin characters who show such dignity, and a passion for music. And, of course, the Beatles! Their music reaches deep into my soul. You gave me insights into the meaning of their tunes that after all these years never crossed my mind! I also enjoyed being bathed in all the very colorful special affects. The 60's and early 70's were a time of outrageously bold colors and design. Something brilliantly portrayed in Across the Universe! The only film I intend to purchase on DVD that has been released this year!",10,173,253,1 October 2007
I Am Legend," What A Powerful Tribute To Bob Marley & A Great Movie To Boot!
","There's lot of Bob Marley in this film. My favorite line was the Bob Marley quote about why he was going to perform TWO days after being shot in an assassination attempt: 'The bad people in the world never take a rest, so neither can I.' Bob Marley believed that music and love could change and heal the world. He was a true visionary, and I'm so very glad his very important message has not been forgotten by Hollywood! Playing various tunes from his Legend album makes Bob Marley's dream for peace all that more poignant! I'm a fan of the original Omega Man film with Charleston Heston. Over the years I have watched it about a dozen times. I never tire of it! This remake pays homage to the original. But it's a very, very different interpretation. For example in the original film it was a biological warfare agent that got loose in the world. Now it's a genetically engineered virus to cure cancer that caused the destruction of the human race. In other words -biotechnology did us all in! 'I Am Legend' also made me squirm because other then the occasional Bob Marley tune, so much of this film had zero music or sound effects. After a while you felt the Will Smith character's mind-boggling loneliness. This is first, and foremost, a psychological film. Even the movie theater audience barely made a sound! The filmmakers had tremendous courage not to dumb the story down to the level of adolescent boys. I have been begging Hollywood for years to make a Sci-Fi film suitable for the mature adult mind - so thank you! You've done it! My favorite scene was the very last one. It showed how civilization can survive in the future - by being self-sufficient. Keep an eye out for the ultra-modern windmills and solar panels. The scene only lasts a few seconds, but it speaks volumes! This film will be watched a 100 years from now! It's that good!",10,1,3,15 December 2007
Children of Men," Nothing But Glorified War-Porn! Can I Have A Ticket Refund, Please!
","This movie is a Saving Private Ryan rip-off. It's one man's quest to save another person, from what, we are never told - but why bother with details? The violence is so graphic, and frequent, it must consume half the movie! To be perfectly honest I left the theater feeling bored and empty! I was also incredulous: Where's the story? At least Saving Private Ryan had a beginning, middle and end. This mockery of a sci-fi film had virtually no beginning or end - it felt like one overly long chapter of a book taken out of context. Not my idea of good story telling!I can only speculate this film is doing so well in the United States because a large segment of the American public enjoys watching scenes of incredible violence and destruction. I'm tired of it! It's dreary, monotonous, and annoying! We have enough butchering going on in the real world that I don't need to pay to watch it, too!What makes this movie so incredibly sad is the waste of such outstanding acting talent! Don't actors, and their agents, bother to read the scripts before they sign on? If top acting talent started saying no to junk, then junk would be harder to sell to the movie-going public!What messages are the viewer left with while watching this godforsaken movie? The human race will go barren for no apparent reason. The entire world, except Great Britian, (for some strange reason), will be reduced to savagery. The British government that does survives will, of course, be fascist. Those who oppose the government will have to be terrorists. The good guys are so few, there's only a handful of people willing to save the last child on earth. People become terrorists because, 'they just want respect!' (How touching, I never knew terrorists had such sensitive feelings!) The good guys come out of the blue, and you will know absolutely nothing about them, except they know how to pilot a large boat. People die constantly from stray bullets. (Then don't stand-up while the shooting is going on silly!) So many people die in this film, it becomes an art form: How many different ways can people possibly fall down in the same movie? It must set some sort of record! I repeat! This is not sci-fi! This is a war film, geared to teenage boys and young men. If you want to see really powerful & intelligent sci-fi then let your fingers do the walking over the Internet and purchase (not in any special order): 1. Zardoz, 2. Soylent Green, 3. Beneath the Planet of the Apes, 4. Silent Running, 5. Enemy Mine, 6. Light Years (By Rene Laloux), 7. Fantastic Planet, 8. Final Fantasy - The Spirit Within, 9. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), 10. Bicentennial Man, 11. GalaxyQuest (for comic relief!). While taste in film is personal, like any art, these eleven films, seen together, could change a person's life!",1,6,17,13 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," By Far The Best Harry Potter Film!
","I'm NOT a Harry Potter fan! The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film - very disturbing. But they finally got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining! It stands on its own. It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it! After leaving the theater, it dawned on me that this story is truly from a European perspective. Anyone in Europe who has lived through War World 2 knows first hand what a powerful monster (dictator) can do to a society. It's not an abstraction, like it is for the vast majority of Americans. While Lord Voldemort is physically portrayed as a devil, what he really is is a very powerful war lord. One that would be only to happy to destroy any person, group of persons or institutions that stand in his way of absolute power. He exists for no other reason. He's not after wealth or glory, just raw power! There's even a Neville Chamberlin character in this rather clever film. He and his allies are so blind to the obvious threat of war that they undermine everything they profess to hold dear. They are so arrogant and foolhardy they become caricatures of sheer stupidity.There is so much good that can be extracted from this story - what it means to a leader, that wisdom can come from the most unlikely of places, the importance of planning ahead, there is strength in numbers, don't always believe what you read, improvise in a crisis, help can come when you least expect it!I have high hopes for the final Harry Potter film. If Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is any indication of what is to come - I wait with great anticipation!",10,2,5,11 August 2007
Limitless," A Brainless Film For Brainless Audiences!
","I regret seeing Limitless! But it's a great film for disturbing violence junkies! The violence is excessive and mind-numbing. PG-13 doesn't mean very much anymore! The current movie rating system in the United States is an absolute joke and it should be abolished! Have a sex/violence activity rating system like they do on Common Sense Media! At least that would be much more honest! When stabbing out a man's eye and making him blind (he was already blind in the other eye) is PG-13, then what's next? Scraping out his eye with a spoon? Such campy violence is a reflection of Hollywood's desire to turn movie making into a commodity like underarm deodorant and toothpaste! But at least deodorant and tooth paste serves a valuable purpose something that certainly cannot be said about a tedious piece of crap like Limitless!",Null,0,1,12 May 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Tired Of All The Brutal Violence! Tired Of The Poor Screen writing & Acting!
","My favorite genre is fantasy & science fiction. While I have never been a big fan of the Harry Potter storyline, I like to keep an open mind. I have to say the cinematography and special effects are absolutely magnificent, and the creatures from ancient mythology are always a treat. There are also moments with a wonderful sense of humor, which is especially appreciated. But, when all is said and done, I found this particular Harry Potter episode alternating too often between boring and disturbing.First, the disturbing. An amputation, the brutal murder of a young man, an act of torture, and the wailing of a grieving father, in quick succession, was rather demoralizing, to put it mildly. One thing is for sure: This movie is certainly not made with young children in mind.Was all this intense violence really necessary for what is essentially a movie series for children and teens? In my opinion, it's a sign of poor writing, or worse, pandering to the audience. I can appreciate the need to be edgy and sensational, and the desire to maximize one's profits. But does everything have to be so black and white in the Harry Potter universe? After a while it's starts to become a cliché, and that's boring! The screen writing had a lot to be desired. The editing was terrible. There was a lot of meaningless or annoying dialog. Some of the acting was very weak and shrill.With all the money this film rakes in the Director should be getting the best teen actors in the world, even for minor, or cameo roles. I just can't believe how predictable much of the acting is! At times, it's like a broken record! Then on the other hand, you have some top adult talent that barely gets to say a word, like the Maggie Smith character.I guess I'm expecting way too much from a formula-type film. Something which clearly reflects the dualism in our Judeo-Christian tradition, and our Capitalist system of putting profits first, and everything else, like art, second!",1,1,3,19 February 2008
The Happening," Shyamalan The Schlockmeister Strikes Again!
","I don't know about you, but seeing dozens of people on the Big Screen graphically and creatively committing suicide is not my idea of having a good time! But before I go any further, I want to strongly advise people who are severely depressed, or currently have issues with suicidal ideation (thinking/fantasies ) NOT to see this movie. The violence portrayed can be summed up in one word - harsh! The Happening is also wildly inappropriate for children and young teens! Consider this warning a Public Service announcement by someone who used to work with people in crisis! Personally, it's sad to see Director Shyamalan stoop so low. His masterpiece, 'The Sixth Sense,' is one of the greatest supernatural fantasy films of all time! He obviously likes to work in this genre, and there are plenty of stories written along these lines over the past hundred years to tap into for ideas! But no, he most follow the majority of Hollywood and dumb down his films, too! The Happening will certainly make Director Shyamalan a quick buck, but it will also damage his brand. He's slowing and steadily becoming the 'Roger Coreman' of schlock film making. I, for one, will certainly think twice before paying my hard earned money to see another one of his films in the future!No one is denying that there's an audience for this kind of intense and graphic violence, but there's a much larger audience for intelligent story making. Hopefully, The Happening will take a drubbing at the box office and teach this formerly bright filmmaker a valuable lesson!",1,6,14,14 June 2008
The Fountain," The Soundtrack Alone Was Worth A Trip To The Theater!
","What I liked most about this film is its intense spirituality, fantastic cinematography, moving soundtrack and Tree of Life mythology, which is also historically accurate! The film is essentially divided into two stories, one happening in the real world, and the other coming to life though the imagination of the author. I enjoyed the story within a story approach! It's refreshing!I also like brave movies, which are dreamlike and leave much to the imagination, like 2001: A Space Odyssey. The cinematography is rich and inventive. I think the great surrealists, like Salvadore Dali, would have greatly enjoyed this film! Oh, and the music still pulsates through my soul as I write this review! It reaches deep, and I'm adding the soundtrack to my collection. The music is so magnificent, I feel it's the best part of the entire movie! It deserves an Oscar nomination! I was also deeply moved by the Tree of Life theme that runs through the entire movie. It so enchanted me that I did some research. Not only is The Tree of Life a part of the rich mythology from the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is also a significant aspect of the ancient Mayan culture! I find that absolutely fascinating, so much so, that I purchased a very obscure video documentary, 'Tree Of Life,' directed by Bruce Lane!!While it would be very easy to criticize this unique film for it's various shortcomings, I much rather concentrate on its many strengths. This is one of the few movies I have seen this year that actually was exciting, and I want to encourage filmmakers to continue being brave and taking chances! That's what art is all about!",10,0,1,14 February 2007
There Will Be Blood," What A Scathing Indictment of Capitalism and False Religion! WOW!
","What a disturbing, yet brilliant film! This story is certainly a bit overwhelming, and definitely not for the faint of heart! There's one central theme that runs through the Daniel Day Lewis character's life: financial success at any cost! He wrecks every human relationship in his adult life. He destroys his health! He suppresses his sexuality. It's obvious he's a homosexual, he shows zero interest in women, but he can't let any intimate relationship get in the way of success! He rejects his only son over something so trivial it would be laughable under different circumstances. He admits he's full of hate but does nothing to rid himself of such feelings. He even rejects God and all religion - because he believes in nothing but himself, which in this case is recipe for disaster! Unfortunately, he's a perfect example of the Protestant Work Ethic. He works hard, very hard. He has the single-minded determination to become successful. He's intelligent and knows how to manage people. He's well spoken and very clever. He successfully manipulates both church and the local community to do his bidding. But in the process he damages the natural environment in orders to make his wealth. He steals from others because he can get away with it. He uses an innocent child to gain leverage with those around him. Literally anything goes in order to be a financial success.False religion is the other side of this story's coin. Again the Protestant Work ethic is portrayed as doing whatever it takes in order to succeed . This time it's a preacher who has his eye on the big time. He too knows how to manipulate people to get the wealth and power he wants. While he does not kill anyone like the self-made business man does, and certainly does not deserves his fate, all God means to him is a way of making great wealth. In the end, when that wealth fails him, he admits for the very first time what a foul human being he truly is!This is a very dark cautionary tale about the destructive power of greed and believing that the 'ends justify the means!' What makes this tale so incredibly sad is that the preacher's and the business man's life could have turned out so differently if they did not allow themselves to become corrupt. These two men did not have to become evil in the end! They could have used their success to the benefit of others - something they apparently never learned how to do! But all they cared about was themselves, which, in the end, led to their mutual destruction!",10,2,11,14 January 2008
Hancock," An Annoying Story Written At The Level of A Ten-Year-Old!
","I expected more from Will Smith. He's a Super Star with a lot of clout! He can pick and choose his projects. He brings in the bucks, which is all Hollywood cares about! Then he has the ability pass up junk, like Hancock! The only reason I did not give this film one-star is that the concept of 'redemption' is a powerful one. I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull! And it's hard to imagine Will Smith in a boring film! There are so many glaring holes in the story it became distracting! A good story makes sense within the world the writer has created. When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell, that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey story! Memo to Hollywood: It's not cool to chop-off both of a person's hands in a movie geared for children! Is that supposed to be funny? If you think so, then maybe you need the services of a psychiatrist! And when you do cut off a person's hand and wave it around, it relaxes, it does not remain inflexible. I guess whoever wrote the script must think everyone is as dumb as the filmmakers of Hancock!",2,3,5,10 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," What A Wasted Opportunity!
","Despite all the ridiculous complaining by many Star Wars fans about the previous two Star Wars films being inadequate, this is, by far, the weakest of the current trilogy series. Sure it has magnificent special effects and plenty of shocking scenes. But its all about the story, stupid! Unlike the previous two Star Wars films, which were masterpieces, this finale left me feeling empty, disappointed and a bit annoyed. Maybe the actors were exhausted by an oppressive director. Or, perhaps George Lucas is getting burned out, like his scenes in the volcano. Whatever the reason, Revenge of the Sith certainly didn't capture my imagination like previous Star Wars films did!I also found it annoying that George Lucas would force me to suspend every iota of disbelief by watching a rather lengthy hand-to-hand combat scene take place inches above roiling volcano lava! When its all over, one character practically explodes, while the other has only one tiny burn mark on his clothes! It borders on camp, something George Lucas should be truly ashamed of!Nor did I find it the least bit believable to see Anikin become so totally clueless, utterly naive and a cold blooded killer of children, all at the same time. Its just not realistic to turn him into such a utter moron!George you blew it! Next time you make a movie don't listen to your critics and focus groups. You have the money and power, just make a film from the heart! If you're tired, and out of ideas, get a copy of 'Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction,' edited by Neil Barron, and unleash the genius within!",1,4,9,15 February 2007
Shooter," A Scathing Indictment Of The American Justice System
","I have to admit I found the violence, which was a bit excessive, to be an integral part of the story. In Shooter, the good guys win in the end by a landslide! Not only do the good guys win, but they have to win! The mass murder of innocent civilians that took place in the name of corporate & government power in 'Ethiopia' can not be allowed to happen all over again in Ecuador! In this film you are left only with black & white, life & death choices. While this is supposedly a work of fiction, Hollywood, in my opinion, just substituted Ethiopia for Nigeria, or perhaps, Cameroon!It's a simple fact: There are so many mercenary forces around the world for hire, they are even currently employed, in a huge way, to fight in Iraq against the insurgents! So it's not so far fetched that they are being used in very poor countries to get rid of tribal/indigenous people who are trying to stop large development projects, like an oil pipeline. I know I would get a bit testy if some outside force, in cooperation with my central government, was going to force me off my land and/or harm the environment that my family is dependent on for wholesome food and clean water! (For further information on on this complex subject, see the obscure documentary - 'Pipe Dreams' by Terri Hathaway or read anything by the late Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.)But what does this have to do with the American justice system? I couldn't think of a more scathing indictment than when the U.S. Attorney General, himself, throws up his hands in the air and says there is nothing he can do! How can the most powerful U.S. law enforcement agency possibly stop American mercenaries in the employ of corporate and government interests working both inside and outside of the United States? In other words - when it comes to extreme human rights violations, the lofty U.S. Justice system is powerless, and only the story's hero has the courage, and ability, to stop these foul villains from committing further atrocities in the name of progress!What a commentary on American society!",10,2,7,14 April 2007
WALL·E," What A Profound Cautionary Tale!,
","Wall-E is a surprisingly good film. It's touching, humorous, imaginative and quite subversive. Something you don't see too often in a children's film! I think this brilliant film makes three very important points. First, robots will someday become sentient (self-aware) akin to Data from Star Trek or Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. What makes Wall-E so interesting is that a simple maintenance robot becomes self-aware, unlike Hal or Data, which are the most advanced technology known within their respective worlds. Granted, Wall-E's sentience took place over a 700 year period, but it makes one think if someday this could happen in the real world!Another important insight is the current plague of obesity Americans and many other technologically advanced nations are facing. What I found so fascinating was how, taken to an extreme, the 'Couch Potato' lifestyle would play out in human evolution. Amazingly, humans were literally losing the ability to walk! The toes were even starting to disappear! If machines do all the manual labor, nothing will be left for us to do but engage in shallow conversation over a television-like screen while eating liquid fast food!What brilliant satire! The message is clear! People need to get outdoors more often and enjoy life. Get off the computer, shut off the T.V. and leave your Cell Phone in the glove compartment! Don't let technology rule your life or make you sick!But I save the best to last! Wall-E is first, and foremost, a cautionary tale about wrecking the environment. Through the eyes of an adult, I found this film to be profoundly sobering. In Wall-E's world the Consumer Culture has literally consumed the planet making it uninhabitable. People were so focused on a throw-away economy and vapid entertainment, eventually nothing was left except one sentient maintenance robot struggling to find a purpose. The stupidity and ugliness of the human race was juxtaposed by the beauty of Wall-E's determination to enjoy his existence.What an amazing and poignant story! My hats off to Pixar for attempting to warn us about sustainable living and protecting the environment in the process! If I could recommend one book, which I actually finished the day before I saw Wall-E it's: 'The World Without Us,' by Alan Weisman. I consider this book to be one of the best non-fiction books I have read in my entire life. I can't recommend it highly enough!",10,2,5,30 June 2008
Never Back Down," What a True Testosterone Delight!
","This is one of the most masculine-positive films I have ever seen in my entire life! Sure there's a lot of sweat and hot muscle everywhere you look! But that takes a big back seat to genuine character development - with the primary focus being on the muscle on the left side of your chest (Your Heart)! What an incredibly intelligent story! If only Hollywood could have the courage to do this more often - A 'Fight Club' type movie with zero, I repeat, zero exploitation or gore! This rare, one-of-kind movie is even suitable for older children to watch! It is so sophisticated, in fact, I would even recommend it as an excellent resource for Anger Management classes! The fight choreography is mind boggling! It certainly looks like full contact! If you watch closely you could even learn some very good moves!It also made me reflect on my own High School experience! Where there were certainly a lot of aggressive and vicious bad guys, but very few good guys to stand-up to them. It amazes me to this very day how some teenage boys develop powerful, man-like bodies at an early age, but have the emotional maturity of a turnip! Is this a universal in American society? All this aggressiveness and malevolence to those physically weaker than one's self? Where does it come from? Is it some sort of malfunctioning biological drive? Or learned at home from an abusive parent? If only we could find the right physical trainer as our hero did! Wow! It could move mountains for so many people who are constantly bullied by their fellow, physically stronger classmates!Never Back Down is neither maudlin or trite! It discusses real issues we all will face at some point in our life - like making a big mistake, relocating to a different community, falling in love, defending one's self from physical or emotional harm, dealing with the loss of a loved one, submitting to someone wiser than yourself, and learning to manage anger, regret and grief! This, and a lot more, is covered in this delightful, sheer joy of a film!",10,3,8,26 March 2008
Iron Man," Memo To Hollywood: The Situation In Afghanistan Is NO JOKE!
","I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. - I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon! It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have alway got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, some of the Merchants of Death literally have a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)! Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday! I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!",1,41,104,6 May 2008
Blade Runner," Can Hollywood Leave Well Enough Alone? The Best Cut Was The First Cut
","I have seen both the original cut and the final cut on the big screen. The first Blade Runner left me feeling elated, entertained and full of inspiration. This tired retread left me feeling disgusted and flat.Why disgusted? In the first Blade Runner we witness the snapping of an important man's neck. The one scene in the whole movie that I could have done without, but it didn't ruin the movie for me! At least it was an instant death. This time in the film, for some godforsaken reason, the director had the replicant's kill by pushing people's eyeballs into their brains. It's horrifically shown once and implied twice. Now what possibly does that add to the movie? Is society becoming so sick that Hollywood thinks that's entertainment? Are we so desensitized that gruesome violence no longer revolts? All it did was turn the bad guys (replicants) into monsters. One is left without an once of sympathy for them unlike in the original Blade Runner.Why flat? Well the speech at the end of the film by the dying replicant leader now rings quite hollow. Who gives a hoot what wonders he's seen. Just hurry up and die so you don't kill anymore decent people. While those replicant designers were short sighted and a certainly terribly naive, does that warrant a death sentence? The replicants are like spoiled children: If I don't get my way, I'm gonna throw a tantrum! In this case if you don't 'fix me' I'm gonna push your eyeballs back into your brain! The other reason it left me flat was the 'boy meets girl ending' is so trite! At least the original Blade Runner had what I would consider a passionate ending by a being that does not torture its victims. Too bad Hollywood doesn't pay its writers better, instead of forcing them to go on strike. Maybe then we would have some really daring sci-fi film making instead of this tripe",1,22,64,2 November 2007
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A Wonderful Film About An Important Chapter in History!
","I enjoyed this film so much I actually watched it twice on the big screen! Something I have not done in a very long time. The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!To all those who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the Elizabeth: The Golden Age prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church & their allies in the Spanish government had the armada succeeded in its mission.If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of the dictator Franco!! Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line. Something this brilliant film makes crystal clear, regardless if Queen Elizabeth was no saint!",10,2,4,3 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney Played It SOOO SAFE! What An Incredibly Wasted Opportunity!
","Don't take any chances! Do virtually nothing original! Take NO risks! This is a remake of the first Star Wars movie, not a real sequel. We Star Wars fans have been duped! Disney is gonna make billions worldwide on this film - and on dumb toys made in sweat shops, God knows where - by making a film that is close to an exact copy of the original. Keep in mind there are hundreds of Star Wars stories in print to choose from. Or, God-forbid, someone writes an original screenplay. Oh, no, who would have thought of that? But the morons at Disney know the first Star Wars film was a big hit so why not make it the same exact story only shuffling around the characters: Luke becomes Obi One Kan-obi, our new female heroine becomes Luke, the new bad guy is Darth Vader - even wearing a mask to imitate his grandfather. Oh, my God, who comes up with this utter nonsense? Another death star and another innocent world destroyed. What is up with all the mind-boggling killing? Do people kill billions of intelligent beings just for kicks? Genocide on a mind-boggling scale is glossed over like it's no big deal. That's not exactly the lesson I want my kids to learn from watching Star Wars.What Disney wanted was a guaranteed hit because if it was a hit back in 1977 then rewriting the new movie to be so close to the original will most likely be a guaranteed fortune in 2015. How sad and ruthlessly logical. This miserable film is such a disappointment I will not be PAYING TO SEE any of the sequels and I'm the biggest Sci-Fi fan around! IFTHE American PUBLIC KEEPS PAYING TO SEE BAD MOVIES IN HUGE NUMBERS - MAKING A FORTUNE FOR Hollywood - WHAT POSSIBLE INCENTIVE DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE SOME RISK AND DO A BETTER JOB? ZERO! With that said, I'm glad I went see the movie for myself since I went with a group of friends, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I loved the new droid. He was by far my favorite character in the entire move. I'm also happy to see an African American character being in a Star Wars film from beginning to end. It's about time.",1,99,167,18 December 2015
The Social Network," The Youngest Billionaire In The World!
","Before I review the film, I would like to mention that I do have Facebook account, and its sole purpose is to allow friends who I have lost touch with - and who live all over the United States, and the world - to find me if they want to. I also have a extremely rare ethnic last name and no one in the entire world of 6 billion+ people has the same first and last name, which makes my name unique, so I carefully guard my privacy. I have the barest of personal info on Facebook and the highest of security settings. I also spend close to zero percent of my time socializing or keeping track of people I know through Facebook or other social networking sites. Why? As the Social Network makes perfectly clear: Nothing, but nothing, takes the place of real, live people in face-to-face relationships! After watching Social Contract it left me feeling both amazed at Mr. Zuckerberg's good instincts and his fortitude in not letting anyone hold him back and allowing himself to succeed beyond his wildest dreams - and empty - by his profound loneliness and from the persistent discord that swirled around him throughout almost the entire movie. I also found irony in the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg did not cooperate in any way with the making of Social Network because it exposed his private life to the world - but, yet, at the same time, the general public is encouraged to give him (Facebook) as much of our personal information as we can! Social Network is interesting because you see what a person with good instincts can achieve in the real world. While I don't approve of people mistreating each other, the history of inventing anything important is full of stories like Social Network. For example, patent lawsuits are a big business, that's why we have 'patent' attorneys! (I also found it so delicious that the founder of Napster, who brought the recording industry down on its knees, played a key role in providing critical good advice to Mr. Zuckerberg's success. I know how malignant the recording industry can be. None other than the legendary Nigerian drummer Baba Olatunji told me a how one the biggest record companies in the world viciously screwed him out of a lot of money!)Social Contract is mainly about two things: Interpersonal relationships and money. As far as the 'money' part of the story is concerned: Mr. Zuckerberg is now a billionaire (actually he's a MULTI-billionaire!) With that huge amount of wealth I couldn't help, but wonder, what is he doing with all that money to make the world a better place? At the same time, I kept thinking about the 18-year old gay college student who recently jumped off the George Washington bridge because someone filmed and then posted his same-sex sexual activities all over the internet. He left his suicide note on Facebook! I hope someone close to Mr. Zuckerberg's reads this review and encourages him to start spending some money on organizations that work to strengthen laws that protect a person's privacy and maybe throw a few bucks to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Suicide Prevention Hotlines around the country, also. They are always struggling for money. It would be a most profound gesture, Mr. Zuckerberg!",10,12,22,3 October 2010
