Source Code," A different thriller !!
","I won't be compelled to put this feature in the league of 'Inception' , however the storyline is quite gripping , the characters are believable and the screenplay is brilliant. the '8 minute' theory of something related to the human memory after death though keeps the narrative going , is a little bit difficult to digest, but then this is what sci-fi cinema is all about ....'unbelievably believable ' Thoroughly enjoyed it in the theaters..The introduction sequence (which by the way is repeated for 5 times) repetition is handled very well to bring out small nuances in developing the story.At some places though ....the length of the film seems to drag a bit and at one point of time (about 10 minutes from the end)the film appeared to have ended ...so a little bit of confusion there...",8,1,1,4 May 2011
Life of Pi," And the story of Pi seems irrational but is logical to the core !
","The symbolism of PI a mathematical annotation to irrational numbers has perhaps not been captured so beautifully ever in cinema !! Those who know India and have had the experience of spending even a few days in this enigma of a country know how confusing yet subtly philosophic this country is ...and this is exactly what the cinematic masterpiece from Ang Lee portrays ......To discover who you really are , you need to be thrown in a situation which tests your limits and then 'wisdom' will be given to thee. I have not read the novel so i did not actually know what its all about when I walked into the theater and was pleasantly surprised at so many insinuations & portrayals of the Indian way of thinking of universal brotherhood. Ang Lee keeps the things in a different realm of reality which we all acknowledge does exist but perhaps are afraid to 'test the waters' since we as human beings are conformists by nature and can not leave our 'comfort zone' to think things in a way they should be thought of .......this is exactly why the director succeeds in drawing our attention to small but significant things which need to be understood to make the path more worthy of further discovery......Truly world class cinema with great acting and I will not hesitate in adding that the 'tiger' who plays Richard Parker does deserve an Oscar this season .........",8,16,29,22 November 2012
