The Rock," Surprisingly much better than I expected
","I was hoping for another film in the same league of 'Con Air' and luckily I got it and with less bad language that that film.The acting was universally good, Sean Connery was his usual excellent self and Nicolas Cage continues to prove to be one of my more popular actors.The film dragged out too much at the end and the sudden change from Ed Harris was a bit unconvincing, but there was enough action and suspense to keep me watching all the way through. (9 / 10)",Null,1,1,24 June 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Well, what more can I say. In my opinion, one of the worst films ever.
","I don't like War movies at the best of times, but I just couldn't see that this film served any purpose but to make the audience disturbed and deeply moved at the end of the film. The performances were O.K, but nothing special. It's films like these that in my opinion glorify war, it may have been shown to be horrific, but do we really need to see it and how are we expected to cope if it were ever to happen again when films like this exist.If you want to see a good film, find a comedy or sci-fi, you can watch the film and either laugh or see it as a possibility of a future. A War movie is showing us events of a terrible part of our past, something that does not need to be depicted in such a manner on the big screen. We know war is a bad thing, just film simply disturbs its audience.As you can tell, I really DIDN'T like this film. (0/10)",Null,0,1,24 June 1999
Titanic," The First sign of an excellent movie
","The first sign of an Excellent movie is when over 2,000 people took time out of their day to give this movie 0/10.Winslett and DiCaprio put in some of the best performances witnessed on TV, with a fantastic soundtrack, directing and 'story'.A Perfect film, that will be treasured as one of (if not the best) film of all time ! 10 / 10",10,2,3,27 June 1999
