Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Eternal. One of the looniest toons ever. Far, far, far better than 'Space Jam'.
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a successful movie in every way. And I'm not referring only to the commercial success. I doubt it is that commercially successful now. What I mean is that this is a very good movie, a crazy comedy and a timeless classic. It's original, imaginative, creative and unique. I love its dark atmosphere, which makes it something close to a thriller. This is a quite noisy movie with crazy toon humor, but the fact of being loud and crazy doesn't bother me, it is actually perfect for those who tolerate its noisiness. It's got suspense either. I also love its nostalgic and old-fashioned atmosphere, even in small details, which accent its charm.Much of the soundtrack is jolly and typically cartooned, but there are also brilliant instrumental tunes usually carried with suspense except for an emotional one that plays during a sad scene when Eddie Valiant is looking at old pictures reminding happier days of his life (and briefly in a few more scenes).Although people tend to think that this movie was one of the pioneers in combining live-action and animation, in reality it wasn't. At the time this was already an old Disney tradition. Nevertheless, it's always a clever and delightful combination (when successful, of course). This one is among the most successful on that combination.This was one of my childhood movies. At one point, I even used to watch it nearly daily when I was a child. It was an important part of my childhood. After all these years, it still holds up greatly. However, looking at it through an adult's perspective, the story may be complicated for children to understand and, for a kids movie, it deals with heavy subjects. If there are still kids who watch this, I guess they do it more because of the cartoons - as I did as a kid.As for the cast, Christopher Lloyd is a great Judge Doom and his make-up makes the character look more sinister. Bob Hoskins is terrific as Eddie Valiant and he speaks with a very good American accent (which disguises well his English roots for those who don't know his nationality). The things he does are amazing (acting against the air and other stuff). Alan Tilvern is great as R. K. Maroon (this was one of his last or maybe his last movie role and sadly that actor already died). Kathleen Turner is the right choice to voice such a hot character like Jessica Rabbit with that sexy voice of hers.The later but unrelated 'Space Jam' was a pretty poor attempt to repeat the idea of combining live-action and animation. 'Roger Rabbit' is a classic, but 'Space Jam' will never be one.Title in Portugal: 'Quem Tramou Roger Rabbit?'.",10,2,2,13 December 2010
The Polar Express," Born a classic
","When this film came out 6 years ago, I went to the cinema for it. I was invited by a family member who wanted to watch it. It took me a while to make up my mind, as I was less than convinced about it. For me it didn't seem to be especially promising. I eventually agreed to give it a try. Well, both me and this family member of mine adored 'The Polar Express'. I still remember as if it was yesterday how it blew up my mind and my impression hasn't changed with time. Even at the very first time I saw it, I already had the perception that it was gonna be a classic. Or, more appropriately, it was already born a classic.There are a lot of things to enjoy. It brings fond memories of childhood's Christmases, when we were innocent, ignorant and happy and when Christmas was really Christmas. The graphics are really cool and admirably realistic. Everything looks surprisingly real (the characters, the amazing sceneries and settings). There are lovely Christmas carols, good characters, a nice story that is also a quest to the real meaning of Christmas, magic, colorful special effects, charm...I am somehow thirsty for adventure films, so the fact that this one has exciting scenes with loud and jaw-dropping roller-coaster effects is fine for me and I welcome that.Tom Hanks often portrays irritating characters, which harms my impression on him, making me avoid movies with *that* actor. That's the price to pay for this strong reputation of his. But in 'The Polar Express' that's another ball game. The fact that his participation is vocal helps, but it also helps that he doesn't portray any annoying characters.Most Christmas movies are silly and annoying for me, even though I like Christmas (well, I used to). But still there are exceptions and 'The Polar Express' is one of them. It is one of the very few Christmas movies that really deserve to be called a holiday classic and one of the only with dignity. One of the things which this movie disappoints is the Big Man. He doesn't look too bad, but he looks a little phony. Also, there is a line that bothers me a bit: when the Conductor says «One thing about trains, you know. It doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is to decide to get on». I'm sure that his intentions are good, but filmmakers should be careful with the way these 'messages' are transmitted. They can be badly misunderstood by kids and lead them to very serious trouble and disastrous consequences. Aside these two things, only a few minor cheesy scenes but nothing enough to harm my positive impression on it. Title in Portugal: 'Polar Express'.",9,3,6,14 December 2010
The Orphanage," Authentic, a modern legend.
","Even though we look at this movie and can tell it's perfectly recent, at the same it oozes a certain old-fashioned feeling, which is good. Indeed, it is something of a return to the classic horror stories: simple, deep and intense, has soul, atmosphere (it transmits a cold and solitary atmosphere), film-making of quality, gorgeous cinematography, a beautiful musical score by Fernando Velázquez and expertly done and realistic scares instead of cheap terror and special effects.On a first impression it is a little tricky to understand. It's a great deal of information to 'digest' in just once and sometimes it happens very fast. But the fact that it is complex makes it all the more interesting and distinguish. At least it sets apart from others in a time when movies keep getting increasingly similar to each other. Plus, it gets easier to understand the more you watch it.This is a touching, depressing and tragic story. Certain parts are truly scary. No kidding, they are! Certain events are so sudden, they happen so fast - it's hard to explain, but they catch you by surprise when you less expect. Some of the content is strong and disturbing. I wouldn't recommend this for hyper-sensitive people.The orphanage is enormous and its architecture is very beautiful. Although 'only' an orphanage, it definitely has that creepy, spooky atmosphere perfect for a superior ghost story. It's like a big, sinister shadowy house. The settings too are wonderful.The actors are generally very competent, both the adults and the children. Among the adults, the beautiful Bélen Rueda steals the show with her acting. Among the children, the best performance belongs to Roger Príncep, although each child is rightfully chosen for their role.Clearly a very good movie and a breath of fresh air in the recent history of cinema. Although still fairly recent, it's not too soon to consider it what it is: one of the best movies ever.Of course, Hollywood wasted no time and (already!) in 2007 bought the rights to remake it. What is it with Americans that they have to remake everything? Instead of remaking, why don't they start developing their own ideas and leave the other movies as they are? And if they remake, then they should only remake films that are bad or certain films that are too old and awfully dated (crying for a remake). And I don't think this wicked movie is bad, so I do not approve a remake.I can understand J. A. Bayona's disappointment, to which he famously said «The Americans have all the money in the world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money» and «The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits».Title in Portugal: 'O Orfanato'.",9,5,9,29 September 2011
The Little Mermaid," The best Disney animated classic since 'The Rescuers'!
","'The Little Mermaid' brought back Disney firmly into the map after a period of crisis and less successful movies, even if not all of them were that bad. For instance, 'The Fox and the Hound' and 'The Great Mouse Detective' are not bad. The horrifying 'The Black Cauldron' and the frankly poor 'Oliver & Company' belong to a dark age at Disney, though, and were made during that period.'The Little Mermaid' came precisely after 'Oliver & Company'. And what a difference comparing to that one! You can say that Disney went from one extreme to another. That is, from a deplorable and very cheap-looking movie they went to this which happens to be one of their finest.This film is fresh, lively, charming, humorous, romantic and artistic. It has beautiful artwork and colors, made to a quality level comparable to 'The Rescuers'. Besides, it isn't just a movie about merpeople, it has a story. And it isn't too girly. The idea of a movie about merpeople might sound too feminine for males's tastes, but men and women can be pleased with it in the same way. Take it from me.Since I was a child this has been one of Disney's best to me. And yet somehow it seems to improve with time. My explanation to this is that it ages better than you might think at some point in your life.The soundtrack is always nice, but variable in genre and temperament. There are jolly songs ('Under the Sea' and 'Les Poissons'), a love song ('Kiss the Girl'), a song of hope, anxiety, dreams and optimism ('Part of your world') and a dark-spirited song ('Poor Unfortunate Souls').Ursula is one of Disney's big villains. Strangely she was never scary to me as a kid and I even used to find her funny, particularly when she puts lipstick and the kiss she simulates next. Also, her figure used to amuse me: half fat woman, half octopus. Now as an adult, she doesn't scare me but I can see how pure evil she is and I've gotta admit that there are some pretty disturbing and creepy scenes with her.Scuttle is hilarious. He's a self-claimed 'expert' on human stuff and makes up funny names for objects (in his language, a fork is a 'dinglehopper' and he says people use it to comb their hair; a pipe is a 'snarfblatt' and he tells people use it to play music like a trumpet).Ariel (nice name, by the way) is one of my Disney princesses of election. She looks pretty as a mermaid, but I prefer her as a human. She is simply hot as a human. Plus, as a human she is more shy and adorable, looks more cute and even more innocent, as her face and those expressive, enormous blue eyes suggest. Like the movie itself gets better with time, Ariel looks more attractive with time. Her looks grow on you - at least they did on me. Ariel has qualities I highly appreciate on a woman.Title in Portugal: 'A Pequena Sereia'.",10,4,4,28 December 2010
Jaws," Sensational
","'Jaws' was and still is highly successful as a film and critically. It continues to be the first and ultimate Summer blockbuster.More recent but similar films are much more violent and gory. But still, 'Jaws' was quite a shocker at the time and even now it still is shocking. With this film, Steven Spielberg broke new ground in 1975 just like Alfred Hitchcock did with 'The Birds' in 1963.Unlike more recent sharks's films, this one is solid in its story and as a film. Also, the shark isn't that much seen, being more of an unseen assassin that is slowly introduced. This may be blamed to the reliability problems that plagued the mechanical sharks, which limited the role and made this a challenge to make. But it was worth it because that makes the shark more mysterious and also contributes to make this film the long-lasting legacy it is. Another reason is because the shark looks a little rubbery although it doesn't look too phony and still looks intimidating and petrifying.The director did the right choices for the cast. Roy Scheider is very convincing as the police chief Martin Brody. Richard Dreyfuss is a comic relief as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw was one of those 'old school' actors who, more than portraying the characters, seem to become them. All of this thanks to his performance as Quint, a character who is cocky, arrogant, crazy, rude, cynical, more stubborn than a mule and pirate-like yet hilarious at the same time. Murray Hamilton plays well the Mayor Larry Vaughn, a character who, in the name of the town's interest, ends up doing the opposite: a series of poor decisions. Even the actors who have minor roles were finger-selected.Cinematography is great. Amity Island looks very appealing and inviting and it has that wonderful golden sand beach. Reminds me Porto Santo island.This fascinating film is rich in suspense and horror element and can even count with a creepy soundtrack (the power and the magic that comes from the maestro John Williams). This soundtrack has that quality of mystery and horror. Sends chills down the spine and this sensation gets bigger just imagining that the shark is coming through.All of the deaths are shocking. Each death is as shocking as the other one/s. They are brilliantly made and directed. The death of Chrissie Watkins is terrifying and so are her screams. Alex Kintner's death is one of those that affect me most and you can hear him screaming either. It hurts more to see a child dying so horribly than an adult. The scene when deceased Ben Gardner shows up is sudden and scary. The guy who loses his leg... another shocking one. And Quint's death is the goriest and the one you see closer. Plus, to see the shark tearing him apart and the pain he cries out can make most people freeze. There are also two implied deaths (of two dogs) which are unseen, therefore uncertain.Where this film leaves a little to be desired is in details such as the fact that the 2nd half focus a little too much on the attempt to hunt the shark and a particular use of a long take (the bit when Quint tells his USS Indianapolis story - but fortunately that is nothing compared to the excessive long takes of 'Before Sunset'!) Nevertheless, they could have done, for example, scenes with Brody's wife and kids (and show Michael recovering from the shock he had and returning home) and show Brody returning home to announce that he killed the shark and his wife and kids congratulating him and hugging him at the ending.Now, these are just flaws, but this film is great. A cinematic benchmark. I believe it caused people the fear of going in the water at the time but I am also pretty sure that doesn't happen nowadays and ever since many years ago.Title in Portugal: 'O Tubarão'.",9,6,10,20 November 2010
The Birds," As groundbreaking and terrifying as 'Jaws', 12 years sooner than 'Jaws'
","Like most Hitchcock's films, 'The Birds' is as original as it is dramatic, bizarre, dark and macabre although not as weird as such Hitchcock's films as 'Psycho', for example.The effects are almost unbelievable for the standards of 1963, so much that it wouldn't be far from the truth to claim that even now these effects would be a surprise. Plus, the Bodega Bay scenario is so beautiful that it brings visual appeal and charm to the film.This movie deals with unusual bird attacks against humankind. It's as if the birds had declared war against us. They develop strange and aggressive behavior. Even the innocent love birds act funny (although they don't actually harm anyone). The attacks start off as minor, but eventually increase with increasing viciousness and violence. Innovative, ground-breaking, unique, surprising, shocking, chaotic and great are some of the words that perfectly describe this motion picture. As far as I know, there's nothing quite like it. Think of 'The Birds' as the 'Jaws' of its day.It kind of makes me wonder if this movie made many people look at birds differently, particularly those who had the chance to watch it in 1963. The birds responsible for the attacks are seagulls, crows and perhaps even ravens, birds known for their bad temper. Gulls are such beautiful, elegant, graceful and noble-looking and confident-looking birds that fly beautifully – even though their foul temper is another one of their trademarks.There are many memorable scenes. In fact, all of the birds's attacks are memorable scenes. Even the birds's sounds when they make noise, peck and flap their wings are awesome. This film makes a great combination of terror and suspense in an old-fashioned way with its old-fashioned charm. It is also rich in light humor. The cast is clever and quite interesting. Rod Taylor is terrific and great fun as the smug but cool and charming lawyer Mitch Brenner. His chemistry with Melanie Daniels (well portrayed by Tippi Hedren) is perfect in a most unusual and, most of all, hilarious way. I love it how they keep telling lies to each other and the way they are clearly enjoying that, which results in many memorable moments of comedy. Equally hilarious is how two men kept saying that the little Brenner girl's name was either Alice or Lois when her name has nothing to do with those: Cathy.Veronica Cartwright's performance as Cathy Brenner is extremely good and her enormous eyes are very expressive. Jessica Tandy is an interesting choice as Lydia Brenner, the overprotective mother of Mitch and Cathy. While her acting is very good, what really rings a bell on me is the fact that she looks almost exactly the same as Tippi Hedren. She looks as if she was a much older version of Tippi Hedren.The Brenners are an unusual family. Mitch is so much older and bigger than Cathy that he looks much more as if he is her father than her brother. Lydia is elderly enough to look like Mitch's mother, but looks much more as if she is Cathy's grandmother than her mother. What a strange family...Suzanne Pleshette is pretty natural as the teacher Annie Hayworth. Plus, she oozed sophistication and grace and had a sexy husky voice. Ethel Griffies is a very interesting choice as Mrs. Bundy, the English ornithologist, who happens to be a very interesting character with nothing more than a minor role in the movie. I don't know the name of the actor who portrayed the character who kept saying that the war of the birds against humans was the Apocalypse, but whoever he was his acting was absolutely impeccable. Even the other adults and children with minor roles are all very well chosen and do quite well in their roles. Overall, a triumphant movie experience from the iconic Master of Suspense.Title in Portugal: 'Os Pássaros'.",10,2,3,21 November 2010
