First Man," Depressing Shakeup
","As noted previously, the shaking in the scenes was ridiculous. For example, when the capsule was spinning out of control, the shaking (in the film) would have made it impossible to read or flick any of the dozens of switches, which Armstrong was systematically switching on and off, not only his own, but his co-pilot's.Seemed to me the purpose of the firm was to discourage anyone from ever wanting to be an astronaut, but more broadly, one should be content with where they are in life and shut up. In addition the 'Whitee on the moon' song suggesting space travel was done with black peoples lunch money, and then were the final scenes of Armstrong on the moon blankly glaring into never land with flashbacks of home, where if there were a caption would have read something like ' WTF are we doing here?' as if the purpose of space travel was to populate some glorious new world that we were all told existed. And ultimately the non-planting of the flag.There may have been a reason why he didn't hire Americans for the lead roles.",2,11,18,19 October 2018
