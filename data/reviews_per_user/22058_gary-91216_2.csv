War Dogs," Something different and a pleasant surprise
","A movie based on real events is obviously not guaranteed to be interesting or entertaining. However, in this particular case this film ticked both boxes and more. The two leading protagonists are convincing in their respective roles and while the bulk of the action takes place in the US, the Middle East and Eastern European locations add an extra dimension. Social historians please note that the film also shines the light on the unbelievable state of affairs that existed when the purchasing arm of the US military totally lost the plot.",8,0,1,25 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Plenty of action for those who are patient enough to wait for it
","Those who like their action movies to be founded in fact will enjoy this film. The heroism as depicted on screen is hard to believe, although in reality Army Medic Desmond T. Doss really did indeed achieve what any normal human being would imagine to be the impossible. While it understandably takes a while for the background story to be established, once the action starts the 'lead to air' ratio increases to the max. Director Mel Gibson and crew clearly pulled out all the stops to make the action scenes as realistic as possible. Some might even say the combat scenes are a little overdone, but then again you would have had to have been there to know for sure. Despite the various references to 'action' in this review, it's important to conclude by emphasizing the movie also tells a great story and encourages the viewer to reflect on the human costs of war.",9,7,11,28 February 2017
