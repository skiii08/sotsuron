The Blair Witch Project," Pretty awful
","I did not like this movie. First of all, it is all taken for a home video camera and it litereally made me motion sick by the end of the movie. Second, I went to this movie to be scared.  Not happening.  3 kids get lost in the woods doing a documentary on this witch and they disappear one by one.  You barely hear the witch, dont see it, and the kids use bad language every other sentance. I thought the movie was ridiculous.",3,0,1,4 August 1999
