Requiem for a Dream," Amazing movie...Nothing like it.
","There are a lot of great movies out there that make you think, this one stands out above all the rest. Friends have told me how disturbed they were after watching this and being someone not normally touched by movies I had to see it. I thought it would be just another druggie falls from the top type movie but I was in for a complete shock by the presentation of the situation. If you want to be blown away by a movie you need to see this. The end completely drained me emotionally, it should easily be higher on IMDb's list. There are drug movies like Blow and Scarface(I love both) and then there is this...in a league of its own. I am yet to see a movie that i can relate it to. The acting was superb, Jared Leto was incredible and completely believable. Ellen Burstyn showed one of the most heartfelt performances I believe I have ever seen. Jennifer Connelly played what I saw as the most mediocre performance of the main characters, but was still so much deeper than most characters you see today. Finally there was Marlon Wayans...He is so talented and showcases himself perfectly in this movie. All in all, this movie had an incredible plot, the camera work fit perfectly, and the cast put forth the best overall performances I can remember. WATCH THIS MOVIE",9,5,8,1 April 2008
