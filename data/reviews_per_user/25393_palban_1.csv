The Devil's Advocate," Flamenco singer
","I would like to know who is playing and singing the two flamenco songs in the restaurant scene, can I buy those songs? where? The Movie sound track don't include those great songs; 'what a shame'. Other then that it is a great movie. good special effects. Hope someone has the answer to this question Al Pacino good job! K. R. great job That is all i have to say thanks P. Alban P. PS please let me know if you know the answer to the flamenco question! I think the guitar player is Tomatito. The singer I don't know? (the late Camaron maybe?) I would like to purchase the cd if it is available. The dancing is not bad either, It is worth it to check it out!",7,0,1,27 January 2006
