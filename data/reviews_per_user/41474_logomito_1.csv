The Hangover," Best comedy since ages.
","This is definitely one of the funniest movies since ages and for me it comes right after 'the 40 year old virgin' and 'The big Lebowsky', which I consider as the funniest movies for men ever. Gladly all the stupid 'hollywood business as usual love stuff' was left out of this one. It's full of surprises and not only a commercial copy of other successful comedies like so many others I have seen within the last 3 years.I guess I will see it over and over when it comes out on DVD. Because I consider the music as slightly too commercial, I'll keep the last point for me and hope there will be a second part of this next year.",9,5,8,8 June 2009
