Walk the Line," Legend he might of been , but he was like all the rest of us all ....
","After watching walk the line there was one thing that I learnt about Jhonny Cash ... he was a human being like the rest of us all and he had his faults as well . I know that biopics usually are glamorised to a certain degree but this was differently one of the best biopics I have seen . With Mr.Phoneix acting out the role with style , you just love it when he comes out on stage and says HELLO - MY NAME IS JOHNNY CASH !!! Hats of to him ! , the film kept me interested all the way the through - well just about it I missed the last few minutes , Reese Witherspoon does another fine job of playing June Crater she really does provide some good laughs . T-1000 Robert Patrick does a fine job of playing Cash's dad and the strained relationship between father and son was something that I found I could relate to . I knew very little about Jhonny Cash before watching the film but after watching it I was actually inspired to check his life out further . A must see for anyone who is studying music or is looking for inspiration on the guitar . Enjoyable , check it out !!!",8,1,1,23 January 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Trust Talented Mr Norton to save this!
","The first Hulk movie although had its moments was not the best. Its over development took way too long and rather than showing us a depressing movie , it just ended up being bleak and dull. When I heard Ed Norton had signed up for the role of Bruce Banner I was a bit hesitant at first but then after watching Bale as Batman and Cage as the Ghost Rider I welcomed the idea. After watching it , it easy to understand why Ed Norton can prove he is capable of standing toe to toe with the likes on Jhonny Depp , his ability to completely immerse him-self in a role really captivates. The best part about the The Incredble Hulk is that, it wastes no time getting straight into the action and rather than giving us a depressed man , we are given a desperate one driven. Right from start to finish it was a joy to check out , the special affects were brilliant as the director brings justice to the Hulk by making him the angry rampaging beast that he is rather than some sort of over grown mentally retarded child and truly at times he was scary. Tim Roth , Liv Tyler were both excellent at their roles and the fast pace of the movie truly left you wanting more. Another great thing about this movie was that is kept in spirit of the marvel comic universe and at the same time paid tribute to the original TV series listen to the music very carefully at one point and also starting a cross over into the marvel universe. My only complaint was that a little over cooked CGI made it look a little fake in places but that was me being too picky. To some it up Iron Man was already a great comic book summer flick and then with this realised it means things can only get better? Well we hope so with the Dark Knight coming out !THE INCREDBLE HULK 8.7 OUT OF 10UNLEASH THE BEAST...",8,2,5,6 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Average warm up for what perhaps lies ahead .
","I actually consider my-self lucky enough to witness and experience the magic of the Star Waes saga as I was never really around when the original 3 films were made . But the funny thing is that George Lucas still some how managed to bring us a prequel trilogy to the original trilogy to set it all out and tell us how it all began . I had already read several other comments on this board that either liked it , hated it or just checked it out for the just the thrill of the movie . Either way there is no denying that the movie made a boat load full of money and sparked probably storms on its own across the internet community . First thing that I thought about was the way the film was approached , unlike the other other conventional 3 this one had a very different taste and feel to it which NO Star Wars fan can deny ! The CGI was out of this world and made out to be as realistic as they could be but what else would you expect ! The fight sequences were cool but the last one between Obi-Wan , Qui-Gonn and Maul was probably one of the best fights I have seen out of the Star Wars saga as well as any other movie . The film kept on pushing forwards although sometimes I felt it was rushed in a few places (come on George you got 2 other films to expand on .) I can understand why fans are also pretty annoyed with this one and a big reason for that was the action as it was pretty limited in this one (either it was crammed into one place and time or it was over before you knew it .). Another thing was the intergalactic federation with its tax policies and other various forms of politics which to some point kept me in as I do have a bit of a Keen interest in politics . The presence of the Sith were all so very little as they were mainly used in the background as a sub-plot which will thicken as the saga moves forward , and there was not enough of Darth Maul shown as any fan will point out his history which happens to be quite interesting and thusly he can stand out on his own but was suppressed to a very basic henchman and not the an appearance however credit due to Ray Park for the way he played the character . Another thing was the rather some what racist voice overs used to describe most of the other aliens i.e. Jar Jar Binks who obviously the bumbling black guy used for comic relief but was just not funny at all and yes he was very annoying ! The Federation owners who were made to sound like 2 yakaza cooperate gangsters . Jake Llyod who played the young Skywalker done a good job but even he had his moments . Its hard for me to give this film a hard mark as it is George Lucas's big return to the silver screen and some rust is to be expected after 15 years of exile but in the end I think George Lucas spent a little too much time on CGI , sets , pods etc and making this The Phantom Menace to be more fabric then flesh .To some it up , Star Wars - Episode 1 : The Phantom Menace , is a film that oozes masses of potential but needed a lot more time and approach rather than being hyped up beyond apprehension which has resulted in a disappointed effort by Lucas . It still shines through in places and thusly because of that fans including my-self are oddly drawn to it . Hopefully the other episode 2 will push on further and take us deeper.STAR WARS : EPISODE 1 - THE PHANTOM MENACE AVERAGE 5 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NIGHT !",5,0,1,8 May 2006
The Longest Yard," refreshingly nice change.
","I saw The Longest Yard after watching Two for the Money last week and as I thought we have a bit of a sports theme going ,The Longest Yard just seemed to be in the right direction to follow . Being that Hollywood is going through a rather annoying stage of doing remakes , sequels and prequels so there was something to look out for . I have never really seen the original movie with Burt Reynolds in it so I thought that I should really approach this film with an open mind as it is not really my normal genre of films. However It really did seem to like the film and what it had to offer . Adam Sandler up grades him-self from his waterboy days to something a lot more enjoyable like this and you really feel your-self routing on for him as the film progress's forward but this by no means his best performance as it basically still mirrors his previous performances . Chris Rock provides a few decent laughs especially in the beginning where we meet his character . Nick Turturo also is a good laugh to watch especially when his true nature is shown on the film in the hall . Burt Reynolds plays the wise old pillar of support pretty well not to mention wwe wrestlers Goldberg,Steve Austin,and Kevin Nash I found them to play their part pretty dame well !!! Nelly was also good as he made use of what he had to work with . The warden and guards were all a right bunch of A!sholes , as at times you found their sadistic treatment funny but also shocking at times , Courtney Cox did look hot in that pink dress but sorry honey ! You still kind of remind of your FRIENDS days . The good thing about this film was that the plot kept going along rather smoothly rather than dragging along , the laughs were consistent but nothing making you fall out of your seat funny , with a few good moments to talk about i.e , the chase in the Bentley and Colenel Sanders from The Waterboy . I had my doubts about this movie but it ended up being one of those movies where you can just watch and forget about the out-side world for a while . For comedy and Adam Sandler fans worth a purchase but highly recommended rental . All in all nothing new or fantastic but still a good laugh .

Catch Me If You Can," Amazing...
","When I checked out the true story behind the exploits of one Frank Abignale Jr, I saw marvelled and shocked by this guy. This has got to be one of Speliberg's best movies but what also makes this film special is that it has his style but all in all without any big CGI or SFX , its just pure magical entertainment which strings you along. The story follows the life of a young man known as Frank Abignal Jr who would go into history as the most audios and yet daring and youngest con men in history conning banks out millions as well posing as several other professionals. Leo DiCaprio shows once again that he is not just a pretty face and he can square of with the likes of Johnny Depp. One thing that is great about his performance is the level of innocence portrayed by him and it is very hard if not impossible to be mad at him . The film moves at a slow pace which I really didn't mind because it introduced you into his world which also mad one build bonds with the other characters which made the movie an emotional one to watch and sometimes painful for me personally through watching my parents having to struggle with their finical situation and how teen against can some times go right out of control. Tom Hanks was good as the federal agent , not his best performances but still very good but Christopher Walken was nothing short of brilliant which begs the question why has not been given an Oscar yet ? My only complaints were that it was a little too long but I was willing to let that go because DiCaprio kept my hooked and a few Hollywood moments added in which I guess kind of distract a slight bit from its inspired by true events angel. To conclude Catch me If You Can is one of Speilbergs best works as well as proving that DiCaprio is not just a pretty face but one of the talent and very respectable actors coming up , highly recommended there is something for everyone in here.CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: 8.6 OUT 10THE TRUE STORY OF A REAL FAKE.",8,0,2,3 December 2007
Minority Report," My 100th review!!!
","For my 100th review it could not of gotten any better than this. Minority Report proves when Tom Cruise keeps his out-landish behaviour to him-self why he is probably one of the best actors to come out of the past century. From the surface Minority Report seems to come across as a super futuristic action thriller but once you check it out you come to the realisation that nothing is what it seems as this is a story with a lot of complex human emotion rolled into it with lots of philosophical arguments on both sides which all in shows both sides of the coin and what it feels like for the hunter to become hunted. The acting was completely flawless from all corners whether it be Cruise, Farrell or Sydow with a pacey story which wastes no time and plenty of twists, turns to keep you moving and guessing. Words are not really that are used to describe Minority Report because it tends to open it-self up like a flower and one has to watch it for him-self . To conclude put Minority report on your '100 films to watch before I die list' as it is one of those movies which will make you think after its done my only complaint was that it was just a little bit too long but the film kept on moving at a quick enough pace and there was quite a bit to take in but the arguments presented to you in this movie really make one wonder what is moral and what is not giving the situation of the world we live in.MINORITY REPORT : 9 OUT 10IN THE WORLD OF THE BLIND , THE ONE EYED MAN IS KING!",9,9,13,28 August 2007
Training Day," Denzel - STILL my man !!
","I could not have picked a better time to watch Training Day as I am going into a career of Law enforcement my-self. From the beginning I understood the situation which a new recruit faces from his superiors and what the pressures are of being a cop as it is. Ethan Hawke does a wonderful job of being a stranger and making us take the ride with him and when he meets Alonso Harris who is unforgettably played by Denzel 'American Gangster' Washington. Training Day is an account of life both for a cop working the rough streets of LA and also if you do your research you learn that it also involves real crips,bloods and various other gangs with their input which means that you get an authentic taste of what life is like for those living and growing up in one of these rough hoods. What makes Alonso Harris scar your mind is that he is not your average Dirty Harry wannabe but he is more like a resourceful , intelligent street wise cop with his Jekell/Hyde tendency's which makes him a joy to watch and no one could of carried this of in style like Denzel. The most shocking thing is that to all of them this was everyday life but unlike us who will be completely blown away by its power . My only problem with Training Day is that it just skips up a notch too fast and misses out some important factors but the stand out performance all the way through are what save this movie. To conclude Training Day is a movie that offers an experience which is hard to put into words , it offers an experience which has to viewed to be felt but all I can say is that this proof why Denzel Washington is one of the most talented black actors to have graced the silver screen , A MUST SEE !TRAINING DAY : 8.6 OUT OF 10THE ONLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE LINE BEING CROSSED, IS THE COP WHO WILL CROSS IT...",8,0,1,24 March 2008
Two for the Money," You never know , you might relapse.
","Those were the words spoken by Walter at the gambling meeting which I found to be really funny .I decided to check out to for the money because I thought it would be a welcome change to my normal genre of movies and what I can say is that the film starts of good and you as the person who is watching kind of develop some sort of attachment to Brandon Lang after his hopes of becoming a high flyer are put to the side when he becomes injured and like the rest of us works a nine-to-five . Something that I could feel for him was that he was young,well to do and has plenty of ambition and still dreams of making it big but is stuck in a very dead end place where he feels he won't get anywhere . Que the rather wild , wacky ,and some what flamboyant Walter Abramhs played in style by Al Pacino who then goes onto promise the Brandon the world if he comes works for him. And thusly you see a star in the making as you see Lang's speeding rise to the top from his desk job days to the point where he starts using the alias Jhon Anthony - the million dollar man with a billion dollar plan!! He also gets to drive the Merc-Benz SL 500 which coincidently my boss drives at well and says that one day it will be but I don't really believe that people . So far so good but then during the second half of the film when things turn sour and Lang's world starts crashing down before him the film then gets a little sloppy and thusly loses what direction it wants to go in , from this it tends to drag on a little longer than it should do which I didn't mind as long as it was given time to recover but instead it started developing plot holes . Al Pacino performance was great , I found my-self laughing with his witty ability to turn things around . Matt McConghay was also gave solid performance portrait a person who got him-self in a little to deep but was enjoying the part. Rene Russo performance was also pretty solid . All in all Two for the Money was on its way to earning an 8 or 8.5 but because of the sloppy , dis-organised , some what unrealistic second half it started losing marks . However the first half was brilliant the way it showed us a gritty , realistic portrayal of the cut-throat business which is known as sports gambling . Definaltly worth a rental .TWO FOR THE MONEY - A RATHER WEAK 7.5 OUT OF 10 .THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN SIGNING OFF WISHING YOU A GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK.",7,5,9,27 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Best one in series so far ?
","The first film kept me interested long enough to make me sit all the way through and also made me want to check the the second and whilst I was in a swash buckling mood I said why waste time? So I dived into it straight away. Glad to say that Dead Man's Chest lived up to its expectations and I found it to be better than Curse Of the Black Pearl. Jhonny Depp's performance as the enigmatic Capt Jack Sparrow is the reason why he is fast becoming one of my favourite anti-heroes as this time him and his crew get into more trouble this time with a super-natural , hideous looking foe known as Davey Jones with whom Sparrow had some business dealings and well its time to pay the paper! There are non-stop action and laughs through out this one so thusly it is difficult to pick a favourite moment however the action and violence had been taking up a notch which to be honest was great! and even a little bit or gore to keep everyone satisfied. I was glad to say that all the cast came together and worked together really well, you also so some more character development on various other members of the crew and no silly little sub-plots firing all over the place. The SFX were great and the not to mention the make-up of Bill Nighy who was totally unrecognisable! My only complaint was that it was a little too long and it does require committed watching but with the surprise ending I assure you it will be worth . To conclude Dead Man's Chest is defiantly a great summer time film to check out as it thrills, makes you laugh and entertains you , I just hope At Worlds End will be just as good if not better !DEAD MAN'S CHEST 8.3 OUT 10JACK'S BACK !!!",8,0,2,11 June 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A good entertainment
","Jhonny Depp adds to his list of already enigmatic characters played probably the one he is most famous for playing - Captin Jack Sparrow , during the 2 hours of curse of the Black Pearl it was hard to think of anybody else who could pull it off as well as he did. The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of those summer time movies which you have to be in the mood to view and many years later finally... that mood had arrived for me. On the whole I was not left disappointed as it kept me hooked through its swash- buckling antics and I can see how the angles were curbed to keep this a good family film. The plot was fairly straight forward with our anti-hero pirate trying to recover his ship back whilst taking revenge on a group of super natural foes along with the entire naval fleet and the meeting a few characters along the way . The special affects were very good , not to mention the stunts and the sword play all brilliant although its never really taken to the level I had hoped for but hey again this is a family film!!! Jhonny Depp was the man who kept me in my seat , whether it be the action or the catchy one liners he makes it very apparent why he is one of the most versatile actors to have emerged onto the big screen. Orlando Bloom although I am not a fan of his he pulled his weight through out the film very well indeed UNLIKE in Troy where he was nothing short of an annoying pep-squeak and I really enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance through out the film (not just eye candy)and every body made full use of the scenery to the brilliant make-up and costumes really made it worth while. Too conclude The Curse of The Black Pearl is one of those films which are worth a check at on summer's day with your family or worth a rental if your looking for a bit of light action/fantasy I mean I may just be a little too old for Pirates now days and the action was not taken to the level I had hoped for but instead it was saved by brilliant performances all round.

Hostel," Can't wait for part 2!
","I was meaning to get round to watching Hostel for a while and yesterday on a boring Sunday afternoon I took the chances of watching it and I was not disappointed. It seem really apparent that anything that gets the Quentin Tarentino's seal of approval is worth a check out. Hostel was a movie that satisfies the gore hound in me , of course if strip everything away it could still be classed as a teen-slasher movie but it is different in the sense where it has these odds moments where one seems to genuinely care about the characters. The plot focus is on 3 back packers trodding around Amsterdame getting stoned,laid etc but then they are given an opportunity to take a ride in the wild side in Slovakia and being 'dumb American teens' they go through with the offer. One thing that Hostel could say has a focus on is the dark nature of humans and how far one is willing to go for the ultimate thrill. Although it as I said earlier one could argue it could be treated as a basic formulaic slasher it just takes the blood and gore level to graphic which makes it all the more amusing. I would recommend this as something different from Europe and is worth a look at , you might be shocked and you might laugh and some bits but it was a ride . My only complaint was that the trailer just gave away a little bit too much so we knew what was coming however Eli Roth has done very well indeed. I just hope that Part 2 satisfies the hunger for my gore better than The Hills Hvae Eyes Part 2 which was just a let down.HOSTEL 8.9 OUT 10 THERE IS A PLACE , WHERE FOR A PRICE , YOU CAN SCARE , TORTUE AND KILL!",8,2,2,21 May 2007

This film had everything that i could wish for , blood , guts , violence an out-landish storyline .

Blade," One of the best vampire and comic movies made
","I decided to check out Blade after a long time , although it might seem a little bit dated by todays standards on SFX , Blade still is great movie in the sense of action style . Wesley Snipes was just absolute brilliant as the day walker him-self not to mention Stephen Dorff. Throw in lost of guns, blood , kung fu and sword fights and we have got a great action flick. Although there are clearly a few plot holes in here and a few unanswered questions but in general the movie works as it is a comic book based movie and there is a lot of info to cram in a short space of time but still that does not stop it from being a great movie.BLADE: 8.6 OUT OF 10",8,0,2,19 January 2009
Superbad," not bad!
","Superbad was one of those movies I decided to check out because I was bored and for some reason I decided to waltz down memory lane and remind my-self of all the mischief I got into high school. I was pleasantly surprised, for a start it does not have that glossy Hollywood feel to it, it has a reality based check to it which is what makes you genuinely hooked to it. The characters in it are actually funny and well liked for a change and may even remind you of someone who you know in high school. Although it might drag on in places you can guarantee that Jonah Hill's brilliant comedic role was what saved it from being a total dud . I would say it is worth a check out if your in the mood for some high school comedy.SUPERBAD : 6.1 OUT OF 10",6,0,3,4 January 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," They saved the best till last.
","POTC saga is one that I have really grown to like, its just really a shame that I checked the saga out on the eve of the final film and what can I say I was not left disappointed at all. Picking up from where the story left of in Dead Man's Chest with the surprise ending we find our hardy crew being led to the end of the globe by Captin Barbossa (my enemy's enemy is my friend)to bring back our rather eccentric anti-hero Capt Jack Sapparow with the looming threat of Davy Jones and the East India company. We dive straight into the action and it is a non-stop roller coaster ride. While I felt that the first one was a little slow and the second one was little too long in places I was glad to say that this one had a steady pace and the film moved along rather nicely. The acting was top notch and I felt this movie belonged to Geoff Rush and Orlando Bloom and the special affects were again nothing short of fantastic especially the climatic battle at the end. There were a few questions left unanswered about the movie and I also felt that Chow Yun-Fat should been given a bigger part to play but he was good along with the other foreign pirates from around the globe. To conclude At world's end is a great way to finish of the POTC saga with thrills , spills and laughter (not as much as the first two movies but it is still there). I made a comment during the first movie which was that I felt I was a little to old of Pirates ! I'LL TAKE THAT COMMENT BACK!

Spider-Man 3," Is 3rd time really a charm ?
","My favourite web-slinger is back for a third outing and I for one was very hyped up about it. Ladies and Gents I have been a huge spider-man fan since I was a kid and when I saw the the teaser trailer of this third instalments with him hanging up-side in his black symbiont suit I for one was counting the days to see it. From reading other comments I can understand why people felt let down, I mean all this hype going round and Sam Rami had taken a very bold step in introducing the symbiont which I felt was too early in the franchise but being that the first two movies where brilliant it was understanding that he had to deliver the goods and bring something new and fresh to the table.On the whole the movie was not that bad, but as a Spider-man fan I did feel a little something missing. The whole concept of the darker side of Spider-man was good but unfortunately we never really truly see it go to that level I mean any spider-man fan will tell you that what the symbiont CAN REALLY DO. The film was also rushed in places with things getting hectic and chaotic which made it seem messy! We Mary-Jane juggling her own problems with Harry Osborn donning the suit of his father, the Sandman seemed to be the central villain in this movie and not Venom who seemed more like a tweener (what the Fu!K)with silly little sub-plots firing left right and centre. On the other side I really enjoyed watching the symbiont spider-man being he was given very little screen time , the fight sequences were good and still filling . And the comedic moments were funny as well. The stars that stood out were Haden as the Sandman, although I felt that they got the character of the Sandman wrong he still done a wonderful job and J.K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jameson was better this time round. James Franco was surprisingly a lot darker than Tobey Maguire who at times was starting to show the his darker side but then abruptly cuts it off and Kirsten Dunst was just plain moaning and whining whilst Topher seemed to behave a lot more like Carnage than Venom !Too conclude Spider-man 3 could of been the best in the series but unfortunately Sam Rami crammed wayyyy too much into it which makes it seem messy rather than mind-blowing and it could of been one hell of an exit for Maguire and Dunst who will not be reprising there roles. I would like to see Venom back for the 4th instalments but Rami should sit down and take it easy rather than rushing it because I felt this could of been the best one in the franchise. On the whole I have tried my hardest to defend this film the best I can because I did feel that others were cutting it for no reason but any movie movie goer or Spider-man fan can tell you that there a problems clearly visible but I do hope this is not an omen of any kind. Spider-man 3 is worth a look at but after all the hype it merely satisfies and not amazes.SPIDER-MAN 3 : 8.1 OUT OF 10THE GREATEST BATTLE LIES WITHIN!",7,0,0,14 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," The best one in the series
","The first Resident Evil films were good but were Luke warm adaptations for a great computer game franchise by Capcom. However I was glad to say that Resident Evil : Extinction on the other hand offered was a nice way to cap off the saga. Set after the events of the second movie, we find out band of survivors trying to get out of the barren wasteland earth as the T-virus inflection goes global. The film wastes no time just diving into the action and moving along at a quick pace with very little gags and wise cracks as the tempo was upped. There were excellent use of SFX, landscapes (kind of mad max style), and action with gore. One thing that I loved about this movie was that it did not waste time on trying to offer scientific explanations for everything trying to make it sound intelligent as the last 2 movies did not really do a great job of it, this one just stuck to the action. Both Milla Jovoich and Oded Fehr were excellent in this as well as the alter-ego crazy woman from Heroes - although she was Claire Redfield...but to me she will forever be know as the homicidal woman alter-ego woman from heroes and Manfred Powl from Tomb Raider was very cool as umbrella research leader all keeping in touch with the spirit of the computer game. My only complaints were that I wished it had ended a little better and not on what felt like a cliffhanger. I would of also like to have seen a bit on the expansion of Alice whilst she was in the Umberealla facility rather than just an abrupt start I think that just felt a little stupid! To conclude Resident Evil : Extinction stood out on its own as a film as well as ending a saga of a very Luke warm trilogy , worth a check if you have seen both films and are fan of the games but also if your a fan of zombie movies like Dawn or Land of the Dead! Either way this lived past its expectations of being crap and you can check this out feeling entertained and satisfied unlike with Rob Zombie's Halloween.RESIDENT EVIL:EXTINCTION - 8.8 OUT OF 10EXPERIMENTATION...EVOULUTION...EXTINCITION!",8,2,5,1 October 2007
Ocean's Twelve," Well I liked it !
","The Oceans saga following the exploits of Danny Ocean and the gang is something you will either like love or hate. Yes of course, you have this over hyped nonsense about sooo many stars being in it and it cost this much to make and the hype is spread all over the place. The first movie kept me entertained long enough with its wise cracks and build up to its master heist but to be honest I really did not think it was all that so naturally I was having my doubts about watching Oceans 12 although whilst reading other reviews I was rather surprised to see how much some people really disliked it. So I was taking quite a gamble on watching it but to be honest with it was not all that bad!!! Yes of course it had problems but my advice is just to watch for the sake of entertainment and for the sake of entertainment only and not get to nit-picky over every small little detail. Set 3 years after the events of the first movie we find our band of thieves in hot water again as Terry Benedict has mad as hell and wants to be paid with interest for his loss. So our group reassembles once again to pay Terry and keep their lives this time headed of to Europe , of course things take a turn for the worst as there is a twist involved which does not help them at all with time running out! The layout of the film was great , fans of the BBC show Hustle will understand what I am saying and with funny jokes running all the way through ( I love part where the Chinese acrobat talks in Chinese and the gang say it in English). Geroge Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Bernie Mac not to mention Don Cheadle (aside from his crappy English accent) all done great. But this also Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones (never really took the time to see how sexy she was) and Vincent Cassel (the laser room) rocked. There was also a certain special someone who turns up and kind off adds a surreal feeling to the film which may not sit well with everyone but I thought it was cool. There are problems visible like the movie sets out on a target but never really seems to accomplish it as it gets torn away into a sub-plot ties into the main plot, the Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones love thing was good but just ends out being a little too cheesy and nothing we can connect with on a deep level and there were elements that made it look a little to dame easy. But however to conclude not everybody would agree with this review but if you searching for a good night in with some good food and a glass of wine then pop this into your DVD player, just watch just for the sake of entertainment.OCEANS 12 - 8.8 OUT OF 10 TWELVE IS THE NEW ELEVEN!",8,2,3,9 July 2007
Crash," People , the strangest creatures on the planet.
","After watching crash , what can i say ? I was left speechless because there are no easy answer or comfortable conclusions . The film leaves you confused to the point that you don't realise whether to sympathise with the people or to hate them . As a whole it leaves human beings like us trapped in an uncomfortable position , and i came out thinking to my-self . Would people treat me differently if i was a different colour ? Each character in this movie has a crucial part to play as they all contribute towards the race issue and but however the film never at one point slowed down or tried to glorify or glamorise the subject . Watch this film , and i'll bet that you'll probably wonder humans ! the greatest mystery of all . we build vast empires , establish great heights but at the end of the day all we do is bring each other pain and misery .",8,2,4,23 August 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," A 'fairy-tale' for adults without the sugar coated toppings
","I had no idea what I was letting my-self in for when I watched Pan's Labryinth but to be honest I bet neither will anybody else when they check this film out. This film has Del Toro's masterpiece written all over it and truly is one of his finest if not best films to date. The story is set in Spain's war torn past and has a focus of a 12 year old girl named Ofelia who seems to live in a dream world of her own which probably seems to be the best thing for as her reality is far from perfect with her mother forced to travel whilst being pregnant to meet her new husband and Ofelia's step-father the brutal and cold Captin Vidal who as we get to see is far, far from the perfect role model for any child. As the events unfold you are taken into a surreal world with extraordinary creatures and you begin to wonder what is real and what not. Del Toro has done such a marvellous job of luring you into this little girls world and taking you to a place where the lines of fantasy and reality become blurred . There are great performance's all round especially to the girl who played Ofelia and Sergi Lopez the cold hearted , evil Captin Vidal . Pans Labrinyth is truly a wonderful film to have watched, experienced, and felt my only complaint was that it left us too soon as your taking into this captivating world which tells us a very in your face fairy tale without the 'cuteness' which I feel is not suitable for children but on the hand tells us that indeed the Power of innocence is something evil should fear.

Blade II," A very good follow up
","I loved the first Blade movie, it had all the correct ingredients to make an excellent action movie. I was also happy to say that Blade 2 is also good, if not that little bit more stylish visually than the first. This time the plot focus on Blade helping his sworn enemies take on a new breed of vampire , basically like a James Bond movie we have a straight forward plot , gadgets and action which action make it all the more pleasure to watch and also this round we are take further into the Vampire Nation and we get to look at the world of and complex vampiric politics. There are also pretty solid and strong performances from Snipes,Pearlman , Krisoffen as we also get to see a lot more of the human 'side' of Blade and with good hints of comedy along the way which just make it great. So if your a fan of the comics and action movies and you enjoyed the first definitely give this one a shot , you won't be disappointed.BLADE 2 : 8.1 OUT OF 10",8,0,1,24 January 2009
Taxi Driver," Travis Bickle aka THE PUNISHER
","Taxi Driver was a very good movie to check out . Its not a popcorn type of movie its something that I felt requires your full attention which that not that many people understand so perhaps they then claim that the film is over rated but to it is a good film that lives up to its high expectation and hype . I guess in a Travis Bickle in this represent how most of us feel in the world , the sudden urge to lash out but unable to do so because of fear the consequence of our actions .I guess Robert De Niro plays a man on the brink with class you feel it and find it believable and the rest of the cast were in top shape and gave solid performances that just make the film run smoothly . I guess by 1976 standards this film is pretty bloody and I understand that this was put in the same boat as A Clockwork Orange was but however there are worser things out there these days . All in all a very interested portrait of a man on the edge screaming for help.",8,0,1,19 December 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Keeps on impressing!
","The exploits of Danny Ocean and crew are something you will either love or loathe. Asides from the first movie which was what I felt Luke warm Oceans 12 really did impress me with its wise cracks and story line which leads to a perfect warm up for this third instalment. Danny Oceans mentor and team member Ruben has been screwed out of a deal with a ruthless Willie Banks (played by Al Pacino) the team take it upon them-selves to teach him that when you cross one Ocean! you cross them all! This Danny and the team leave the stylish Hustle-like format out and pull out all the stops with everybody who owes them. What I liked about this movie was that it shows almost a mission impossible layout of getting in and getting out with no little surprises up their sleeves. The film still has its funny moments which are great and gives it that charm but this time EVERYBODY has their part to play in the heist a bit like in the first movie. Again my only complaint with O13 was that although it tries to keep a serious tone to it at times with the fact what Ruben means to the team and leaving the wives and girl-friends at home it still pretty much fails to connect on an emotional level but you'll just have to take it for the sake of entertainment and trying to fill in a few gaps. Clooney,Pitt and Damon were again all in fine form but I felt that extra kudos should of gone to Don Cheadle this time (although his cockney English accent still sucked). Al Pacino was brilliant as always as Willie Banks and we certainly can't miss out Ellen Berkin (I need to find what was the name of that perfume!). To conclude Oceans 13 is one of those movies that you just watch for the sake of entertainment, nothing to lose nor gain but having said that I liked that fact that it was not as hyped as much as its predecessor due to the fact that films like Spider-man 3 just aimed too high and delivered not all that much but on the whole this one kept me happy and I would walk away saying I would like to see another one !OCEANS 13 : 8.1 OUT 10WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF GETTING EVEN ?

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A little bit too long for me.
","The Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the Rings hit the UK cinema's whilst I was still in High School. At the time I didn't really care much for it as I was and to this day still am a huge Matrix fan however the time would eventually come where I would have to explore a new saga and LOTR seemed like a good place to start as I was starting to feel like the only person on earth who had not seen it although I had all 3 films on DVD for quite some time . So yesterday I sat down for what would be one of the longest films I have seen without taking a break . What can I say ...that after the movie had finished I had gone straight to sleep . I HAD NO CLUE IT WOULD BE THAT LONG ! Having said that it was an entertaining first part and it has got a bit worked up to see the other instalments . The story is not difficult to follow at all so its pretty easy to get into and follow and it keeps on moving on to the next level which you are waiting to see what happens next . The SFX were mind blowing from the start so you know that there was no other way to approach this film but with epic proportions especially when you meet Sauron ! Elijah Wood ,Hugo Weaving , Vigo Mortison,Sean Bean , Ian Mckellen and Ian Holm all done a brilliant job and Chrispother Lee put the icing on the cake . At times you wanted to look away or nod off but too much was happening and you could not afford to look away or miss out on anything , thusly I can understand the rather lengthy running time . The only thing that pester's me a bit were the annoying name's but at least I can remember some of the main ones , i.e Bilbo ,Frodo , Strider , Gandalf - I've already forgotten Lee's character's name ! To sum it up , a good place to start and learn about this saga , plenty of action and drama and this was only the first film . I am itching to see the other 2 .LORD OF THE RINGS : THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING - 8.4 OUT 10 SO FOR NOW THIS IS SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOODNIGHT !",8,0,0,2 May 2006
28 Weeks Later," WOW , welcome 2008
","28 Days Later is probably my bleak out look on the future. After watching the first movie which was great I thought why not check out this one (after I did not get round to watching American Gangster). I was however pleasantly surprised with the sequel which from the trailer really looked like a badly made version of Resident Evil 2. The story picks up ...28 weeks after the first infection of the Rage virus and with the aid of the US (who for once seemed to do the right thing) but as it happens just when you thought it was safe to enter London again ! the Rage Virus returns with a vengeance! 28 Weeks Later is what a apocalyptic genre should be about , it waste no time to deal with silly little sub-plots . The action was clear and precise , with gore probably this time more than the first film . Robert Carlyle was in pure top form for his role along with all the other cast and crew members especially the 2 youngsters who impressed greatly . My only complaint is that the camera work was a little shoddy from time to time and I felt that things moved a little too quickly in some places as I would love to have seen an expansion on a few things but giving the severity of the situation I was willing to let that go. Nobody can say they are fan of Zombie/apocalyptic movies unless they have seen this movie , It easily overtakes the Resident Evil Genre and in one or two ways I liked it more than Land Of The Dead but remember this is by no means a feel good typical Hollywood movie , but having said it is thrilling and entertaining. I have also just heard that Danny Boyle has announced he wants to do a third one so I am truly looking forward to what happens next , HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!28 WEEKS LATER : 8.7 OUT OF 10 IT ALL BEGINS AGAIN !",8,2,4,7 January 2008
21," A highly charged , entertaining flick!
","21 tells the story of several students from MIT who go to Vegas and make a killing through counting cards which is legal. Anybody who is strapped for cash and is a bit of a wheeler-dealer should check this movie out. Right from the start 21 wastes no time with getting straight into the action , it sets the scene in a great way which makes you really feel for main characters and their reasons for doing this. The laughs were plenty and the movie rolled enough at a fast enough pace for you to catch up on everything. My only problem was that it felt like a typical Hollywood movie put together with glitz and light and had a typical formula ending but having said that it made up for it with its high on entertainment value. Another thing which I find a little offensive to a degree was that the real MIT was actually a group of Asian students and really made me wonder how actuate the story truly was although it was inspired by true events. To conclude 21 , was a highly entertaining flick which gave us a brief insight into how to the game of cards and also told a highly entertaining story , defiantly worth checking out.21 - 8.3 OUT OF 10WINNER WINNER..CHICKEN DINNER !!",8,0,1,20 May 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Aja defies , and conquers !
","Being the craze at the moment that is with Hollywood (prequels,remakes and sequels)it was just a matter of time before they went ahead and remade this. However people should be glad to know that the man in the directors seat this time was Alexander Aja and if you have seen his french horror master-piece High tension your headed for a good time! Aja's take was different from Wes Craven's in the sense that this time round he shows us a travelling family on vacation going through the New Mexico desert where the U.S. government had secretly been conducting atomic energy blast and this is vividly explained all in the opening credits not leaving much to the imagination however the survivors of these nuclear explosion show us what did not kill them , only made them more insane! There is no time wasting in this one as we dive straight into the action and waste little time with things like character development (hey they all gonna die after all). The camera angels and cinematography is used in a brilliant way to show the vastness of the mountains and really giving the viewer that they truly are stuck in the middle of nowhere but then also shows a close up focus of how the horrors and consequences caused by radiation. Gorehounds and horror fans shall be pleased by the levels of blood , and body count and not to mention body parts flying about! and Aja also manages to weave our heroic dog into as homage and respect to Wes Cravens original. Another great thing was the cynical tone it had with the family members which made it all the more realistic.To conclude , very rarely a remake can over take an original and especially one like The Hills have Eyes which has a devoted cult following but again , it shows that if you go away and do homework then you can inject something new fresh and make it worth while checking out. I recommend this to fans of the original and horror/gore fans or maybe people who are just in need of some entertainment during a boring summer day. I would not be at all surprised if this one started developing a following or people saying they prefer this to the original hopefully a remake of part two will make up for the original shambled part 2.THE HILLS HAVE EYES - 8.9 OUT OF 10THE LUCKY ONES DIED FIRST!",8,3,5,26 March 2007
Wanted," Just felt like a load of crap!
","Sometimes you should never really judge a book by its cover and that can be so true for what is said about wanted. Unfortunaltey even though it stars one of the most desirable women in the world and 'boasts' about great action stunts it never really hits the action mark to the point it should do and with its Matrix-esquire points it thusly just makes it seem like a very silly and flawed imitation to lets say... Equilibrium. Although it does have some genuine amusing moments in it , it is just a very brainless action movie which either some people liked or loathed and unfortunately for me , I never really got into it to enjoy that much. Check it out it if it is on TV otherwise if you can find something better on , just check that out instead. WANTED 6.7 OUT OF 10 CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY...",6,1,5,4 August 2008
Apocalypse Now," My Redux Review.
","Apocalyse Now has been something that a lot of movie critics have been banging on about for a while! In fact they go on about it so much that they actually end up killing some of its magic I feel. Although it should be something that should be watched by every movie lover the truth was that I was putting of watching it for quite a while. Reasons ranged from me being young and not understanding it well enough to me not really liking war movies that much. However I came across a really cheap DVD copy of it some time ago and thought might as well give it shot. One should keep in mind that this is the review of the redux movie and not the original Copella film version. What I can say is that I understand why this movie won a few awards , I mean Martin Sheen is just plain cool and it is a joy watching him undertaking this journey into madness as well as the creepy but yet enthralling philosophical Brando. The whole movie is like conducting some sort classical music - loud and flamboyant one minute then calm and serene the other ! What I also just loved about it was that the scenes matched wonderfully with the music and thusly creating some sort of magical method of drawing one into its world. The lighting, colouring actually the whole way that the movie was shot actually showed us a trip into the jaws of hell , in which one hangs on for dear sanity but feels completely disconnected from the world around him and that is what I felt that Apocalyse Now is really all about. The down side about Apocalyse Now Redux is that it is a little way too long and does require a solid frame of mind view , one just like Martin Sheen has 'want' it to enjoy it. Although the movie uses visuals and colours nicely it just sometimes drags on a little to far which might cause one to lose interest in it I mean I understand it is a build up to a big climax but it should keep you building towards that and not sway away. To conclude I am glad I finally got a chance to see Apocalyse Now , although it might not have been the original but I am glad I got to see it , because to me it was not really a movie focusing on a war but a movie focusing on the horror of war and the madness it brings with it. As a wise man said 'war is only good to those who have not tasted it', so I would say check it out and draw your own conclusion , I am glad I finally got round to it.APOCALYSE NOW : REDUX - 8.3 OUT OF 10The Horror...The Horror...",8,1,2,25 March 2008
Spider-Man," A true super hero movie
","I grew up on Spider-man and have probably been one of his biggest fans as a kid growing up and I was thrilled by the movie when it was reaslied on the big screen. I was just going through my DVD collection when I said to my-self just check it out. However I was actually surprised to see some comments which actually blasted this movie badly. Althouh I am a huge Spidey fan I understand that Hollywood is a big business which actually has money on its agenda first rather than pleasing the fans , and over time I have learnt to live with that and although it can't be denied although one or two things might of been changed in this movie , Sam Rami has sit down and down his research on this. The film is a thrilling ride from start to finish , moves at a great pace and keeps us entertained all the way through with its action sequences and emotional scenes. Tobey Maguire was cast brilliantly as the web slinger and although from time to time he maybe a little tooo geeky , it was all well. Willem Defoe was cast brilliantly as the Green Goblin and although The Goblin was never truly one of my favourites he seemed to make the regather interesting. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst who otherwise I can't stand were class. My only complaint about this was that they had changed The Goblins costume which I felt done the regather no justice but Willam Defoe managed to save that with his body language and use of the SFX. On the whole I throughly enjoyed checking Spiderman out as it reminded me of my childhood and as cheesy as it sounds to me it is still magical.SPIDERMAN 8.7 OUT OF 10WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBLILTY...",8,1,2,5 July 2008
The Fast and the Furious," What it lacks in substance it makes for in style
","The Fast and the Furious is one of those movies that everybody watches and majority of people like , although it predominately appeals to the brainless boy racer a!shole genre there is no denying th almost street racing craze it has a hand in playing. The plot is not the the brainiest so don't go expecting a grossing movie and the acting is a little drape and the script is quite crap to be honest . But then at the end of the day it is a movie that you would check out for the action as there are some very well made car races and sequences put together. Personally I would not look into it saying it is the best car movie made as there have been better ones out there like Gone in 60 secs but it is worth a rent , I mean if you get fast , cars women and action and semi good acting from Diesel , Brewster and Rodrgieuz.THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS : 6.7 OUT OF 10",6,2,6,20 October 2008
American History X," Norton's finest performance.
","Any fan of Ed Norton will show us how he left his mark on the movie world with his blistering performance as the lost, confused but yet at the same time intelligent and articulate Derek Vineyard. Norton immerses him-self so well within the role that you forget the past measly characters he has done and focus on this muscle bound skin-head before you! The film is shot beautifully and told through black and white flashbacks which let us into the world on Derek and Danny as we see the traumatic events that shape and change their lives forever and not to mention the beyond repair damage that they go through. Although the film might be basic, it has a very hard hitting message about hate , no matter what colour or background it comes from but still leaves us with no easy answers or comfortable conclusions. This movie truly must be a top one to watch for people who don't normally watch movies anyhow let alone be on the top 100 films to watch before I die list. All performance from Norton to Furlong even to Suplee were nothing short of excellent not to mention the score which is superb from Anne Dudley. Truly AHX is a movie not just race but about misplaced anger, rage and frustration which affects people from all different backgrounds and that is shown in this film wonderfully.American HISTORY X - 8.9 OUT OF 10VIOLENCE AS A WAY OF LIFE...",8,0,2,5 May 2008
The Usual Suspects," Good film , if not a little too over hyped.
","The Usual Suspect is one of those films which tell you that seeing is believing. Don't get me wrong it was a very good film and I am glad I finally got the chance to see it but with critics going on and on about it, they kind of kill the magic of the movie. However that really did not hinder my enjoyment as I decided to treat this just like any other movie. Basic concept of 5 cons on various heist missions until one goes terribly wrong and then the authorities try to establish what went wrong hearing this from the account of one of the crippled crooks (Kevin Spacey). Gabreil Bryne was a excellent in his role as the lead crook and Benico Del Toro was also a stand out performance but we all know that Kevin Spacey was the man who took joy in playing the audience like a piano. A film can start of slow but the ending is the most important thing in the whole thing and I am glad to say that this ending was nothing short of a slap in the face.THE USUAL SUSPECTS - 8.1 OUT 10 THE GREATEST TRICK THAT THE DEVIL EVER PULLED WAS CONVINCING THE WORLD THAT HE DOESN'T EXHIST AND JUST LIKE THAT.....

Quantum of Solace," Craig IS Bond .
","Quatom of Solace is the direct sequel leading after the events of Casino Royal. Each Bond film adds something new to the genre as each movie has its own styles and Tastes. Quantom of Solace is a Craig continuing along that same ice cold path which I think in a way most Bond fans were waiting to see. Craig might lack that James Bond charm but he compensates for it well in other emotional conflicts and not to mention the flat out action in it. The plot still focus's on James Bond going to uncover the events of the first movie , although the plot might seem not all that it is however very well compensated for with the continuous flow of action and thusly thats what keeps you in your seat the whole time. The only problem would be that well the main villain might not all that this time round and the leading bond girl might suck , also the Bond song is terrible...Chris Cornell rocked but Alicia Keys might be a good singer , but not a Bond singer ! However if you take QoS for what it is , an evolution of the Bond character then you should be fine. It is not the best Bond movie created but and I would not put it my best of Bond collection - but still it is worth a look at .QUANTOM OF SOLACE - 8.1 0UT OF 10",8,2,7,18 November 2008

","After that rather unpleasant let down called Batman and Robin , I am glad to say that Batman Begins truly is what comic book films are to be like . Chirstian Bale's performance was top notch along with Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman . Although i felt that Katie Holmes was a bit wasted but Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman had small parts but played them well. This film was dark , no nonsense and straight to the point and has for me injected new life into the Batman genre .

City of God," The harsh , brutal , cold reality
","Brazil is a huge, vast country with enormous amounts of history and culture but having said that would you believe that only 10% of the population own 80% of its wealth? City Of God shows us what you could say is the hidden side of Brazil away from its glittery night life and laid back attitude, it is a cold, hard knock to the head which shows that the words 'Life is Cheap' live up to its expectations. The tag line of the movie is Fight and you won't survive , run and you won't escape and it could not be more closer to that as the movie shows us the life of kids/teens growing up in the slums of Rio De Janerio. Don't mistake this for a hyped up ghetto and glamorising gun-totting movie! City of God is a pure , raw side of life in the harsh slums of Rio where truly only the strong survive . The main character if you may is a guy called Rocket who just like any other teen dreams of the better things in life i.e. a good job , house , babes ! But always finds him-self down on his luck as he can never truly escape the dangers and problems that he faces growing up (as if being a teen is not tough enough!) The movie is then played out in a Pulp Fiction format showing the lives of the people around him and like him all of them have hopes and dreams but are all sucked into the harsh void of reality . The acting was top-notch all round and the direction of the movie just made you want more but to some it up in general City of God is an experiment with the truth which makes the likes of Snopp Dogg and 50 cent look like a bunch of playground bullies as it holds nothing back in showing the life faced living in Rio's slums and to what extend people will go to , to get what they want from life when circumstances don't give the basic things we take for granted in our lives. A powerful film and pleasure to watch.CITY OF GOD 9 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOODNIGHT AND GOOD LUCK !",9,0,2,28 December 2006
JFK," Mind-blowing!
","I once stumbled upon JFK on Sky One one Sunday unable to sleep , and although I did not get round to seeing all of it, it was nothing short of interesting. I then just last week purchased it and popped it into my DVD player last night. All I can say is that instead of interesting - it was fascinating! Nothing truly is white and black over here as we re-visit the faithful day when the President of the US was assassinated , I remember my father talking about the day vividly and the way he told my brothers and I about it. Truly my father never really believed all of the evidence , and after watching this Oliver Stone movie I truly believe that there has been a fabrication of the truth and that in Nov 22 , 1963 the Predident of the United States Of America was assassinated and America it-self underwent an invisible coup'd'ete. The most worrying thing about it is that in the year 2008, we get to see factors similar to this all round the world which show America's dominance and foot hold in trying to play the policeman of the world. The film paves the way the in a do-cu-drama style way and then paves the way forward for the trial that took place with the stunning of most visuals and set ups so no one is confused and Oliver Stone does this in such an easy way for us to follow. The script is sharp and tight so there is no silliness floating around but then also the acting from everyone and I MEAN EVERYONE WAS BRILLIANT! , throughout the entire movie there is a certain feeling of dread and one does realise that it is a mouse fighting a gorilla. I really am not sure how accurate it is but it seems that Oliver Stone has conducted his research on it! The film might also be long but try to see it as a case study that way your attention will be a lot focused. To conclude JFK is highly bold and provocative film making that probably would not be allowed to have been made today giving the highly politically charged and sensitive times we are living in today. It has to be observed on its on basis and probably requires us to go away and make up our own minds but one thing is for certain , we all smell conspiracy and I am just how the US will cover up Iraq which to most of us is the new Vietnam , this movie cannot be overlooked!JFK : 8.4 OUT OF 10THE STORY THAT WON'T GO AWAY...",8,3,15,17 March 2008
The Number 23," One Jim Carrey's finest moments.
","An actor to me Ladies and Gents earns the title actor when he manages to convince the audience that he can come out of his shell and become something completely different and I am glad to say that Jim Carrey has finally joined that elite club. We are all used to seeing him in a comedy role where he would just make you laugh non-stop but then after a while his same routine, time warn bag of tricks really got boring thusly it was time for a change and he had done it very well in The Number 23. Jim Carrey plays an animal control officer who for his birthday is given a book called The Number 23 which is apparently a heart wrenching Odyssey into a world of paranoia, whilst reading this book Carrey begins to realise that his life has very striking similarities between his life and the book and then this leads him on a journey where the curse of 23 is revealed. I really don't want give a lot away because the film on its own is a journey into to darkness which might be a different experience for everyone to view. I was impressed with the way film mixed reality , fantasy and elements of the philosophical side together which makes people think away . The movie also moved at a quick pace with the curse being stretched out further and further along as we go. However having said that I have read some of the other reviews from people and critics who have dismissed this movie as boring, and not what they are used to seeing from Carrey and that might be true in some minor aspects as this movie is not for everyone as it requires a clear and focused mind kind of like watching a Hitcock thriller and for some it might require more than one viewing but I would say to people check it out for your-self and draw your own conclusion from it and you might find some similarities between your-self and Mr.Sparrow!

Ghost Rider," One of best comic-to - movie adaptations
","When I heard that Nicholas Cage would take on the role of Jhonny Blaze AKA the Ghost Rider, I was a little bit unsure...of course he is a big comic book fan no doubt (after all he named his son Kal-El and has a Ghost Rider tattoo) but still I felt the part would not really appeal to him but with Christian Bale managing to pull of a great performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman I thought to my-self lets give him a try. Although I was not totally satisfied I was pleased with his take on as Jhonny Blaze and the film it-self was nothing short of brilliant. Don't get me wrong , its no Oscar winner and we all know that but one thing is for that it is enough to keep any comic book nerd happy. Although some things were changed around (which I dislike), I was willing to let them slide because the actual story seemed to fit in very nicely with the spirit of the comic. Motorcylce stuntman Jhonny Blaze sells his soul to the Devil Mephisto (played in style by Peter Fonda)so he can become the Ghost Rider whose job is track down anyone who escapes from hell. In this case the son of the Devil, Blackheart played to an impressive level by Wes Bentley who is here to unleash hell on earth. Although it is a wafer thin plot, the film moves at a fast pace and does not break off into tiny annoying little sub-plots . There are small doses of romance, and wit which don't through the film of its course. The special affects where dazzling and watching Blaze transform into the fiery entity was definitely something! Too conclude , this film was another great comic to film adaption which any person who is not familiar with the comics can watch and enjoy and gathering from the other positive reviews others are giving it, no one is really listening to the critics. Ghost Rider was not as good as the Spider-man , Blade and X-Men franchise but it certainly blazed passed Dare Devil and Hulk .GHOST RIDER - 8.9 OUT 10 LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE RIDER IS THE DEVIL'S BOUNTY HUNTER!

X-Men: The Last Stand," Flawed but fitting end to one of the best comic-to-big screen adaptations.
","I have just finished watching X-Men: The Last Stand and being a fan of the comics, and TV series since I was a kid I was naturally holding high expectations of this final chapter . The last 2 X-Men movies were great and this should of been the one to top it of. Basically this time the story revolves around some sort of cure that has been found for the mutants making them human again , yet again this does not go down well with mutant fundamentalist Magento in whose eyes history is repeating it-self takes it upon him-self and forms a group known as The Brotherhood (Brother hood of evil mutants in the comics). And once again it is up to good old Professer X and the gang to save the world and also deal with the return of Jean Grey who is not quite her-self. First of X-men waste's no time in going into the action straight away and we are shown by the action that this time they mean business. The SFX were great and there were even a few shockers along the way which kept me going , but however not only that but you get to see a few sides to the characters that you not normally see and it was good to show some development on the likes of Wolverine,Storm , even Rogue . The acting was great from the norm of Hugh Jackmamn , Halle Berry , Patrick Stuart, Ian Mckalen , but however I felt that the stand out performance was Kelsay Grammar who played Hank McCoy/Beast (they got him spot on correct, and even Vinnie Jones was fairly amusing as the Juggernaut . However this movie is not without its fair share of problems , although I felt that there was a lot more emotions in this movie compared to the other 2 I did feel that it was a little too rushed and thusly tried to cram a bit too much in 2 hours . I also felt some of the characters were a little over used i.e. Pyro , Clossalus . Another that also bugged me was the changing of the story line and any comic book fan would tell you that they would tell that and I was tempted to take a few marks of for that but I guess I am just a bit too much of a softy . On the whole The Last Stand has a few problems but if you can over look that trust me it will be worth it . A very fine but not perfect end to what has been one of the best comic-to-movie saga's and I am looking forward to solo Wolverine and Magento projects coming up.X-MEN : THE LAST STAND 9 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK.",7,1,2,31 December 2006
I Am Legend," Whole new meaning to concrete jungle...
","I had my reservations about watching I Am Legend as Will Smith's last sci-fi attempt which was I Robot was Luke warm at best although it did raise some very interesting philosophical questions. However as the holiday season roles on I was still on my anti-Christmas crusade and I for one was glad for checking this movie out on Boxing Day. This for me has to be again another one of Will Smith best performances! His portrayal of a man who is all alone is moving yet sometimes emotional hard to watch and as time goes on it becomes more and more easy to sympathise with as we see the desperation of this man unfold. The setting and the scenery of NYC was done very nicely which made it feel very bleak and depressing . Having said that I felt that there were some good usages of CGI although I do personally feel that a little bit too much was used and that kind of dampened the enjoyment . Another thing was that the movie might of dragging on in some minor places and the ending just felt a little too rushed but having said that Will Smith was the man who carried the whole movie on his shoulders. To conclude I Am Legend is a dull, bleak and uncompromising vision into the future which again beckons more questions to be asked and really gives a vision of a cold unforgiving version of a concrete jungle, it was also a nice change from the typical post apocalyptic genre and makes a nice edition to it with its uniqueness although I don't know how they kept it in spirit of the book but I shall check that out as well. Highly recommended for those who are not in the festive mood and for fans of the sci-fi/end of the world genre as it will keep you firmly in your seat.I AM LEGEND: 8.6 OUT OF 10THE LAST MAN ON EARTH IS NOT ALONE...",8,1,2,27 December 2007
The Game," Well what else would expect from the man who gave us Fight Club and Se7en?
","I really had not the slightest clue what I purchased when I bought myself a copy of the game. From the trailer the film looked like it was worth a look and it seemed as if I was also invented to go along for the ride when I picked it up. I would rather not discuss the plot with anyone because this movie is definitely an experience which some could argue come close to what the late Alferd Hitchcock would bring to us , all I can say that after watching you might love it loathe one thing is for certain and that is that won't ever be bored during the course of this journey. As good as Sean Penn is , this was without a shout of a doubt Micheal Douglas's movie , from the begin he just lures you in with his unique form of acting to the point where one actually begins to sympathises with him. There are classic Dave Fincher trademarks whether it be deliberately keeping things dark with plenty of twists and turns and not to mention a tight script. My only complaint was that the movie might just drag a little in places but having said that it never wonders far at all and the action and suspense is great. To conclude I had no idea what this movie would be like when I viewed it last night and I guess that was the trick of it all as we take the ride with Mr Van Orton ! Highly recommended to movie lovers all over the world and make sure this is on your '100 movies to watch before I Die' list !

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," major improvement on the first !
","The first Fantastic Four felt like a Lamborghini Gallordo, from the out-side you wanted to check it out but then once you saw it and experienced it, you realised that it was not all that and you felt cheated and left out. However just like Lamborghini, the makers of the disappointing Fantastic Four went back to the drawing board and gave us this version of the Fantastic Four , only this time round they threw the Silver Surfer in for good measure and to be honest , The Silver Surfer was the one who probably saved this one this time round. Although the problems that arose with the first film are still very apparent with this one , it is the Siover Surfer appearing out of nowhere with his presence that ends up saving the movie and not to mention Julian Mchmaon who helped give Doctor Doom a little more justice this time round. To conclude although Rise of The Silver Surfer might not be the greatest comic book movie made , the producer went away and done some research on the movie which made this one entertaining and fun to watch, worth a look at.Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer - 8.3 out of 10RISE...",7,4,8,3 August 2008
Transformers," An amazing movie with an amazing experience!
","I grew watching Transformers and playing it with my friends as a little kid in the school playground (I was always a Decepticon). When I saw the trailer for the very first time I was blown away at the special affects and saw my child hood cartoon characters bought to life - something in me said that this movie was going to rock but I have had my doubts since Spider-man 3 that was billed to be the biggest blockbuster of summer turned out to be an over-hyped let down. I am glad to tell you that Transformers was something that lived up to the hype!!! Right from the opening scene one is blown away from the awesomeness and power of these cybernetic organisms and once again you felt like a little child amazed by what unfolded in front you. CGI was definitely what made this movie and without it, its hard to imagine otherwise but it is absolutely amazing as you watching a massive robot turn its self into a fighter jet and back again. It was good to see all my old goodies like Optimus Prime with the correct voice from the cartoon series and an ultra cool paint job and the rest of the gang hanging about and certainly not to mention the bad guys who really meant business. The movie retained a comical tone all the way through with gags and wise cracks from everyone which was funny. The acting was great as all the actors really put it well with the interaction with the robots . My only complaint was that I felt everyone was a little too clued up on what to do and how to tackle the impending problems and he ending left a bit like eh? was that it ? But however I did remember things kicking off and shutting down very quickly on the cartoon series as well which is another reason for old time sake I let the cheesy one liners go. I would of also like to have seen some character development on other Autobots and Decpitcons because any Transformers fan will tell you that they each have their own personality thats why you gotta love them all !Too conclude Transformers was a piece of childhood that I thought I would never see on the big screen but thanks to the modern wonders of CGI done correctly it was kind of like a dream come true , I would ask fans to go with other fans and those of have young kids of their own take them and share a piece of your childhood with them.

Saw II," jigsaw = dr phil !!
","The first saw put thrillers and horror films back onto the map and restored , atmosphere and tension to a genre which it seemed had become dull and bland. And although as the way things are going these days, it was a only a matter of time before a sequel was realised to the genre and one had to be aware as sequels can totally ruin a genre completely i.e. The Hills have Eyes part 2. On the other hand I was very pleasantly surprised with Saw 2 , as Jigsaw promised us from the start that there will be blood and yes he promised us. From the grizzly opening sequence we are reminded of who Jigsaw is and why he put saw on the map, however just like Hellraiser we taken into the world of the charther and we are given a background and like Pinhead , Jigsaw comes across as a philosophical character who was played pretty well by Tobin Bell. It seemed that someone actual took there time and studied well at what would make our skin crawl and trust me there were at least 2 parts in the movie that my flesh crawl and I don't squirm that easy . The film moved at a fast pace and the the fact that it has been thought through and it is not some dull formulaic teen slasher flick is what keeps you hooked. The only down thing about the movie is that the acting is not the greatest and there were supposed to be some gory moments which just end up being funny for me . On the whole I thought that Saw 2 was a flick that was aimed at a brainless teen genre but it ended up being one of the best thrillers/horrors I have seen since Se7en , a must see although if you watch closely enough you might just catch the twist however on the whole a great movie and a good way for Jigsaw to place him-self with the likes of other great horror movie icons like Pinhead and Hannibal Lector.SAW 2 : 8.6 OUT OF 10'Oh yes! , THERE WILL BE BLOOD'!",8,0,1,23 June 2008
Black Snake Moan," Very good performances from Jackson and Ricci.
","I thought Black Snake Moan would be one of those Walk The Line type of movies but I was completely wrong as Samual L Jackson adds another interesting character to his already impressive CV. The story is what attracted me to it in the first place, about a deeply religious blues player named Lazurus whose missus has just left him and he is pretty cut up over it but tries not to let it get to him as he holds his faith near to him whilst on the other side we have Rae (by far Chritina Ricci's best role to date) who is one could say a version of 'the beast in the heat'. The plot is not really that big , but what the film does show us is that if you take away all the stuff that is going on around them they are at the end of the day two troubled souls reaching out for love. Chracther development was the main the thing that this film focused on and done a wonderful job of people going into Lazurus and Rae's lives. Samual L Jackson was brilliant as the blue's guitarist and I really enjoyed every moment he was stringing his stuff. Chirstina Ricci'e performance was the one that moved me and I felt she was the star of the show and Timberlake done well with his small performance. To conclude Black Snake Moan was something different from what I would normally see , the film deals with a lot of taboo themes of drug abuse , interracial relations , Nudity etc but it goes beyond that and makes the viewer see it for what the core subject is at hand. I would recommend to people who would like to view something different for a change but I would say check it out when it comes out for rental or on TV.

The Dark Knight," There was NOTHING funny about this Joker!
","The Dark Knight was probably the only and truly comic book movie this summer that everyone wanted to see , of course their was Hulk and Iron Man and Hellboy but this one was well worth the wait. Giving the tragic death of Heath Ledger I kind of thought that I owed it to him to watch this movie as a means of paying my respect to him. AND boy o boy , Mr Ledger has left a mark on the movie and comic book world that will not be forgotten. Christopher Nolen has shown the world that if you sit down and do your homework then the results will speak for them-selves. The Dark Knight is nothing but pure escapism as we plunge straight back into a world of darkness and now chaos.Christian Bale is just a joy to watch and this time round he seems a lot more relaxed with the Batman character and we are allowed to come into the Batman world. Gary Oldman and Aaron Echkart all were a joy to watch and I was waiting to see how they would the two-face character and I was glad to see he was given a better treatment than Venom . But truly the one the only Joker was the one who runs away with the whole show. Unlike Jack Nicolason this Joker is genuinely creepy and his macabre sense of humour is just not funny even to someone like me! The thing to note about this movie is that we get to see some detective work which also reminds us a bit of CSI , this film is something that keeps in tune in spirit of the comic book and just puts Christian Bale on the map, however in my op-ion I hope Heath Ledger finds some peace because he simply was a fright to watch on the screen.

Green Street Hooligans," One hell of a way to do 50th review .
","Green Street Hooligans is well on its way to becoming a cult classic. The film simply kicks ass to say the least . The great thing about it is that it views the subject of football hooligan's through the eyes of a complete stranger who is not well used to this kind of life. This film is one hell of a roller coaster ride that waste no time getting into the action . Being that it is the World Cup and being an England fan I had decided to check this out giving the reputation English football fans have although oddly enough they have been very well mannered during all of England's games ! The film actually explains what the structure and the violent nature of the firms that go these matches just to cause trouble . The material is nitty-gritty , no holds barred fun which at times one could say that hypes up violence. But the absolute brilliant thing is that is portrays hooligans as human beings rather complete mindless thugs . The acting is top notch , Elijah Wood shows a brilliant show of a mousy , geeky nerd who then transforms into one of the boys who will stop at nothing to show how loyal he is to the football hooligans code of honour , Charlie Huuman also kicked ass showing us a fearless gang leader he is and Danny boy from Hustle proved that he is a talented actor and Jake from Eastenders popped his head in . My only regret is that I did not check this movie out any sooner , however my piece of advice would be that you should not check this out as a football movie , just take the ride with Elijah Wood and you will see that you shall be able to relate to him . I mean at the end of the day have not we all wanted to be part of something ! to be accepted ! these groups are like a social out let for these guys . A must see for all soon to be a cult classic .GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS - 8.8 OUT OF 10FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOODNIGHT AND GOOD LUCK !",8,2,5,19 June 2006
Blood Diamond," One Leo's best performances
","Blood Diamond was a remarkable film that should of gotten film of the year award after The Departed. NOT that I am saying The Departed was no good I just felt in Blood Diamond we were given true depth into Leo DiCaprio's ability as an actor. Set in the back drop of the Seirra Leone Civil War, Blood Diamond is the story of lust power , money , greed to the highest degree all over a rare pink diamond for which all this madness and chaos is about. There is a lot happening in this film so you do have to watch it carefully and usually that would be a complaint of mine but in this film it was I felt an important part because it is all about the chaos that happens in a nation and how the ones in power will do absolutely everything to make sure that carnage ensues so that they can line their pockets with the blood money. The acting was top notch and I really could go on forever how Leo DiCap stole the show with one of his best performances (he starting to compete with Jhonny Depp now , as he has long shrug of his handsome, pretty boy image in Titanic). Djimou Houston acting was also something special as he plays an innocent man caught up in all this and not to mention Jennifer Connolley as a reporter trying ever so hard to make a difference but frustrated at the lack of international attention and not to mention stand out performance's from Arnold Vosloo and the Rebel United Front leader. The action was fast and non-stop with equal amounts of wit and humour from every angle, my only thing was that apart from its romantic moments which never really hit the spot apart from in one scene because we all know really that everybody is out for them-selves at the end of the day. To sum it I would have to say that Blood Diamond is an experiment with the truth. It shows how far a people with power are willing to stretch to ensure that a nation will tear it-self apart so the customer demands of the likes 50 cents, Snopp Dogg are met but only if they realised the amount of blood spilt for a diamond which shows how cheap life really is worth out there.BLOOD DIAMOND - 8.8 OUT OF 10IT WILL COST YOU EVERYTHING !",8,1,2,2 July 2007
National Treasure," very good summer time movie.
","National Treasure is one of those films that you really have to check out for your-self and make your mind up . This movie for me makes a change from the normal type of films that I check out in the sense that it was not that heavy at all . The good thing about it was that it moved at a good pace and really did not fire of into in sub-plot or and twists that were too complicated , the humour was funny and sharp but another good thing about this film was that the action was quick sharp , not really gory at all which was surprisingly good to be really honest but the good thing about National Treasure was that unlike a Schwartznegger action flick where the action is over flowing all over the place this one was in quick short bursts leaving you wanting more . I also learnt a bit about the American history so it is educational to some extend to those who don't know that much about American history . The acting was great , especially the father son relationship between Cage and Voight and lets not forget about Sean Bean after all he was 006 !!!. The only let down would be that this would be one of those movies that appeal to fans of Nicolas Cage and people who enjoyed the Tomb Raider flicks and to those fans who also enjoyed movies like Ocean's 11 as it did try and incorporate these high-tech heist scenes which were enjoyable having said that . On the whole , this was in my opinion a great holiday/summer time flick and I am actually looking forward to the sequel . NATIONAL TREASURE - 7.5 OUT 10",7,1,1,2 January 2006
Inside Man," Nice joint rolled up by Lee
","From the trailer of Inside Man you can tell straight away that it is going to be a good movie. And right from the word go it does not disappoint, as you thrown straight away into the action and one excellent thing was that you got to learn a bit about the characters as the film rolled on and did not stop for anything. Clive Owen was nothing short of brilliant as a smart, witty and ultra cool bank robber with Denzel at the other end pulling his weight as well. The other cast members like Defoe, and Foster not to mention Owen's team done a very good job. The film as it stands on its own was nothing short of fantastic as Spike Lee leaves you lost in it. Although it was an action/thriller movie it still had its bits of sharp humour which was most welcoming as well as being a smart taking an odd twist or turn and not leaving the viewer confused . I would love to go further into it and explain the film but I feel that might be giving a bit away, so my advice to you is check out the trailer , then the film and I promise you it will be time well spent ! To sum it up Inside Man is a clever, caper flick which has been very well directed and brought together, but if you don't believe me , check it out for your-self. Personally I'm waiting for Lee to roll another class act up like this one.INSIDE MAN - 8.6 OUT OF 10, FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK !",8,2,3,27 November 2006
Pulp Fiction," Original and best .
","I've seen Sin City , and despite the mere fact that i have saw Sin City first , Pulp Fiction was much better . A mix of Hollywood's top stars come together and put a huge great performance and also one make one hell of a film , By far QT's greatest piece of work and shame on me again for buying it and not watching it sooner !!! John Travolta , Sam L Jackson , Bruce Willis , Chris Walken , Ving Rhames all make use of their time on the screen . Its so difficult to pick out a story that i like the most and maybe because the dialogue is all top notch and with a sense of humour that will make you the light of any party if you brought it along with you . Apart from that there is nothing more i can say apart from check it out - You will love it !

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A Class Act.
","I made a few attempts to watch Lock , Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels . Once on T.V. and twice on DVD and with failure always found my-self losing interest (maybe because there was a lot more going on the out-side of my life ) . However last night for some reason or another I sat down and watched it and yes it really was that dame good . The dialogue was classy , the jokes hit the spot and I did find it to be some what addictive viewing . This film goes up there with Pulp Fiction , it does require a close following to but once you get sucked in , trust me you will love every second of it ! The plot is wacky , the ride that follows after that is a barrel of laughs . The main character's are not trying to go OTT on acting like hard men but it flows naturally even their dim-witted behaviour . I would say that my favourite characters would have to be Soap for his witty comments especially when it come to knives , Vinnie Jones who seems to play a very questionable roll model to his son as his line of work is not totally kosher but my absolute favourite has to be the football loving yardie Rory Breaker played with brilliance by Vas Blackwood (His I'll kill ya speech just can't stop making me laugh ) . This one Britian's finest exports , highly entertaining stuff , not to be missed with plenty of reply value , but thats what you would expect from the man who gave you Snatch .

The Departed," worthy of ALL its awards.
","Let start this review of by saying that I am by no means a big Oscar lover or fan of the glitzy-glitz award shows and ceremonies but having just seen The Deaprted, its hard not over look this movie and not give it the awards it was nominated for. When I read that Martin Scorsese was going to take up the task of doing an American take on the Hong Kong smash hit Infernal Affairs , it did raise eye brows as yet Hollywood's take on the Grudge ans Ring were well ...crap to be honest and I can't really see a remake of The Eye being all that either but having said that I was completely shocked and mesmerised by Scorcese and I would say that this is probably his best film to date (taking over Taxi Driver and Cape Fear by miles). Not your average cops and robbers thriller, The Departed takes place in Boston with Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello who is head of the Irish Mafia who has sent his best knight in shinning armour into the State Police with the task of rising above the ranks and slowly take control of the force . Whilst on the other hand the state police send an undercover mole to infiltrate the mafia , from there on it becomes a game of who is screwing who ? The acting of the movie was nothing short of superb Nicolson, DiCaprio, Damon , Sheen, Baldwin and Walhberg ALL shinned but I think kudos should go Dicaprio for his stand out performance (he might be a worthy advisory for Jhonney Depp ). The script and pace of the movie was sharp and quick with equal wit and attitude , my only complaint was that it ended a little to quickly for me. To conclude The Deaprted shows just what quality film making is , and also shows the true shine of a director like Martin Scoresese although I have yet to check out Infernal Affairs , I can quite comfortably say that it does stand out on its own . A true masterpiece worthy of its Oscars.THE DEPARTED : 8.8 OUT 10HOW FAR WILL YOU TAKE IT?",8,0,5,26 February 2007
30 Days of Night," a deep, dark and depressing way to end 2007
","From the trailers 30 days of Night looked like a good Vampire movie however with an out landish plot I decided to go ahead and check it out anyway. Set in the desolate and isolated town of Barrow in Alaska close to the Artic circle, 30 Days of Night is about a group of Vampires who decent on the town and its people after the town is plunged into darkness for a month. The good part about this movie is that well it was the right time of the year to realise it with the 'coldness' to it. The film did not waste anytime getting into the action as well most of these people are going to die anyway so who cares however Josh Harnett who I agree with most people was a little too young for this role but I felt that he carried him-self well. There was a miserable and depressing tone throughout the movie which really help set the mood and a very clever use of film colours which made one feel the harshness of the Arctic circle. For truly the real stars of the shows had to be the Vampires! not only was the interaction top-notch but also they didn't behave like Bella Lugusi ! These lot were fierce , savage and brutal and it was brilliant watching them on screen with a genuine creepiness to the way they howl (guess they don't like the cold either) and some great killing styles which made you jump here and there, with an eerie silence you didn't know where the would strike from. Having said the problems occur with the story , its starts of good but then feels rushed and messy and at one point we lose track of what is going on. Robert Kneepper still reminds me of Tea Bag out of prison break and the camera work just feels like a child was doing it and although the dim colouring did help it became a little too dark to follow in most places. Another thing was towards the end it just felt rush because it seemed that Evan knew a little tooo much about the Vampires?...when did he become Blade ? To conclude 30 Days of Night is truly big on the entertainment value however having said that it has its share of faults but if willing to see past them it is a good , brutal , fast movie and a good edition to the Vampire genre. Defientley worth a look at when it hits the rental stores.30 DAYS OF NIGHT : 7.8 OUT OF 10THEY HAVE LIVED IN THE SHADOWS, THEY ARE THE LAST OF THEIR KIND, BUT IN THE ARTIC CIRCLE, WHERE NIGHT NIGHT LAST FOR 30 DAYS...

Downfall," a must see.
","This film is one of the best war films made . A film that absorb you into totally to the point where you lose track of time . Hats off to Bruno Ganz - it was as if you really were watching Adolf Hitler , all other actors done a truly tremendous job that gave it that sick , dark , depressing feel !!! Although this film was given a label because it humanest Hitler - it didn't . It showed Hitler as the rest of us - YES , but it did not tear away from the point that Hitler was a monster and that it stuck true to . The tension in it was unbearable as you were waiting for the Russian army to invade . One of the best war time movies ever made and I believe personally it should be played in history lessons across the UK so the youth can be educated about the the true atrocities of The Third Reich . This film was far better than Hitler : The Rise Evil, a must watch for any film fan .",8,0,2,20 September 2005
American Gangster," Denzel - My Man....
","From the reviewers posted by certain people I had got the impression that American Gangster one of the top films to have come out of Hollywood , having said that only very few actors with big names like Crowe and Washington can carry off something as great as this without the egos clashing. For me American Gangster was truly worth all the hype , Ridley Scott set out to tell us a story , not only entertain us and he carried so well that it was so easy to get sucked into it. Denzel Washington played a rather different type of gangster , unlike a drug kingpin like Tony Montana or Nino Brown , George Lucas comes across as a charming caring, figure who at the end of the day was probably conducting business unaware of the ramifications of what he would end up turning Harlem into however Denzel Washington plays this character with such grace that one actually anticipates his presences on screen with his knowledge and Savoy. Russell Crowe as well plays a very flawed character with great ease and really sticks to his guns and during the course of this movie one can say that both men are fighting for what they believe in . Aside from Washington and Crowe everyone else played the part well , it was as if everyone really did enjoy their screen time which actually made it probably more realistic and not to mention the colours,lights, and camera angels used by Scott make this a true beauty to watch. My only problem was that it was over 2 hours long and I did get a neck ache afterwards but however in the whole there was never a scene that dragged on. My conclusion is that American Gangster is homage to the blaxipoltain flicks of the 70's as well as telling us a story which has not been stereotyped into a certain genre. Certainly this movie must be on your '100 movies to watch before I die' list.American GANGSTER : 8.9 OUT OF 10THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE American DREAM...",8,1,4,4 February 2008
Shooter," A filling action movie.
","Shooter seems to come across as a light, no brainer time pass action movie which we see the market getting crowded with. But however that truly was not the reality of this movie as I pleasantly surprised. After his country screws him during a mission in Africa in which his close friend dies , Mr.Swagger (Walhberg) retires to live a life of solitude in the country however that peaceful silence is once again broken when his 'country men' need him only to screw him over again. It does not seem like much of a plot but the good thing is that it moves at a quick pace with action all the way through it and with no silly little sub-plots which bore the audience. Mark Walhberg seems to step into the shoes of an action movie star with considerable skill and I was very satisfied with his performance and Danny Glover also kept the movie rolling along nicely. To conclude Shooter is a welcome return to action movies from the likes of Commando and Die Hard , movies which no matter how many times you watch , you can never really get bored of. Any how I would recommend Shooter to anybody who enjoys a different kind of action movie, the script might not be as sharp as one could hope for but it kept me in my seat for 2 hours.SHOOTER - 8 OUT 10JUST LIKE THEY SAID THAT WMD ARE IN IRAQ AND LIKE WHEN THEY SAID ANNA NICOLE SMITH MARRIED FOR LOVE!",8,1,4,2 April 2007
Blow," The real Tony Montana .
","Blow is just the rise and fall of George Jung , who after watching this film I have rightfully crowned the real Tony Montana . Played with just style by Jhonny Depp you really thought you were in dream land watching this film . I guess the most disturbing fact about this film is the way cocaine was glamorised giving the history period of America with the 'EVEYONE'S DOING IT ' life-style and how one man fought to exploit it and ended up making millions from it and then was drawn into the increasingly dangerous world of the drugs market . The reason I really enjoyed this film was because Jhonny Depp and Penelope Cruz acted up to very high standards and everything script , setting etc was top notch with moments of humour which I felt i should not of laughed at but did anyway . And the second reason behind this because you can look at a so called hard-man or gang banger wannabe and now laugh at him in the face because you'll probably think to your-self that he wont last 10 seconds in the game .

Vanilla Sky," Forget everything you have ever know about LoveHateWorkLifeSex......and just open your eyes
","Vanilla Sky is a film that is truly like walking into a different world , a trip to the twilight zone if thats what you choose to call it . I think that right from the start it is made to confuse us and lets us dazed and confused long after we have seen it . I wont go into to much detail about the plot or whats going on in the one because I felt that more people have a much vivid and better review than I could ever done on the IMDb and it is also pretty fascinating to check out peoples perception of what they thought . Tom Cruise does a top-notch job this time as his good looks cant save him literally !! Cameron Diaz surprises me quite a lot on this one I however found Penelope Cruz to be a tad bit annoying but apart from that one of Tom Cruise's best performances . Check out but don't leave your brain at the door as may be required to think quite a bit and challenge everything in your path whilst watching this film .P.S. - I WAS DISTRACTED SEVERAL TIMES WHILST WATCHING THIS MOVIE BUT THAT ONLY MADE ME FOCUSED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING .",8,2,4,12 December 2005
Iron Man," Entertaining!
","I went to go see Iron Man on my day off , although being a huge fan of Marvel comics in general I was not really a huge fan of Iron Man but the movie was worth a check out. Robert Downy Jr was brilliant as Tony Stark , he actually reminded me of Nic Cages take on Johnny Blaze / Ghostrider . The good thing about the movie was that it tried to be entertaining and not too political which at one point became my fear in the movie. The special affects and the awesome action are what stop this movie from its storyline which although deals with Morley the birth of a hero and a little a less on the movie rolling along side , but because Robert Downy Jr was just so hilarious as Iron Man I was just willing to let that go. To sum it up Iron Man might not be the biggest or the best comic-to-big-screen action movie , it certainly lives up to it advertising and delivers and entertaining flick which is worth a look at and I certainly would not mind checking out a sequel to it.IRON MAN 8.0 OUT OF 10 FULLY CHARGED ...",8,1,3,8 June 2008
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig sets the defies and sets the standard for a new Bond.
","I was a huge fan of Pierce Brosnan as Bond and was actually ever disappointed when I felt that he had been unfairly screwed out of his Bond role. However when Daniel Craig was going to take over the role I was a bit adamant about it as although he was good actor I don't feel he was the ideal role for James Bond and I guess thats what really but me of watching Casino Royale. However yesterday as I got ready to watch it I was glad to say that Casino Royale lives up to its hype and delivers on all levels. Craig set the new standard for which Bond which I guess in a way all Bond fans have been waiting to see. I can't remember seeing a Bond so cold since ...Timothy Dalton's performance in A License to Kill , Craig has simply taken the smooth talking ladies man who played by the rules , torn the book the book up and has given us somebody who feeds of his ego and does not hesitate to kill but then in some perverse way . he likes it. The action from start to finish was brilliant with Craig as the no nonsense Bond who stops at nothing to get to his target. Although there are very gadgets the movie has plenty going for it in the use of action scenes and gun fights. The villains were pretty sinister in a non-romantic sense which was fine. My only complaint was that showing the depth of 007 may of slowed the movie down in places but it kept on going to the ending in which Craig stylishly shows the haters who is the new Bond. To conclude , Casino Royale is a boost to what was slowly turning into stale series and is a welcome return to the Bond which I guess most of us have been waiting to see for a while.CASINO ROYALE - 8.6 OUT OF 10 EVERYONE HAS A PAST.

Trainspotting," Just Watch it , nuff said .
","This is one of the films that you see and have various aspects of it applied to your life . On the surface its not that difficult for me explain but then also when you get into it gets far more complicated . The mere fact of this brilliant film is that it makes you laugh silly in some places and yet makes your stomach literally cringe in other places it will just leave you speechless . Obi-Wan is the guy who owned this movie BUT Hitler/Renard might give him a run for his money.The rest of support cast make a fine job but please be warned its a no holds barred film with a really hard hitting message which probably in our own way makes us aware of the risk of drug taking and the world you are taken into . What ever you do , add this to your 'films i must see before i die list '",8,0,1,31 July 2005
Signs," Very good. Not to be compared to Independence Day or War Of The Worlds.
","After watching the Dr.Who xmas invasion I decided to go with my alien invasion / sci-fi mood . When I checked out the trailer for Signs , it looked really good and appealed to me and I decided to go and check it out . What I first of all would like to say is if your going to watch this film and are expecting a huge epic like Independence Day or War of the Worlds then forget it . This movie does not use special affects a lot but instead builds up tension and suspense just like back in the 'old days' when you people would be glued to the TV with your jaw touching the ground not believing what happening . Thats what Signs done for me . Instead of showing space ships tearing New York,Tokyo , London apart or F-16 fighter jets roaring through the sky , your given huge level of tension that builds up and jumps out at you at all the right moments . Mel Gibson and the future Jhonny Cash-Joaquin Phoneix were a joy to watch and also the 2 kids all pulled in brilliant acting performances . I guess the only real flaw was how much info could the little boy pull out of one book which seemed a little odd as to how all his theories could be correct ???? But in general a brilliant film and not to be missed ! 8.5 out of 10 for me .",8,0,4,29 December 2005
Casino," An amazing film!
","I had bought my-self a copy of Casino a while back ago but never did get round to watching it, however on Sunday I did as I thought I would keep up with my gangster movie phase I am going through, however unfortunately whilst watching it , my disc messed up and I got annoyed as anything (never purchase second hand DVD's). However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this. This movie had all the ingredients to keep to make a recipe for disaster and Scorecse just brighten's it up for us which keeps us hooked. The most funny I found about this movie was that Robert De Niro reminds me of my own ex-boss, his constant nagging and micro-management of everything might seem good to others , but then to the rest of us he just seemed like a control freak and all round ass hole. But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.CASINO - 8.8 OUT OF 10 You Don't Stay At The Top Forever...",8,1,2,22 January 2008
Fantastic Four," I felt disappointed by this one.
","Some people gave this Marvel adaption positive reviews but the over whelming majority gave this negative reviews and keeping that in mind I decided to venture on with viewing this although. And trying not to be too harsh with this one although it was entertaining on the whole it felt more like a let down. Based loosely on the Ultimate Fantastic Four the film tries to keep in spirit with the comic book however the problems are very clear and present from the very start. The first problem is that it moves way way to fast and thusly gives no time for character development which just makes the movie seem like a brainless action movie and does not make us care about the characters , something which I found very disappointing giving that I grew up on the cartoons and comics. The script just seemed very superficial that even I could memorise it without any problems. Although the actors done good with what they had it felt that just like Topher Grace as Venom they had very little to work with I would have to say that stand out performances were from Julian McMahon as Dr Doom apart from that the movie was nothing special at all. I would recommend it as a rental and that is if you can't find anything else to watch.FANTASTIC FOUR - 7.8 OUT OF 10PREPARE FOR THE FANTASTIC...",7,1,2,20 July 2008
Jackie Brown," A grossly misunderstood movie.
","QT's Jackie Brown is homage... homage to movies from the 70's blaxpoiltation era to movies like Superfly,Coffy , and The Mack. That I feel that was over looked from the audience who saw this movie and thusly I feel did not give it the type of review that it deserved. This movie can't be rushed or crammed because for me Jackie Brown is a character study from person to person , we are given time to analyse each character to and to see them for what they really are. Everything in this movie is form following function and that can be told from Tarintino's heavy study on the lingo used by the characters and not to mention the soundtrack and settings which just add homage to the genre. This movie is different from what others might expect from QT , but it really has to be followed closely and appreciated as we get to see him stretch out his wings further into the artistic world of directing. Having said that I feel that Jackie Brown may not be for everyone because not everyone will understand it will probably require than one viewing but if you can get through that then trust me you might really get to see it for what it really is.JACKIE BROWN : 8.6 OUT OF 10THIS Christmas , SANTA'S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG...",8,1,2,15 February 2008
Coach Carter," education,education, education !
","I decided to take a break from my normal action viewing of movies and decided to check out Coach Carter. Although Coach Carter might be a typical MTV Hollywood teen movie , the message it sends is clear! Education is the key to freedom which gives you the edge over others , although it seems typical in places it goes along at a nice pace and you actually route and feel for the characters in this movie. There are some funny moments in this film and a few turns which make it different from other movies. Samual L Jackson as usual is in fine form for his commanding roles although I felt he did not require too much practise for this one. All members of the basket ball team done well with their performances. On the whole Coach Carter I felt is a good change for those who want to watch some solid drama .COACH CARTER - 8.1 OUT OF 10IT BEGINS ON THE STREETS..AND IT ENDS HERE ...",8,1,1,4 May 2008
True Romance," True master piece
","This film was great . QT , has proved to us why he is the most influential writer and director of our time . So many stars put together underneath one film and the most shocking thing is that they all make good use of their time on the screen . EVEN BRAD PITT , WHO IS DOING NOTHIING BUT GETTING HIGH ! Its rather difficult to pick out a favourite scene in this film but the scene with Gary Oldman , Sam L Jackson and the other guys in that room was style . The conversation between Walken and Hopper was worth the price of Admission alone indeed . And not lets not forget about Val Kilmers humorous take as the Elvis him-self . This is what is called entertainment , a mix of everything you could expect however check out the 2 disc edition on DVD as the film it-self wont be alone and the extra's will keep you hooked that little bit longer .'PRETEND THIS IS A FINE CENTER FOLD B!TCH , AND YOU , YOUR SITTING DOWN....'",8,1,3,24 July 2005
Gladiator," Ridley Scott puts epic back on the map
","When I was at High School everyone was going on about Gladiator and how good it was. Having seen several old movies like Spartus, I knew that these movies would require you to get into the mood for them to really enjoy them. And it seemed that all these years later and several failed attempts later I finally got around to viewing it. All I can say is that it truly was worth the hype when it came out and after all this time it still has not lost its shine as it still has the ability to entertain us. Ridley Scott set out to give us an epic and thats exactly what he had managed to do. I can't think of anybody else who could of done a job to the quality of Russell Crowe although if you pay close attention you can hear his Australian accent a bit. Joaquin Phoneix him-self was marvellous along with Oliver Reed, along with Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris , they were nothing short of mind blowing. The script was sharp and tight not to mention the costumes, make-up and various other things that made the whole experiences breath taking. The music alone is worth a purchase and it adds a certain haunt to the point where one really does want to cry. To conclude Gladiator for me is a bit like a Porshce Carrera GT , if you put the effort into watching this then I promise it is a form of pure escapism rather than entertainment. It must be on your '100 films to watch before I die' list!GLADIATOR - 8.6 OUT OF 10'On my command - unleash hell' , Maxiums (Russsell Crowe)",8,1,2,14 April 2008
Donnie Darko," It will change the way you look at life .
","The majority of films i tend to watch are for the sole purpose of entertainment , but however when the magic of that film stays with long after the film has finished then it has indeed served its purpose . Donnie Darko is a film that does that for me , this film drew me into a world where nothing is what it seems like at all , we are taken on journey where i believe we experience the chaos theory and we are told that everything that we do has a consequence . The film it-self has a sense of humour but also retains that certain level of being creepy . With a twist that is added on to every level of the film up to the climax leaving people a little dazed and confused . This film is certainly not one to view just for entertainment purposes as it will probably get you thinking a lot and it is not for people with a short attention span as you have to follow it very carefully . However i defiantly recommend this film , add this to your films to watch before i die list .",8,0,1,14 August 2005
