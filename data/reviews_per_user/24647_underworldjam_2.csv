Mission: Impossible III," Redeemed The Brand
","I was a little hesitant about seeing this film as I didn't really like the 1st and the 2nd was awful. I love the original TV series so realise how much potential there is with the right script. I'm not much of a fan of Tom Cruise, but JJ Abrahms direction was a draw. I got talked into seeing it and wasn't disappointed at all. The action was exciting and original from start to finish, with a few good stunts thrown in along the way. The plot had a little more depth than your average action movie but wasn't too difficult to follow as it so easily could have been. I would recommend it to any fan of the action genre, or anyone who just fancies a couple of hours of fun.",8,3,6,4 May 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Amazing!! But not quite perfect.
","I was more excited to see this film than any other. I finally got to see it at the cinema I manage last night. Overall I can say it was fantastic, I came out with that buzz that I felt after watching the 1st film. The film quickly got started and from there it never really let up, the action was constant with plenty of humour along the way. The style was very much the same as the 1st film just with more of it.The introduction of new characters brought new elements to the action however there was a lot more potential in this area I feel. The development of the relationship between the leads in this film reminded me very much of Armageddon, it made me actually believe that they were falling in love; no mean feat when Megan Fox's character is paper thin.Theis film wasn't perfect by any means, the story could have been developed much more and there are things which go unanswered. Normally this would drive me mad but this time didn't really bother me. Lets face it, the 1st film didn't exactly have a flawless storyline, thats not what its about. The point of the film was Michael Bay blowing sh*t up, which as expected was done well and often.Overall I loved this film, normally it wouldn't come close to a 9 but it has that incredible feel good effect present in the 1st. I came out smiling and wanting more, and that it what Michael Bay and Transformers are designed for.",5,167,347,18 June 2009
