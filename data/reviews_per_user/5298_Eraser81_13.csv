Gremlins," Still love it after all these years
","I first saw Gremlins around 1988, and have never grown tired of it. Stripe, Gizmo, and company were wildly thought up and put to life.Billy Peltzer gets a bizarre pet for Christmas. A Mogwai, which originates from China. But beware there are 3 important rules that tag along with owning a mogwai.1. Never get it wet. Don't give it any water to drink and don't ever give it a bath.2. Keep it out of bright light. Especially sunlight, it could kill it.3. And the most important rule of all. No matter how much it begs, don't ever feed it after midnight.So of course after accidentally getting it wet the mogwai multiplies. Then thinking it's only 11:42 p.m., Billy decides to give the whole brood of creatures a batch of Kentucky Fried Chicken. But of course Billy's clock had stopped! So now after emerging from a cocoon stage, Kingston Falls is blessed with little monsters called Gremlins, and Christmas will never be the same!",10,1,3,7 December 2004
The Terminator," Still Arnold's best
","I've seen every Arnold film, and this is still my favorite.  Groundbreaking story and makeup effects. Vivid music score. Satisfying performances.
Arnold is the T-800, a cyborg sent back in time to kill the future mother of an important war figure.  Kyle Reese was also sent back in time, to stop the T-800!!Many people love the even greater effects of the sequel and enjoy that one more.  But I believe sometimes less is more, and this being such a fresh story is unbeatable.I'm looking very forward to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines this July.I'll Be Back!***1/2/****",10,0,1,25 December 2002
Predator," You're one ugly mutha f***a!
","Arnold gets the best movie projects.  No other actor has a better resume. Back in 87 Predator was released and the world got one hell of a ride for a movie.  Schwarzenegger and his team square off against a sneaky alien monster in the jungle.  And only Arnold Schwarzenegger can stand up to it! Not even Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and Bill Duke are a match for the Predator.Stan Winston as always succeeds in bringing the monster to life.",10,0,0,12 June 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Arnold's Back!!
","There was a 7 year gap between T1 and T2.  And now a 12 year gap between T2 and T3. But is was worth the wait.  The Terminator is sent through time to save mankind and John Conner!  To do so, he has to contend with the TX, a sophisticated evil terminator that will stop at nothing to do what is programmed to do.Kristanna Loken is the TX, a beautiful but deadly cyborg and only Arnold Schwarzenegger can stop her!The film greatly combines action, drama, and even humor.  The humor doesn't fall flat either.  The film offers one of the best chase scenes ever filmed, a 7 minute crane chase that will have your jaw dropping and your eyes widened.***/****",9,1,1,13 July 2003
The Shining," What a movie
","Sure Kubrick drifted from the novel, but it's still a hell of a movie.Fed up with low annual salary as a school teacher, Jack Torrance decides to pursue a career in writing. Soon Jack gets the job as winter caretaker at a luxurious hotel in Colorado. It sounds like a dreamjob to Jack as he will have plenty of time on his hands to write. Little does he know how 'cabin fever' will set in and he will eventually lose his mind.Nicholson's over the top performance and Kubrick's perfection driven direction help propel the movie into being a masterpiece.***1/2/****",10,0,1,10 April 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Great, but not the best
","This is many Terminator fans' favorite installment, but I don't believe it topped the original.  Maybe I just liked seeing Arnold as the bad guy for a change in that movie, but it just seemed funner.T2 soars on many levels.  Special effects to knock your socks off, but sometimes less is more.  Arnie in the original I thought was more menacing than the T-1000.  It could be Arnold's mere appearance to however.The chase scenes in this movie are awesome, as is the exciting climax.***/****",9,8,11,3 October 2003
Alien vs. Predator," Bad Directing
","Alien and Predator fans obviously had high hopes for this film. 
The first big blow was the PG-13 rating was reveiled.  Well, we now know at least 10 minutes of footage might have to wait for dvd. Great, whats next?We pay our hard earned money and learn some mumbo jumbo about Antarctica. Then the first scare tactic scene ends up being a penguin!Ok, lets get this thing rolling shall we?  Finally some Predators arrive via a unique aircraft. The humans start getting shuffled around the cube because it's pattern shifts every 10 minutes (neat but not original).
Finally we get some action between Alien and Predator but it's short lived. Aliens tail can rip apart anything apparently.The only twist I got out of this was the teaming of Predator and a human. Had Arnold teamed with Predator, that would of been a tag team!!There were some cool scenes but I would have liked to seen some more actual wrestling between the two creatures.  Yes there was some action, but not enough to satisfy.I like the movie, but it leaves you wanting more.",Null,0,0,2 September 2004
Saw," Impressive
","Hardly ever does a movie open with an interesting premise. But Saw sure is an exception.Sitting at the theater, not sure what to expect, Saw opens with two strangers chained down in a filthy bathroom. Both men are completely puzzled on how they got in that situation so they try to find clues to figure out the bizarre puzzle.It turns out they are the latest victims of the Jigsaw killer, a sadistic maniac who liked to torture people who he believes don't understand the proper way of living life.The plot isn't totally original though it does manage to spin some original ideas into it.Normally movies like these end up straight to video, while the total garbage hits theaters. Luckily this hit theaters and let's hope there's more little gems like these that make it to the big screen.",8,1,2,9 February 2005
Sinister," I jumped at least 5 times and I don't scare easy.
","Let's face it, these days horror films have a tendency to neither be 2 things, scary or good. This movie is quite effective with some truly eerie visuals and plot points that keeps the movie interesting. Usually in these types of movies a family will move into a 'haunted house' where a spirit or two lurks, but this movie is so layered with details and thrills that is keeps us viewers glued to the television set for nearly 2 hours.Ethan Hawke, being the good actor that he is, does a good job here, just as Kevin Bacon did in Stir of Echoes. As he plunges deeper and deeper into the dark history of what he has found in his attic, he starts questioning more and more whether unveiling facts for his new book is even worth putting his family at risk.Sinister is a quite good thriller which had all the elements to keep me interested for nearly 2 hours, not to mention make me jump and squirm a few times, which is no easy task.***/****",8,1,2,9 March 2013
Total Recall," Total Action!!
","I saw this when it premiered on cable.  And for my second viewing I bought it on DVD and it still rocks.  After seeing The 6th Day in the theater twice, I realized how awesome Arnold is after all this time! 
He plans to go on a virtual vacation to Mars and ends up really going to Mars to save his ass!!  The mutants in the film are creative.  The first time I saw a 3 breasted women!!  Oscar winning sets are a plus, as well as Paul Verhoeven at the helm.  We need more directors like him.  And more Schwarzenegger movies.  Give us 5 a year Arnold!",9,0,1,6 February 2001
Rocky," The Greatest Film Of All Time
","When it comes to charisma, heart, determination, and love, nothing can beat the Academy Award winning Rocky.  Great cast, great direction, and great script rises this above the rest.  And the 4 sequels were good too, something not all sequels can say, like Lethal Weapon.  Not that the sequels to Lethal Weapon were'nt any good, they were.  But when it comes to a film series, Rocky is champ.",10,0,1,29 April 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," cant keep your eyes off it
","I saw this on opening night in 99.  As soon as we walked out of the theater my friend yelled 'You'd have to be high to understand that!'. Maybe not, but ur own explanation can go into it.  Your own opinion can be the answers to the movie.  Cruise Kidman Kubrick definately was an excellent collaberation. Im proud to of seen this film.",10,0,2,1 June 2001
Halloween," The Night HE Came Home!
","Opening in Kansas City in October 1978, John Carpenter's Halloween emerged into the world and we were introduced to a new king of terror, Michael Myers.On a cold Halloween night in 1963, a teenage girl met her fate at the hands of her brother. 15 years would pass til he killed again.Only Michael's obsessed shrink, Dr. Loomis, knows the evil that Michael stands for.After seeing more than 100 horror films, Halloween still reigns at the top of the ladder. Effective soundtrack, good acting (rare for a horror film), superb directing, and an unstoppable killer made this stand through the test of time.Never meant to become a franchise, Halloween's success has been entertaining us for 25 years, and no stop is in sight.****/****",10,0,1,6 January 2003
