Skyfall," Finally the classic Bond film that I remember from Childhood
","I wasn't planning to see this movie at all. I don't particularly like the latest Bond series from Daniel Craig at all. Strangely from the little I remember from the James Bond franchise is that James Bond is nothing like Daniel Craig or how Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace portrays.Anyway, as I was browsing IMDb, I see Skyfall has a rating of whooping 8.1. So I was like what heck let's trust the IMDb netizens and check this movie out. I gotta say, I'm impressed. I think Sam Mendes did a superb job on it. It's pretty resembles the Bond I remember. Not just packed the show with actions and explosions but a lot of witty conversation, classy scenes, and the usual classic backdrop and Bond's music. And I thought the plot itself is great too. It digs inside MI6 and Bond's personal life as the movie goes and give us a better understanding of everything. On top of that, I love the work on the cinematography too. I can feel like a lot of effort was put into obtaining beautiful and classy scenery and background. I'm no expert on all this kind of stuff but that's just how I feel when I see the movie. And a lot of scenes made me go 'wow, that's awesome!'.So all in all, it was worth it. Definitely should check it out. However, if you love the Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, you maybe a little disappointed with lack of actions and gadgets.",7,3,11,19 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not so amazing for me
","The Amazing Spider is not so amazing at all. Whatever people might have said, I still think Andew Garfield is neither fitting as Spiderman no Peter Parker. The acting and action were also so much better in the first 3 installment of Spiderman. For me, this installment just kinda screw the reputation up for the last 3. Then again, I still have friends who said this is awesomeÂ… Though I don't see from which perspective this is awesome but at least it proves that they still have audience who love it. Also it's rated quite highly in IMDb as well. So I think I just probably grew up on Spiderman. Probably if I go back and watch the previous Spiderman movies I probably wouldn't be enjoying it as much as I remembered. Anyhow, watch this at your own risk.",6,0,3,24 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," I'm sold.
","Christopher Nolan did it again. He bless us with yet another incredibly awesome movie. The Dark Knight Rises easily adds itself to the list of best movies of all-time. Just when you thought that The Dark Knight was so good, he could he top it off? Yet he did it. I'd have to salute the man. Honestly, I was never really a bit fan of the Batman, both cartoon and movies. And I don't even read the comics at all. Not that I don't like comics, it's just that from where I come, we don't have access to US comics. But oh well, I started watching simply because of Christopher Nolan. A fan or not, I knew he'd work his magic and make Batman awesome, which of course he did.Anyway, on with The Dark Knight Rises. I won't go so far to say it's better than The Dark Knight. It's amazing in different way. The highlight of The Dark Knight was the villain-the Joker. However, in The Dark Knight Rises was everybody and on top of that there is a better story line. In Batmin Begins, Batman is awesome! in Dark Knight, Joker is awesome! However in Dark Knight Rises everybody is is awesome! well with the exception of Marinda. I would like to especially high light Cat Woman because before the film released I read a number of article about people being skeptical over Anne Hatheway's suitability for the role as Cat Woman. I think she has just proved them all wrong. I think she did a superb job as Cat Woman. After watching the show, I couldn't think of anybody else who's more suited for the role.All in all, I think the Batman trilogy are all incredibly amazing, I don't rate anyone higher than the other because to m, these 3 combined is simply 1 big extended movie divided into 3 parts each having different theme and highlighting different things. So you gotta watch them all, be amazed and become a fan!",10,4,8,19 November 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Well I couldn't get pass the fail in logic and just get disappointed
","Disappointing? I wouldn't say so but I went in with a bit too high expectation I guess given the fact that I've watched the first 2 installment of the Madagascar 3 and I freaking love Madagascar 2. The show is so short. The story wasn't that fantastic. I get the feeling that Madagascar 3 is just to tie up all the loose end and show everybody a happy ending. And I found of the supposedly 'funny' parts were dumb. But again I'm looking at this from an adult point of view, which yeah maybe not be that suitable for a 3D cartoon show. However, that's because Madagascar 2 did cater for that without losing its younger audience. I somehow felt that they didn't really put a lot of thought into this and just go all out make something damn epic because it's the finale. I can still forgive the giraffe and hippo dancing on a tight rope but which f-ing tiger can jump through a key hole while holding a zebra? Come on! I know it's cartoon this is ridiculous even for cartoon.But on a positive note, the show is light-hearted and does make you smile and enjoy the fun. If you ignore all the stupidity, and just go in and relax your brain. Madagascar 3 serves you well. So yes despite the fact that I don't rate it so high, it's still not really a waste of money to watch.",5,1,3,24 November 2012
