Requiem for a Dream," An incredible depiction of spiraling addiction
","The film centers around four addicts, and their lives which completely revolve around drugs. The way the film is shot really puts them into a first person perspective, and it is a beautiful (although incredibly disturbing) film. As they grow more and more reliant on their opioid of choice, sone will go to great lengths to get their fix, and some will lose their minds...this might be my favorite film I've ever seen!! Also the music score is pretty good",10,0,0,26 May 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Incredible Movie
","Inglorious Bastards is an incredibly violent, action packed, simply awesome movie. The movie has many points that tensions rise significantly, and that grasps the audiences attention and this is aided by a fitting, gripping soundtrack. Although the film doesn't dive deep into characters (there's not much opportunity), it's plot makes up for it, and the cinematography as well as the action is very captivating. The film while overly dramatic, is not entirely implausible, and carries the plot very well.",9,0,1,30 April 2020
