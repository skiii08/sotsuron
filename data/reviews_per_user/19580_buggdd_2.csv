The Blair Witch Project," Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time
","If this isn't the biggest load of cinimatic crap ever made, it's  as close as we ever want to come to it. This film was made by amateurs on no budget and it shows.  Scary? Not hardly. Videos of my niece's first birthday were more terrifying (and more artistically done). I found myself cheering for whatever was lurking in the dark , picking these morons off and begging it to hurry so this film, and the audience's  suffering, would be over. Note to the makers of this film: there is probably a reason why you are amateurs. Get a refund on your film school tuition, go back to your rewarding careers in the convenience store and the car wash industries and leave film making to those who truly have the gift. On the suck scale of 1-5 vacumn cleaners(5 being the worst) this gets a 9.",Null,2,4,21 July 2002
Chinatown," One of Jack Nicholson's finest efforts
","The scene: 1930's Los Angeles.  Someone is fiddling with the scant water resourses in the time of drought. When the water commissioner 'drowns', private eye J.J.'Jake' Gittes becomes entangled in the mystery while investigating a routine domestic case that is anything but routine. Nicolson's cool, yet passionate character is the standard by which all of his subsequent roles can be measured. Faye Dunaway is also excellent as the wealthy yet seriously messed up Evelyn Mulray. Ditto John Houston as the menacing Noah Cross. Add to this a haunting score and you have a detective picture in the best film noir tradition.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  On a scale of 1-5(5 being the best) this gets a 10.",Null,1,3,13 October 2002
