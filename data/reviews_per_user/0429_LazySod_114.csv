National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Nice enough
","After seeing the first film I was more or less looking forward to a sequel. There was enough ground to make one on after all. And it must be said, this film is slightly worse than its predecessor, but only slightly and that means it is still a very enjoyable film.Storywise one can expect the same kind of thing that made the first film: a trail of clues leading to some great lost treasure. In this film the clues are even more far-fetched than the ones in the first film, but not to the point of being irritating. The rest of things in the film is very much in line with the other as well. Just about all the characters return and play their part well.The few characters that get added to the mix work out well enough and that makes the grand total for this adventure a well deserved 7 out of 10. No work of art, but surely worthy of cinema time.7 out of 10 lost artifacts",7,1,3,9 January 2008
Angels & Demons," Should have been better
","A few years ago there was The Davinci Code. In effect a fairy tale that played like an adventure through something that could have been reality. It sold well as a book and did fairly well as a film. Personally I liked the book a lot and the film a little. When I saw the trailers for this film I wanted to see this one too - even though I've not read its book. When the film started rolling I was regretting having made the choice of going to see this as this film is less than a shadow of the former one. Where Davinci Code keeps building on its backing story this one just jumps from one corner to the other and tosses its characters from the one to the other corner of unbelievable plot holes and standard twists and turns.All too predictable this one is another fairy tale. It is a rather bad one though - a fairy tale where everyone is sitting together from the start, actually trying to find out what role one is supposed to play out. When it finally ends it has bored for at least a good 30 minutes and there's no sympathy left for anyone anymore. Not the way a film like this should be IMO.4 out of 10 fractured stories",4,12,24,22 June 2009
Black Swan," Madness through perfection
","When a highly motivated ballet dancer wins the part she has been hunting for for so long she's happy as can be. Driven by a strive for perfection she trains hard in hopes to please her mentor. But is she ready for this kind of pressure with on the one side her lust for peer recognition and on the other side the need to escape the smothering of her mother? This film starts out looking like a fairy tale with all the standard characters - the somewhat naive princess, the overbearing mother, the jealous sisters, the bright unobtainable future at the horizon. As it rolls on it does not stray far from that path - in fact it follows much of the structure of the theatre play it encompasses. It is this structure that makes it a very interesting film - the pace is right, the tale is compelling and believable and most of the characters are in place.The film starts off pretty dark and grows darker with every passing minute - biased around its lead player it depicts her madness with a pinpointed finesse, with everyone else revolving around her in an intricate dance. My hats off to Portman who plays the role of her life in this one. One tiny peeve to be had is the pained look she carries right from the start though - I guess the choice was made to have her character live her life as a tragic one, but in my eyes it could have done better by being slightly more optimistic at the start.8 out of 10 swans dancing",8,1,2,4 April 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Ho ho ho, this pirate has been milked dry
","Being the fourth part in the series the general setting of this film will not have to be explained. It more or less continues the story where the third film left of. Jack has the map that leads to the fountain of youth, and is in need of a ship and a crew.Missing most of the original crew this film has to make do with a lot of new people. This isn't bad - most of the new ones come across as fitting and make for a new setting. Personally I am missing some of the comical characters of the previous films though - especially the guy with the prosthetic eye and his mate. The pair of them made for an extra bit of comedy with their constant bickering and his fooling with the eye.The film starts with a bang and explains the situation as well as it must - it sets out the stage for the rest of the film. As the action starts rolling it looks rather promising. But then...Then the film gets to its main part and it becomes clear that it is a clear attempt at rinse and repeat of the success of the previous ones with different characters. Some bits are flaky, some are rather good, but overall the film is on the dull end of the spectrum. It's not entirely unpleasant, but it could have been so much more.Finally we get to the 3D layer that was added. Again it can be said that it doesn't add a single thing. The few scenes that really worked were the standard gimmicky scenes where a sword sticks into the audience - please stop doing that, it's been done, it's becoming a drag. Either make a film for 3D or keep it 2D. This one is clearly made for the 2D market and that is just fine, just don't try to sell it as 3D to make some extra money.6 out of 10 bored pirates",6,1,1,26 May 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wrong to the umpteenth power equals brilliantly funny
","Where does one start to describe a film like this one? Let's start with wrong. It is wrong. It is wrong in offending more people than I would care to count, in the most horrible ways. It is wrong in taking all the politically incorrect turns it can take. It is wrong in portraying a country in the way it really isn't, people in the way they aren't. It is wrong. Period.But. It is so wrong that it manages to become good. Very good even. Most of the film is absolutely hilarious, and I found myself in tears from laughing for most of the length of it. I can only hope some of the things are actually staged instead of on-the-fly skits because it could only mean a grave danger for Cohen and his team.Some bits are downright disgusting. Some bits are cruel. But most bits are fast paced and amazingly funny in a dark way.Very good stuff. 9 out of 10 people insulted and laughing their behinds off.",9,3,11,10 November 2006
Sucker Punch," Seriously off-kilter, but tasty
","The story to this film is easy enough: a young girl with more baggage than she is supposed to have at her age is committed to a mental asylum. Instead of being helped to deal with her baggage she's being tormented even further - which makes her search for other ways of escape.The implementation of this story is a short introduction which gives more than enough insight into the backing of the characters and the location - and then an overly large dose of eye candy that alternates between reality and fantasy. This alternation works well - it gives a nicely balanced rhythm of high and low pace scenes and all of them are worked out artfully right.The film does feel a tiny bit fractured though and the ending isn't entirely pleasing or even fitting. This isn't due to the acting - which is good enough in general, but is purely due to the chosen story line. It doesn't make the film bad - it's eye candy and nothing but eye candy after all, but it could have been better.So, all in all, maximum visuals, more than OK sound track, highly entertaining and sometimes even art-house but forgotten the moment the cinema is left behind.7 out of 10 unreal realities.",7,1,3,5 April 2011
Source Code," Nicely put together from stolen bits
","A guy wakes up from slumber on a train. Startled to the bone - as he wasn't on the train in his previous memory - he quickly attempts to make sense of what is happening. Failing miserably at that he ends up in the biggest surprise of his life.Films like this work best when there's little to no knowledge of what is going on before seeing them so I'm not going to say anything more about the story. Suffice it to say that it's a thriller in most senses and that it puts together the tag lines of various other films - in all the best ways. It's also biased towards science fiction - without the aliens - and again done in a good way.It's no work of art and doesn't leave a mark on the mind, but it's a fun way of spending an hour and a half and well worth the cinema time - high speed, captivating story and nicely acted.7 out of 10 odd events getting odder by the minute",7,2,3,2 May 2011
United 93," Disturbingly good
","After nearly a month of no cinema at all (I hate summer recess) here comes United 93. The story of one of the planes that was hijacked on that dreadful September 11th.I'm searching for words on how to describe this film: everybody that hasn't been stuck under a couple rocks for the last few years knows what happened to the plane. The people on it knew they were going to perish and decided that their lives would not go in vain - they went and made sure the plane did not get to the place the terrorists wanted it to go.As I'm writing this I'm having a strange fit of emotions and I'm fighting back tears. During the watching of the film I didn't have such - I was overwhelmed with another set of emotions, caused by memories. I went to visit NYC in October 2001, just 4 weeks after the attacks. The trip had been booked long in advance, and I wasn't willing to cancel it. When I saw this film it all came back to memory. I guess that goes for the most people that watch this film - everybody goes in with their own mindset and own set of memories of that day, and everyone comes out differently.The film itself then. I can't put many negatives to it: the way it is played out feels a lot like the dramatized documentaries they do on TV every now and then, only better. What is seen here are humans coming together to fight their last battle. Humans as they are supposed to be, sadly in a place and environment no one should ever find him/herself in.8 out of 10 disturbed emotions.",8,2,5,9 July 2006
Deja Vu," Somewhat OK
","When a terrorist blows up a ferry full of people an ATF agent is called to the scene. When a female corpse washes ashore she proves to be a piece of the puzzle - but dead women tell no tales. Or do they? Deja Vu plays with the idea that a deja vu isn't an erroneous action of the mind, but something real. With the invention of a device that allows the investigating team to see the actual past as it is happening it opens a premise for a story that might be fun enough for a film.And granted, it is. Watched as a mindless action flick this film isn't half bad - the plot is believable enough to pack the elements that keep the story rolling and the play-out is good enough to make it more than just acceptable. For me the one thing that demolished bit of the film though is something that happened at the very end of it - it just didn't belong in there or was just plain wrong (in combination with the events that lead to that moment).Still.. Acceptable material. Nothing to remember more than a few days after seeing it, but good enough to visit the cinema.6 out of 10 memories from the future",6,3,5,20 December 2006
Star Trek," To boldly attempt to please three generations
","Where does one begin to define a mission like this one? The mission being: take the combination of a long running TV-series and a series of films, loved by many and hated by just as many, and turn it into an interesting film. One can only blunder: the old guard loved the original series and hated the last series, the younger guard goes exactly the other way around. Or can one do a good job after all? I must consider myself one of the members of the old guard - I loved the original series (still do), and although I liked the second series it all went into a very steady decline after that. Filmwise it wasn't much better - the films with the original cast were all good (with one exception) and the first three films with the second cast were good too - after that it was all bad and even worse. Then came the series Enterprise and that just didn't hack it at all, worst stuff I've ever seen.So when I saw the first trailers of this film I already saw Roddenberry turn around in his grave in my mind. My heart cried as they were working on the final destruction of my childhoods heroes. But I went to see the film - I wouldn't be able to deal with not having seen it, even if it was going to be bad. Nothing could have prepared me for the surprise I would be going through. As the film starts the first few moments started to proof my dread - but quickly that dread started to grow less and after about 15 minutes I felt what this film tried to do: use elements of the original series and elements of current day graphic eye candy and combine it into a stew of old and new that is at the same time completely different from all it ever was and completely the same. For me this combination was flawless - it was different enough to be a film on its own, and the same enough to allow me to reconnect to everything I once loved about the series. The explanation of things is a bit of a cliché but I'm guessing anything else would be even worse - once one tries to make a film after so many episodes of so many series and so many films one is bound to a set of events and therefore a set of limits. So, it's good. It's very good. It's a long breath of relief since parts 9 and 10 that more or less did their best to destroy the series.8 out of 10 past heroes resurrected",8,1,7,22 June 2009
Iron Man 2," Too fractured
","Picking up where the first Iron Man film left off this film continues the tale of Tony Stark, the rich and somewhat eccentric inventor of technologies most people can only dream of.Being a typical action film this one is filled to the rim with explosions, chases, fire and women that are too beautiful to actually exist. There is a story line and it isn't half bad - it's enough for a decent film. But, and this is a major but, as it tries to mimic the stories from the cartoons it skips through this story a bit too quickly at times leaving gaping holes and making the film feel like running across a giant Swiss cheese where you have to jump the holes to make it to the other side.The appearing Nemesis is fun to watch and the trails that are left to the Avengers are clear enough - but fitting, somewhat. Appearance of most characters is good - just a few that are a bit dodgy (Johansson didn't really work for me in this one) All in all, this is popcorn cinema, but not the best of it. It can be enjoyed, but there's better things out there to enjoy. If it had been less fractured it would have been very good.6 out of 10 amazing sources of energy",6,0,1,27 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Ho ho ho, and a bottle of rum
","Captain Jack is back. And how. Where the first Pirates of the Caribbean film was, IMO, bland and too full of Jacks strange ticks and a lot of little things that just didn't work this one is alive with a multitude of good effects, odd happenings, great characters, funny bits and a lot more good bits that add up together really well.It picks up where the first one ended, at least I think it does - I can't remember the first one very well anymore, as I really didn't like it all that much. But after seeing the trailers for this one I thought that this one had a lot of potential to be better than the first one. So I just had to go out and watch this one.So. What is it about? Well. Davy Jones wants Jack to pay of his debt. So Jones goes hunting for Jack. And Jack goes avoiding him and tries, in his own evil way, to avoid him and find a way to get out of his arms forever. And all that, in that setting of beauty, fun and pirate laughter.Good stuff. Several factors better than the first one.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Could be worse, should be better
","Arabian nights, princes, princesses, shiny cities and lots and lots of desert sand. Story wise this film is more or less a typical fairy tale one: handsome prince comes to the rescue of handsome princess and during that process there's battles and blood.Films based on games usually end up to be a complete waste of tape. This one doesn't do quite that bad, but it could have been a fair deal better too. I must admit I only played the very first Prince of Persia game and this film doesn't seem to take too much from that - apart from the acrobatic jumping around. Not bad, it works, and the storyline used for this film is good enough to keep it entertaining.One bad thing that struck me was the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as the Prince - his style and looks really do not fit what one would expect of a battle hardened prince. I love his roles in many films but in this one he falls out of place a bit too much.The good things about the film include the humor which is in many places completely out of time but entirely fitting to the film - it gives the film just that bit of extra it needs to become pleasurable.All in all, 6 out of 10. It's an enjoyable watch but forgotten five minutes after leaving the cinema.",6,10,20,27 May 2010
Black Book," Finally another GOOD Dutch film

As the story starts she finds herself on the run, in the need of finding new shelter.From there the film keeps rolling. For 2.5 hours, without ever stopping for a pause. Its grim nature doing the work very well, keeping one locked to the screen until after the ending credits roll by. A film that is filled with all the prime emotions - light and dark. And a film that with that works out very well.Acting is superb, characters are likable and dis-likable enough to make the watcher a part of the story - and one that wants to see certain people live and certain people die. It brings emotion, the occasional grin and a good bit of tension.Good stuff. 9 out of 10 casualties of war. And I'm already waiting for its DVD release.",9,7,14,28 September 2006
Superbad," Not quite good enough
","It's the year 2007 and a new generation of high school comedies is born. New actors, new schools, same jokes and same weak story lines. In Superbad three friends are about to leave high school and are trying their hardest to get into one of the cooler parties. The first hurdle to take is the fact that they are under 21 and want alcohol really bad. More hurdles are to to be taken, so don't turn away just yet. And so the film starts and rolls on. And some of the characters are actually good fun. For me Seth worked out very nicely. I could have been that guy.But what was stated above stays true. It is nothing more but a rehash of many of the better student films of the past decades. Just different people attending different schools. It just doesn't add anything new to it. Nothing at all. Just more incredibility's and plot twists that just do not happen in real life.5 out of 10 under aged drinkers",5,3,10,6 November 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The cow has been milked
","This fourth film with (part of) the X-men is based around the past of Wolverine. There's no real need for further character introduction - the most important ones are defined already and the new ones are laid down quick enough to have a fitting place in the film. Action films like this are usually full of eye candy and this one isn't much different - there's more than enough to look at. There is also some sort of backing story, even though it does seem to detour from the X-Men stories as defined by the comic books. I say seems, I've never really read them, they may be spot on. They just don't match up all too well IMO.As a pure action film this one doesn't work out too well. The most of the action sequences are just that - pure action. At the one side they try to create a background story, but on the other end they fail to connect it to the things that happen and that makes the film far more fragmented than it should be. Tone down a bit on the graphical effects, tone up a bit on explaining things and you've got a lot better film.4 out of 10 bored action heroes",4,2,5,22 June 2009
Juno," Stands up to the comparison with Knocked Up
","When I saw the posters for this film I was thinking this was going to be a teenager version of Knocked Up - some humor, some drama, and eventually a rather Disney end of a story: everything ends up flawlessly well. Maybe it was going to be a little bit moralistic because the pregnancy happened with a child instead of a young adult.When I finally got to see the film I was happily surprised. One, it's a lot more serious than Knocked Up, it's a bit moralistic, but only a bit and never 'in your face' and its choice of characters is just brilliant. Juno is the perfect alternative girl next door and Ellen Page (who I also loved in Hard Candy) is able to carry her through per pregnancy with a vivid flair that's almost too real, as if she actually is the girl.The film deals with the serious aspects of a teen pregnancy as well as the parents of the young mother and the way they have to deal with this new situation. It also deals with the father of the child and all things are worked out equally well, making this a very enjoyable watch.9 out of 10 pregnancies too early",9,0,3,15 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Good stuff
","This next installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series picks up where the 2nd part left of: Captain Jack has been swallowed by the Kraken, the war between government and pirates is growing harder by the day. The trailers tell much of what is about to happen: a confrontation between good and evil in the form of government and pirates. The rest is what is to be expected: a good sense of adventure, lots of things happening in all places at once, and all the actors of the previous parts coming back for another part to be played.For me this third part was what I had expected from it: slightly worse than the 2nd, still better than the 1st. It was slightly weirder, somewhat less stable, but overall still a good lot of amusement and action.8 out of 10 pirates sailing at the end of the world.",8,1,3,28 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Bottom of the well - time to end the series
","Spider-Man is back. This time he's about to marry his girlfriend, and also about to find one of his worst enemies. Wait? Is this new? It sounds so much like the story of the first film, and the one of the second film. Anyway, there we have it. Spider-Man comes to tangle with yet another enemy, in a tale that is yet much the same as the others.In the first part of the film I was slightly irritated by the characters and the way they got completely pulled out of context by the ridiculous way they were played. Then I more or less accepted that that was the shallow way the series was written in the first place and that's where it got slightly better. But only slightly. Next part was eye-candy. Special effects to the max, albeit bad special effects. For a film of this caliber and budget I was expecting much better. Then comes the continuation of the story and I can't say that was entirely appealing either. To be brutally honest, I found it an insult toward the comic series and an insult to the previous two films.All in all, it was a film I didn't expect much from, but one that still managed to give me even less. Complete and utter waste of tape.4 out of 10 spiders tangled in their own web of shallowness.",4,3,7,5 May 2007
Yes Man," Worthy of a good laugh or two
","Meet Carl. Carl leads a life on his own. Somewhat miserable because he's always stuck with himself. Carl denies himself all the pleasures of life because he's unable to accept them. With each and every new opportunity arising he turns it down with a firm NO. Luckily for Carl he has a friend, a friend that pulls him along to a seminar where Carl is introduced to the power of Yes. Converted by the power of Yes Carl is now ready to accept life's challenges and chances, saying Yes to every single one of them.And so the film starts running and shooting gags concerning each of the accepted chances and the very most of them work out pretty well. Carrey is on a roll playing the plagued Carl that has to swallow down quite a few odd things during his days of the all-accepter. The pace of the film comes to its final speed when Carl runs into Allison though, who I guess can be considered his final and most challenging opportunity. It works out flawlessly - Deschanel plays her brilliantly and the two characters together work out more than well enough.The story line plays by rather predictable, but that's fine. It's no big mystery of life that is being challenged here after all. And when the film finally comes to its end all it can do is leave a smile on the face of the audience - time to say Yes and accept that life can be a swell place after all.7 out of 10 opportunities taken",7,5,7,15 January 2009

","Resident Evil, part 3. The story continues so it would be a good idea to watch the other two as well before seeing this one otherwise some things will be missed. So where are we now? Alice is roaming the Earth, the T-virus has escaped from the laboratory, and survivors are on the run. Oh, and not to forget, Umbrella Corporation is chasing Alice. So, all in all, more of the same.When I was watching this film I was more than once reminded of the Mad Max series and some other post-apocalypse films but not in an entirely bad way. The start of the film is a wee bit slow and there are a few odd bits in there that don't exactly match up with the previous two films, but the complete set is pretty much OK, apart from the slow start.The ending gives a good reason for a part 4 to be made and if it does get made I will be seeing it. This film could have been better, but it was a worthy watch as it is, if you liked the first two that is. Personally I loved the soundtrack, it matches the film very well.

The Prestige," Abacadabra - no bunny from the high hat
","At the end of the 19th century two helpers to an illusionist are good friends. One of them married to a third help. They pick up the tricks from their master and things go well. Until a sudden event changes things in a big way. The friendship turns sour and they go their own separate ways.The rest of the film is that tale - what happens after they split up. Played out in various time splits, going backward and forward through time at will. It isn't hard to follow, and the changing of time works as a positive - it keeps the story more interesting. It gives a good insight into why everyone is the way they are and why they do the things they do.The story is believable, even in the time it is set in, apart from one thing. And quite frankly it was that one thing that more or less turned me against the film, but not too bad. It was still very enjoyable. Some of the things it touches on are actual history and that is very funny to see.All in all. Rather enjoyable, a nice way to spend an evening.

Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A mere shadow of the first
","Our red anti-hero is back. Together with the agency he's out to save the world again. And this time he's all gentle and careful about it. No, I'm kidding, he's just as rude and crude as he was the first time around.Where the first film worked because of the new 'hero' this second one has nothing like that to start it off. So instead of being able to rely on the newness of things it has to come with something extra and quite sadly the one thing new it does bring takes the film away from what it should be. For me the added creatures just did not belong in a film like this and actually made it a lot worse than it should have been.It's still a fun film, for the most of it, but it could have done a lot better if it had stuck a little closer to the tale of the original one (and as far as I've heard, the comic books the first film was based on). If there is going to be a third one I for one hope they return to the original style.6 out of 10 big hearted bad guys",6,6,9,2 September 2008
Cloverfield," Annoying waste of celluloid
","The trailers to this film show a party in Manhattan, and people there being startled by a heavy explosion and the head of the statue of liberty flying around. They then go out on the street to investigate and end up fleeing what looks like a terrible disaster/act of terror. No further information is given about what actually happened and with that the trailer is good. Curiosity is at a high level, people go see the film. I am one of those people that went to see it.I am one of the people that regrets having seen this film because it is one more example of how current day film makers know nothing better anymore then to copy other films and copy them poorly. Again, every single cliché is pulled out of the high hat and glued together with random things flying around, sometimes literally.Added to that is the fact the film is too short (just 90 minutes) and even in those 90 minutes manages to spend about 25 on a slow introduction on the main characters. Although introduction is a necessity to have people bond with the characters in some way I feel that nearly a third of the film is too much of an introduction, leaving too little for the 'real' film.The one plus it has is nothing more but a gimmick, but that gimmick is not enough to make it work.4 out of 10 running victims",4,12,24,30 January 2008
The Expendables," My name is Corn. Pop Corn
","A group of hired guns has a long history together. Their history is about to get longer as a stranger wants to hire them for a mission. Oh, let's skip the story. Let's skip on to the most important bits of it: the bits where stuff gets blown up.This film is a typical fast speed action film. It contains a story just thin enough to carry it all, a large can of well known and somewhat less known actors from the action scene of the old and current days and an insane amount of pyrotechnics. It takes a short time to build a backing story and introduce some of the characters and then moves on and starts an action sequence and since this sequence doesn't really end until the ending credits for the film rolls by it does this fairly decently.Pity though that most of the names on the film poster are no more than a marketing stunt. Two of them have no more than a few seconds screen time and the film would have been just as good without them.All in all, a typical popcorn film to be watched with the brain set on the 'off' setting, to be forgotten seconds after leaving the cinema.6 out of 10 explosions and fires",6,1,8,16 August 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Definitely not meant for children
","Pan's Labyrinth, as the international title goes is a conflicting film - it mixes a fairy tale into the Spain of 1943, split up in a civil war. This conflict makes for two good bases for stories, rolled into one great story. The effect is weird like Big Fish, intense like Hard Candy and bittersweet like Thelma & Louse.Be warned! Do not think this film is meant for children as it includes a fairy tale. I would not take any children younger than 15 years to see this film. Some scenes are pretty twisted and/or downright evil.The story starts when a little girl and her mother travel toward a military base somewhere in the middle of a forest in Spain, to be safe from further harm. A sense of drama is added: the girls father is dead, a casualty of war, and her mother is throwing herself into the arms of the captain of the garrison. Then the film turns on its heels and goes into full flexed fairy tale mode as the girl finds a friend in a big grasshopper that turns into a fairy.From there it rolls on and the film switched to/from reality a number of times, each time revolving into something else, each time becoming stronger and more overwhelming. The end effect is both lovely and grueling, both sweet and sour.Spoken language is Spanish but that doesn't take a single thing away from the film. In the contrary, having English speaking Spanish people would have ruined it a bit.. Special effects used range from OKish to pretty good and the scenery is very good. Really gives the feeling of a war zone. Story is a little predictable, but not in a bad way.IMO, a very good film that has made it onto my list of films to get on DVD when it gets released. Has a good base for extras.9 out of 10 fairies lost in a labyrinth.",9,3,6,28 November 2006
Knocked Up," Not entirely unpleasant
","Birds do it, bees do it, even educated flees do it, let's do it, let's fall in love. It might have been the tag line for this film. When a party animal and a hard working ambitious girl end up in bed together neither of them consider the possible consequences. This is not entirely strange as they are both drunk. When the consequences do show themselves in the form of the girl being pregnant she pays him a visit and drops the bombshell on him.Films like this one have been made before. Nine Months Later (1995) comes to mind but there are a lot more examples. This film isn't entirely different from any of them apart from one thing: it doesn't really pick a genre. Parts of it are comedy, parts of it are tragedy, parts of it are the basic high school/underpants junk, parts are feel good film. It does keep itself together pretty well though. The two of them combining is hard to believe but not so hard that it is impossible and even though it is as predictable as the cycle of night and day it isn't entirely unpleasant to watch.Personally I would have liked to have seen a little less broad pick of genres. By selecting one or two less they could have made the film somewhat more stable, less chaotic, but it didn't work out completely bad.7 out of 10 accidents waiting to happen",7,0,1,3 October 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The thin line between genius and insane
","When I first heard that a new Tim Burton film was in the makings my ears perked. Doubly so because Helena Bonham-Carter and Johnny Depp would be starring in it, which had proved to be a winning threesome in the past. Then I heard the theme of the film would be just as grim as The Corpse Bride and my heart fluttered (for I love that one too). So, expectancies were high. Very high.The film then. The story is the one of revenge. A guy named Benjamin Barker is wrongfully accused and sent to exile. When he returns he wants his revenge on the ones that did this to him. Returning to his home town as Sweeney Todd he starts planning, taking up residence with a pastry maker. And from there it rolls.The setting of the film is dark. Grim colored scenes depicting a dark time to live in, and doing that well. Characters are picked with great care and played by actors that do it well. And, to make the grimness at the same time more and less intense, dark and twisted humor is added for good laughter, and most dialog is sung to add a sense of merriness. The totaling sum of all this is a rather morbid film that will bring a smile or a hearty laugh to anyone with a wicked sense of humor.Not that the film only works for those with that sense of humor. The settings are so wonderfully worked out that it is just a pleasure to watch the scenes as they pass by - everything adds together and just works, no gaps, no jumps. Just a work of art.10 out of 10 chins shaved",10,8,14,7 March 2008
Nacho Libre," Hilarious at some ends, good at other ends
","Friar Nacho is the cook in a monastery. Day after day he has to make stew for the kids and the other people living there because there is no money for anything better. And day after day he dreams to become a 'luchador', a free wrestler, so that he can make more money and become something important for the monastery. When a free fight event is issued in his village he grabs his chances and together with someone from town he goes to the match, ready to show his wild side.Comedies with Jack Black in a lead are always a one of a kind trick. You like them or you don't. The people that like Black in the comedies where he can make his funny faces and use his strange singing voice will probably like this film. Others will probably not like it. Personally I didn't know Black at all until I saw School of Rock and I love that one. While this one doesn't come close to that I still find it very funny - it has a couple hilarious sequences in it.All in all the film adds a number of very good bits to a number of good bits to a number of mediocre bits and the combination works well enough - easy to watch, easy to forget. Watch once, never again. Detach the brain before watching though - there really isn't much it can do while this film is rolling.8 out of 10 shocked wrestlers",8,0,0,13 January 2007

","Set in the 1950s this film starts as a special agent starts his investigations on what seems to be the miraculous escape of a mental patient from a heavily fortified mental institution for the criminally insane. As he finds a note hidden in the patients cell things seem to turn a shade more sinister.This being one of those films that only work out if you know little about them I'll have to leave it at that. It's dark, it's downright creepy at times, it has all the things a solid thriller needs, and more.I'd call it a brilliant bit of film if it weren't for some hit and miss scenes - especially scenes where some of the actors came over as too much of a character.8 out of 10 persons missing",8,0,2,9 March 2010

Having no eye for fashion and not being a skin-over-bone model herself she falls out of place quite badly there. Add to that the head editor that is in all senses of the words a *censor bleep* from Hell and it becomes clear where this will go.A rather thin story for a rather thin film. There's a good couple funny moments and just enough buildup to make people able to like the lead roles just enough to care for them, but for the most the film falls on its behind pretty badly anyway - it just doesn't add up together like it should. This is just another melting pot of 'a whiff of comedy, a drop of drama, a taste of self deprecation and a smell of reality' and with that it is just another thirteen in a dozen film.Not bad, not good, just right in between.",5,0,0,14 November 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Whoa... This is a surprise
","When I read that Ben Affleck directed this film I had a sinking feeling. I like some of the films he plays in but the most of them are DVD material and not worthy of cinema time. Decided to give it a chance anyway though and I can honestly say that was a wise choice.The film tells the tale of a kid being kidnapped and the search for her that starts. As well as a lot of other events that tie a number of people together. The story is told from the eyes of a pair of private investigators that get hired by the aunt of the kidnapped kid. This viewpoint works out very well. The film has a good tension to it for its full length. It's also highly sentimental, pulling all possible tricks to keep the audience on its toes and reaching for handkerchiefs. This isn't entirely bad though and never pulls away the force of the film.The best of the film comes after it ends though. It leaves one thinking for a good long while and if there ever was a film where the tag line really defined it it is this one... Everyone wants the truth, until they find it. It can't get any clearer than that.9 out of 10 rocked up emotions",9,2,4,9 January 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Good ending to a superb series
","Everything that has a beginning has an end. Five years after the release of The Bourne Identity Jason Bourne comes back to the screen to finish the story by coming full circle. The story of this one picks up where part two ended: Bourne is on the run, chased by the agency that trained him and several other. Bourne still wants to find out who he truly is and who made him into what he is now.Being a third part in a series means the film doesn't have to 'waste' time on explaining new characters and their place in the story and that's why it can let itself start of the easy way - full throttle action. And it does this well. In fact, it never lets go of the throttle, it just keeps rolling on and doesn't allow itself to take a breather. The sequences used are good, high adrenalin based and building a good tension field that lasts till the very end. The storyline isn't breached too much by plot holes (only a few marginal ones really) and things done aren't too impossible which makes the film a highly enjoyable.Not the best in the series, but a very worthy closing chapter to the series. Amusing to watch once and watch again when the DVD release is done. Personally I will be waiting for a trilogy release that I assume will be coming sometime in the future - these films belong together and deserve to be watched back-to-back as one long running feature.7 out of 10 dirty little secrets",7,5,9,17 September 2007
Burn After Reading," Not the Coen brothers' best ,but fun either way
","Mystery, mayhem, massive mix ups of people. Misunderstandings and wrong interpretations. Deceit, trickery and complete astonishment. That'd be the keywords for this film. It's not the first comedy done by the Coen brothers and I surely hope it won't be the last. After their previous, No Country For Old Men, it fell a bit strange and it might even have pulled a partly wrong audience to the cinema, but it works for me, I've been watching their films ever since I found myself crying with laughter over Raising Arizona and have been amazed at their combined talents quite a few times.Anyway, this film starts rolling when two workers in a health/fitness center find a CD full of what they think to be government secrets. The trail of events that starts there is far fetched but not so far it becomes entirely unbelievable and the trail of people that is followed through the film is both long and highly varying. The effect of that is that there is always something to do on the screen, making the film rather entertaining. Some of the characters fall a small bit out of place but not so far that they become a true nuisance.Finally, the show is stolen by three players: Brad Pitt who returns a small bit to the marvelous role of a madman he played in Twelve Monkeys by putting down a somewhat slow health-care/fitness agent here, Frances McDormand who spotlessly plays a somewhat neurotic coworker of Pitt and John Malkovich who puts down the angered special agent with a class only he can. The rest of the casting is very good too, but for me the above three really pulled the film.All in all this is not the best work by the Coen brothers (for me Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski outclass this one as comedies) but it delivers and that's good enough for me.7 out of 10 secrets uncovered",7,1,5,6 November 2008
Watchmen," Slightly worrying and nasty
","Once the protectors of the citizens on the run down and dirty streets, now themselves threatened by scandals and darker forces that want to eradicate them. They are watchmen. They are in a danger greater than any danger that ever threatened the people they swore to protect, and they are unwatched, except by themselves. Times are dark, crimes are running wild and the citizens have learned to distrust these former heroes.Based on a graphic novella this film is very different from what people may think it to be after watching the trailers - the trailers show what seems to be a more or less mindless science fiction action flick that has little worth thinking about. This film proves to be a lot better than just that. In fact, this film might be classed as a drama in a science fiction surrounding. A lot is done to work out the different characters and some of them come of the screen very well. My personal favorite would be Rorschach who depicts the classical warped mind that has gone beyond all borders of normality, living in his own world with his own rules. There is a great deal of special effects in this film but none of them work against the film - they add to the story in the good way. I have never read the novella so I don't know how well the conversion was done, but from what I heard it isn't too bad of a conversion. For me this film could have done a small bit better by working out the characters some further still, and the ending story is a little too much of a classic cliché. Still, worth a watch.8 out of 10 fallen heroes",8,2,7,6 May 2009
28 Weeks Later," An insult to the first film
","In 2002 the audience was treated to 28 Days Later. A film in which a group of environmental activists release animals from a laboratory. Animals that happened to be infected with Rage, a virus that makes them incredibly aggressive and hostile. The activists get killed or infected, one by one, and the virus escapes from the laboratory. 28 days later, the whole of the country is infected. The survivors seeking shelter for the infected that have only one drive: hostility towards non-infected. It radiated desolation from the word Go and to that a quick building and never relenting tension was added. At the end one felt bad. Maybe with a slight hope that better days might come in the future, but generally bad. Despairing, lonely, looking forward to accept the inevitable death that haunted all.Now, in 2007, the story picks up 6 months after the original film. The US army (where did the US come from all of a sudden? This happened in the UK and as far as I know the UK is closer to the European mainland than the US - insult number 1) holds a base in London. Around that base is a secure area in which survivors live and find shelter. Then two kids of one of the survivors return from their vacation abroad and are reunited with their father. From their the chaos starts.And quite sadly, that is where the insults come flying in quicker than the Rage itself. To give examples would be giving away much of the plot and its massive holes but IMO the film insults the army quite badly, it insults the audience very badly by throwing cliché after cliché at it, and it insults the first film by taking its name and part of its story. There are gaping plot holes aplenty and the whole film is predictable from the point where the kids get home again.3 out of 10 infect-eds eating the directors and the plot-writers",3,1,3,27 September 2007

","When a student of MIT finds himself in need of money he decides to join a club of card players that have decided to go to Las Vegas and become rich by counting cards at the blackjack table. Based on a book that is based on true facts this film displays another side to the story of six students that worked together to 'bring the house down', to play the casino to the point of coming away with big money.The film runs like any average film. A short bit is dedicated to lay out the character definitions and when that has been done well enough the actual story starts. The main bulk of the film is done quite nicely too. Nothing too fancy or too good, but good enough for cinema. The actual card playing is made interesting by displaying the thoughts of the main character together with his reasoning and there's a fair bit of action sequences added as well to make it even more interesting.I can't comment on how true the film is to the book as I've never read that, nor can I comment on how true it is to reality as I don't know the facts.

Somewhere in the middle of the wasteland they get stranded, and find out there is a truth about bad things happening to people that lived in the desert at the times of the big nuclear tests that were done there.The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of the film with the same title from 1977. I must admit I have never seen that one and after seeing this one I might be willing to see that one - usually the originals are a good deal better and this one was okay, almost at least.The story line is a normal one - very comparable to a lot of films that deal with the same ideas (people getting stranded in the wrong place and then getting slaughtered), but the work out isn't as good as the most of them.

Kung Fu Panda 2," Good for an afternoon watch
","Not having seen the first film I'm unable to define how bad or good this one connects to it. From what I do know of it, the lead character is still pretty much the same - thinking with his belly, not completely help- and clueless but almost there, but still a hero. Either way this film starts with an old enemy of Po rearing its ugly head and Po being called in to protect the citizens from him.Story wise there's nothing too fancy about this film - it's all been done before. It doesn't affect the film negatively though, it's an animation film designed to please kids and their parents and it does that.Animation wise I must say I was pleased by the colour scheme. It gives a radiant hum. The details in the background are just high enough as well, and the added 3D effects aren't wasted (though they can be missed without missing out on anything of the film).The character development may go a little over the heads of the kids - but I didn't see any of that bother the kid I had with me. So, all in all, enjoyable for kids and parents.7 out of 10 Pandas behaving fiercely",7,0,1,15 June 2011
Knowing," Plot - meet holes. Holes - meet plot
","How would one go through life is one would know what would be happening next? It's a question that is silently posed in this film but it's never really answered. It all starts when a young kid, upon being asked to make a drawing to store in a time-capsule does not draw a picture but writes down what seems to be random numbers instead. When years after the time-capsule is opened again the paper with the numbers comes into the hands of a father and his child and the father starts to stare at the numbers, attempting to find a pattern or meaning in them. What he finds scares him more than anything has ever scared him before.This film starts by making one big claim. If one can accept that claim to be truth it turns the film in a pretty standard but OK film with a fun but plot-holed filled story. If one can not accept that claim the film quickly turns into a long series of irritations. It plays out fairly decently, building on the initial claim and adding more twists to it, eventually digging its own grave a bit because it contradicts itself a few times. It doesn't completely run out of air though and in the end its OK enough to have people leave the cinema without being completely bummed out.6 out of 10 random numbers in a stream",6,2,6,6 May 2009

The woman lived there as a kid and wants to return the orphanage to its former glory by reopening it as a safe shelter for disabled children. As they are living there her sons imagination starts running wilder and wilder and by soon he has a number of imaginary friends. Soon after the trouble gets even worse and it is clear that there are more things happening than meet the eye.Combining a touch of drama with a good bit of mystery and a hint of horror is a dangerous thing, but this film proves that it can be done and can be done with style. The scenery is great - a spooky old house, the waves crashing onto the beach, a broken down playground, etcetera - combine into a well designed image that make the effects of the film stronger. The touching on the grim reality inside orphanages in the past adds to this too.The film asks a lot of questions and answers only a few of them. In the end one is left with one big one: what is real? And in reality it doesn't matter: either way you look at it it works out. And that is what makes the film so well, it has gone the distance and made a story and explanation that adds up for both the cynics and the believers.8 out of 10 horrific events",8,1,3,11 March 2008

He fails and has to promise the bear to bring him new food because the bear will kill him otherwise.When the raccoon and the band of animals get together the film starts rolling - and suburbia turns into the playground of the raving beasts.Over the Hedge is an animation film made by Dreamworks Animation and the animation itself isn't half bad. It looks good enough really. The story isn't half bad either - it is too short, but not half bad. The characters are a little flat though, and don't really fill up the short time the film lasts, and there is the last problem: it is just too short.It does have some good bits: there's a bullet time sequence that had me in tears from laughing.

A life totally different from the one he is living now: the life of an assassin.When I saw the trailers for this film I was thinking it was going to be a brainless action film with lots of collateral damage, a flimsy story and some nice looking scenery, but overall a good sense of amusement. When the film started that thought was proved rather quickly. I had been wrong in one point though: the amusement factor. That last one was quickly broken when scene after scene went over the top and a lot of scenes did that so far that every sense of reality (and with that tension) was broken.To me it felt like the film tried for too much at once and eventually toppled itself over while it could have been a lot better.

Not much can be said about this film without writing any major spoilers - not that there is that much to say in the first place - this film is an animation film for kids and therefor does not have any hidden trap doors and complex plot lines.For the kids its good fun with lots of laughter, dancing, a small bit of tension and a sense of good and evil.

The girl team gets canned, so it looks like her dreams won't be coming true there. But, there's a chance - a slim one: her brother is out of the country for a while and she might just be able to take his place for a bit.And presto, you've got the start up for a series of misunderstandings, college jokes, light homophobia, bits of under the belt zone humor, and all in all, enough good stuff to get a light film rolling and keeping it rolling until the end sequence starts.Bynes is one of the many oncoming actresses and she plays this one nice enough - not that the film thrives on good or bad acting, the storyline is too thin for that. All other characters are done nice enough too (with a plethora of clichés played out), and all in all I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this one.7 out of 10 girls in the boys football team.",7,1,2,1 August 2006

He's not completely happy in his life, being locked between a loving wife and three kids, as well as friends with their families. Shrek wants to live again, wants to be a real ogre again. Lucky for him, there's someone that can help him with just that.Following up on three previous films - that have been gradually getting worse - this fourth film was expected to be the lowest point in the sequence. It fails to live up to that expectancy - IMO it's better than the 2nd and 3rd part added together (and only slightly worse than the 1st). The story plays out rather nicely, using (again) several fairy tale characters and their tricks and treats to set for a rolling story and a mission that needs solving before the world ends.The animation is great, I especially liked the ogre village. The 3D addition is pretty good as well - there are a few scenes that are clearly designed for 3D viewing and they work well. But it must be said that this really should be the last in the series - continuing on where this one stops really wouldn't make much sense.7 out of 10 ear shattering horns",7,2,3,26 July 2010

And with each film they bring to the screens they seem to be raising their own ladder and expectations a bit. Ratatouille is no different when it comes to that. Animated sequences are brilliant. Nice choice of colors, no single still moment in the background and excellent details at the heart of every scene. In that, Ratatouille is a brilliant animation film.Storywise it doesn't bring much new with the exception of a rat working in a kitchen. The backing story behind that is an often used one though, so in that it isn't very special.Still I found it a very enjoyable watch that left me with the feeling usually caused by 'feel good' movies, and it had me in stitches on more than one occasion.

Saw III," A mere shadow of its predecessors
","In 2004 the world was treated to Saw. Saw was a brutal horror flick with excellent gore, a thrilling story and a superb plot - it combined the absolute best of a lot of things and with that became a new standard. Not too much later the follow up came - and that sequel confirmed the myth that some sequels can withstand the comparison with the original. Saw II was in my eyes just as good as the first one. Now... In 2006, Saw III sees the cinemas. Does it withstand the comparison? IMO, no. Not by a long shot.The premise to the story stays the same: a criminal going by the handle Jigsaw puts people that deserve a lesson in his eyes to a test. The setup for the film is the same as well - lots of (excellent) gore, fear and agony burning on the screen. The background story is different. The plot attempts to make the film fit in by adding tie-ins to the other parts and succeeds to a certain level, yet it fails pretty hard as it makes a number of jumps that just don't make any sense at all. It also misses the one thing that made the previous two films twist and turn - a severe twist of plot in the end that made them unpredictable. This film is very predictable.I guess it will now draw to a conclusion in a fourth part, but I can't say I am really looking forward to seeing it - it can only mean further downfall.5 out of 10 mutilated victims",5,2,4,20 December 2006

She sends everyone to the real world, where life isn't as pleasurable as in a fairy tale at all.Enchanted combines animation and live acting by putting them together side by side. The parts slide into each other well enough, but never actually combine. Not bad, not bad at all. The animated parts are good, the live acting is better. The story is pretty much standard, but the way it gets worked into the film is just really good.The film runs the middle between satire, making a mockery of fairy tales and the way things happen in them, and actually being a fairytale itself. It does this very well. It has an amazing amount of good laughs and a good way of exploiting all the positive aspects of a feel good movie.

Quantum of Solace," Could have been better
","Picking up shortly after Casino Royale stops this film is not to be seen without its direct predecessor. The story line just continues, and not in a bad way. Bond, driven by the lust for revenge and hatred, sets out on his quest for personal vengeance and doesn't really care who or what gets in the way.In style this film isn't much different from the previous one either. It is again miles away from the original James Bond format (which is a good thing IMO) and simply stampedes on from the word go. And that's where, for me, a bit of the problem starts. It doesn't give itself or the audience much or any time to get used to the settings, it just tosses action sequence after action sequence at the watcher and it could have used a few more restful moments just to catch a breath and explain some of the things that are going on.It isn't bad, not by a long shot.

He knows taking the bag of money, a lot of money, isn't the brightest idea. But he does it anyway. And from there things start rolling.Soon the stories of a number of people will start to collide at various points. And as expected from the Coen brothers these stories stand out on their own and work out amazingly well when brought together. Added to that the long slow shots and the effect is a mesmerizing film that captures one from the start and just flows by naturally, never ever conflicting with reality so much that it becomes a film. It might be just the tale you get told by a broken man at a bar instead of just something that happens on the big screen.Some characters could have done some better if they had gotten some more screen time though. For me the role played by Woody Harrelson falls a bit short - but more because of the few appearances he has than because of anything else. But for the rest all is well.

Meet Edward. Edward has been living in the cold town for ages and he's an outcast too, but in an entirely different way. When the two of them get together the story starts rolling.Based on a book this film is the first film to be made out of the series of books and I'm looking forward to seeing the next part. I've never read the books and I probably never will, but as a film this one works out pretty well. The growing romance between the two isn't half bad as it plays out and the response of the world around them is believable in many extends.The main characters play their roles correct enough and the general setting of the film feels a bit like a chick-flick but not so bad that it becomes unwatchable for people not falling into that category. I've seen worse, I've seen better, but this looks like a promising start to a trilogy.7 out of 10 lovers under a dark moon",7,1,4,21 December 2008
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Starts OK, then looses the plot completely.
","A smart company has a smart idea. They have developed a drug that might one day be used to repair the brain damage caused by Alzheimer disease. All they need to do is expand their tests from rats to bigger animals and eventually humans. But as many smart ideas go, this one turns sour and they end up with more than they can handle.Story wise this film is a prequel to its direct predecessor, giving a more or less plausible explanation of how things got to where they were. It really is too bad though that this exact story has been used to many times before already because it makes the film feel more bland than it should. Either way, the story rolls and eventually the revolution begins.And that point is the point where this film really starts loosing its grips on reality. One has to enter this film being able to believe that a drug makes apes much more intelligent and that is perfectly fine, but what one is supposed to take as believable from the middle of the film is just ridiculous.Those two added together make the film an insult to the original series and even worse than its direct predecessor (which was bad to begin with). Again eye candy wins over story and depth and again it makes for a film that will probably lure in the popcorn lovers and send everyone else off to the DVD rental store to see the original ones again.4 out of 10 apes gone mad",4,4,10,16 August 2011
Cars," Mildly interesting
","Normal films about racing cars are generally bad. In fact, I have yet to meet the first good one. Good thing this is an animation film. A young and rebellious car, still full of dreams, races his rounds, hoping one day to win the big prize: the Piston cup. Travelling from one race to the other he accidentally ends up in a small town. A town that once stood proud as a part of the great route 66 trail, but that has fallen apart after a highway is installed, taking away all the need to pass the city at all.In many respects this children's film is about making new friends, standing your ground, putting your priorities right. In many other respects it is a colorful animation film that amuses the kids. In completeness, it does fairly well, if not good.Can't say I was overly impressed with it myself, but my 7.5 year old nephew loved it. It stays interesting from the start to the end and brings a couple good messages across - to the parents. The children will probably miss them.6 out of 10 fast cars on the slow lane.",6,2,5,23 August 2006
Mr. Nobody," What if...
","This film starts as a guy named Nemo is asked to retell his life story. Who is he? What happened to him to make him the way he is? Does he remember? As he starts telling his story it becomes clear that the story is quite convoluted.Keeping the line smack in the middle of The Science of Sleep (2006) and Sliding Doors (1998) this film plays out the 'what if' questions of life in a somewhat quirky artistic way. Following events that happen after making a choice - or having a choice made for you - it retraces the full life of a person through several different paths, at once. A multitude of different stories rolling through each other intertwined like an intricately woven web.While I can say I really like the idea of toying with 'what if' questions and depicting the results of each one of them I can't really say I liked the wrapper that was used to capture it all in one film very much. It's acceptable, but I don't think it was the best possible fit.The bulk of the film though is very good - the different story lines are played out remarkably well and are different enough to stay interesting. It never becomes impossible to track which lifeline is which and the mixing of them is nice. It's just the wrapper that doesn't really fit in and that's a shame.7 out of 10 choices made",7,51,98,29 March 2010
Insidious," Slightly better than run of the mill
","When a kid sees eerie creatures in the night the parents do the usual thing - they comfort the kid and blame childhood fantasy. But when the kid slips into a coma and other people in the house start seeing things they may have been wrong.Films like this are a dime in a dozen and they usually pick one of the more classical films and take whatever they can from that one. This one is no different and leans very heavily on Poltergeist (1982). It's still rather different from that one though so it's OK, it's better to copy creatively than to create badly after all.The tension build in the film is quite good. It starts slowly but gets under the skin eventually. Attempted shock moments are there but are completely ineffective (and might just be designed to be like that) but they don't disturb anything. As the film rolls on and picks up speed it becomes a pleasant watch but never goes above that level. So, all in all, slightly better than run of the mill.7 out of 10 dark intentions",7,4,9,15 June 2011
Bolt," Too Disney
","Bolt is a star. He's an actor playing a superhero dog in a series in which he and his owner, a little girl, go through several ordeals trying to save the world and themselves. The good thing is, he's doing a fine job and everyone likes the series. The bad thing is, he doesn't know he's an actor and actually believes he's a superhero. When an event is created that takes his co-star, who he believes to be his owner, away from him he thinks it to be a true crisis and goes to the rescue.So far the story. Good enough, it's only a simple animation film after all. And like most of todays animations it leans a lot on the actions of several side characters and their interaction. I love the cat best, and the hamster plays a good part too. But all in all the combination just doesn't work out too well. It is too much of a standard story packed into too much of light headed animation. The animation is up to par with what can be expected today, nothing wrong there, but it doesn't really add to the story and that makes the ending result just too thin.Added to that is the fact that this is a pure Disney film and that is seen in the way the story flows - all the elements of the classics are there and it has to be said that the day for the classics is done and should be changed into a new rhyme instead of repeating it over and over.5 out of 10 super barks.",5,3,12,2 March 2009
The Number 23," Almost, but not yet, a complete waste of celluloid
","A gal buys her guy a book to read. It's called 'The Number 23' and it advertises itself as a trip into the heart of paranoia. The guy, not the reader type, starts reading it reluctantly and slowly. But the more he gets into it, the more parallels he finds between the book and his own life. Well, that's paranoia for you alright.Storywise this film isn't too bad. It relies a bit on the ability to believe in numerology but not so much that it becomes completely unwatchable when you don't believe in such. The things that happen aren't too out of the possible, and with that it becomes a pretty much OK mind warping thriller film. I say pretty much OK because it fails to get out of the 'thirteen in a dozen' range for the most of the time.The actual build up of the film (acting, music etc) isn't half bad, it works well enough. It's just the story that is just a little too weak to carry it all, and with that it fails to be good enough to be considered worthy cinema material.5 out of 10 paranoid people",5,2,6,25 February 2007

","A young motor stunt racer sells his soul to the devil to save a loved one. Years pass without the devil coming back to collect, but anyone knows that it is inevitable. When the day comes the guy isn't too happy about it, but he knows that he can't avoid it. From that point on he becomes the devils bounty hunter, set out on a dangerous mission.Based on another Marvel comic this is the umpteenth superhero coming to the big screen and it must be said that it isn't the worst adaptation. It isn't the best either though. Cage doesn't really come of the screen as the rider and the story itself isn't half well enough to be able to live it out. And with that the most of the film becomes a drag, only running on a few widespread scenes that are OK enough to be watched. Special effects are not more than OK, and that makes the ending result into a meager one.All in all, Ghost Rider is something to be seen on a very bored evening when there is absolutely nothing else to be seen.4 out of 10 bored riders out of Hell.",4,0,2,3 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Sort of okay
","The mutants are still on it. The story more or less continues where part 2 leaves off. I must admit I can't remember that much from part 2 anymore, and that probably says a lot of how I liked that one.This one then. It's much of the same. The red line of the story is that some scientists have found a mutant that negates the powers of other mutants. They have also found a way to sap the power of that mutant into a 'cure' that will remove mutant powers from others by injection. So far, the story.The film then. As said, it is much the same as the other two parts and I guess that if you liked these two that this one isn't one that should be missed. The effects used are pretty funny and some of the new mutants are nice to see, with one exception: The Juggernaut. He's a cool mutant, but he's played by a completely miscast Vinnie Jones that falls out of place completely by his British accent.So. All in all. An enjoyable film that will be forgotten just as quickly as the other X-men films.6 'cured' mutants out of 10",6,0,1,1 June 2006
Across the Universe," A working gimmick
","Set in the sixties this film tells the story of a guy called Jude, living in Liverpool and working like many men of that time at the docks, and having little money to spend. Sick of the job and the little prospects it shows he decides to go the USA and test his luck there.Some films get released and work because of a gimmick. This is one of those films. The gimmick in this case being the fact that the most of the dialog is converted into people singing songs previously done by The Beatles. For this to work out most of the film is build around the opportunity to sing a song - but it is done so well that its storyline is actually good enough to make the combination work out.The film is attractive visually as well - some of the color schemes are pretty wild but they match the setting. Most characters are played out well enough and all of them fit the theme of the film. Hence, all added together, there's the makings of a great artistic film with a high entertainment value.8 out of 10 songs covered",8,0,1,7 April 2008
The Mist," Truly awe-inspiring ending
","All is well in a little country village at a big lake. At least, until a huge storm tears down some trees and causes some damage to property and such. But even this storm is nothing compared to the chaos that ensues when a strange thick mist comes rolling into the town and stays there.Films that play their biggest part in just a tiny place are always something special - they require quite a bit of effort to make them work out as there is so little space to move around. This one does work though, and not in the least by some of the actors that play their finest roles ever. The added special effects are pretty good too and in just the correct amount: some where they are needed but nowhere too much.I haven't read the book this film is based on but it is clear that it is a Stephen King story - some of the elements used are just about a trademark of his writings. As a place holder for the background to the story they work out well enough though.Events going on are good. At least I can see them happen to some extend. And that is where the good things end: it's only to some extend. And this film takes these events to beyond that extend and in one occasion so far that it becomes completely unbelievable and therefore irritative. If it hadn't done that I would have gladly given it a 9 out of 10 but now I'm stuck at the upper end of an 8 out of 10 and only because the ending was so amazingly good.8 out of 10 hopes shattered.",8,0,2,5 May 2008

Little does he know that the star landed in a world that is very little like his own, but he'll found that out soon enough.Once in a blue moon a new fairy tale is born and as it grows up it might one day find its way to general public. In this case, the fairy tale did. It grew larger, it grew tangled roots and eventually it rooted itself in full completion on a cinema screen, shining brightly as the stars it tells about.There must be three or four fairy tale films on yearly basis. Some work, some don't. This one is a slight bit on the plus side of the middle for me. The story is worked out well enough but I think there's just too many bland pieces in it to make it really brilliant. Adding a whole plethora of famous actors to the film usually means the film is supposed to be bad, but in this case it more or less works out. I loved Robert De Niros part in this one. That one worked out really well.7 out of 10 fallen stars",7,2,4,26 October 2007
I Am Legend," Remake of a remake, but still OK
","Remakes are always to be watched with a cautious eye. Remakes of remakes even more so. But in this case I haven't read the book the original film was based on, haven't seen the original film and haven't seen the first remake. I have only seen this one.The story is easy enough: humankind is in a pickle. A virus has wiped out a large part of society. The sole survivor is a scientist who has to survive day after day in a menacing world. But is he really alone? I have always had a weak spot for films that play with the end of mankind. This one doesn't come with an original plot - even in its original time it had been done before. But the way it brings it is quite interesting. As the days pass by and the guy explains his actions and his motives it is hard not to feel for him. The story is interesting enough and even though most of the film is carried on the shoulders of just one actor it comes out pretty well. There's plenty of action, but not too much and there's a good dosage of drama too.Lovely film, 7 out of 10 lethal viruses",7,1,3,24 December 2007
Cars 2," Fairly enjoyable
","Starting where the previous one left of we meet Lightning McQueen completely settled and living in Radiator Springs. Life is good - there's racing events to be won and the company of friends to be enjoyed. During a race event in Japan the wheels of fate are set in motion and McQueen and Mater end up in what can only be described as a cloak and dagger operation. So far for the story.Animation wise there's nothing too wrong with this film - the style is much the same as the first one. Most of the scenes are busy - there's always something to look at, some detail to pick out. Story wise I felt the film was aimed at an audience a bit older than the one for the previous film although the number of young kids in the theatre enjoying themselves proved it didn't matter.3D effects were far under the expectancy level for an animation film. I don't think anyone would miss them if they weren't there at all and that makes this film another proof that the 3D addition to film is one that is to be worked at some more or removed completely.All in all it is a fairly enjoyable film with a good number of cultural effects and lots of laughs.6 out of 10 sources of intelligence",6,3,5,7 July 2011
Kick-Ass," Solid over-the-top action-comedy
","A guy, as average as averages go, decides to become a vigilante, a savior in need for damsels in distress. He puts on a suit, practices a fighting routine and tosses himself into business of superheroes. Not hampered by any form of experience he is quickly faced with the grim reality of being a want-to-be-hero, but that doesn't stop him. Instead, it feeds his resolution to become one.As a storyteller this film offers quite enough. It flirts with reality, in that it never goes so far that it becomes completely impossible (just very, very improbable) but since it never takes itself seriously this flirtation only works in a positive way. The story line that ties the action sequences in this film together is thus more than good enough.As an action-film this one is solid gold - nice quick paced, neatly choreographed, sometimes blatantly stolen from other films, but always fitting to the film.But all that is the basis, and with just that basis this one would still fall in the category of run-of-the-mill action films. This one does not do that because it offers extras in the form of some dark and twisted tangents and it is these extras that make this film very enjoyable instead of just enjoyable.All in all, nicely over the top, nicely paced, nicely twisted, and completely mad.9 out of 10 good intentions",9,1,9,28 April 2010

So, the search is on for another heir.Shrek The Third picks up where Shrek 2 left of. Everyone is back in action and ready to roll from the first minute. And that's why this film works out so well - all players are right in their places in their specific roles and there is more than enough of a story to tell to keep things going for the full length of the film. Add to that the animations for this one that are a lot better than the ones used in the first film and it can't be much of a surprise that this third part is better than the first part and better than the second part.For the rest it brings just what is to be expected: a lot of dark and cynical views on fairy tales and a good lot of one like jokes that are somehow connected by the mad adventures to the many figures that run around through the film. So, all in all, a very worthy third party to the series. Looking forward to part IV.9 out of 10 Ogre Kings",9,2,3,11 June 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Arise, Surfer
","This sequel to Fantastic Four (2005) continues where the first one stopped. The Four are still together and doing what they do best - make silly jokes amongst themselves and planning marriage and such. It wouldn't be a superhero comic if there wasn't someone to add a thrill to the story though and so there is the arrival of a strange phenomenon on planet Earth in the form of a silver surfer. So, investigation starts. And that is much of the story of this film. Which is OK, this type of films doesn't need a thousand page book to back it, it just requires fun, nice action sequences and some slick graphical effects.The first film was more or less OK, it wasn't anything worth watching twice but was fun for a bored Sunday afternoon. This sequel is in my eyes a small bit better, but not much. It still is a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and still isn't worth a second watch. The bit of storyline there is is worked out well enough and some bits of the film were actually very funny. Some other weren't though and that made the total a little too inconsistent to become truly captivating.Graphic wise this one is pretty well. Most of the used effects are convincing enough to keep one watching the film instead of moaning about horrendously bad effects. Music was fitting, at least didn't fall out of style with the rest.6 out of 10 disasters happening on poor planet Earth",6,1,3,16 August 2007
Transformers," Nice adaptation
","In the eighties there was an animated series on television called Transformers. In the eighties I was a kid. Unhampered by the things that make an adult life so boring at times I liked the series. Somewhere in 2006 the trailers for a Transformers film were released and I could be nothing but skeptical. For who would the film be made? The kids of the eighties or the kids of the current era? Driven by curiosity I decided to go and see for myself, by seeing the film. It turned out to be one of the better choices I've made this year.The film is very clearly based on the animated series: the same set of characters, the same story line, the same idea basically. It works as well as it does because it combines the raw action of the robots clashing together in war with the fact that it doesn't take itself very serious. In fact, it doesn't take itself serious at all, often using self deprecating tag lines between the rampaging action sequences.In effect, it works like a charm. It's a good barrel of laughs with plenty of CGI based action, most of which is worked out well enough not to cause too much friction on the viewer. So, there you have it. Simple minded but effective action with a good laugh in it.8 out of 10 rampaging robots in disguise",8,2,7,10 July 2007

","Life isn't always easy if you're a young inventor. Especially not if some of your experiments run into disaster. It isn't any different for the lead character in this animation film - wanting to save the city he lives in from becoming a ghost town he invents a machine that can turn water into food. And while the idea sounds good it has all the potential to turn into a full flexed catastrophe.Intended for a younger audience this film plays around the invention and the effects it has on the city and its denizens while skipping lightly over a couple heavier subtopics - those go way over the heads of the smallest ones in the audience but fit right in there for their legal guardians.The animation style used is great - a wild color scheme, lots of exaggerated forms, heavily characterized persons (both in style and actual behavior).All in all it makes for a hilarious film that will have the entire audience laughing.8 out of 10 meatballs in a storm.",8,1,2,17 February 2010
Children of Men," When new life stops, all is lost
","In 2027 the world is without hope. No new baby has been born in 18 years because every single person on the planet is, for reasons that are not explained, sterile.This is the premise the film starts with and although it is only a short line it offers more than enough feeding grounds to build an excellent story from, and this film is a good proof of that. It plays out like one of those books you simply can't put down, that you have to keep reading until the very last page of it.It tells the bleak tale of a world where people have nothing left to go for - riots on the street and refugees being kept in cages, public transport happening in armored vehicles.I've always been a sucker for post apocalypse films and this one surely counts as one of those.

Clash of the Titans," Popcorn amusement at its worst
","Two things first: one, I'm none too big on myths so I didn't know the backing story. And two, I've never seen the original Clash of the Titans (or cannot remember seeing it) so I'm not going into comparisons.The film starts when a kid is found at sea gets rescued from drifting. A small bit of film later and he's all grown up and a skilled fisherman who sails the sea together with his family to get some food and fish to sell. During one of these fishing trips they witness an event that can best be expressed as an act of war against the Gods and so this war starts.What follows is an endless string of battles, explosions of pent up anger and overly predictable near misses, rescues and what else. Added to this is an awfully thin layer of 3D effects which makes the film look and feel like these old school 3D toys where you insert a disc with pictures into a device that looks like a binocular to give them some depth.Added up you get a thin and broken up story line, somewhat more than OK 2D effects and very very bad 3D effects. Add to that the effect that most of the events are boring and you get what is best described as 'one huge waste of tape'.2 out of 10 very irritating hours spent in the cinema",2,3,6,13 April 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Fate can be fought
","As a guy goes through his routine life something rather extra-ordinary happens: he has a literal run in with fate. From there on he's met with many choices - most of them biased around accepting his fate, or running away from it.The story of the film isn't entirely new - more films have been made with the same premise. The way it is worked out isn't altogether fresh either - this film reminds me a great lot of Dark City for instance (even though that one doesn't necessarily deal with fate). But it is worked out pleasant enough - the start is a wee bit slow but it picks up in the second half and the ending isn't too bad.The characters are played out good enough - they fit the parts they need to be and come across believable enough to keep up with the film. The tension field between the two main characters is OK enough, one would be able to believe the two of them to be in love.All in all, OK enough but nothing more than that.6 out of 10 fates escaped",6,0,1,28 March 2011
World Trade Center," We can be heroes, just for one day
","The second '9/11' film for 2006. This one tells the (dramafied but real) story of two port authority officers that find themselves trapped under the debris of the collapsed twin towers and in need of rescue.It starts as the day started: perfectly normal. The commanding officer deals out the orders for the day and the briefing is done. Then the news comes that a plane has crashed into one of the two towers and the action starts rolling.The bulk of the film plays as two separate stories: the two officers laying in the debris, and their family and rescuers trying to get to them and finding out what happened. It plays on emotion, becomes overly sentimental and tries to put up some 'real' heroes.And just that is the point where it fails miserably. At least for me. It is just one big streak of patriotism and personally I don't think that is necessary in a film, or anywhere else for that matter.4 out of 10 scared family members.

And once again the Batman comes out of hiding to save the city.The original Batman tales never had too much around them. Flimsy little comics never could have after all. The main story line backing this film isn't much different: criminal is on the loose, superhero goes after him. But luckily for this film there is more. There is the background of the main characters, there's a nice suspense story and there is great action.And not to forget, there is great acting. Bale is doing a wonderful job as the Batman, but it has to be said that it is Ledger that is stealing the show. His rendition of the Joker is downright brilliant, the character coming to life as mad as it can and every little move and sound he makes fitting into the character and the story.So, all in all, well played, well written, and good looking.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," great!
","By now the Harry Potter series won't need any explanation. Most people that will be seeing this film will have seen the films and/or read the books after all. Bookwise this fifth part is a HUGE part. About 1000 pages, the largest part so far. Filmwise this means a lot of information needs to be brought to the screen or trimmed away far enough that it disappears without too much consequence.So far the series fared rather well on that. The first three do a more or less straight conversion. Harry Potter 4 was missing a lot of data that was in the book but still worked out well enough. For me, part 5 misses more data than 4 did, but works out better nonetheless. I think this is a great film. It's fast, action packed, played out well enough. I also think it works better for people who have read the book than for people that haven't. Some things don't connect very well without the story backing it.New characters like Luna Lovegood were typecast brilliantly which added to the film in a great way. Used effects were great, atmosphere was chilling, musical choice was fitting. All in all, another great addition to the series.

Into the Wild," Compelling
","Angry after having lived a lie for many years a guy leaves his home town and life behind right after graduation. Hitch-hiking across the USA he eventually makes it to Alaska where he lives for some time longer.Based on the life of a real man this film tells a story that is already known by many. I haven't read the book it is based on, so I can't say whether it is a good adaptation or not. The events depicted are clear enough though. On his way through life the main person is changed by the people he meets and the things he gets to do - and in many cases he changes whoever he runs in to. And as his tale grows longer his life becomes more complex and he becomes less of the person he was when he left his city.As a film it was for me a combination of TV episodes of Jacques Cousteau, and a lot of elements from The Straight Story. Apart from the fact that this film is a dramatized version of reality it never raises far above the level of a 'good' film. It is good, but not great. The main reason behind that being the way it distracts at some points from the real center of the film - the guy that makes the trip. I can't put a more solid finger on it, but at some points it just shies away from the main subject too much.8 out of 10 miles hiked",8,2,5,7 April 2008
Blood Diamond," What's the color of money?
","When wars are fought and weapons are needed the question comes where to get the money for them. When the grounds are rich of a rare mineral otherwise known as diamond that question is quickly answered. Then, as a last step, for the cheap mining of this rare material the locals are forced into slavery.Blood Diamond plays around exactly that. Starting of its story when a diamond smuggler hears that a huge rough pink diamond has been found by one of the slaves and hidden somewhere. When a stone of such rarity is found greed blooms like a dirty flower and it is no mystery that the chase is about to begin.So far the story. Blood Diamond is a combination of adventure style and thriller, following its three leads character on their travels through Africa, during the civil war in Sierra Leone. The way it is put together feels OK - it isn't entirely impossible to feel for the characters as they make their way across the land. Some of the scenes reminded me of other films, featuring the same level of brutality and wrongness (children should never hold weapons, and surely not being forced to use them). Scenery shots are downright beautiful, musical score is good.All in all, a rather interesting film to watch and one that makes time fly by - even for its length of nearly 2.5 hours.8 out of 10 hands with blood on them",8,0,0,30 January 2007
Taken," Intense but too short
","When the daughter of a former CIA agent gets abducted the guy gets to use all his skills to track her abductors down. There are a few lines of story twisted through this, but the main line stays the same: quick, sometimes crude, action.It all starts when the daughter, who is living with her mother, asks her father to sign a paper that allows her to travel out of the US because she wants to see Paris. The guy is a bit reluctant because he's seen too much darkness on this planet during his days of work for the agency, but he signs anyway and thus the story starts rolling.And roll it does. Taking a few plot holes at a time it finds its way to the bottom of the rabbit hole pretty quickly and as things get more and more dirty the plot holes get deeper.The film isn't entirely bad, but if they had listened to the call of reality a bit more often it would have been a lot better. Now it is just another film where some invincible angry human chases after a lot of bad guys and that really doesn't credit it as well as it might have been.Another irritation factor to this film is its short running length. Taking just under 90 minutes this feels a bit like a rip-off - having to buy full price for a film that rushes its way to its end doesn't make me happy.6 out of 10 bad guys beaten to a pulp",6,5,15,5 May 2008

The story line works well enough, if you're into fairy tales and the sometimes odd angles they take. Personally I love a good fairy tale, especially if it's a bit dark and twisted, so this works well for me.This adaptation is then done in part computerized graphics, part acting, part cross-over. Added to that is a layer of 3D effects that make for a solid immersion in a world that is strange for most - but terrifyingly believable as well. For me the way the scenery was designed matched perfectly of what I remembered from the books - which I read as a child, years ago.The computer graphics are wildly colored and often heavily exaggerated but it fits the story and therefore works out really well. Music doesn't really jump out, but fits. Acting is fitting, with only a very small number of very small kinks. The choice of rolling events works very well, with only one or two falling out of place/style.All in all, I had high expectations when I walked into the theater - I generally love Tim Burton's work, especially when it combines with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter because the three of them always make for a well matched team, and I also love the original Alice in Wonderland story and its sequel. And although that usually means the expectation gets shattered while actually watching the film it wasn't in this case - this film offered all I wanted and more.So, apart from one or two out-of-place/style scenes, there's only one word describing this film and that word is brilliant.9 out of 10 rabbits in a deep hole",9,3,5,16 March 2010
Super 8," The glorious return of the Goonies
","A group of friends consisting of kids of about 12 years old works together to make a film. Using a Super 8 camera and whatever scenery they can find they attempt to put together their master piece so that they can send it in for a competition of sorts. Things get really interesting for them when they see something they shouldn't have seen during one of their sessions.And so the story rolls. Story wise this one isn't exceptional. It begins with people being at the wrong place at the wrong time and from that point on being the unwilling victim of sworn secrecy. Most of the things that happen make some kind of sense and that makes the story good enough.The way it is played out, carried on the shoulders of the children, is cool. Their way of acting is both natural and designed and this works wonders, especially as part of the film hinges on them making a film themselves so there's plenty of acting to be acting so to speak. Most of the adults feel to be at their place too.The first thing I was reminded of when seeing this film was The Goonies, a feeling that never went away during the rest of the film. That film had the same kind of touch to it, but it's a good touch so nothing lost there.All in all, surely worth a watch, even though it's based on a story that is a little too overused 7 out of 10 shots in the dark",7,1,3,7 September 2011
Rio," Two birds of a feather
","The story starts as a number of birds is caught in the middle of the Brazilian rain forest. One of them is a blue parrot, and as it turns out, a very special one. Years later the wheels of fate have taken him into the loving hands of a woman that treats him very well, maybe a little too well. Fate is again turning on him and his presence is needed in Rio.And that's where this very colourful animation film really starts rolling. He quickly meets a number of friends and a necessary number of enemies and the rest of the story unfolds at a pleasantly quick pace.Animation wise this one is nice, but not more than nice. The colour scheme is just great, spot on for the type of film, but action wise it's too much of a kids film - there's too little fun stuff hidden under the surface to keep the adults happy.Story wise it's a little too rich on clichés and the easy turns and tangles. It's not bad but it's not great. All in all, it works great on the children, and works OK on their parents/guardians.7 out of 10 feathers in a ruffle",7,6,6,1 August 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Here There Be Dragons
","Hiccup, the son of a tribes headman lives in a typical fishing village. Picturesque medieval housing at the sea, with fresh fish to eat a plenty, sunny meadows where the sheep graze before they're eaten. For the most, life is good. Apart from the dragons that sometimes attack the town.Story wise the film starts with this baseline and then builds out on a typical growing up kid story that desperately wants to impress his father who that cannot see beyond his own expectations for the kid. Now, all that wouldn't be fun at all, at least not for its intended audience - kids. So, the tangent of dragons and befriending them is added.Everything that happens is highly predictable but it fits and it makes for a more than decent base for the rest of the film - which consists of mostly great animation, some added 3D effects and fast paced action. All in all, the film is great for its intended audience and good for the parents that go along to see it with their kids. And the 3D? It's a good add-on and not overused, it fits.8 out of 10 dragons running amok",8,2,3,13 April 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," terribly slow and mildly agitating
","A doctor and his wife finally discover the strength of their marriage is weakening. When she tells him she almost cheated on him and dreamed about it later he almost breaks up and seeks refuge with a prostitute. From this comes the next and in this case the next is a strange sexually biased game in a castle performed by a cultlike group of people.After this experience he comes clean to his wife by telling him about his evening and this puts them both back in their places, knowing for sure they can still solve their problems by living together.And this concludes the movie, Very slow, and due to this suspect to agitation. Not a great movie at all and to be honest, a great disappointment as it came from the hands of one of the greater movie makers. Having said this, i'd recommend 'The Ice Storm', dealing with the same subject but far better.",6,0,1,6 September 1999
The Da Vinci Code," Nice
","A murder happens in the Louvre, Paris. The police is called to the scene and quickly after that a Professor in ancient symbols is called to the scene as well. What follows is the hunt for the killer and the chase after a lot of mystery, straight into Christian history.I guess most of us know the story by now. It's been hyped to high heavens from the moment it was known that a film would be made from the book. So I won't go into the story any deeper here.That said... I haven't read the book yet. I did thoroughly enjoy the film - it shows many analogies to films like National Treasure in that it follows a trail of frail clues through history. It's also a fairly well designed slow thriller, that sadly is just a little too predictable towards a couple of the final 'secreties'. No bad though, it still managed to kept me bound to it for its full length, and since that length is 149 minutes that is pretty good.Scenery is cool. All around. Settings are done wild, and the acting of Paul Bettany jumps out. His character is played out insanely well.In the end, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this film. With some luck I'll get the book tomorrow, and then I'll see if that is better, like most reviewers who did read the book seem to be agreeing about.8 out of 10 dark secrets.",8,0,2,24 May 2006
Thor," More shallow than it should be
","The Gods are crazy. Norse Gods even more so. After long raging battles they rest in Asgard, keeping an eye on the worlds so that they might intervene when necessary. But not all is well, first there is the arrogant son of the King that lusts for power, second there is the constant threat of an ancient enemy.And so starts the story of Thor, a young brash member of a tight group of Gods that is about to meet its newest challenge. Playing partly in Asgard, partly on Earth this film hits solid gold when reviewed as a graphical feast - the depiction of Asgard is great and would make even the largest creatures feel humble and small. The effects all through the film are quite well too.But then there is the story. The fact that is biased around Thor is one thing (he is the title character after all) but insulting many of the other players by allowing them little to no screen time is unnecessary. Given the length of the film the makers obviously had no problem making a film longer than average, and an extra 15 to 30 minutes would have solved many of the thin backgrounds to the supporting crew quite decently. It's a shame really for now it's nothing more than popcorn amusement and eye candy.6 out of 10 bored Gods",6,2,6,10 May 2011
The Happening," Huge disappointment
","Mass suicide, chaos, panic and disorder. It all starts suddenly and people rush to find an explanation. But first and foremost they try to find a safe place, attempting to flee from something that seems to be spreading faster than the plague. Seen from the trailers this seemed interesting enough.The films start isn't entirely bad either, except for a frequently appearing boom mike and acting that is a lot poorer than expected from its cast. But it starts to get bland and boring very quickly and at that point the acting and the boom mike get to be a source of irritation. And as the film runs towards its end it is clear that it doesn't get any better. No, instead it gets worse - it finishes itself off with a true cliché ending that manages to change the feeling of slight irritation into massive irritation.So, in short... Poorly written, poorly played, poorly edited and badly ended. Complete and utter waste of celluloid.3 out of 10 missed chances.",3,2,6,2 July 2008
The Departed," Should have been better
","Organized crime, organized crime fighting. Corrupt policemen and undercover agents. They seem to be connected at the hip and this film plays with that from the start to the very last minute of it, telling the tale of the actions of a FBI/police combination fighting to bring a hotshot criminal down. Apparently it is a remake of the Japanese film Mou gaan dou (2002). I have not seen that original but will be on the lookout for it now.The Departed is intense. A tad slow in the beginning and maybe a little too fast in the ending, but I guess keeping a very good balance in a 150 minute film can be a very daunting task. The most of it is rather interesting and builds a tension that runs somewhere until the last 15 minutes of the film - but - that is where it all fails. For me the last 15 minutes of film feel glued to the rest but not really connected to that rest and that more or less breaks the film in half, destroying its quality.All in all. A lot of good looking imagery, good sound track, nice story - until just before the end of it. Cut of 15 minutes and you've got a thrilling good film.6 out of 10 dirty cops",6,4,6,30 December 2006
The Holiday," Shallow, predictable, but good enough
","One American girl, cheated on by her boyfriend. One English girl, seeing her unanswered love getting married to someone else. One change of houses, cars, lives and pretty much everything for a holiday. Three ingredients for what turns out to be a very lightheaded but rather fun film.The Holiday starts quickly by showing the events that lead to the change of lives - neither event needs a lot of explanation and that part is over with rather quickly. What then starts it the actual change, and that one couldn't have been more dramatically for either party - from a tiny house with no luxuries at all to a large one with all luxuries available and vice versa. It all works out very well.The film is rather predictable - the ending is clear in sight for just about everyone from somewhere in the middle of the film. But that doesn't make it any worse - it works in the same ways as any other feel good film. Characters are worked out well enough, but not very deep. Not bad either.All in all, worthy of screen time.7 out of 10 beats of love.",7,1,3,28 December 2006
30 Days of Night," Complete waste of celluloid
","A dark period is about to start for a small village in Alaska. This isn't entirely strange as the town is located so far to the North there's a yearly recurring period of 'eternal night'. In this period most inhabitants of the town skip town because they don't want to be plagued by the long lasting darkness and the nasty effects that has on people.As the local sheriff and an accompanying officer ride around the town to do a final check up they find something odd: a pile of burned satellite telephones. As the investigation continues it turns out to be the start of something much more sinister. And so it starts. The remaining citizens of the town will soon find out that going somewhere else had been a better option. It doesn't take long before the sun goes down and the trouble starts.So far the story. Personally I love a good horror film and I love films where people get mangled for whatever reason. If there's a good streak of tension to it, all the better. If there's a bit of imaginative and new monster building to it, even better. Quite sadly, none of those are present in this film. Tension is non-available as the characters are played out so much using all the known monster film clichés out there that one can point out the next one to die about a second after the character comes into play. Imaginative monster design is out of the question too: the monsters are pretty much the same as the ones seen in many many more films. The one thing that the film does have is people getting mangled in a good way. Most of the kills are pretty vile and worked out nicely.All added together though it leaves a sad impression. A complete waste of celluloid if you ask me.3 out of 10 overused clichés",3,1,5,24 January 2008
Hancock," Not too bad, not too good
","Hancock is a drunk. Hancock is unfriendly, anti-social and generally a miserable bastard. He's also a superhero. He's shunned by the city he 'protects' and looking at a troubled future. Until he saves the life of a public relations professional who decides to help him.Hancock is a superhero with a twist. A genre that has found its way to the masses during the last few years. Some of these work very well, some don't. This one is more or less in the middle. The adventures of a superhero misfit are good for a good few laughs and the way his story continues is amusing enough but are nowhere downright hilarious or brilliant.Effects used in the film are good for the most of them and poor for some, but not poor enough to become a nuisance. Acting is done OK enough and stays in style well enough. So overall the film is worthy of cinema time but only very marginally over the line.6 out of 10 intoxicated heroes",6,1,3,21 July 2008
Inception," Enter sandman
","During the night the brain rages on, projecting dream worlds for the sleeper, dream worlds that purge the mind from random luggage, often combining bits and bytes that normally should not be connected at all. In a dream anything is possible. And in this film, the dream stage is the point where a mind can be altered, to give information the person isn't ready to give.Allowing the film this starting point makes for an interesting set-up - a master thief enters dreams and tries to steal information from the invaded sleeper. But than said thief is sent on another mission. He's not to steal anything, but he's to leave something behind, he's the plant an idea that will eventually alter the decisions the person is going to make.What follows is a nearly 2.5 hour long revolving tale in which a crime is worked out. The visualization leans heavily on CGI, but doesn't abuse it - the essence of the film is in its story. It moves with considerable speed but never looses track of itself and if there's plot holes in it they aren't deep enough to trip over. So, all in all, good stuff.9 out of 10 warped minds",9,2,7,26 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," A solid mixture of costume theatre and violence
","Sherlock Holmes. Most people know him from the stories as a somewhat dusty investigator with a peculiar pipe and hat, solving various crimes by dry logic deduction. How does a figure like that thrive in these cinematic times? I guess if the film had been made completely based on the original characters it would have turned sour.But leave it to Guy Ritchie to pick up the character(s) in the stories and make them into a successful combination of brutal violence and costume drama. Sticking close enough to the original tales and their relations as well as adding enough flavors of current time dark cinema and his own personal traits (the feel of typical British crime-comedy that made him famous) this film works like a charm. Fast paced, a sinister plot and many logic deductions (amongst many other things).Downey and Law do well as Holmes and Watson. Holmes comes across as highly intelligent, yet thoroughly vile and somewhat of an egocentric bastard while Watson comes across as the help against his will and better knowledge. Added together they make a formidable mix. Of the other characters there a few that jump out performance wise but all in all its the mixture that works best. All added up, a nice watch if you like dark crime-comedy.8 out of 10 crimes solved",8,0,0,19 January 2010
WALL·E," Cute with clichés
","In a future time Earth has turned into a massive junk yard. General laziness of people have caused global pollution to run to the point where there is no more normal space to live in and every one has left the planet. Everyone, except a small cleaning robot that somehow manages to sustain himself through the years by scrapping parts of his former colleges. Life is a bit dull for the little robot until one fine day another robot appears in his life. After that point life isn't quite as dull any more and things get rolling quicker and quicker.Wall-E is a typical children's film - somewhat moralistic, nothing too complex and filled with a number of additions that make it fun for the adults to sit through it while their children are enjoying it. Its animation is great. Even the future Earth that is filled with junk looks great. The movements of the robots are marveling and the choice of color palette is working out quite nicely. There's little to no speaking between the two main characters, making the film all the easier to follow for the smaller children and the most scary part is a robot that can be best qualified as a toned down HAL2000.All in all, good fun and able to bring some good smiles to the faces of the most of them.8 out of 10 cleaner worlds",8,0,4,24 October 2008

Animation at its finest this film combines elements of classic Western films with modern day animation and plenty of elements to keep the children in the audience happy. Like most modern animation it combines elements for a more adult audience with elements for a younger audience and it does it very well.The adventures of Rango and the other denizens of the town are a fun story and the way everything comes together is compelling enough to make for a fairly long film - and there's plenty of space to introduce events that mimic other classic films, paying tribute to the better things that film industry has to offer.Very good stuff, 8 out of 10 roads crossed",8,1,6,10 March 2011

But it doesn't quite stay that way.1408 is a fun little film where most of the events happen in a small contained area - a specific room of a hotel. It is a little predictable but not to the degree where that becomes irritating. The things that happen as the film rolls on are varying between fun and mediocre standard stuff but all in all add up to a nice way of passing the time.

X-Men: First Class," Not gripping at all.
","Set in time years before the start of the first film this prequel shows the younger years of two of the more known mutants - Professor X and Magneto. Mankind does not yet know the mutants exist - and the mutants are doing their best to keep it that way by sticking to hiding.The trouble with prequels is that the ending is already known. Normally that wouldn't make for so much of a problem (it's the how you get somewhere that counts, not the where you get) but in this film it is. From the very start of the film it becomes clear that this film is going to have to bend the rules of the continuity of the series (or even break them) to work out and that point becomes painfully clear later in the film.What follows is a series of events that fits the theme in behaviour and speed (although the beginning was too slow to my liking) and since it is known where everyone is going in the end it just doesn't matter - it's a pointless recap of what might have happened in the past of the players in the other films but that can't really have happened because the rules had already been laid out differently.So, all in all, the film fails pretty hard. The action sequences are more of the same, the story is mediocre at best, and although the acting is pretty decent that alone is not enough to save it.5 out of 10 mutants better removed from the gene pool",5,2,10,6 June 2011
Iron Man," Fast paced action, decent story, good fun
","When the brain behind a weapons manufacturer has his eyes opened he decides to tip the scale and turn his brain to work for a better cause. A move that is questioned by some and blatantly disliked by others. But, all in all, a move he makes for himself and that makes him a better man, an iron man.Any film based on a comic strip is dangerous. Some work out really well, but the most of them are bland and clearly very short stories smeared out over a long film that are therefore eye candy without anything else. This one is one that falls in the first group though. There's enough time to get to know the main character, to understand his reasoning and come to terms with his changes. There's also more than enough time to watch him fight it out with his new found friends and enemies. And there's enough time for eye candy.I love this film. It's what spring/summer action is all about. Not too rich on the brain power but very decent fast paced action, a fun story, and very nice imagery. Action starts pretty early in the film but not before letting the audience learn to know the main characters. The hero is a superhero, but not one without some frailty.

Casino Royale," A return to the heart of the Bond style
","Bond films. I've never been a great fan of them. I loved Dr. No and From Russia With Love, but after that it all went into a steep decline and I can't remember much of the last few I saw the past decade - none of them were impressing. But, I took the risk to go see Casino Royale in the cinema anyway, more by lack of anything else to see than by anything else, but still.I am glad I did take that risk. For the first time in ages a Bond film is released that is a good nice watch with a lot of fast paced action but nothing too far fetched (although there are a few Mission Impossible like scenes in the beginning of the film). The film isn't completely Bond styled either - Moneypenny and Q aren't there and that feels somewhat strangely. M is there though and Judi Dench plays her with style. Craig does a very convincing bond.The bulk of the film is chasing around, building tension and trying to throw a mask over the face of the person that is the actual master brain behind it all. It does that pretty well and with that it stays fun to watch until the very end of it.8 out of 10 bad hands at a poker game",8,2,6,25 January 2007
Toy Story 3," A bit too grown-up for the kids
","When making sequels one always has to make the conscious choice to keep the story going on in the same time line as the film or not. In this case the decision was made to have the film and its characters age at the same speed as the real world - and that makes for some effects. Andy is now ready to go to University and has left his toys untouched for many years. Now that he's about to leave his parental home the question arises what to do with the toys. Will it be the safety of the attic, or the trash-can or some other fate? To me this film was tilted just a bit towards the audience of the first film and no longer really towards the kids in the audience. My own kid loved the film anyway - even though he had some questions about some of the things that happened and I found the film a little too gloomy. Life isn't perfect, but that doesn't have to be displayed so openly in a children's film IMO.When it comes to animation this one does what it is supposed to do. It's great to watch all the characters and their surroundings move along and the color scheme is very pleasurable. The story runs OK, but as said before it's a bit too gloomy to my taste.7 out of 10 snakes in boots",7,1,3,26 July 2010
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Nicely compelling
","At the end of the Tudor dynasty a queen rules over England. It's a time of great religion based conflict where the Catholics and the Protestants want to bash each others heads in. It's the time where the Spanish try to invade England with a massive armada.Not being a man of history I do not know how far the events depicted in this film deviate from the truth. What is depicted is a queen living her life in a this turbulent time. A queen that is imprisoned in her life, a queen that goes to war with her soldiers, a queen that is in many ways a normal person like any other (and that in many other ways isn't a normal person at all).The film is in effect a costume drama and those stand or fall by the way they get acted out and how events fit together. For me this film worked out very well. Cate Blanchett plays an excellent role as Queen Elizabeth and thereby carries the title role with verve. Clive Owen fits well as the more or less pirating adventurer that aids her in her life in many ways. All other actors revolve around them and each other in matching style. Added to that the events that keep the pace of the film going, a great musical score and a complete lack of unnecessary additions. So, added all together, it's a great compelling story that might or might not be true, and it's a great watch.8 out of 10 turbulent Queens",8,0,1,18 December 2007
Beowulf," Not entirely bad
","Once every few years the poem of Beowulf and Grendel is made into a film. Some get aired on television, some make it to the cinema, and some get edited so that they work well on the IMAX format. This one falls into that last category.The story is so old that it is known to almost everyone. It is the classical tale where a hero comes to save the day by defeating a demon that has been terrorizing the lands for some time. It's also the story of the hero that makes a most dreadful mistake.So, story wise there is nothing new here. What makes this Beowulf different from the others that have been out there is that this one features a few things that make it work well in IMAX theaters. It also differs from most others because it uses a sort of CGI acting method where real actors get smudged into the CGI instead of the other way around. It works out well enough, looking more or less like an adult animation film.Most of the effects are done well enough, only a few are of the toe curling bad stuff that makes for films like Jumanji All in all, not quite the worst to be in the cinemas this year.7 out of 10 demons from the other world",7,1,5,26 November 2007

It's a typical summer blockbuster kind of film where you know what to expect and know what you will be getting. It does deliver just what is expected and has some very good moments. Action sequences are great, comedy value is good and there is even a slight trace of tension.Acting is done well enough to not fall out of style, musical score works well enough, used effects are more than well enough.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," And so the circle closes
","As an eight part in the series there's not a single reason to explain the story or its characters, they've been defined. And so this film starts running, and doesn't really pause until the very end of it. As a book translation I guess it doesn't do too bad of a job - most events of importance get a glimmer of screen time. I have no idea how it works on people that haven't read the books though.As a film it's dark, literally. Too dark to my liking, it's a good thing to express the dark and grim feeling of the book, it's overkill to make the film look like everything was shot between dusk and dawn. This effect was even worse in 3D - which again turned out to be a dud.Overall the film felt rushed - as if the maker was done with it, glad to have the series end. As part of the audience I now feel the same - it was a good series to watch through the years but I am happy it is done now.Adding that all together makes it the worst part in the series to me, fitting but not fitting, pleasing and not pleasing.6 out of 10 last rites",7,0,0,8 August 2011
300," Alternates between boring and very interesting
","When a massive army of Persians threatens to attack Sparta its noble King throws himself and a small army of 300 into the fray, hoping to withstand the attacks or at least delay it long enough for the city to defend itself. Outnumbered by far he decides to seek his defense in a narrow mountain pass to make sure the difference in number of warriors can't be exploited by the attackers. This is the story of that battle and what happened just before and after.Based on a graphic novel the one thing that makes this film different from other films based around the same stories, tales, factual legends is the fact that it is made so that it looks half like a normal film, half like a series of drawn pictures. It also uses a lot of stop - motion sequences, slowing down the sequences of shots to an almost full stop and then picks up to full speed again, effectively accentuating the middle of the scene.This trickery works out -very- well. The film is a work of art to watch. The choice of coloring feels radiant yet chilly, and dangerous as the actual battle fray. Choice of music is done well too - really adding to the film.Still, there's a negative end to it all. The film stretches itself too long every now and then. Wild action sequences alternate with slow sequences and in effect I find this film to be pretty boring. Had they chosen to make it about 20 minutes shorter it might have been really good.7 out of 10 brave Spartans",7,3,7,20 March 2007
Fast Five," Somewhat failed attempt at popcorn
","Picking up the story where the previous one left off this one doesn't need much explaining story wise - the gang is still up to no good and using fast cars to do it. This time the scenery has changed to Southern America, Brazil to be exact.The theme of the films being fast cars, fast driving and action sequences galore this one does not fail to deliver. There's plenty of all of that. When it comes to adding something new to the series it does fail a bit though - it's just more of the same. Add to that the fact that most of the story is more than a little ludicrous and the end result is easily derived: if one is able to dislodge ones brain for the duration of the film then it can be enjoyed otherwise it can't.For me the turning point was the point where it became clear there were no characters to bond with. Every single one of them should be locked away for life. One can't care for characters like that - whether they live or die, escape or get caught, it doesn't matter. It makes the film flimsy and too easily forgotten.6 out of 10 corns not yet fully popped.",6,0,1,18 May 2011

She's still tossing and turning between Edward and Jacob, and that is starting to make less and less sense to the people watching the films but not reading the books (like me). Still, the story goes on. And, since it continues where the previous one left off, this one makes no sense when watched on its own.The film then. It starts slowly with the normal twisting and turning of the days - normal when you consider your boyfriend is a vampire and another friend you care about is a werewolf. All is well in the world, but there's something brewing just a few cities away. It looks like the start of something nasty, something that will have to be dealt with and that seems to be too big for the Cullen clan to handle on their own.This story is one of the two red lines through the film - the other one is the obvious love triangle between Bella and the two guys and convoluted as that one might seem it still isn't enough to fill the first half of the film - it's just too slow with too many long stretches of nothingness. The 2nd half the film picks up speed and becomes quite all right, but it doesn't make the film as a whole work out. It's not enough, even though it's enjoyable (if you're very bored).6 out of 10 sparkling vampires",6,3,6,26 July 2010
Click," Classic Twilight Zone material
","A workaholic finds himself in trouble handling all the different remotes in the house and sets out on a quest to find an universal remote so that he can get rid of all the other ones. What he finds is a little more than he bargained for - a universal remote control that remote controls his Universe. From there the film starts rolling. Armed with this new power he starts to amuse himself through life.From all the Adam Sandler films I've seen about 40% is good enough to be allowed into the cinema. I'm happy to say that this one is surely amongst those 40%. Click rages on, starting off quickly and not settling down until the end of it. It plays much like a classic Twilight Zone episode - highly moralistic, but fun, in a dark way.8 out of 10 out of control remote controls",8,0,1,3 October 2006
Pineapple Express," The adventures of two Stoners
","Much in the line of both Harold and Kumar films this film drives on the thought that the adventures of two constantly high guys can be fun. If you disliked the Harold and Kumar films, skip this one. If you liked them, see this one. Easy as that.It all starts when Dale Denton, excellently put down by Seth Rogen, comes back from his regular marijuana dealer and accidentally witnesses a murder happening. In his high fear he goes back to his dealer and tells him of what happened, and from there things start rolling. The events that happen are pretty typical - the regular things that would happen to two people that are out of their skull on weed and that are being chased by a murderer. Action sequences are followed by simple and sometimes successful attempts at humor and funny characters and all in all it works out pretty well.As the story continues on it goes further and further over the top and the grand finale had me in stitches for quite a bit of time. Add to that a good number of in-jokes in the form of references to other films and the ending result is there - some good laughs in a funny film that can be forgotten the moment you leave the cinema.7 out of 10 samples of weed",7,0,2,28 November 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Life, love and millionaires
","When a young guy from the slums of Mumbai makes his way to the final question in the TV quiz 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' there are people that are so doubtful of his sincerity that they have him arrested and interrogated - in their eyes there is no way he can know all the answers to the questions, so he has to be cheating. And as the film rolls on the question gets answered.The quiz is not the only red line running through the film - there are a few more things that keep re-appearing. And with each single explained moment in life the puzzle pieces connect better and in the end one knows what the truth behind everything is. Filmed as both drama and comedy it is intense yet light and able to leave a deeply set smile on the faces of most of the audience - yet the smile is a knowing one and there's a strong thought behind it.Few films are able to cause that effect and that's why this one is to be rated amongst the better ones - it's not brilliant and takes a few poetic turns here and there to make the story work out better, but it's good enough and to be remembered.8 out of 10 questions answered correctly",8,0,2,9 February 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Make it stop, please.
","Picking up where the previous one left of this one starts with several transformers living on earth, more or less at peace with human civilisation. This all changes when an old government secret is uncovered. From there on things start to get nasty and the world once again needs to be saved by the Megatron and his metallic friends.After seeing the second one I wasn't expecting too much of this one. Where the first one had a story and a decent amount of CGI the second one had no story and nothing but CGI. For some reason I was thinking this one couldn't be worse than that second one. But alas, it is.On the one side it offers what is to be expected - explosions and fire, and lots and lots of action sequences. On the other side it offers the return of some of the older characters - and a shipload of new ones. Now that wouldn't be too bad - if only they would fit in the story and would do what they were supposed to do. What I found more than mildly irritating for instance was the fact that the Sam Witwicky character had to start all over when it comes to trust from the government agencies.Add to that that at least one character was hopelessly miscast - Patrick Dempsey does not belong in this film, at least not in the role he plays, it doesn't suit him at all and it shows in the way it comes to the screen.Then it seems they tried to save the film by applying the old trick of opening a can of known actors/actresses in the hopes they can turn lead into gold. The trick never worked and it doesn't work in this one. What's Frances McDormand doing in this film? She can do a lot better. The same for John Malkovich. John Turturro is about the only big name that I can like in this film - but that's because he has a long history of odd little roles and the one he has in this film suits.Last but surely not least, the 3D. This can be described by asking one question: What 3D? There's next to none and where it is visible it doesn't add anything.So, all in all, an utter waste of celluloid.2 out of 10 robots no longer disguised",2,15,32,6 July 2011
The Simpsons Movie," Good stuff
","After many many years of waiting one of the worlds oldest animated families finally comes to the big screen. After an incredible number of episodes on the little screen it is hard to come with something good enough to feed a movie theaters audience for the length of a full size film, but, it can be said, this one does the trick.It all starts as Homer gets a pet pig and collects the pigs feces in a silo that he then flushes on a small lake. This small lake had been the victim of lots of pollution already and the silo is the proverbial drop that spills the bucket. And when the bucket spills it is time for drastic measures.As the story starts there is plenty of room for the little jokes we have learned to expect from The Simpsons series and there is more than enough room for the continuation of a story line that makes this film into a combination of two or three episodes of the series. It doesn't get better than a combination of episodes but I don't think that could even be expected from a series running as long as this one.There are a some small cameos by actors and other celebrities and all in all it is very true to the series and very enjoyable.One small hint: take the time to sit through the ending credits.9 out of 10 french fries covering up things",9,2,7,31 July 2007
The Godfather," Wow
","All right! Let me start by admitting that I should have watched this a long ago instead of waiting until now. Just never got around to it. The Godfather is probably one of those few films that everyone that has ever watched a film has at least heard about. The story of the aged leader of a mob family that transfers his powers to his son intermixed with the lives of the family members and their actions.Used as an example for a plethora of films that were to follow it, used as a starting point for games. It's been used for everything, but nothing and no one ever came close to touching this film. It's a work of art - a truly and completely compelling story worked into a great looking film with strong playing actors, making for a film that constantly breathes what is trying to depict: life with the mob.For the rest I have nothing to add. A true masterpiece that is yet to be outclassed. A true ground breaking film that sets standards for all others.10 out of 10 Italian accents",10,1,4,28 September 2007
