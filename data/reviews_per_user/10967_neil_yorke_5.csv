The Blair Witch Project," Nice Camera Work, Shame about the rest
","The Blair Witch promised so much, and in my opinion delivered very little. I tried to go into the cinema with an open mind, not pre-judging the film. I did however expect a eerie, unnerving film that would make me leave the cinema feeling slightly uneasy. This was simply due to the massive success it had received in the states. However it did not deliver any of the above aspects in my opinion.I felt that the use of hand held cameras did increase the sense of realism, and the acting from the cast is 100% perfect, there is nothing I can fault with them, they really gave across the feeling that they were completely in despair, not knowing where to go and what to do,this however could not cover up the problems with the film.There will be many people who will watch the film and enjoy it emensly, I suppose I have a tendency to analyze a film to much, maybe it stems from my vast movie watching experience.I just felt that it fell into to many of the classic horror movie cleches, which I would have though the writers would have tried to stay well away from, others may not notice them. I think my main problem was due to the fact that because they only have hand held camera, due to the fact that the film is supposed to have been made up from the recovered film reels, everything that you see has to be filmed by the actual film makers. This however raises problems, an example could be when one of the team is filming a disturbing scene and is screaming hysterically but still continues to film and also at one point actually zooms in on the subject. Is this really what a person would do, I imagine most people would turn and get the hell out as fast as humanly possible. I understand there is little you can do with scenes like this as there is no 3rd party filming, but they should have thought the scenes through better. You could have written it as thought they made a another film at the same time, the second being the film of themselves doing the documentary, this would have allowed scenes to be included which could have dealt with the previous scene.My only advice is to watch the film with an open mind, and try not to analyze to much, and you should be able to enjoy it as simply a medium thriller, if you are expecting the scariest movie since the exorcist then you are in for a big shock.",Null,0,1,13 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Amazing first instalment
","In 1977 a film opened in cinemas which was to change the way we looked at films, that was and still is Star Wars. 22 years latter and audiences are once again about to enter the exciting cinematic world of Star Wars with the cinema release of  Episode 1.Even though this film is new, and from the same writer and director it could never have the same movie impact which star Wars had thrust upon the public, the amazing special effects which previous to that film could only have been imagined in a small boys mind were now displayed for all to see.   What Episode 1 could bring to the audience was the beginning of a saga started many years before, to open a new chapter in the life's of the Skywalkers and of the force. Written and directed by George Lucas like the original Episode 1 is brimming with exoctic locations and far off worlds populated by strange creatures. The special effects may have becomes more life like but the film has trully kept it's story telling ability. It would have been very easy for the film makers to have ignored the true story line and to have concentrated on the special effects using them to hold the film together. What they have created is a film which in the words of Harrison Ford is ' Story telling with effects '. Episode 1 was always going to have one major draw back, what ever they did in the film the audience still knew the future of many of the characters, and those which they do not know exactly they will use their star wars minds to calculate the future paths of them. There will not be a person in the cinema who will not know the fate of Anakin Skywalker, and if there is then what are you doing watching this film, for it is obvious that you are not a fan.The only major problem for me was the fact that the technology has increased to such a level that there are of course many more creatures featured in this film that in the original 3.  What is concerning me is the flow of the film when placed together when all finished to create the complete 9 part film. The technology and effects will be of todays high quality and standards for the first 3 films, then reduce slightly to the 1977 quality and standard for the next 3 and then jump back to the same quality as the first 3 if not even better. I feel that is may affect the cinematic flow of the film when watched all together. In some ways I feel it may have been better to have blended some of the old techniques used in the original film ie actually using model instead of the large use of computer graphics with todays technology and then used the advanced work for the final 3 films. There will be many people who will think I have lost my mind, but I can assure you I'm completly sane, I'm just looking at this film from a technical point of view, and also as a Star wars fan.This film is the first in 9 films, and so has to set the scene the same as A New Hope had 22 years ago, if these films follow the same film style as the previous films, then we are to expect a much darker instalment from the second of the Prequels and then a lighter more fun third instalment. The first film has the hardest job, by having to introduce all of the characters, and to set the scene for the rest of the 8 instalments to come in the future.Overall I liked the look and feel of Episode 1 apart from the few minor concerns as outlined above, and as a star wars film I felt it had the right feel to it. If your a star wars fan and are looking for the answers then this is the film to watch. Keep you eyes open for the next installment and remember the force will be with you always.",Null,0,0,11 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," One of the greatest war films around.
","When is the life of one man, greater than the life's of 8. This is one of the issues raised in Steven Speilberg's great war epic ' Saving Private Ryan'.Set during the D Day invasion it follows 8 soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) who must venture behind enemy lines in order to find and retrieve Private James Ryan who's 3 brothers have been killed in action.There are many who have said that this film includes to much gore and over the top violence, and in some way I must agree. In any war not everyone will have parts of their bodies blown off, but equally the film is trying to destroy a myth that so many have that in some twisted way war is glamorous. The majority of war films will simply have a soldier shot and fall to the ground with a minimum of blood lost, if this were the case then there would not have been so many soldiers who returned from wars minus limbs.This film deals with many of the human aspects of war, similar in certain ways to ' The Thin Red Line ', soldiers are expected to obey orders without thought or question, no matter how impossible or crazy the orders may be.A solid cast hold this film together for 2hr 40minutes, with Tom Hanks well cast in the role of Captain John Miller and Mat Damon as Private James Ryan. Each and every one of the main actors in this film will stay in your mind after you have seen this film, and is because of them and Speilberg that this film is as good as it is. I feel Speilberg has dealt with a strong subject with the same level of sensitivity which was shown with 'Schindler's List ' it maybe painful to remember, but equally it is important not to forget the past or the same mistakes could be made again. No one should ever have to go through another war like that.If you are looking for a film with a strong story line, then I can think of none better than this, I don't think there can be a person alive who after watching this film will not look upon war in a completely different light, and remember the sacrifices which were made.",8,0,0,8 November 1999
The Matrix," The Film of the 90's
","'The Matrix' exploded on to our screens in June 99, and totally blew it audience away with it rich blend of special affects and story telling. It's one of the best films I have seen to date and I've seen quite a few. It's use of new special affect techniques allow never before seen images to amaze and bewilder you. The story revolves around a computer hacker named 'Neo' who is persuded by shadowy figures to help them capture a known terrorist, but as he is about to find out the truth is very much different than anything which he could have dreamed up. This film does what films have the best ability to do, which is transport you to another time and another place and allow you to view things as if you were actually there. It's a great way to escape the rigors of life for a few hours. The actors are all on top form and there are some memorable moments from some of the newer actors. I did however feel that on occations it did rely heavely on it's special affects, to hold it up but then in other parts there is real story telling. Overall a really good film which you will want to watch time and time again.",Null,0,0,22 December 1999
The Thin Red Line," A great war movie
","There are many aspect that make up a great war film. It is not enough to simply sit an audience down in a cinema and blast them with shells and death. War has never been black and white, you must alway strive to show the human aspects of war. The way in which it affects the solders and the villagers involved. ' The Thin Red Line ' captures all aspects perfectly, showing you the personalities of all the cast and delving into the mental aspects of both the front line troops and the commanders safely unfolding the battle from a distance. If you want to see war as it truly is then this is a film you want to see.",7,0,1,7 November 1999
