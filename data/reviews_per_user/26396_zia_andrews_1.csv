Hereditary," At last, a really good horror.
","I always rate every film I watch, but very, very rarely write a review, however, this film is definitely worthy.I love, love, love horror. No idea why. No one else in my family likes them, but I always have, from a very young age.I've seen some very good horrors, and some mediocre and some just plain awful, the mediocre and plain awful being the majority over the last few years, with the exception of World War Z. Zombie genre is definitely my go to, but so are possession films, The Exorcist being my first experience of one.So I have to say thank you to Ari Aster for writing and directing this film. The story was great (save maybe for the very last few minutes), although it is still worthy of a 10/10. The acting was also brilliant. Toni Collette was perfect in this role, but she always is in any role she takes on.As for the scares/horror factor, this film totally freaked me out. I jumped, hid behind my hands and even screamed (or should I say made a strange grunting sound), numerous times throughout. EXCELLENT - and a long, long time coming. TOP MARKS.And for any doubters of reviews out there who will possibly read mine, compare it to others and presume I'm somehow related to this film, as I do myself when I read reviews against some of the films I've watched, I can assure you I am writing this purely because I felt I had to. As I said before, I rarely write reviews, unless a film deserves/needs it.Give it a go. It's definitely worth it.",10,1,2,8 September 2018
