Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," i love this film!
","I saw this movie on opening night, but unfortunately I was disappointed. Two days later I was feeling a burning desire to go see it again. I felt, somewhere inside of me, that I had misjudged it, missed something... I went again on Friday night and I LOVED IT! I realize I was way too critical the first time I went. I was taking too much in at once and that distorted my view. The second time, I just sat back, relaxed, and enjoyed the ride. It was amazing! I highly recommend it.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
