Requiem for a Dream," Worst Movie Ever
","Some friends of mine rented this a while ago and raved on and on about how great it was, how the cinematography is beautiful, blah blah blah, all that usual stuff so i finally saw it, and i HATED HATED HATED this movie!! I've had several people tell me that KIDS is a terrible movie because all it does is depict a worst-case-scenerio, well that's exactly why this is such a terrible movie.  I actualy liked it untill the end, but the end is so horribly depraved and depressing that i hated this movie.  Don't get me wrong i'm all for 'non-Hollywood' endings for movies, but this was so bad. It's like the film makers tried so hard to make this a 'non-Hollywood' movie that they forgot to make a good movie.  I'd like to remind everyone that different does not neccesarily mean good.  If you like movies with weird endings that are sad or different from most, then go see AMERICAN BEAUTY, but if you want something that will make you wish you were dead then REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is you film.  I really can't believe hoe bad this movie was, it boggles my mind.",2,8,16,9 April 2002
Fight Club," first rule of FIGHT CLUB: don't give away the ending!!
","What is there to say about this movie that hasn't been said already?  I don't know, I really really really liked this movie, it's simply amazing. Pitt and Norton are great and they play off each other brilliantly.  the cinematography is beautiful and the violence is killer (not literally, but, well, yeah). It's also got an amazing score (courtesy of the Dust Brothers) and the Pixies' song 'Where Is My Mind?' during the final scene... perfect!!! see this movie NOW if you haven't all ready, and see it again soon if you have... one of the best films ever made!",10,0,1,9 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," this is a good movie
","I have a few friends who were really big Harry Potter fans so when the movie came out they were all a flutter about it.  When my girlfriend, who had just finished the first book, wanted to see the movie I agreed to go along.  I expected some cheesy Disney-esque kiddie film but was realy pleasantly suprised.  Because of this movie I have now read all four books in the series and as i reflect on the movie I really believe that it was an excellent adaptation of the book, having never read any of the books prior to seeing the movie i enjoyed it alot and i am looking forward to seeing it again now that i know the story better.  The characters and their respective actors were excellently chosen, Alan Rickman as Snape was a really good choice in my opinion.  The only real problem i had with the movie as compared to the book was that in reading the book I got a much darker feeling so when the movie was so bright and cheery i found it a little odd, but other than that i think it was a great book/movie translation.  I'm sure that there are a number of Potter heads (hahaha) that will say thing were left out of the movie, but of course they were, there's no way to fit all the story line of the book into a movie and still have it short enough to hold the attention span of its target audience, as it was the movie seemed a little long for yournger Potter fans.  I am really looking forward to the rest of the movies in the series especialy Prisoner Of Azkaban and Goblet Of Fire and the next book.  If you want to see a really good movie that the whole family will enjoy this is the movie for, well, anyone.",9,0,0,18 April 2002
Am√©lie," Fabuleux to say the least
","This film was great, one of the best i've ever seen, the story telling was brilliant, i loved the way it was told like a childrens' story since Amelie is kind of a child in the film.  Not like any movie i've ever seen before, i highly reccomend this to anyone that enjoys good movies, i was a little wary of it at first since it's French and foreign films tend to make me wonder what the insides of my wrists look lokie (because they're DEPRESSING) but this is a really really good movie, i can't use enough superlatives with this... and Amelie is soooo cute, i wanted to take her home with me... mmm french women...",9,0,1,18 April 2002
Donnie Darko," Do you even know who Graham Greene is? I think we've all seen 'Bonanza!'
","OH my god! this movie is... amazing! i love it! the first movie i've liked this much since the Royal Tenebaums (wait a minute DD came out BEFORE RT, ah ha, but i saw RT in the theatres and i just recently rented DD). This movie is awesome, it really is, it's got everything you could want in a film, humor, mystery, mayhem and a giant evil bunny rabbit. think 'Harvey' gone horribly wrong, but still really really good! i've had it for like three days and i've seen it like 3 times already. yeah, it's that good, it's just a little on the confusing side, but hey! so was 'Memento' and that's amazing, too! in addition to being a great movie, 'Donnie Darko' is a rarity in the movie world by being a double threat, not only is the movie amazing, but the music for it is great, too! With a score reminicent of AIR's 'Virgin Suicides' work mixed with some interesting 80's tracks (Echo & the Bunnymen's 'Killing Moon' is a brilliant opening track, the school sequence set to Tears for Fears is stunning, and the closing track are all amazing). If you haven't seen this yet, i highly reccomend it to anyone who likes wierd movies that make you think.",9,0,0,25 June 2002
