Hereditary," Brings hope back to the horror genre
","It goes without saying that the majority of horror films out nowadays rely on cheap, tacky jumpscares to emit any fear into its audience. Which is why it is so refreshing to see a movie where it's most terrifying scenes rely on brilliant camerawork, sound queues, and acting. The two or three 'jumpy scares' are still cleverly presented and with reason. This movie had my stomach churning with horrifying, disturbing imagery and saw me incredibly tense throughout most of the runtime, and Im happy to say I couldn't predict any plot aspects. One of the final sequences in the film was quite definitely one of the scariest I have ever seen. There are of course some flaws; the film is rather slow paced, especially the second act, and at times very monotone. However this does get to show off the incredible acting that really does drive this movie. Toni's performance is phenomenal, and everyone else does a great job. Wolff is brilliant but definitely has potential to grow.Overall I am extremely happy this movie exists. This is the movie the horror genre needed to redeem itself.",9,2,4,29 June 2018
