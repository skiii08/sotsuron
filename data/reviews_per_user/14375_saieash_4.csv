The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Extremely underrated - solid movie
","To be honest, I initially didn't expect much from this film - I had just finished watching the Harry Potter movies and I was just craving some extra Watson so I picked up this film and I absolutely loved it. And while I am being honest, there is something missing from the film, I don't know what exactly it is, maybe it was a second too long or needed a bit more music, maybe the plot was just a tiny bit thin, I don't know. All I know is, if it did have that extra bit, it would be extremely difficult not to give it a 10/10. All the actors were extremely solid especially the two leads - Watson did exceptionally well in my opinion. You always fear when a actor you have known to play one character acts in something different, you will always see them as the old character - but that didn't happen here at all. She perfectly slipped into this new role and does a great American accent. It is great to see her playing other roles and being able to act in other roles without playing a character with the same personality as your old character like other actors do. Overall this is a solid movie and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a high school romantic comedy type movie.",9,1,2,28 July 2014
500 Days of Summer," Boring, Long and Dead
","Before I watch any movie I usually check the reviews, and as this had extremely positive reviews I thought it would be a great watch because they are usually in the correct direction - but this time it was completely wrong. I'll start off with the good points of the movie: it seemed like a lot of though and planning went into putting this together - it felt cohesive and flowed pretty well. The cinematography was great and had a really nice tone to it. Now that I have finished all the good things about this movie now on to all the bad. This movie has absolutely no plot - it feels like someone aimlessly walking around for a couple of hours and then sits down for an ending. This movie is completely dead & devoid of any emotion. The movie is way longer than it should have been and it just take too long to get to the end which is not great anyway. i really don't understand how it got such high rating with such a dead movie. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you are really bored.",4,2,5,28 July 2014
Ender's Game," Don't watch for people who have read the book
","I have read the book and absolutely loved it. This movie is the exact opposite - and I strongly believe it will be the same for anyone else who has read the book. Even if you haven't read the book, you probably won't like it anyway. There was just way too many plot points that were cut out, rearranged, raced through and mashed together to make it fit into a movie length. In my opinion, they would need at least 2 movies to cover the book properly - and I think that is the main problem here. The film felt like they only read every 10th page of the book and then occasionally they would skip a chapter or two. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has read the books and is a major disappointment. I know I am comparing heavily to the book, but I think most people watching this film would have read the book. If you are one of the few who haven't, I recommend you don't watch this - the book is on another completely different level and you time and money is better spent reading the book.",1,3,6,3 July 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Boring Mashup of Rubbish
","I don't think I have seen a worse movie in recent memory. Even the Superman movie that came before this was significantly better and that was rubbish. This is just a few of the many problems I had with this movie. This movie dragged on for too long, spent too much time setting up for future movies and the justice league, doesn't show or even explain the shift in Batmans character, plenty of plot loop holes and character behavior which wasn't consistent with that character, the action scenes were boring at best with plenty of shaky cam, dragged on for way too long in the first half of the movie and consequently the second half felt rushed, exactly 0 cinematography and just very little if any entertainment value in this film. There is a point in most movies where you really start to get invested and really interested in a movie, I didn't get that to that point even after the credits finished. The parts that did really excite me was the cameo appearances on the TV News - to me that just gives an aroma of realism which is really great. Apart from that, there was not much I liked about this movie at all. This just should have been done better. It almost feels like they have put effort to make this film boring.",3,1,2,12 August 2016
