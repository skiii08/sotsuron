Ali," Surfing movie
","Watching 'Ali' was like surfing -- several long waits of nothing happening interrupted by a few incredible rushes.Mann got many things right: the tone, the balance of a complicated life, and great work from the actors. But there are many frustrating slow scenes. I looked at my watch twice in the first half-hour of the movie, and twice during the ten-minute sequence of Ali running in Kishasha, which was a self-indulgent piece of under-edited crud. 'Look, everybody, it's REALLY Africa!'We aren't allowed to detect the drama of this moment, we're going to have every single emotion forced through Will Smith's face and body language. Too much. Exploring character does not mean devoting several hundred frames of film to a tight focus on the protagonist's tortured features. In Ali's case, much of that attempt to show him thinking could have been skipped.There were several much better scenes demonstrating character -- the byplay with Cosell, a fascination with termites on TV while Malcolm X has come to tell him something important, or walking away, momentarily silencing his motor mouth in bitter anger at someone else's lack of confidence.Other pacing oddities riddle the movie. We get to see every single bullet coming straight at Malcolm X's POV, but we're at a medium distance when Ali publicly voices his political concerns about the Vietnam war, wrapped up in one 20-second news conference. This is the emotional center of the film, and all of a sudden we're ten rows back?Timing issues aside, Will Smith finally fulfills the dramatic promise he made years ago in 'Six Degrees of Separation,' living into a complex character who is both charismatic and human. I haven't seen all the competing performances this year, but his could easily be in the top five. Great job on sustaining the soft Kentucky cadence. Most of the supporting performances are excellent as well.But for a character study (with good places to hit fast-forward), you could wait for the rental. There are not enough visuals in here to make you rush to the big screen. A couple of the lighting choices are overdone (wow...everyone's BLUE!). I thought the boxing sequences were effective; Mann puts you right in the middle of the action without the cheat of too much slo-mo. But they would be nothing unusual for people who already watch a lot of boxing, and for people who don't like or watch boxing, it will be just as painful as you always thought.Final hint: if you're taking anyone with you under 40, sit together ahead of time for half an hour and review the history highlights of Ali's life. Without that, you might not keep up with the story at all...my 14-year-old nephew couldn't even figure out who had won the Ali-Frazier fight!",7,0,0,28 December 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Hype-powered (slight spoiler)
","The performances are good. Christopher Walken is himself, and even when he's sympathetic, he's odd. The movie looks clean. But for a caper/con movie, it's very slow.(Spoiler) Also, the movie suffers from the typical neat Spielberg coda where 'Poof! Now he's happily married and a millionaire!' Kind of like Mike Milken, Ivan Boesky and (soon to be) Enron, Adelphia and WorldCom figures who bilk little people for millions, serve almost no time, and come out ready to restart with all their cronies. I'm all for redemption, but without the context of the interceding years, this amounts to glamorizing grand theft and fraud. I'm sure the facts are true, but they didn't belong in the movie. Unless the director is making an expensive lesson advising his (and my) children that crime can pay if you're just clever enough.",6,6,14,1 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'All that glitters...'
","I first devoured these books when I was 10, and I have read them seven or eight times since. The inhabitants and issues of Middle Earth are important friends from my childhood, and the trilogy's sensibilities are part of my adult makeup. The full quote 'All that glitters is not gold, not all those who wander are lost,' has been an apt theme for my life. (Since the quote is not in the movie, I'm sure only the readers are reading on at this point!)Which is all to suggest that the bar was pretty high for me in these movies. And it is with a very deep sense of gratitude and relief that I can say the Fellowship of the Ring has passed...summa cum laude.I reject the most effusive commentary here. I've only just seen the film, and just seen it once, so whether or not it surpasses Citizen Kane, or whatever is being implied, is premature. However, it is as fully realized a vision as I could have demanded.For the book lovers, the movie will not have the same rich detail and nuance. But it shows and tells the story masterfully. The upwriting of Arwen Evenstar's role is seamless and well-played by the very young actress. In fact, all of the casting is astounding, especially Bilbo, Gimli, Gandalf, Saruman, Boromir, Galadriel and Samwise. And the actors live into their characters well.The least successful for me is Frodo. Elijah Wood is excellent, but too young. Throughout the film Frodo is shown as the holy innocent, while in the book he is an eccentric bachelor approaching middle age, a generation older than his hobbit companions. Maybe this is just important to me as self-description...but then maybe it was important to Tolkien too. Adventures do not happen only to the young.In any case, this was probably an inevitable casualty of a moviemaker's responsibility to sell tickets, but it changes the story just a little. To Jackson's and Wood's credit, a bit of the steel (or mithril) in Frodo's character begins to assert itself at the very end of the movie...but it is a bigger part of the book from the beginning. I trust it will be an important part of the other two films.But that's a quibble. One other quibble is that the mallorn woods of Lorien were too dark. But overall I thought the special effects in the movie showed true vision and excellent craftsmanship. All the details of plot that really matter are presented in a logical and manageable, if rapid scale. The characterizations have been well written. I didn't really notice the score or shots much, but I tend to catch those things on second viewings with any movie.I thought the back-story synopsis at the beginning was genius, a far better way to exploit the medium than having Gandalf and Frodo talking it all over in front of the fire. It throws us right into Middle Earth, a place where history is never far below the soil.Mr. Jackson et al.: thanks for showing the entire birthday party, right down to the Proudfeet. Thanks for containing both Aragorn and Strider in one man, and hats off to Viggo Mortenson for surpassing my expectations. Thanks for allowing a 3,000-year-old elf to look ageless, even at the risk of confusing the non-reader audience. Thanks for those waterfalls in Rivendell, and for bringing Orthanc and Moria to life. Thanks for distinguishing the Uruk-Hai (in fact, I think the movie does this better than the book...making me look forward to The Two Towers a lot). Thanks for Gwaihir's flight. Thanks for using so much of New Zealand, already familiar to me as the planet's most beautiful place.I have a long list of other things I'm grateful for...but I'm going to be too busy heading out for a second viewing!",10,0,0,19 December 2001
District 9," I dare some of the naysayers to try it again
","First, I've barely played any video games, so please don't dismiss this comment as those of an impressionable youngster. I'm middle-aged. I loved Blade Runner, Alien, Terminator etc. in their (my) time.Which is one reason I loved this film. It is one of the most original, non-derivative science fiction movies I've seen produced in at least half a generation. The central character is compelling and the actor holds your attention through comedic and tragic moments.What is this movie? A sci-fi, love-story, epic, buddy-movie social commentary.Honestly, I read hundreds of the negative postings trying to understand that point of view but I just can't. I sympathize with those who get nauseous watching hand-held (not a problem for me). Otherwise, the vast majority commenting seem to have missed basic plot points, missed all the dry humor, and missed a great film--one that will be setting the pace and style for another half-generation or so ahead (unfortunately for these detractors!).",10,2,6,5 September 2009
Shrek the Third," Mostly enjoyable
","Just caught it on HBO. I was a fan of the first two movies but never found time to see this one in the theater. I have to say it was a lot more fun than the average poster seems to say...but maybe watching it at home is different.I'm surprised no poster has mentioned the gingerbread man's life flashing before his eyes, complete with bionic legs. That made me laugh out loud. There are other moments to cherish, including a pair of geeks at the high school, the dronkeys playing with their dad, and above all the Disney heroines morphing from their long-suffering roles as passive victims into a bra-burning assault squadron. There's enough subtext rolling by to make this film well worth the time.",8,2,3,22 June 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Wow, that was bad (very slight spoiler).
","My expectations were low. I've liked Will Ferrell's brand of soft-edged mania well enough in the past, but not enough to go see a movie just because he's in it. I went because I remember San Diego in the 1970's, and even the network news in that sleepy city in that era.As I say, my expectations were low, and I was still very disappointed. I realize it's the 14-year-old inside this was aimed at, not my 41-year-old outside -- but I know a lot of teenagers, and none of them are stupid enough to enjoy this. The script was atrocious, even when you're not bothering to score for plot. Most of the jokes and set pieces were lame -- even 'Afternoon Delight' fell flat. The performances were no better. Will Farrell was not much more than present. I've seen him show more heart in SNL sketches, or even as the cop on the trail in the Jay and Silent Bob movie. Fred Willard, so brilliant in Best in Show, looked sad and tired. Most strangely, the comedy casting at the center was deeply flawed. Two of the three sidekicks were worthless: just...not...funny. Not even for one second. Steve Carell was funny, or at least absurd, for about five seconds. You know you're watching a bad movie when the senseless cameos and animal dialogs are the only things you can summon up as enjoyable memories. Waste no money or time on this turkey!",3,62,109,17 July 2004
The Matrix," Deserves its attention, but it won't last
","The visual style is terrific, and the story sucks you in well enough if you can get around the (under-exposed) primary premise. The mythic allusion and religious allegory is all-just-sort-of-OK. No one is going to emerge from this movie with a much deeper view of life or anything.It's hard to root for Keanu Reeves, whose choppy pace can interrupt any good story for me, but it's undeniable that he pulls this one off. Everyone who usually holds their nose and steers clear of a project because he's in it, go ahead and go.Personally, I wasn't too thrilled with the dialogue or the other performances, and the soundtrack did most definitely suck. But as eye-candy this ranks high. Find the biggest screen near you.",8,0,0,10 April 1999
