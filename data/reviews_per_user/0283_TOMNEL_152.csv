The Avengers," It's sort of entertaining, but dramatically uninteresting and shallow.
","These Marvel comics obviously have a lot of fans, and apparently whatever it was that fans (and many non-fans) were looking for in a Marvel film was fulfilled here, explaining the huge internet buzz, the vast amounts of money this has made, and it's current spot in the top 50 films of all time on the Internet Movie Database. This movie does have expensive looking action, and some comedic bits with lots of superheroes, but what it's missing is...pretty much everything else. The plot is uninteresting and quite honestly stupid, and nothing really is driving this story along. At times, to me, it grew boring, because there was nothing to get excited about besides action, big stars and comedy.After Norse god Loki steals the powerful potential super weapon 'Tesseract' from the peace keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. agency, and mind controls a few people, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) puts together a team of superheroes known as the Avengers, made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and eventually Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Loki is in cahoots with a group of aliens called the Chitauri, and plans to help them take over Earth. The Avengers must stop fighting with each other in order to protect the Earth...can they do it, or will the Earth be destroyed? (Take a guess).Director Joss Wheddon, known for his work on television series, does a fine job with the direction when it comes to action. The big action scenes are appropriately frenetic, and they look big and shiny. I appreciated that the action scenes were spaced apart from each other also, as to not overkill the action like the Transformers films. The fighting scenes between the Avengers was a bit overkill however. Half the movie is them disagreeing with each other, or Tony Stark being snarky with everyone. These scenes don't really have anything to them either. They aren't exciting. They are meant to be funny, but oftentimes comes off as more infantile in the humor department than anything else. They further the plot along, only in that the plot cannot proceed until these guys stop fighting. These scenes are supposed to work as character development, but it's almost unbelievable how stupid these guys are, and how unwilling they are to put their differences aside.The middle of the movie takes place on a ship, with the Avengers angry at each other, and this whole section of the movie just meanders. You could say that this part of the movie gives us the character conflicts and whatnot, which it does, but the Avengers' dislike of each other could have been introduced in something more important to the plot, instead of practically stopping the plot to have these guys get angry at each other. And that's really the movie's biggest problem is the plot. There's never really a feeling of dread, or that something bad could happen, and it's hard to care about anything that's happening. That's not to say watching Tony Stark bantering isn't amusing, or watching Bruce Banner go insane as the Hulk isn't interesting, but nothing ever truly feels at stake. When the film decides to kill off a character to add some level of emotion, and serve as a reason for these heroes to stop their childishness, it doesn't work on an emotional level. It comes off as a cheap way to further along the plot. The Avengers has some good elements to it. It's got a lot of charisma in the cast, and each character is given enough screen time I suppose. The action scenes are satisfying mostly, and some of the comedy isn't bad (while some does come off as a bit corny and pandering to the audience). The problem is the plot, where the villains never really come off as menacing, despite possessing a super weapon, and a main villain is Loki who is about as threatening as a teddy bear. There's nothing to the film, and nothing to really love about it, unless you are a big fan of these actors, the comics, or explosions. There's very little below the surface of the film, and without a good plot to move this along, we've essentially got one long Avengers origin story. Apparently many have fallen in love with this though, so if you like your movies big, dumb and full of buff dudes, you'll probably like this one quite a bit.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 140 mins. PG-13 for action violence.",6,4,14,16 July 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A big improvement over the first.
","Stars: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, Gordon Lui, Michael Parks, Larry Bishop, Bo Svenson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeannie Epper, Sid Haig and Perla Haney Jardine.This is an excellent movie in every way. It's about ex assassin Beatrix Kiddo going to kill the last two assassins, Budd (Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) and then kill Bill. The reasons that I enjoyed this over the last is that this movie puts action and style second to good writing and character development, yet it still has great style. Where the first was a Japanese action movie, most of this is like a Spagetti Western. The first film was more like a hard core action flick, where this one had some time to breathe in between, and was more like 'Jackie Brown' in it's quietness but still very entertaining. Some other positives are Gordon Lui who played a different tole in Kill Bill 1. He plays her teacher Pei Mei in a long flashback. Michael Parks is also very good as Bill's 80 year old pimp father figure.My rating: 10/10 stars. 138 mins. rated R for violence, language and drug use.",10,2,4,29 June 2006
Black Swan," This is a very well done film in almost every respect, except for the story.
","Director Darren Aronofsky knows what he's doing, as does actress Natalie Portman, and pretty much everyone else in this film. These people are artists who take this material and transform it into something beautiful. The script is good too, when it comes to dialogue and character development. But, the real question is, does this plot need to be told? The story of a woman becoming mentally unhinged has been told numerous times before, and in some films (Mulholland Dr.) the story actually was quite similar. Now, I'm not saying we need all original films, because at this point, that's near impossible to find, but the question this film raised was 'Why was this made?' Perhaps to show the beauty of the dance, or maybe to show how stressful dance is on the dancers...hard to tell. The simplistic nature of the plot layout bumped this down a notch for me, but it still stands as one of the best of 2010 for every other aspect of the film.Nina (Natalie Portman) finally is able to live her dream out and play the Swan Princess in her dance company's production of Swan Lake, but she isn't tapping into her dark swan enough. The movie follows this character's descent into darkness, and into insanity. The performances here were fantastic. Natalie Portman definitely should be a front runner for the Oscar for this one, because she comes off as very believable. Many good actresses would play the role well, but not be able to pull off gaining empathy from the audience. Portman is walking a tight rope here playing a character bordering on irritatingly passive, and then frustratingly aggressive and uncaring, and she still can pull in the audience to care for her, and that's a skill. Mila Kunis gave a fine performance, and Barbara Hershey was good, but the other standout performance was Vincent Cassel as the dance instructor. He's another character that is hard to figure out. Is he a complete jerk, or is he doing what he does for a legitimate reason? Either way, Cassel was great.The direction was stellar. The staging was excellent, and the camera felt like an actual player in this film. Never did we get static and boring shots. Everything was alive, and the camera-work, staging and direction was a large part of that. In it's own grungy looking way, the film also looked beautiful. It was more gritty than most nowadays, but it gave it an atmospheric style that only worked to help it. Now, the problem arises in the writing, but not in the dialogue, or the character motivations, or any kind of logic flaw. The dialogue was all natural enough, and the pace flowed nicely. This film just felt like there was nothing to get out of it. Nina wanted perfection, and she was going crazy, with interludes of ballet and talking...that's what this film is. There's very little to it, and perhaps more could have been done with the mental breakdown itself, because here, it just made it look like Nina was crazy from the start, period. And she really had no reason to go insane. She was doing all this to herself. I'm not one who believes films should all have a message, but at least this film should have had a purpose to tell this story. The story itself had very little new in it, though certainly many elements were fresh in it. It's almost like the purpose of this film is to show dancing, and a woman going crazy, and nice choreography along with good music. It's hard to place what makes this film not as great as it could be, but it definitely lies in the plot. It lies in a lack of subtlety in the breakdown itself, and a lack of motivation in the plot. This same plot has been told, and why should we care more this time? Other than this underlying feeling that there needed to be something more, this was an excellent film.The Black Swan boasts excellent direction, performances, choreography, and an interesting look into our protagonist's very disturbed little mind. The problem with the film is the familiarity of this plot layout, and the lack of anything new to the 'woman's mental breakdown' plot (other than the ballet aspect). But, if one can forgive that aspect of the film, then this film does indeed reach near-perfection.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 105 mins. R for sexuality, violence, drug use and language.",9,2,5,20 January 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," So hilarious, yet so wrong!!!
","Starring Sacha Baron Cohen.This movie left a lasting impression on me that most don't. Not because anything extremely important was said, but because this was so funny. This movie was nonstop funny, and quite consistently hilarious. The plot of the film is that a TV reporter from third world country Kazakhstan, Borat, is going to America to film a documentary on how to renovate his country. An amazing thing that Sacha does with this character is he manages to make him extremely likable, but meanwhile he is a huge racist, chauvinist, anti-Semite and is just plain politically incorrect. Borat along with a partner Kazakhstani go around clueless learning what to do and what not to do. My favorite scene in the film is one at an etiquette school, where Borat shows pictures of his son's genitals and poops in a bag. You don't want to miss this very wrong, but oh so hilarious 'documentary'.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 81 mins. Rated R for Full frontal nudity, Language, Crude Humor and Sexual Content.",9,3,11,11 November 2006
Antz," A really clever movie, that actually reaches all ages.
","Stars: Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Christopher Walken, Jane Curtin, Jennifer Lopez, and Danny Glover.This is a clever comedy that was one of the first of it's kind...an animated movie that's fairly kid friendly, but also geared towards adults. This film is about worker ant Z, that wants to be a soldier ant, but picks the wrong time to switch with his friend Weaver (Stallone). He ends up in a war with the termites, these huge acid spewing creatures, and gets trapped in a hole in the ground becoming the only surviving ant. The film ends off where he kidnaps the princess, and trouble ensues. This is one of the best computer animated movies of the late 90's! It may scare little kids because it is quite violent.My rating: ***1/2 out of ****. 81 mins. PG for Some animated violence and Language.",9,0,1,1 August 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Does a good job of what it's trying to do.
","stars: Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Lui, Kevin Chamberlain, Oliver Davis, Robert Forester and Danny Aiello.This is one of those films that REALLY tries hard to put in snappy and funny dialog like Pulp Fiction did, and they do that in this film and it mostly works. The performances in this film were all really good, especially Ben Kingsley in a role as a Rabbi mobster and Stanley Tucci as the corrupt FBI man. The problem with the film is that it is unfolded in a confusing way where you don't know exactly what is happening until it is explained at the end of the film. It might annoy you, which it did to me, but I enjoyed just watching these guys perform. The plot (or what you are lead to believe is the plot) is that hit-man Mr. Goodkat (Willis) kills a man named Nick, and Slevin (Hartnett) happened to be staying at Nick's place and is called in by two mobsters both that hate each other (Freeman and Kingsley) that believe he is Nick and they want him to pay him money that Nick owes them and kill each other's loved ones. Meanwhile Slevin meets Nick's neighbor Lindsey (Lui) and is being watched by FBI agent Brikowski (Tucci). The plot unfolds about 50 zillion secrets and twists and turns along the way which I won't reveal, so go see it. I recommend it! My rating-3/4 stars. 105 mins. Rated R for strong violence, sexuality including nudity and language.",7,2,9,9 April 2006
Requiem for a Dream," An emotional, very stylish look at drug use.
","'Requiem for a Dream' is not an uplifting film in any way. Nor does it have a traditional story line, so if you don't like movies like that, then don't watch this. If you're looking for a good drama, this is it. I felt glued to the screen at times.Four people live their lives addicted to drugs. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict and lets the drug take over everything. His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) loves her boyfriend, but she'll do anything for the drugs. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) is a friend of Harry, who wants to live the way his mother wanted him to, but can't quit the substances either. Sara Goldfarb, played by the wonderful Ellen Burstyn, is the mother of Harry, and just wants to lose some weight. She begins an addiction to diet pills, and a dream to be on a TV infomercial. All four of these stories are sad, and all four are amazingly written and acted. Ellen Burstyn is the stand-out actress. Every scene she was in, I was sucked in. Her acting is amazing in this. The direction is great, and the cinematography is beautiful.This great drama reaches near perfection, and should be touted as a classic, as it seems to be by it's cult following.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. R for sexuality, language, drug use and violence.",9,2,3,13 March 2008
3:10 to Yuma," A good movie with a simple story.
","You don't usually see westerns like this. This was a slow moving film, with some action, but mostly dialog, and it was very entertaining. Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) and his band of loyal men are tough and evil guys. When Ben is caught and escorted on horseback to the 3:10 train to Yuma by a group of men including Dan Evans (Christian Bale), Wade's men stop at nothing to get their boss back. Dan Evans is a farmer that needs to get Mr. Wade to the train to Yuma to get $200 so he can keep his farm. It's a very straightforward film with a really standard plot (obviously seen before in the original), and it's also very slow. The slow plot helps it. It's one of the few films where we get to know the good guys and bad guys as actual characters. I was interested the entire time and though I personally didn't like the ending that well, it still worked. I highly recommend this for fans of westerns or just good movies.My rating: *** out of ****. 114 mins. R for violence.",8,1,3,8 September 2007
The Longest Yard," Really stupid movie.....one of Sandler's best!!!
","Longest Yard-Adam Sandler, Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell, Chris Rock, Nelly, Bob Sapp, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Eddie Bunker, Terry Crews, Tracey Morgan, Cloris Leachman and Courtney Cox Arquette.Let me just say, this is a stupid movie. Here's my summary first, then my review. Former quarter back Paul Crue(Sandler) steals and crashes his girlfriend's(Arquette) car and goes to prison. He makes friends with the care taker(Rock) and another former football player(Reynolds). The warden(Cromwell) makes Crue play football against the guards or go to jail for life. Soon the warden puts a spy in to find out their football plans. The spy puts a bomb on a radio in Crue's cell, but Caretaker goes in to give him a present and catches on fire and dies. This makes them play harder and they win the game.My review: 3/5 stars. This was so unbelievably stupid, but was entertaining enough to get 3 stars. Rock annoyed me with his instant energy and I was pleased that he was missing from the second half. Not my cup o' tea but it might be yours.PG-13 for nonstop fart and poo-poo humor, language, some mild sexual innuendo and some bloody violence.",6,0,2,2 July 2005
Skyfall," More than anything else, this film is just pleasant to the senses!
","It's doesn't seem like the highest praise to say the best part of a movie is the music or the look over anything else, but here it works quite well. This is a great looking movie with good music, and a drive to all the scenes that make it exhilarating. The plot is what moves the film along, and a sub-plot about an attempted assassination of M (Judi Dench) adds what some consider an emotional depth to the film, but what this movie is really about is James Bond fighting villains and going through beautiful locations, and that's works perfectly fine here!James Bond (Daniel Craig) is seemingly back from the dead after a misstep on M's part, and now has to stop a computer hacking madman (and former agent), Silva (Javier Bardem), from using his skills to wreak havoc and enact revenge on M. There is a sweetness to the scenes between M and Bond, almost playing like a subdued mother/son relationship at times. It's nice that Bond is on a mission here that is somewhat personal to him, so that it feels like it's not just another job. But the character development and interplay isn't what this is about...it's about the action.The action here is great. The fight scenes are well filmed, and cinematographer Roger Deakin takes full advantage of all the locations and awesome sets. The movie from beginning to end looks great! Turn off the sound, ignore the plot, and still this would entertain and thrill on a purely visual level. Add the music, and it's even better. Thomas Newman provides a fun score, using the typical Bond motifs and themes, while also adding it's own unique character. The ladies are sexy (especially Berenice Marlohe), and James Bond is cool. The guy has very few lines relative to how much screen time he has, but instead opts out in huge amounts of dialogue in favor of walking around like he's the coolest guy on Earth. And this is what works best about the film. Bond is awesome, and the places he goes are awesome, and of course, he also has a nice strong villain here in Mr. Bardem. The guy just has a menacing look!The cinematography, locations, music, action scenes and overall look of the film make this a very solid Bond film. It has a plot about a computer hacker, and M being threatened, and the plot is pretty good for a Bond film, but it's the whole visual experience that make this one to watch. There's never a dull moment, and even if there was, your eyes would be popping out of their head looking at the well filmed sets. It's thoroughly entertaining, and has enough pathos to make us care how the story turns out.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. PG-13 for violence and brief sexuality.",9,2,10,25 November 2012
50 First Dates," Slightly more charming than most Sandler pic's, but that's not saying much.
","Adam Sandler is known for making goofy comedies, where he acts silly, and rude, and somehow this still charms the viewing public. I've come to realize the likability of Sandler's character does not make his movies any better, considering his most likable character was in 'Little Nicky' and that was a terrible picture. However, he is slightly more likable here, than in most of his other movies, and though this is a dumb, and not extremely funny comedy, it has a charm to it, somewhat from him, but more from Drew Barrymore who plays a good lead to level out Adam's goofiness.Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a player, and constantly gets with women, only to lie to them to get out of the relationship. One day, when eating breakfast, he meets a girl named Lucy (Drew Barrymore) who he falls for. He soon comes to realize that she has only a short term memory from an accident she had, and she forgets everything after the accident after every day. He tries to win her over everyday, and mildly amusing comedy ensues.As I've mentioned already, Adam Sandler was okay in this one, but nothing special for him. His character is better than in some of his films, but it's still his typical smart Alec jerk. Drew Barrymore is sweet and works well with Sandler, but she doesn't bring anything huge to the project. Her father is played by gravely voiced Blake Clark, and her brother is played by Sean Astin who has gone from a hobbit to a steroid junkie with a lisp, and both of these actors are good. Rob Schnieder plays Sandler's friend who works with him at the zoo, and he can be pretty annoying, but he makes little kids laugh. Finally, there's Dan Aykroyd who's in this for some reason playing the doctor that helps Lucy. He's not in much of it, and his jokes are pretty stupid.This is slightly above most of Sandler's other films, but it still only manages to reach mediocrity.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for language, crude and sexual humor.",6,1,2,17 May 2008
The Hangover," An R-rated 'teen' comedy that actually has some sort of heart...finally!
","In recent years, Judd Appatow has become a major influence on comedy films. His R-rated films that he directs and produces are what seems to be in style, comedy movie-wise. Despite Appatow's popularity, his films all seem to have one major flaw, and that's his characters. Seth Rogen has yet to play a likable character, and never in any recent R-rated comedies, do we actually get the consistent feeling that people care for each other. The Hangover, along with being a dirty comedy, also contains likable characters, and heart. It's a refreshing addition to recent R-rated comedy films.Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) are friends going to Vegas for their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party. Also going along is Doug's odd soon to be brother in law, Alan (Zach Galifianakis). After a wild night, the guys have forgotten what happened the night before, and Doug is missing. They have to follow various clues to figure out how they got to where they were, where Doug is, and various other amusing plot points.It's hard to label this film. It's not really a sex-comedy, as there's not any overabundance of sex. It's not a drug comedy, because these guys aren't drug addicts, and the night before it not entirely their fault. It's more of just a comedy about 4-guys that happens to be rated R because of it's foul language and occasional nudity. It's nice to have an R rated comedy not out here to push the limits of the R-rating. Really, this is like the buddy comedy family film of rated R motion pictures.The actors are great, and have a lot of chemistry together. Zack Galifianakis as Alan is really the one who brings most of the laughs with his performance as a complete moron, who's out of touch with reality, but completely likable. These guys may be profane and goofy, but they're still normal guys...again something Seth Rogen doesn't like to perform as. He always has to be angry.There are a few problems in the film. It's got some spots that are missing laughs, and Mike Tyson is quite a bad actor, but aside from those, it's actually a well done buddy comedy and mystery. The box office has been gracious to this film, as well it should have been, and hopefully this R-rated comedy will show other producers of R-rated comedies, that comedies can still be successful even if the characters are likable (Amazing but true).My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. R for some sex jokes, full frontal nudity, language and some drug use.",8,2,6,15 July 2009
Marie Antoinette," One drawn out shot after another...it looks good, but just drags on and on.
","Marie Antoinette has never been a sympathetic character in the history books, and it's always been said that she deserves what came to her for spending too much money and being arrogant. In this reinvisioning (or perhaps it's partially how it actually happened) Antoinette just becomes a relateable and somewhat likable character. Sofia Coppola decided to make this feel more modern by adding contemporary music, and this might make the queen more relateable. But instead, it just drags the movie out with long scenes of music and no dialogue. For a film that is in essence a character piece (as nothing else happens but mild character development), there just isn't enough dialogue to develop much at all.For the plot of this film, it's pretty much just the story of Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) and the story of her life. Her failed sex life with King Louis XVI and her shaking up of the role of the queen. It's a new take on the history lesson, but like an overly long history lecture, this grows very tiring.This film completely relies on aesthetic pleasures. The sights and cinematography are very pleasing to the eyes, and there are some beautiful shots. The music is overly plentiful and featured in every scene, but often times the music, though contemporary, is fitting. The problem is every scene uses this music. Five lines will be said and then the film breaks into music for several minutes. Some of these scenes can be chalked up to character development by pondering and looking at the world. They can be considered reflective scenes, but it's just an excuse to show their nice sets and play some music and write no dialogue.The performances are fine, though purposefully inaccurate. Dunst uses an American accent, as does Jason Schwartzman, and nobody seems to use a French accent at all. Not a mistake, just part of the reinvisioning.Overall, this movie is too long, and there's too much music, and despite some nice scenes, and great looks, this film literally has nothing else going for it.My rating: ** out of ****. 120 mins. PG-13 for sexuality.",5,5,8,23 September 2009
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Such a fun movie!!!!!!!
","starring: Bob Hoskins, Joanna Cassidy, Christopher Lloyd, Allen Tilvern and Stubby Kaye. With the voices of: Charles Fleischer, Kathleen Turner, Mel Blanc, Wayne Alwine, June Foray and others.Plot: In 1947, cartoons and people co-exist. Cartoon character Roger Rabbit is framed for the murder of Marvin Acme and Detective Eddie Valiant (Hoskins), the toon hating drunk is the only one who can help him. Eddie, has to get over his anger after a toon dropped a piano and killed his brother in order to help.My review: This movie is so well done. The cartoons and the real people fit together almost flawlessly. The direction by Mr. Zemeckis is great and up to par with his other direction for films (like Forrest Gump). Bob Hoskins played the straight man role, but he was actually very funny. I thought all the real life performances were great and the voices had real emotion too, including Kathleen Turner as the sexy Jessica Rabbit. I of course recommend this movie to everybody, though to parents, the movie is full of double entendras that your kids may or may not get.My rating: 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. rated PG for Language, Sexual Content and Violence. 97 mins.",9,0,0,13 May 2006
Meet the Parents," A less wacky side of Ben Stiller is also funny.
","Ben Stiller, Robert DeNiro, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, Owen Wilson, Nicole Dehuff and Jon Abrahams.This has to be Ben Stiller's funniest film, even though it's a less wacky movie than most of his. Anyway, Gaylord 'Greg' Focker(Stiller) is a nurse that wants to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes(Polo) but first must meet her parents. When he gets there, her father Jack(DeNiro) obviously doesn't like him, which is basically the entire movie. Blythe Danner plays DeNiro's wife and is normal acting, but very good in her role. After Greg already makes Pam's family hate him, her ex-boyfriend Kevin Rawley(Wilson) comes over and tells intimate secrets to Greg. Nicole Dehuff plays Pam's newlywed sister and in real life died recently of pneumonia(she was in her early 30's).my rating-A-94%. rated PG-13 for sexual humor, drug content and language. 111 minutes.",9,1,1,26 July 2005
Se7en," The best murder mystery of the 90's.
","Stars: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, R Lee Ermey and Gwyneth Paltrow.This is one of the best examples of a good murder mystery. The bad guy is not revealed (though he can be spotted) until the end, but thats not the wist. It plays on what we expect. The film is very dark and it's look and direction is just really great. As for the performances, Kevin Spacey gives the acting job of his career, but because of his other nomination, he was unrecognized for this sick role that he plays. Everyone else does a great job too. The violence in this film is not in a lot, but it's disgusting violence. I highly recommend this to anyone! ***1/2 out of ****. 120 mins.

The Big Lebowski," If nothing else, extremely entertaining.
","Stars: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Peter Stormare, Flea, Torsten Voges, John Turturro, Sam Elliot, Tara Reid, Jack Kehler.Many obviously consider this to be a classic. I don't consider it one, but I still found it very entertaining and was not disappointed. Our basic plot is stoner and loser Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski is mistaken for millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski, when men break in to his house and pee on his rug. To get the money for the rug The Dude goes to Jeffrey Lebowski, and ends up on a mission to find rich Lebowski's kidnapped wife. The movie is fairly fast paced, but that doesn't stop it from having periods of heavy clever dialogue, mostly between John Goodman as the ex-Vietnam veteran Walter and the Dude. Many of the film's most entertaining scenes are located in the bowling alley where The Dude, Walter and Donnie (Buscemi) talk about nothing and (of course) bowl. The backup cast is really good also, including Julianne Moore as the 'kidnapped' wife and John Turturro as a sex offender bowler. Though I don't consider this to be a great classic film, it's still a good, fun movie with enough gusto to keep the whole thing afloat.My rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins. R for sexuality/nudity, violence, drug use and language.",7,0,2,1 February 2007
Fight Club," Stylish and fun throughout, but emotionally uninvolving.
","Fight Club has gained a huge fan base, now making it in the Top 30 films of all time according to Internet Movie Database users. I disagree with that, but this was still one of the best looking movies I've ever seen. Never has violence been so elaborately shot and planned out.The Narrator (Edward Norton) is a soap salesman who also happens to be an insomniac. He never gets sleep and because of this, he's always in a dream like state. He begins going to meetings for various problems, including testicular cancer and tuberculosis which gives him a gratified feeling which makes him feel better and in turn get more sleep. His sleeping stops when Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) starts going to the meetings despite that she has no problems and no reason to be there. He grows a crush on her. The Narrator later meets Tyler (Brad Pitt) who tells him about a way to get anger out, Fight Club, where men come and fight, not to hurt each other, but to get their rage out. Things get out of control as Tyler does.The direction here is really great. Extremely stylized fighting scenes that are both painful and real, and a mixture of computer animated effects that fit in perfectly. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are excellent leads and play off each other. Neither really shines over the other, the both give memorable performances. The music, though nothing too great to listen to separately, works fine here. It mostly consists of techno dance style music.I didn't find this movie very emotional at all. It wasn't style over substance, because their was a lot of substance to go along with the unique style, but the characters, who were likable, were not particularly emotionally involving. If something happened to them, I'd miss the actors presence over the character themselves.This is a very stylish film with as much gruesome violence as it has brains. A lack of a large heart brings it down a notch, but even with that, this isn't completely heartless, and it's great to watch.My rating: *** out of ****. 140 mins. R for violence, language and sexuality.",8,1,3,28 September 2008
Memento," A very captivating film.
","Stars: Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss.This is literally a movie in reverse. This film starts off with Leonard (Pearce) murdering his 'buddy' Teddy (Pantoliano). The plot of this: Leonard's wife was murdered, and Leonard was injured where he can remember his long term memories, but anything after the murder he forgets fast. He takes pictures and write notes on them so he can remember his life as it is now. His two windows into his new life are Natalie (Moss) a bartender that has problems with her boyfriend (or so we think anyways) and Teddy, a man we are lead to believe is the killer of his wife. Throughout the movie we have all kinds of twists and turns as to who is what, and by the end it all makes sense. After every time we see more of whats happenes, you start to realise more and more of who's what. I highly recommend this thought provoking thriller.My rating: *****/*****. rated R for language and violence.",10,0,2,20 June 2006
Inglourious Basterds," A WWII masterpiece from Tarantino that shoves a lot in our face, but luckily knows what to do with it.
","Quentin Tarantino has a way with dialogue, and a way with plot. Along with that, he has a way with throwing too much plot into a movie, or too much dialogue into a film with not enough plot (like Death Proof). This film has quite a large amount of dialogue, and it also has many different story lines and characters, none of which are elaborated on until near the end, so it almost seems as though they've been abandoned. By the end of the movie, it's quite apparent that nothing has been abandoned and all these story lines have been calculated as to how to end them perfectly and how to connect everything. Tarantino knew what he was doing.Like all of Tarantino's films, this one is split up into chapters. Unlike any of his other's, this one is almost completely chronological, aside from the infrequent flashbacks. One story revolves around the Inglorious Basterds, a group of Jewish-American soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Rein (Brad Pitt), and their Nazi scalping. Another story involves Shoshana (Melani Laurent), an escaped Jew who ran away from the evil 'Jew Killer', Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who is out for revenge. Perhaps she will get the revenge she wants when Landa is security at a movie premier at the theater she owns. And there's dozens of fairly main characters and actors along the way to go along with the main plots.If this film could be compared to any other Tarantino film, it would have to be Reservoir Dogs. Not because of any plot similarities, or similar scenes, but this film is devoid of emotion. Tarantino has his more emotional films, like the second Kill Bill, or Jackie Brown, or even Pulp Fiction, but this isn't really one of them. With that said, this still has characters that are likable and that the audience cares about, this movie just overall isn't an overly emotional film. But that's not what it's about anyways, it's a war film.The movie is rich in characters, and boy are there a lot of them with quite a bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is definitely the main character of the Americans, and he gives an over the top, often times comedic performance, but he plays a great contrast to the German's lead actor Christoph Waltz, who plays the sinister and evil Col. Hans Landa. Melanie Laurent plays a reserved (for the most part), but interesting role as the woman hell bent on revenge. Diane Kruger plays a rather minor, but interesting role as a German movie star who is actually a spy for the Americans. Every role played is played well, but unlike as it would seem by the trailers, all these actors aren't wrapped around Brad Pitt's finger, but instead Christoph Waltz's. He's the bad guy, and not just that, but he's also the smartest and most cunning of the characters. Really, this film revolves around him, and it works well that way, he's a great character.My only major quibble with the film is it's set-up. The way the movie is set up, it's only loosely thrown together until everything at the end brings the stories together. So for the first hour and a half (or around there), this movie felt like a constantly changing anthology. Once chapter five binds it together and gives us a typical great Tarantino ending, it makes the movie whole. But the looseness of the film towards the middle brought up questions as to what the purpose of different characters were. Luckily, the answers are all in the last chapter.Quentin Tarantino has yet again made another movie masterpiece. This one is one of leisure, but at the same time a constantly changing story. By the end, this film has delivered the goods. The rest of the film sets up what will happen with typical rich Tarantino dialogue, and some bloody violence. Definitely it's a unique take on World War II.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 154 mins. R for strong violence, language and brief sexuality.",9,4,13,21 August 2009
Coraline," Imaginative story, amazing visuals and uniquely great music.
","Henry Selick's latest movie, and his first in 8 years is a true treat. It was excellent in every way, except for the emotional punch, which wasn't even really necessary. The 3-D is very good, and without the 3-D, though the movie would lack the depth, it still would stand out. It is the visuals that make this movie so great, but the characters, plot and music are all top notch too, which add up to a fantastic film.Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her family have just moved, and Coraline is bored. She has no friends in this new place, and her parents are quite intent on ignoring her. The only other kid that lives close by, Wyborn (Robert Bailey Jr.), is irritating to Coraline, and she finds the dolls in her room to be better friends. After Wyborn gives Coraline a doll that looks like her, strange occurrences begin to happen. Coraline finds a small door leading to an alternate, seemingly perfect universe where her button eyed parents feed her good food and give her presents for no reason. This universe is not all that it seems, and Coraline learns this the hard way.Henry Selick has always been about the visuals. His first film, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', showed that his knack was for the sights, and amazingly, his animation and style has evolved. 'Coraline' is just as good looking as any of his past works, if not more so, and the animation has gotten better and crisper. Every little set, and every character is bizarrely designed to fit into this surreal movie.The main critique for this film seems to be that it has no emotion in it. Though emotions aren't a prominent aspect of Coraline, there is emotion. Coraline doesn't have a clicking relationship with her mom and dad, but that's why she loves the other mother and father so much. Coraline as a character has enough emotion to be the lead to a film like this. This wasn't meant to be a tear jerker animation. It was clearly made to bring Neil Gaiman's strange plot to life with dazzling animation.Doing the music is Bruno Coulais, and briefly They Might Be Giants. Mr. Coulais's score is beautiful, and strange, and most importantly, fitting. The music sounds how Coraline should sound, and it is a great listen. It is easily comparable to Danny Elfman's score for 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. They both have catchy, sad and unique music all rolled into one. They Might Be Giants also wrote a song, which is nice sounding, though nowhere near as catchy or lovely as Coulais.If I had any problem with this film, it would be that it didn't dive far enough into the alternate universe, but even that didn't lower the movie in my opinion. This was an excellent animated film, and is one that can actually be qualified as a family film, in that all members of the family can and probably will enjoy this.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild language, violence and mildly sexual animation.",9,68,97,6 February 2009
Happy Gilmore," One of Sandler's more amusing attempts.
","Stars: Adam Sandler, Carl Weathers, Julie Bowen, Chris McDonald, Allen Covert, Richard Kiel, Dennis Dugan, Joe Flaherty, Ben Stiller.Let me start off by saying that I really do not find Adam Sandler to be funny. I have yet to see a movie where I actually find him funny, but this was one of his better tries. Adam Sandler plays hockey, then golf player, Happy Gilmore trying to raise money for his grandmother. In order to learn golf, he gets help from Chubbs, played by the scene stealing Carl Weathers. Adam Sandler plays a jerk, yet he is surprisingly likable and you are rooting for him in the film. If you're a fan of Sandler I highly recommend this. If you aren't a particularly big fan of him, this will kill an hour and a half. Also noted is Ben Stiller in a hilarious cameo as the Senior Home worker.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for Language.",6,0,3,24 December 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Good, if you know what to expect
","South Park movie: starring: Trey Parker as Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Satan, Phillip, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Mackey, Gregory, Tom the newscaster, Big Gay Al, Clyde Goodman, Christophe the Mole, Ned Gerblanski, Yippie the backflipping dog, Randy Marsh, Stuart McCormick, Craig, Token, Bill, Fosse and others.Matt Stone as Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, Terrence, Saddam Houssain, Jimbo Kern, Butters Stotch, Gerold Broflovski, Pip Pirrip and others.Mary Kay Bergman as Sheila Broflovski, Sharon Marsh, Lianne Cartman, Wendy Testeberger, Mrs. McCormick, Shelly Marsh, Red-head and others.Isaac Hayes as Chef.Jesse Howell as Ike BroflovskiJenny Howell as Bebe cameos by George Clooney, Eric Idle, Brent Spiner, Minnie Driver and Dave Foley.This film is starts off like an innocent kiddie film and then it gets off into about a 20 minute swearapalooza, and then gets back to plot. This movie is about Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Kyles Canadian baby brother Ike, and Kenny going to see the R rated Terrence and Phillip film and becoming influenced to swear by it. The school counseler Mr. Mackey does a swearing rehab for them, ending in them seeing the film again. Kenny is influenced that he can light his farts on fire by it and he does, but he catching on fire and dies going to Hell. Meanwhile, the parents of South Park get mad at Terrence and Phillip, who are both Canadian, so they start a fight. It ends in the Baldwin actors being bombed so a war starts. Kenny is in Hell and Satan and the newly dead Saddam Houssain are gay lovers, but Saddam only thinks of sex. Kenny tells Satan he should dump him. Meanwhile, Cartman gets a V-chip implanted in his head so he cant swear and him, Stan and Kyle make a big protest group against killing Terrence and Phillip. During the execution of them, Cartman helps them out, but Stan said that if the two Canadians blood hit American soil, he would come to Earth. Totally entertaining with 14 toe tapping, though slightly short, that last about 25 minutes for all the songs. George Clooney is cool as an uncaring doctor. The Kenny Going to Hell animation is really cool, where totally flatly animated Kenny is in 3-D Hell(done with computer animation). Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, sings the last song in the film. Watch it! My rating:A. R for strong language, violence galore, sexual candor, crude humor and animated nudity. 77 minutes long.",9,0,0,27 March 2005
Balls of Fury," Worst film from 2007 so far.
","'Balls of Fury' is an absolutely dreadful comedy. It amazingly would work better as a drama (not much better). With most films, I can find some redeeming quality. I looked hard and I this is what I found on this. The main character was slightly more tolerable than one would expect from such a poor movie. Christopher Walken was occasionally funny, simply because of his delivery...and well, that's it. Other than that, there are only negatives. Every joke could be seen by anyone a mile away. I could practically give the entire outcome of the film, including all the jokes, halfway through.The plot, if you can call it that, started off slightly promising, but quickly became too stupid. Randy Daytona was a ping pong child prodigy. His father bet on him, and he lost, so he was killed. 18 years later Daytona works at a bad magic show. He is needed by the FBI to catch a Chinese mafia criminal. He gets lessons from a blind man, and it just gets dumber from there. To go along with all of this, ping-pong just isn't an interesting sport to make in to a movie. It's repetitive and you can only do so much with it. I really hated this, and I have a feeling this will earn a well deserved spot in the bottom 100 very soon.My rating: BOMB/****. 83 mins. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.",1,6,19,29 August 2007
Batman Returns," Extremely dark, but beautifully written and filmed.
","stars: Danny Devito, Michelle Pfieffer, Michael Keaton, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Vincent Schiavelli, Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) and Jan Hooks.I really do enjoy watching this film, but it's only for people that love extremely dark flicks. It's about the hideous Penguin (Devito) that gets together with well respected monster Max Shreck (Walken) and runs for mayor. People soon realize that he is a horribly evil monster. We also have Selina Kyle (Pfieffer) that is just a timid assistant to Max Shreck until she snoops around too much and Shreck shoves her out a window for dead, but instead she becomes skitophrenic and becomes Catwoman. Batman fights both of these people and also falls in love with Selina Kyle, not knowing shes Catwoman. I loved the films wonderful sets and dark tone, but it's not for everyone. Another positive in this film is the wonderful score that is much improved on from the last Batman film (by Danny Elfman). I enjoyed this film, but it may be a tad depressing in the long run.My rating: B. 120 mins. PG-13 for extremely dark violent content and some sexual content",9,0,1,25 February 2006
Superbad," Very funny, sometimes too raunchy for it's own good.
","After reading man great reviews for this, I had high expectations, and this didn't live up to it. However, this is a very funny movie with a lot of great scenes, and something that many teen movies don't have..a heart. The main characters Seth and Evan are actually very likable, despite their flaws. Seth is the profane, sex starved fat kid and Evan, along with also being sex starved, is the shy and nerdy kid. When popular girl Jules asks Seth to the party, he claims he can get alcohol with his new fake I.D., when their acquaintance Fogel was actually getting one. The whole movie is about obtaining alcohol and getting to a party, but their are many problems along the way. Evan and Seth try to steal the beer, while Fogel is taken by 2 police officers to the party after being involved in a robbery.'Superbad' is obviously written based on true experiences, because so much of the writing sounded like true to life situations. The movie had me constantly laughing, but sometimes I couldn't bring myself to laugh at all the vulgarity, and I like vulgarity, but this was sometimes over the top. The characters were all really good, especially Fogel aka McLovin. Occasionally the two cops (Bill Hader, Seth Rogan) are annoying because they are just too stupid, but they mostly made the movie more enjoyable. When you go into 'Superbad' expect a funny, good movie, but don't put your expectations really high (like mine).My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins. Rated R for nonstop sexual content, violence, language, nudity.",8,1,9,23 August 2007
Hot Fuzz," A strange mixture of comedy, action and horror, that works for the most part.
","Edgar Wright's last film 'Shaun of the Dead' was a horror movie, and a comedy, but more than anything it was a comedy. There were tense scenes, but the more often than not, the comedy prevailed. Here, it's hard to tell what the heck this is. It's good, but it's a weird kind of good caught in genre limbo, never really knowing what the heck it is. It's a black comedy at times, and sometimes is as tense an action flick as you could find. Then there's the horror. The shady villain ready to decapitate his or her enemies, but the violent images cause laughter. Where most movies have a consistent mood, like an action-comedy, which is full of shooting, but with a wink to the camera, this jumps around. For 30 minutes straight it will be pure nail biting action with very little comedy, before switching to downright jokey scenes. It's good...just weird.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a hotshot cop who does his job well and by the book. He's making all his fellow officers look bad, so they force him to be reassigned to 'winner of best village of the year', Sandford. Nick hates how little his fellow officers in Sandford seem to care about anything. He's paired with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), son of Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Things are pretty boring, and are limited to speeding tickets and underage drinking until a series of violent murders occurs. Secrets are revealed, leading to an odd, yet original ending.Edgar Wright has a fast paced style of direction that looks good but can grow tiring. Some scenes needed to be played out to build suspense, but instead drop the suspense and let the action happen right away. Constant cut to's and flashy quick shots are reminiscent of Joel Schumaker's 'masterpiece' 'Batman & Robin'. This movie really shouldn't be compared to a movie like that though. Even with the flashy direction, this was a fine British flick.The acting is good. The chemistry is great between Pegg and Frost, who are written quite different from their characters in 'Shaun of the Dead'. Timothy Olymphant is excellent in the supporting cast, and manages to be constantly both funny and menacing. The cast mostly consists of many English actors that cause people to say, 'I've seen their face, don't know where, don't know their name.' Several unnamed British actors play backup roles, and they give everyman (or woman) performances that fit in nicely.Overall, this movie has no genre. It jumps around which doesn't always work. But what does work is the acting and the story. Even if this may cause a slight headache due to quick cuts, it's still a funny and action filled comedy triumph for Edgar Wright.My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins. Rated R for strong violence and language.",7,2,4,4 October 2008
Ed Wood," An all too often forgotten Tim Burton classic.
","A black and white film about a horrible filmmaker made in the 1990s obviously wasn't going to shatter any box office records, or for that matter even break even. This movie in fact seemed to be forgotten and is never mentioned when mention of Tim Burton comes up. Despite the fact that this is possibly Burton's least known film, it is definitely one of his best. This is an outstanding comical character piece with stellar camera-work and direction, not to mention a cast that brings these oddballs to life.The film follows Edward D Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp), the wannabe film director/writer/actor who worked his butt off to become recognized. It takes place from 1953 to 1959, and goes from Wood's meeting and friendship of Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) to the making of Wood's best known film 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'.This movie manages very successfully to be both funny and somewhat realistic. Mr. Depp gives an exaggerative performance at times, but is the performance unbelievable? Nope. And he never drops out of character either, so it just makes us believe Wood was a bit loony, but still likable. Martin Landau knocks his performance out of the park with his Academy Award winning performance as Bela Lugosi. Again, this character might be a bit exaggerated, but it still always feels real, and Landau plays on the Bela's frailties and emotions perfectly. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are good as Wood's love interests throughout various points of his life also. The only cast member who may have been a tad bit unbelievable was Bill Murray as Bunny, Wood's eccentric manager. His performance was too goofy to believe sometimes. Nonetheless, still stellar performances.The direction and camera work is really good, as is the lighting. The black and white accentuates the backdrops and scenes and also helps make this thing look really great. And to make the scenes even more lush, Howard Shore replaces Danny Elfman as the score composer, and makes the score just as good as Elfman would have likely done (No offense to the very talented Danny Elfman). The score which switches between corny sci-fi theramin score and beautiful brass and strings is just really fitting music for the film. Episodic plots can become boring because they just go from one place to another and never set roots, but this movie is never boring. It's interesting to see the processes this guy had to go through just to make no budget films, and it's interesting to see his home life. It seems overall, Wood was an interesting fellow.Overall, this is a really interesting movie, with enough humor to make it interesting, but not too much to make it stupid. And Johnny Depp's weird performance as Ed Wood doesn't stop the film from actually having a good amount of emotion and sentimentality. Definitely one of Burton's best films!My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. Rated R.",9,0,0,9 June 2010
Home Alone," Cute movie, good for kids, somewhat entertaining for adults.
","'Home Alone' is a very enjoyable semi-classic film. It's about as good as a movie about a kid being left at home and terrorized by burglars could be.McCully Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the youngest in a family of many children. He is picked on by the older ones and a slip of the tongue gets him in trouble. After a power shortage and a rush to the airport, he is left home alone. To make matters worse, Marv (Joe Pesci) and Harry (Daniel Stern), two police officer burglars, are trying to break into Kevin's house while the family's away. This is a really fun movie. The acting is all around good from paranoid mother Catherine O'Hara to Johny Candy. The situations Kevin is put through are unrealistic, but who really cares, they're funny and clever. McCully Culkin is really good in this actually, considering for much of the film it's a one man show. With the good comes the bad...this movie can get annoying at times. His nonstop screaming in the film gets old, as does his constant looking and talking to the camera. But nonetheless, this is still a fun movie for kids, and pretty painless for adults.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG for language and mild violence.",7,0,0,24 December 2007
Terminator Salvation," Very underrated. Critics have this one wrong!
","Having McG direct a Terminator movie seems as though it would be a death sentence to the franchise. Everything the guy directed was a big, extremely dumb action flick. Little more can be said for this, however it really wasn't dumb. It was just action packed. It was a bit small on the plot, but what it lacked in plot, it made up for in great action scenes, and characters that we actually care about. The Termintor series was not brought down by this one!John Connor (Christian Bale), along with many others are fighting against the Skynet corporation. The Skynet's Terminators are killing all the humans in sight, and it's up to them to stop these mindless killers. Then we've got Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Marcus was given the death penalty, but is then mysteriously alive in 2018 after his death. He meets up with Connor's (not yet) father as a teenager, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). After Kyle Reese is captured, all John Connor has is Marcus, but Marcus has a secret unbeknownst to him that causes distrust amongst the humans.Critics have said many bad things about this film. They've said it was short on plot, which is somewhat true. This movie is about the war and the characters, so the plot takes place mainly on the war field. Unlike T2, there aren't a billion loopholes and plot points.Critics have said the characters are flat, with no emotion. I found this movie much more emotional then possibly any of the other Terminators. Marcus is a likable, and torn character. Really, he is the hero of the film, and throughout he is distrusted. He was a great addition to the cast. He was the movie's heart. Anton Yelchin was the thinker in the movie as Kyle Reese. He uses his brain and stays calm when everyone else is going crazy. Christian Bale...well he plays Batman, or the same character anyways. He's gruff, and mean, and untrusting, like Batman. He has a heart, but he's somewhat bitter (like Batman). It seems as though Bale is typecasting himself into his own Batman role by playing the character's the same. To add the the supporting cast, we have Bryce Dallas Howard who has little to do throughout, Helena Bonham Carter who sets up and explains the film and a character, Michael Ironside as the 'by the books' general, and Moon Bloodgood as a compassionate soldier. Even Schwarzenager himself makes an appearance through CGI and ADR as The T-800 prototype.This movie was really great. The action was exhilarating and the characters were quite likable. The plot didn't need to be huge for the purpose of the film, and it wasn't. This was a great addition to the Terminator series, and on par, if not better than the third film.My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins. PG-13 for nonstop action violence and language.",8,5,11,23 May 2009
Juno," Funny, sweet, touching......excellent movie.
","Last year's 'Knocked Up' was thought of by many as a hilarious look at the unintentionally pregnant woman. Juno beats that movie in every way. It's funnier, it's sweeter and has more emotion. Obviously these two weren't meant to be compared, but it deserves a small comparison, in which Juno wins hands down.Juno (Ellen Page) finds out she's pregnant, and knows right away she wants to give the baby to a nice home. She finds seemingly perfect couple Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) to give the child to. Juno also has trouble with her baby's father, and her father and step-mother. The way this movie is done is very unique. The humor comes from the witty choice of words, and not so much from the jokes themselves. The drama, like the humor, is somewhat subtle at times, but it's obviously there, and is one aspect that made this a great movie. The switches from comedy to drama were smooth. The plot was good, as were the characters. Many of the characters had similar ways of speaking making it sound like they were the same character, but it really wasn't bothersome at all.I highly recommend you check this one out. There's not much to dislike about it, but there is quite a lot to love.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor and language.",9,3,12,12 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A long, but thoroughly entertaining film.
","Stars: Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy, Lee Arenburg, Kevin McNally, McKenzie Cook, Keith Richards.I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. The first Pirates was a great film, and the second was a letdown, and I was hoping this would live up to the expectations of the first...and it didn't. But it came really close, and it was enjoyable. In this installment of 'Pirates of the Caribbean', all the chaos from the second film unfurls and the gang gets Captain Jack Sparrow back. If you thought Johnny Depp was strange in the first film, you should see him here playing numerous hallucinations of himself. The main problem with this movie was it didn't quite know what it was. One second it was slapstick comedy, where next it was drama. For the most part they switched back and forth pretty well, but sometimes it just felt odd. Another problem was too much fantasy and unexplained pirate lore, like tipping the ship to make them get to where they were before. But for the most part, this was not a letdown and Prates fans will be pleased.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 164 mins. PG-13 for strong violence.",6,0,2,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Despite having some problems, this was very entertaining.
","Stars: Tobey Maguire, Kirstin Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Bryce Dallas Howard, Topher Grace, Rosemary Harris, James Cromwell, Bruce Campbell, Willam Dafoe, Cliff Robertson.For me, this was probably the most entertaining Spiderman. Not the best however. In this Spiderman film, it seemed like the villains were there just to give the movie an actual bad guy. It focused a lot on Peter Parker's inner feelings, along with Mary Jane's. The bad guys in this were The Sandman (Church) and Venom (Grace). It felt weird to me having Topher Grace as Venom, or even including Venom at all. The character of Venom doesn't appear until late in the film, which felt weird passing him off as a main villain at the last minute. Topher Grace, however, was great as the photographer that became Venom. He played a small, but great role. Thomas Haden Church played a quieter villain with not much to say, but he has a screen presence that came across quite well. James Cromwell was in this for some reason, I have no idea why. As for the movie itself, it was very entertaining. Sometimes it would become too much of a comedy for it's own good, or too dramatic, but it still was fun to watch, so I can't say I was disappointed. One more added bonus to the film was a hilarious cameo that worked well by Bruce Campbell as a maitre'd.My rating: *** out of ****. 136 mins.",7,4,9,6 May 2007
Match Point," Interesting idea, well directed, nice acting.
","Stars: Jonathan Rhys Myers, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johanssen, Brian Cox and Peneolpe Wilton.I don't quite know what this was, but it was very enjoyable. It's about a man, a married man, who's having an affair with an American girl Nola (Johanssen). When she gets pregnant, and she threatens to tell someone, he decides to take things into his own hands. This film is all about how lucky this man manages to be under the circumstances and even though it's an odd mix of romance with black comedy, it's good. It was directed by the very talented Woody Allen.My rating: *** out of ****. 122 mins. R for sex.",8,0,3,31 July 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Artistically this is on par with Pan's Labyrinth. Too bad everything else failed because of this.
","Going into a Guillermo del Toro movie, you should know that the visuals are going to be the highlight of the film. The first Hellboy film had great visuals, though not quite as great as this. But with that said, the first Hellboy achieved so much more than this did. It was funnier, less corny and clichéd, and the villains were much more menacing than the villain here, who's no more than a guy with a spear, and an army of unnecessary robots. The first was pretty good in every way, this one had the eye candy, but offered very little else.After botching a secret operation, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and the crew are finally noticed, and this secret group of 'freaks' is no longer a secret, and they are known to the public. Liz is also pregnant but doesn't want to tell Hellboy. Meanwhile, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), is trying to claim his right to be king. In order to be, he needs the three pieces of this crown, one that his sister has, one that he stole from a museum, and one his father, who he killed, had. Hellboy, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), Liz (Selma Blair), and Johann Krauss (John Alexander, James Dodd and Seth MacFarlane), a man's soul trapped in a robot who was brought in to keep Hellboy under control, must stop Nuada from retrieving all three pieces of the crown, which allows him to control the Golden Army, and eventually take over the world. Abe Sapien meanwhile has fallen in love with Nuada's sister, who has an odd connection to her brother...what physically happens to him, happens to her. They must stop him and save the world.The first negative for me was the villain here. It's just an elf, who has the same build as a human, and could die just as easily. He was no threat ever. Even when he had his Golden Army, it never was a threat. The Golden Army was just a bunch of braindead robots who liked to smash the ground. There was never a moment where I thought someone could be in harms way. The characters have been dumbed down a level and turned into comedians. Abe has been made more human and was even dumbed down, one of the dumbest scenes being where Hellboy and Abe sing Barry Mannilow together. It wasn't cute, it wasn't funny, it was just really stupid.The story was bad. Mr. del Toro went for an all out visual feast and because of this he compromised the story. Elements didn't make sense, and parts of the movie that felt like they should have some impact didn't. They were all there for the audience to say, 'Wow! Look at that!', but I found myself saying 'Huh?' more than anything else. Hellboy fights these imaginative creatures. Instead of making a movie on this, maybe Guillermo should have written a book with all these fantastical creatures he thinks up. At least it would have made more sense.Now, onto what I did like. I've said it all throughout, this was a lovely looking film. The direction was stellar, the action scenes were well choreographed, the creatures, though pointless to the story, were very cool to look at. The CGI wasn't amazing, but luckily most of the creatures are puppets, costumed characters, and lots of make up. The musical score was also really beautiful. I had just re-watched the first Hellboy prior to watching this, and the first film's music was not that great, where this one had some fantastic music, that should've been saved for a better flick. I wasn't surprised to see Danny Elfman's name in the end credits, and the music did add to the movie, and made it a small step better than it would have been.Anyone who says this is director Guillermo del Toro's greatest accomplishment in film making, probably hasn't seen Pan's Labyrinth. Where del Toro failed here in the writing department he succeeded in the direction, and he can write good screenplays. Too bad his sole purpose in writing this was to go wild with the visuals.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 120 mins. PG-13 for violence.*Final complaint. Why did they make Hellboy such an ugly kid? Geez, was he stupid looking.",6,10,22,12 July 2008
Cloverfield," Very well done, Great entertainment.
","'Cloverfield' is just a downright entertaining movie. It's got suspense, good humor and cool looking action scenes. The shaky camera wasn't even bad, it added to the overall effect.Rob is going away for his new job, and a large group of friends throw him a going away party. Unfortunately, the party must end abruptly when a giant grasshopper looking monster begins destroying the city. The cameraman for most of the movie is the comic relief best friend character Hud, and him being the cameraman works very well. Some intense scenes needed a bit of comic relief, and he worked just fine. The action scenes are usually shaky, but they still look great. Because the first 20 minutes of the film are used to introduce the characters and their backgrounds, the audience can actually relate to these likable group of young adults.It's a very entertaining flick. See it in the theaters for the amazing sound effects.My rating: *** out of ****. 74 mins. PG-13 for violence.",8,1,2,1 February 2008
Ocean's Twelve," Just as good as the first
","Oceans Twelve-Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta Jones, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Andy Garcia, Elliot Ghould, Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, Bernie Mac, Eddie Izzard, Robbie Coltrane, Cherry Jones.This movie is just a fun movie. It could be a family film, except the f word is used 3 times in conversations. This movie focuses on Brad Pitt falling back in love with his ex girlfriend(Jones). The only problem is she's a detective that will arrest him and they are trying to pull off a crime. George Clooney had been banished to a backup character and so has Julia. She is at the beginning for about five minutes and comes in again at about 85 minutes in. Her part is best in the movie. All of the heisters go to jail except Scott Caan, Matt Damon(Who becomes leader of the gang), and Don Cheadle. They get Tess(Roberts) to be the 12th member. She pretends to be Julia Roberts(Tess does)and meets up with Bruce Willis(who plays himself.) Bruce is uncredited and has about ten minutes of screen time. The little Chinese guy has no part at all and Bernie Mac is only at the beginning and a little at the end. Zeta Jones is good as an (extremely) sexy cop and Pitt, Clooney, Damon(Especially him), Caan, Affleck, Roberts, and Willis deliver perfect roles. Very good.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," One of the most amusing films ever made!!!!!
","stars: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens, James Earl Jones and Keenan Wynn.This movie is dealing with a serious subject, but it is so amusing! It's about a war started by crazy General Jack Ripper (Hayden) that could have been prevented. The chemistry between Mr. Hayden and Sellers as Captain Mandrake is excellent. the scenes that they share are so great and just the way that peter Sellers delivers the lines is so funny. The entire film takes place in three places; an army underground room where the President (also Sellers), General Turginson (Scott) and many other officials, including ex-Nazi who can't control his left hand Dr. Strangelove (Played hilariously by Sellers). It also takes place in a military bombadeer plane and in a room in the Military base where Mandrake and General Ripper talk about nothing and nonsense. Director Stanley Kubrick does an excellent job directing and writing this great film and I recommend it to everyone!!! My rating: 4/4 stars. Rated PG for Mild Language, Violence and Sexual Humor. 94 mins.",10,1,3,10 May 2006
Scary Movie 2," Quite funny, but also quite stupid.
","Stars: Anna Farris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, David Cross, Tori Spelling, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Masterson, David Cross, Tim Curry, Regina Hall, Chris Masterson, James Woods, Natasha Lyonne, James DeBello, Veronica Cartwright and Andy Richter.This is what is known as a hit and miss comedy. I'd say that the misses and the hits kind of balance each other out, and it came out really stupid, but funny at times. In this installment of the Scary Movies, Cindy, Shorty, Brenda, Ray and others go and stay at a haunted house for a school project. My favorite part was the opening spoof of the Excorsist with James Woods as the priest. If you want a cheap laugh, I's recommend this movie.My rating: **/****. 80 mins.

Pan's Labyrinth," The most amazing fantasy I've ever seen.
","This movie seriously blew me away. I had only heard good things, but I did not expect the masterpiece that this truly is. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is not just an amazing fantasy film, but it's the best and most beautiful fantasy I've ever seen. Visually it's amazing, the story is great and the characters are very believable. They each serve their purpose perfectly.Ofeilia is a little girl caught in the middle of the Spanish Civil War in 1944. Her stepfather is the General of the fascists, and is an uncaring evil man. Her mother is pregnant and dying. She is caught in the middle of death and misery, but she soon begins to see fantastical things. A fairy comes to her and takes her to see a faun in a nearby labyrinth, who tells her that she is a princess to a magical kingdom. In order to claim her throne, she must pass 3 amazing tests. Meanwhile, the Civil War is raging and her stepfather, Captain Vidal is becoming insane.I'll start my positives (because that's all I have) with the visuals. The computer effects are very good, and work well for the fairies and the little creatures. The make-up is amazing, and the creatures are truly stunning looking creations. The music is lovely and very rich with violin. The movie itself is just about the most compelling thing I've ever seen. It starts off fairly slow, but it quickly picks up after giving the basic plot, and wow! My eyes were glued to the screen for the rest of the movie. The more realistic civil war portions of the film are compelling and sad, and the fantasy portions are awe-inspiring and are actually pretty scary. I've thought about this movie since I've seen it, so it's one that sticks with you.Overall, this is a sad, fantastical and amazing film that will have you entertained throughout.My rating: **** out of ****. 120 mins. R for violence and language.",10,1,3,7 June 2008
Knocked Up," A great comedy, and drama.
","Stars: Seth Rogen, Kathryn Heigl, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Allen Tudyc, Harold Ramis. Cameos by Ryan Seacrest, Steve Carell, Jessica Simpson, Jessica Alba.I really enjoyed 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', and I figured I would enjoy this. While I really did enjoy this, I liked it in a different way. It's actually easier to relate to this situation and (some of) these characters than the ones in writer/director Judd Appatow's last film. The plot of this is pretty simple. After a night of partying and drinking, strangers Ben Stone (Rogen) and Allison Scott (Heigl) have sex, she gets pregnant. Allison is a hard worker and Ben doesn't work and is interested only in smoking pot with his friends and watching films where women undress. 'Knocked Up' managed to have some really hilarious comedy, and the next moment it seamlessly went to drama that was actually sad. The only problem I had with this was it occasionally went too much into comedy and too often relied on Ben's friends for cheap laughs, but usually it was fine and hilarious. It was written very well, and often very realistically too. I highly recommend you see it! My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. Rated R for Strong Language, Drug Use, and Sex/Nudity. 123 mins.",8,2,4,23 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A wonderful adaptation of a very bizarre play.
","Who better to direct a musical about a barber who slits his patient's throats than Tim Burton? Who better to star as the lead role than Johnny Depp? Actually, quite a few people could have done better in the singing department for Depp's title role, but he still gave a marvelous performance otherwise. The movie was all around really great.Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a happy man with a wife and daughter. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) takes his family away for his own. Benjamin returns 15 years later under his new name Sweeney Todd, and he wants revenge on those who wronged him. He meets Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who runs a failing meat pie shop and he opens a barbershop up right above her. Violence, murder, cannibalism and catchy tunes ensue. The acting was good, but the real standout was Helena Bonham Carter who managed to play a murderous character who still managed to be sympathetic. Sacha Baron Cohen plays a small, hilarious over the top the role, and was a great addition to the cast. I had heard that Johnny Depp talk sings all his songs, but that is not true. Even if he isn't the best singer out there, he does actually sing several songs. The music is strange, but catchy, and it fits well with the tone of the movie. As a musical, there are better ones out there, not to say this isn't a good musical. One positive to the film, was the smooth transitions from comedy to drama and violence. The London town looks great, and the dark sepia-toned colors didn't get annoying, and I thought they would.Overall, I think Sweeney Todd is a bizarre musical, but it made for a great movie that I'd see many more times.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 120 mins. R for violence.",9,3,6,21 December 2007
The Doors," Typical of Oliver Stone, style over everything else.
","The Doors, or more appropriately, Jim Morrison: The Movie, is about Jim Morrison's short, but influential life from his failed film career to the band The Doors, to his untimely death. I'm not quite sure what this movie was trying to say about Morrison and the band. If it was saying that Jim was anything but a crazy drug addict, then it failed, because that's the only side we see of him here. Occasionally, Stone lets us see his poetic side, but very rarely, and when it does show it's because he's tripping on acid. There's no emotional connections to any character, except maybe Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson, but not much for her either. So, with no emotion and no character development, what we have is the outline of what happened with The Doors, and a lot of Val Kilmer imitating Jim Morrison's singing.Everything about this was not all bad. The acting is quite good. Val Kilmer was very believable playing the hard rocker who didn't care for anyone else's opinions. Meg Ryan was good as his struggling girlfriend. Kathleen Quinlin is very good as his critic sex mate. Even Kyle McLaughlan was good as the keyboard player Ray Manzerack. Along with being a good actor, McLaughlan also had the best character, an advocate of Morrison's work, but also a sense of reason that was never listened to. Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon play the other two band members in small thankless roles.The direction starts off pretty cool, but by the end turns into a major headache. Stone constantly uses blue and red lenses on the camera, no matter what the scene, so instead of being used to symbolize sadness, or anger, they're just there to look cool. A lot of odd zoom ins and strange camera angles are used, and again, they start pretty neat, but after you realize Oliver Stone is just throwing them about for no reason, they get tiring. This whole movie can be compared to his later film 'Natural Born Killers'. They both have uncaring character, a weird style that get's to be a huge headache, and an ending making us think 'Why should we care?'It's really hard to tell why this film was made. Obviously because Oliver Stone wanted to make a film on this popular band, but to show what? Was it to show how influential Morrison was? Because it showed he was influential to some people, but that was because of his crazy music, not himself personally. Was this meant as an homage to the band? Because it actually made the band look bad, and if this is why it was made, then it was an even bigger failed attempt then this movie was. Or was this made because Oliver Stone liked the music and just wanted to make a movie? Probably. This had no purpose or reason to be made, except maybe to turn people on to the music, and even that didn't work for me.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 135 mins.

Elf," Very mixed review.
","Stars: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Ed Asner, Zooey Dechanel, Bob Newhart, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gaas, Artie Lange.Let me start by saying that I thought all the performances in this film were good. Will Ferrell was good, James Caan kept the movie afloat, Bob Newhart was a great presence. With such a great cast, I'm amazed they made such a mediocre film. The character of buddy the elf is kind of a one note joke, 'fish out of water' character that really has no development in the film. Buddy is a human, who was raised as an elf, that goes back to New York to visit his birth father who never knew he was born. In New York he acts like an idiot, getting hit by cars and eating gum off the bottom of benches, etc. Buddy meets a girl played by Zooey Dechanel, who has a problem singing in public. I guess this movie is good for kids, but I found it to be very stupid. I thought Bob Newhart's narration (through the beginning and at the end) was a nice touch.My rating: C. 94 mins.

Lost in Translation," Really just not very interesting.
","Stars: Bill Murray, Scarlett Johanssen and Anna Farris.It's amazing to me how anyone could consider this fluff to be a fine film. Obviously people do, because it was up for Best Picture by the Acadamy Awards. This was a quiet love story that was all very held back and soft, but along with that it just really wasn't interesting. I have seen films like this that managed to be good, but this was just not interesting. The best part of the film was Anna Farris and that really wasn't that good. People can think what they want, but I just don't like this boring and annoying film.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 122 mins. R for sex.",4,2,8,31 July 2006
Full Metal Jacket," A good war movie, brought down by a lack of a center.
","Stars: Mathew Modine, Adam Baldwin, R Lee Ermey, Vincent D'Orfornio, Arliss Howard and Kevin Major Howard.Stanley Kubrick had already established that he was a prominent director in Hollywood that made really good films when this came out. This was a good movie. It wasn't great. The film is about the many adventures of Private Joker (Modine) as he goes through boot camp and goes off to the Vietnam War. The first 45 minutes are the intense boot camp program led by R Lee Ermey playing a heartless jerk, doing the best performance in the film. The second half of the film is Joker and his buddies at war, whether it be fighting, or playing around with the dead bodies. My problem with this movie, is there really is no plot or a center to it. It's just a big timeline of somebody's life that ends us wondering, 'Well, what next?' However, Stanley Kubrick has a great war movie here and one of my favorite war films of the 80's.My rating: *** out of ****. 115 mins. R for strong violence and language.",8,1,3,2 August 2006
Corpse Bride," This was a really great film, but it didn't leave as much of a lasting impression as I'd hoped.
","Stars: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Joanna Lumley, Paul Whitehouse, Michael Gough, Enn Reitel, Danny Elfman, Tracey Ullman and Deep Roy.I thought that this was a very well animated, well acted (vocally) and just really nice looking stop-motion movie. This movie's problem is that it will forever be compared to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' which is now a cult classic. This will never be a cult classic for many reasons. The music by Danny Elfman and the songs were good, but they weren't great. Nightmare's music was better. The writing in this is just as good, but it just isn't very showey. The character designs weren't as flashy as Nightmare, and it seems that would be a big merchandizing problem. Also, we don't see enough into Johnny Depp's character. He doesn't sing any songs, yet he's the star. However with all that aside, Tim Burton made a wonderful movie that I enjoyed, only second to Nightmare.My rating: 3 1/4 out of 4 stars. 74 mins.

Fargo," Excellent independent film
","Stars: Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare.This is what would be known as a very small movie. It takes place in very few places, has only a few main characters, and the whole movie just seemed really small, which turns out to be a good thing. You really get to know and love every character, no matter how much they have to say. The order by which the character's are introduced are quite odd, where the first 1/3rd of the film is about Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) and his wife's set-up kidnap by Carl (Buscemi) and Gaear (Stormare). The last 2/3rds are about Marge Gunderson (McDormand), a police officer, trying to solve three murders in the process of kidnapping Jerry's wife. The whole film I was glued to the screen, and when it ended, I kind of went 'Oh.' It's not a tricky film to follow, it doesn't have any interesting plot twists or any amazing ending, it's just a wonderfully written, directed and acted simple film, that instead of ending with a big bang shoot 'em up, ends with more of a simple and effective whimper.My rating: **** out of ****. 93 mins. Rated R for language, gory violence and some sex/nudity.",10,0,1,6 March 2007
Burn After Reading," Great cast holding up a good movie.
","If you like the Coen brother's previous movies, then you're probably going to like this one. It's labeled as a comedy, and humor wise can be compared to Fargo. At times it's cheeky and over the top, but it can also be very serious. The laughs were not frequent from me, but for some reason, the same heart pounding I got from No Country for Old Men, I got at times in this. Really, this was not one of the Coen's best works, though it was still good and entertaining.Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) has just been fired from the CIA, and he doesn't want to tell his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) the truth. She's got some secrets of her own, and she's been cheating on Osborne for psychotic charmer Harry (George Clooney), and Katie is secretly in the process of getting a divorce from her husband. Meanwhile, Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is in the process of getting plastic surgery, and she's trying to find a love online, and she meets Harry. Chad (Brad Pitt) works at Hardbodies Gym with Linda, and he finds Osborne's files which were mistakenly left in the women's room. Linda and Chad try to give the files back to Osborne, and expect a small reward in return, he takes it offensively. Chaos ensues as many interconnected stories are told.The actors were really great here. George Clooney and Frances McDormand are over the top, but funny. Tilda Swinton is perfectly cast as the rude woman she plays. John Malkovich is good at being angry, so he too was perfectly cast. Brad Pitt is a great addition to the cast a the flamboyant and clueless gym worker, and probably was my favorite character, as he was most likable. The other characters were inconsistent as to whether they were likable or not, though whether or not they were, the actors always portrayed them brilliantly.The stories are okay. At times the movie drags, but usually it's well paced. The script is random and typical Coen strange. It's too serious to be a comedy, and too goofy comedic to be serious, so what we have is a movie stuck in genre limbo, never really reaching any genre successfully. It wants to be a comedy more than anything, but never fully reaches it's goal.Overall, this is a good, not great, outing for the Coens, with a lighter tone than some of their pictures, but pales as a follow up to No Country for Old Men.My rating: *** out of ****. 95 mins. R for language, violence and sexual content.",7,2,6,12 September 2008
Watchmen," The end result is less than satisfying, but the entertainment value throughout is through the roof.
","It seems as though the result of a truly good movie would be to make the viewer think long and hard about what they just watched. 'Watchmen' does make the audience think, but not in a good way. It's overly long, with a climax that really isn't that great, and because of this the last 45 minutes drag and go on and on. As for entertainment, there is much to be found, but this mish mash of a movie just isn't the great superhero character study it could and should be.After the murder of superhero The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), members of a disbanded super group meet together for the first time in years. There seems to be a murderer after these superheroes, but who it is, is a mystery. Many sub-plots ensue.The characters are all written fairly well. The Silk Spectre (Malin Ackerman) is poorly acted, which brings down the character a bit, but it's just a minor thing. The writing is at times good, and at times too soap operatic and melodramatic, but again this is just a minor thing. The direction is what really stood out, and it was quite snappy, if not repetitive. Slow motion is used every 2 minutes, but it goes unnoticed because of how cool the scenes are being shown in that slow motion. The special effects add to the cool and slick direction, and make this a good looking movie, if nothing else.The climax of the movie takes these characters that we've grown to like over the past 2 hours plus, and puts things in perspective....this is not a good thing. First off, it compromises the characters, making their morals that were previously what drove them, pointless. Second, the ending takes us away from what the movie is (a character piece), and it focuses on the human race as a whole, something that should have been done long before. Our focus does a complete 180, and no longer do we care about the well developed characters, but instead about the complete strangers who have been hanging out in the background this entire movie. This switch didn't work too well for me.Overall, this is a stylish and entertaining film, but it is overly long, takes itself too seriously and has an unsatisfying ending. But of course, this is just one person's opinion.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 161 mins. R for strong violence, language, nudity and sexuality.",7,3,7,16 April 2009
Hot Rod," I don't see how this qualifies as a movie!
","'Hot Rod' is a very strange film. At first it feels like a comedy about a nerd who tries to be a stunt man. But then you realize that this is like a spoof movie, in that nothing makes sense and fast paced gags that would actually kill or injure a person, now are just there to make sure the audience isn't bored. And along with that, many jokes come out of nowhere and make no sense as to why they're even in the film, along with really obscure scenes that are just simply there to make you laugh, serving no purpose. The plot of this film was very basic, and could've been more funny if the movie was trimmed down by cutting the stupid jokes and putting more character background, or development. In the movie, Rod is a wannabe stunt guy who is trying to take after his dead father stuntman. His step-dad shows him no respect, and is dying of a heart ailment. In order to keep his step-dad alive long enough to beat him up, he needs to raise 50,000 bucks. Can he do it?.....who cares. The characters are too dumb and strange to be likable, and every joke, except for one very odd scene featuring 'cool beans', was taken from other movies. Even the ending of the film seems oddly familiar, similar to a certain 2004 film that was much better. In the end, this got a couple genuine laughs, a few laughs with the audience and a blank stare for the other 90 minutes.My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.",1,13,38,20 August 2007
The Thing," Slow moving, but with some genuine scares, and amazing effects!
","It's no wonder why John Carpenter's The Thing has gained a cult status today. The special effects in this movie are amazing, and possibly the best looking animatronics ever in a movie. The scares are plentiful, with lots of effective jump scenes. This movie may be slow moving, but it has enough content to please any horror or science fiction fan.An Antartic research station of twelve men is alarmed when a strange body is found near an abandoned Norwegian research station. It looks like nothing ever before seen. Soon after the find, the team realizes that there is a shape shifting alien amongst them, and it can take any form. The Thing (as it is called) can take over anybody and change them into bizarre monsters. RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) takes charge when no one else will and tries to find who the monster is. Lots of scares and violently amazing effects ensue.If nothing else, this movie should be remembered for it's animatronic effects. These are some amazing animatronic creatures, and the most realistic looking one's of any of these 80s movies. One of the best looking scenes features a husky dog being eaten by a Thing husky imitator, with it's bloody tentacles wrapped around the dog.The direction is good. Lots of establishing shots are used, and where in most movies this would be annoying, it's fine here. The characters are a bit generic, but they have enough likability to them to make them stand out. The story can be very tense, and many scenes should have your heart racing. The musical score is...OK. It's a bit scarce, with the main theme being a bass pluck. It worked for Jaws, but it's not quite as effective here.This is a slow paced movie, and the action scenes are few and far between, but if you can keep your attention focused on more than just violence, this will be an enjoyable horror film filled with some spectacular special effects.My rating: *** out of ****. 105 mins.

The Shining," I don't feel that this was a masterpiece.
","Directed by: Stanley Kubrick. Stars: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall and Scatman Crothers. In order for a movie to be a classic, I feel that at first viewing it has to reach you and you have to understand it. Many classics often have second viewings, but don't need them. This needs a second viewing. It is a confusing and overly long psychological thriller about a man's descent into insanity when stuck in a cabin with his wife and kid. This is a horror film, though I find it more disturbing than scary. It's a pretty good movie, but it just didn't reach out to me as it did for others.My rating: ***/****. 141 mins. rated R for full frontal nudity, violence and language.",7,1,3,31 July 2006
American Beauty," A truly beautiful film.
","Stars: Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suavri and Peter Gallagher.This is probably the most thought provoking film I've ever seen. It deals with Lester (Spacey) going through changes. His sex life with his wife Carolyn is non existent, his daughter hates him and he's grown a strong obsession with his daughter's friend. New neighbors move in, the dad being a mean, intolerant military man, and the son being a pot smoking teen that shares his stuff with Lester. Lester soon starts lifting wieghts for his daughter's friend. Meanwhile, the neighbor Ricky falls in love with Lester's daughter, Jane, but his dad thinks hes a homosexual. To top all this off, Carolyn is cheating on Lester. I really felt moved by the end of the film. Among the first words we hear in the film are from Lester saying, 'In less than a year from now, I will be dead.' That is true, but all the events that lead up to his death and extremely compelling and when you realize he's about to die, you know that he's achieved what he's been looking for. And not only has he achieved it, but he's helped others come through their problems and his monologue is so true. I completely recommend this wonderful and quite beautiful film.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Perhaps a tad overrated, but an impressive and entertaining action film nonetheless.
","This film was released 20 years ago now, and looking on it now, it's still amazing they managed to make this then. Computer generated effects were not nearly as prevalent or as easy to pull off as they are today, and because of these facts, this movie is a really interesting piece of cinema history. And at the time, the effects were amazing, sort of like how many feel about Avatar today, but is this film really one of the best of all time? I'm going to say no, and in addition to that, the original Terminator which was done on a much smaller budget is a better film.So, it's been 13 years since the first Terminator, and Sarah Connor is now in an insane asylum after all of her nonsensical ramblings of Terminators got too much for people. Her son John Connor is living in a foster home and he's now a hoodlum. To top off all these wacky family dynamics, a reprogrammed Terminator is sent back in time to protect John, who, in the future, is the leader of the war against the machines. Sent to kill John is a T-1000 model shape shifter Terminator disguised cleverly as Robert Patrick in a cop uniform. After various plot developments, Sarah Connor decides she must assassinate the man who created the original Terminator so all of this could end. Chaos ensues.To start with the positives, this movie has some awesome action scenes. A motorcycle/bus chase in a drainage ditch is a pretty cool way to kick start the action in this picture. The special effects for the time are amazing, and still today, they look good. The characters are likable enough to get the audience rooting for them. Even Arnie as a robot gained audience support in his programmed quest. The movie at times, is funny, and many one liners that might have come off as corny, come off as tongue and cheek amusing. The final 20 minutes or so of the film are really good, and make up mostly for the middle lag. And Robert Patrick plays an excellent villain. His uncaring stare is very menacing.The negatives...well, how about that John Connor? Edward Furlong gave a good performance, but, perhaps they could've given the kid less corny lines of dialogue. From time to time, the kid came off as irritating, completely due to the dialogue he had to work with. The first half of the movie is really good, and action packed, and interesting to see how Sarah copes with living in the nut house. When Sarah decides to go kill Terminator creator Miles Dyson, the film goes downhill. Why exactly? Hard to say. Sarah Connor is only doing what she can to save the world, but she becomes somewhat unlikable here, and after the long opening where she and John meet up for the first time in several years, she leaves again. And she didn't even seem that happy to see her son, the supposed 'savior of the human race' to begin with. It almost seemed as though when the T-1000 went off for long periods of time, the movie became slightly less interesting. And I'm not one who wanted Mr. Patrick on screen all the time, it just wasn't as exciting, and the characters weren't well written enough for the amount of time they were given for development (except for Arnold). The only specific scene that really irritated me was when John called for help as the Terminator grabbed him. He's screaming for help, and then when two guys come up to help, John chews them out. What a little punk. This boy who cries wolf better watch out or he's going to get killed by people trying to help him. This scene actually mars John's character a bit, but perhaps I'm just venting my extreme dislike of him pointlessly being a jerk.Overall, this is a great action film...meaning the action scenes were mostly great. The movie lags a bit in the middle, and the writing isn't as good as it could be (writing is clearly not one of Mr. Cameron's strong points), but overall, this is one interesting film. A must see for fans of Arnold, or fans of James Cameron. I liked the first Terminator better because it almost played as a character piece, while this is pure action. Either way, these two movies make for an interesting contrast, and definitely should be watched.My rating: *** out of ****. 150 mins. R for violence.",8,2,4,12 January 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Felt like a bunch of typical SNL skits.
","Walk Hard looked really funny from the trailers....it wasn't. With all the talented actors and writers working on this, it still wasn't very good.Walk Hard follows the life of singer Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly). Reilly is a very talented guy, but he had nothing to work with. Even the jokes that could've possibly been funny were poorly executed and ruined. It's obvious that, since this is a parody of movies about musicians, might as well include every musician of each time period. The musician (or actors pretending to be musician) cameos mostly also fell flat, mainly because anytime a musician appears, the humor is based on exaggerated versions of the actual musicians, not jokes. Elvis was a ladies man jerk, Buddy Holly was young, the Beatles were hippie druggies. It's not funny making entire scenes pointing this out. The cameo actors got annoying sometimes too, but they were occasionally amusing. However, with the negatives, this was, at times, pretty funny. It was thoroughly entertaining, with very few lulls of boredom, though there were quite a few parts with no laughter.Overall, this was an entertaining, thought not very funny movie. It could've been much better.My rating: ** out of ****. 90 mins. R for language, sexuality, nudity.",5,3,8,9 January 2008
Disturbia," Steals some from every genre, but still doesn't fully work.
","Disturbia is about Kale, a kid whose father passed away a year ago in a car accident. When asked one too many questions by his Spanish teacher, he punches him and gets put on house arrest (No, he doesn't break his leg.) Of course, chaos ensues when he begins to believe his neighbor is a murderer, so he stakes out trying to find out. Overall it's an OK movie. There's really nothing special about it, and at times, it can get overly corny. Though I liked Shia Labeuf, he's really not much of an actor. He acts like himself, or like a mad himself, but he never get any emotion across to me. The actress playing his love interest was OK, and the guy playing his friend was also OK, but again, nothing special. The movie itself was just a shell of the Hitchcock classic Rear Window. Rear Window is a much better film, but if you want to check this mediocre film out go ahead.My rating: ** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for violence and language",5,0,2,5 May 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Kind of a decent by-the-numbers mystery caper
","David Fincher in recent years has grown to become one of America's best known directors working today. He has an interesting, oftentimes dark visual style that he features, and usually he has an interesting story to tell. Unfortunately, in this film, the story is just not interesting enough. It's kind of a typical murder mystery film, with some twists and turns, and an ending that really isn't too shocking. What raises this up from being completely mediocre is Rooney Mara's performance as the title character. Otherwise, this story here doesn't have enough weight or originality to stand out over other pretty good mystery films.Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who's fallen out of favor after possible slanderous reporting. He is called upon by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the ex- CEO of a company, to solve the mystery of his missing and presumed dead niece who disappeared 40 years ago. He ends up being partnered with an anti-social computer hacker, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who uses her skill and research to help solve the case. Mikael and Lisbeth ('The girl with the dragon tattoo') don't meet up until halfway through the film, and the first half features them each working separately. All the scenes in the first half of the film focusing on Lisbeth are very interesting. While Mikael gets immediately thrown into the main story, Lisbeth is given almost a character study (that furthers along the plot) for the first half of the film. Rooney Mara is really great here, giving the character layers, with such understated acting. The character is emotionally disturbed and apparently 'crazy' but any trait is hidden beneath this straight and unflinching face. Daniel Craig's character, on the other hand, is not nearly as interesting, and for some reason, he mumbles here a lot, so he's also hard to understand at times. The mystery he's trying to solve is interesting conceptually, but visually it's often hard to convey excitement when he's sitting alone reading up on research.When the characters finally meet, about 75 minutes into this 160 minute behemoth, the mystery story gels a bit more, mainly because Daniel Craig finally has someone interesting to interact with. Where the film is lacking is largely in the story. The revelation at the end as to the connections of murders, and potential villains aren't that interesting. The resolution of the film must take darned near 30 minutes, and the main thing I took away from the film, was what a great performance Ms. Mara gave, and what an interesting character she played. The plot is by-the-numbers mystery, and the film does at times drag. David Fincher's direction is alright, but he doesn't make researching the murder much more than mundane. He throws in a few disorienting movements of the camera's placement, but other than that, this doesn't feel like a really great David Fincher directed film. It feels more like an O.K. mystery thriller, that has a great performance, some tense moments, and overall just kind of slips out of one's memory after a while. This film isn't bad by any means, it just doesn't have enough going for it to make it anything more than somewhat generic, other than the character of Lisbeth. It is overlong, though not bloated, and really not a lot could have been cut out without either cutting the story, or getting rid of good character scenes. The mystery is sort of interesting, but not nearly engaging enough. The final scene in the film was very good however, and mixed character development with a sort of sadness, giving the film a bittersweet feeling. The title character basically saves this film, and rises it above mediocrity, though not quite enough above.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 160 mins. R for violence, sexuality and brief nudity.",6,3,7,26 December 2011
Dreamgirls," A good musical brought up by stellar back-up performances!!!
","Stars: Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudsen, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Anika Rose, Keith Robinson, John Lithgow.I'm going to start this review with the parts that blew me away first. Jennifer Hudsen, an ex-American Idol top 12 member, played the role of Essie, and I feel she could easily win best supporting actress this year. She sang wonderfully, and she was excellent. The next actor that really amazed me was Eddie Murphy. Not only did Eddie Murphy sing brilliantly, but he played a sleaze bag role that was still a very sympathetic character that you actually cared about. The direction was great, and the writing was great. The negatives for this...none really. I didn't think any of the other actors did a particularly excellent job, except maybe Glover who just has a screen presence about him. I really enjoyed this film, and I recommend you see it!! My rating: *** out of ****. 127 mins. PG-13 for Language, Sex, and Drug Use.",8,0,3,27 December 2006
Being John Malkovich," A movie that I don't really like, but I respect
","Being John Malcovich-starring: Catharine Keener, John Cusack, John Malcovich, Cameron Diaz, Orson Bean, Mary Kay Place, W. Earl Brown and Charlie Sheen.This movie is just weird. It deals with a puppeteer (John Cusack) wanting to get a job, and when he finds one....wow! He works on the 7 1/2 floor of a building, which is only 5 and a half feet tall!! He meets a lady (Catharine Keener) that he falls in love with even though he is married (Cameron Diaz) to a nut animal freak. He finds a door in his office that leads to John Malchovich (an actor) and he becomes his conscience. His wife tries it out and finds out that she is a lesbian. By the way, you can only go in for 15 minutes. Catharine Keener then goes on a date with John Malchovich when Cameron Diaz is in him (So she's going out with him and her as his conscience) John Cusack finds out how to control John Malchovich and it works. He stays in him for about eight months. Bizarre, huh? Catharine Keener is also a lesbian in the end. She gets pregnant by Malchovich while Diaz is in him, so it's their lesbian love child. The question is, why is their a door to Malchovich? It's because these old people are trying to live forever by going from body to body, taking over minds. In my opinion, the ending is brilliant. It ends where Cusack took the next body available and got trapped forever in her conscience with no control. It's a weird but fun movie. The most interesting scene is when Malchovich goes into his own portal and sees the world where everybody has his face (But women still have boobs and they wear their own clothes) The only word they can say is malchovich. It's a movie I don't like, but I respect greatly. Charlie Sheen briefly plays Charlie, Malchovich's actor friend, who is in a couple of scenes. The scene he's in at the end shows him in eight years balding. This movie is not for all, but all should respect it. My rating: 4 out of 5.",8,0,1,2 February 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Hiliarious comedy!!!
","Steve Carell, Catharine Keener, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogan, Romany Malco, Elizibeth Banks, Leslie Mann, David Koechner and Mo Collins.Hilarious movie about Andy Stiltzer(Carell) who wakes up erect every morning, wanting more. Everyone thinks he's a freak, until they find out he's a virgin and they try to get him to have sex. He trys all kinds of things, but eventually meets a special woman(Keener), who is actually a grandmother. Hilarious, if not extremely nasty..featuring multi colored dildos, blowing up condoms, porno movie watching, talk of f***ing horses and more. Carell is really dorky, so it's fun to root him on to have sex. Funny and all around great way to spend just short of two hours. The three anchormen from Will Ferrell's Anchorman all appear including Carell(Obviously), Rudd(As his work buddy) and Koechner(As a dad proud of his kid for having sex).My favorite scene is one at a sex clinic.my rating- A minus. rated R for strong, nonstop sexual content/innuendo, a scene of sexuality, some brief crude humor, Strong nonstop language and a lot of nudity.113 mins.",8,1,2,2 September 2005
She's the Man," How could anyone give this a positive review?!!!!
","starring: Amanda Bynes, Channing Tatum, Laura Ramsey, Julie Haggerty and David Cross.The simplest of plots and the stupidest of movies. Viola (Bynes) switches places with her, not so look-alike twin brother at a private high school to play soccer. This film has the lamest lines and is so corny I was looking up at the ceiling feeling embarrassed that these (semi) talented young stars would even be in this. The only times I laughed in this film were when the Principal played by David Cross had something so stupid to say that it was mildly amusing. In no way do I recommend this film to anyone except for maybe 8 year old girls that are too young to understand quality.my rating-F. 98 mins. rated PG-13 for some mild sexual content and some mild language.",2,4,10,8 April 2006
Tropic Thunder," Clever, original and funny, Tropic Thunder lives up to it's expectation.
","Many reviews of this film have called it a mean shot at Hollywood. That has been used in both a negative and positive light, but either way, I didn't feel that was very true at all. Sure there is some references to Hollywood and actors in general, as there should be in a movie about that. The only Hollywood aspect shown as a negative is the heartless producer, played by no longer surprise guest Tom Cruise. I felt I'd get this out of the way first, but whether or not you find the biting satire of Hollywood to be plentiful, I'm sure you'll find the laughs are.A new huge budget movie, Tropic Thunder is currently being directed, by newcomer filmmaker Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) none the less. The actors in the movie include aging action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), method actor Kirk Lazerous (Robert Downey Jr.), comedic actor Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson). After a series of expensive blunders, the movie producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) becomes very angry. The writer of the book that the movie is based on, Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) decides how to solve the problems and suggests they shoot the movie guerrilla style, with hidden cameras in the trees. Take the boys to the action for authenticity. What we end up with is a small group of actors stuck in the jungles full of men who are ready and willing to torture and kill them.The jokes in this movie come at fairly fast rates, though not so fast as to stoop to lame crotch hit gags or typical fart jokes. The acting is usually perfect to the characters. Robert Downey Jr. plays a 'black man' and gives an over the top, but believable performance. If I shut my eyes and just listened, I could swear Brandon T. Jackson is Wanda Sykes with a sex change. Despite that he was a nice addition to the cast. Tom Cruise was a little too much at times, but he has a screen presence, so even when he was acting like a moron, it was fairly enjoyable. Jack Black was amusing in his drug addicted state and was normally funny, as was writer/director/actor Ben Stiller.The direction worked very well. It was mostly tight cuts and fast paced, but many scenes spoofed other war movies, and they are filmed how the other movies are. Ben Stiller has these war movies down, too. From the direction, to the lighting, to the acting, he obviously has seen many of these types of movies.Overall, this is a funny, enjoyable movie. It's violence doesn't make the tone any darker, either, which is good in this case.My rating: *** out of ****. 107 mins. R for language, violence and drug content.",8,3,9,30 August 2008
Enchanted," The commercials do this movie no justice.
","From the commercials, 'Enchanted' looked like a typical, run of the mill family film. They show a princess coming into New York with hip hop music playing, and make it look like the movie is filled with jokes involving the princess mistaking people for Disney characters, and the princess singing and doing embarrassing things in public, in which she is told to stop. It's not like that at all. When (soon to be) Princess Giselle sings, New York starts singing with her. She's bringing her fantastical world to New York more than New York quieting her down.After Giselle (Amy Adams) is saved by Prince Edward (James Marsden) from a troll, they are to be married. But Edward's wicked stepmother (Susan Sarandon) does not approve and throws Giselle into a seemingly bottomless well that leads straight to real life New York. Giselle meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a single working father, and learns about the real world, and gives the real world a reason to sing. Meanwhile, more cartoon characters go through the portal, and chaos ensues. One thing that really surprised me about 'Enchanted' was that there was no contemporary music. From the advertisements, it looked like there would be hip hop and rap to portray New York, but all the music in the film was created for the film, including a few new songs, by the wonderful Alan Menken (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.) The whole movie was really cute and sweet, but managed to not go overboard and how corny it was, which is often hard with kid's movies. The acting was good, as was the singing, and it was nice to see some traditional Disney animation, which hasn't been seen theatrically since 2004's 'Home on the Range'.Overall, this was a well put together, fun movie, with a fantastic musical score. I thinks kids and adults alike will enjoy this one.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild violence.",9,2,4,25 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," An amazing movie.
","The Coen brothers are known for making very good movies, and this is no exception. The Coen brothers are also known for making strange films and screwing with the audience, and this does that more than any of their other movies. And because of this, some people will not like this, and even though I was angry from some choices the Coens made, I still loved this!Llewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds 2 million dollars out in the desert, from what appears to be a drug deal gone bad. What he didn't expect (and who would) was Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one of the worst villains the screen has ever seen. Meanwhile, the town sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to figure out exactly what's going on, and how he'll deal with it. This movie is amazing in every sense of the word. The direction is perfect. It's almost as though the camera is following people around in their everyday life, which makes this movie feel very real. The acting is wonderful, with the cast being led by Josh Brolin as a redneck who's in a whole lot of trouble. We get next to no background on him (or any character), yet we still care about them. Their characters are revealed through their actions, which is very rare in movies. The writing is my only gripe. I loved the dialog, loved everything about this writing, but the ending. I suppose the ending was effective in conveying a message, and it got it's point across, but along with that, it almost felt like a fade out, with no real ending. My only gripe is that ending, which will bother most of the people who see this. Everything else was amazing, making this one of the best movie-going experiences in years for me.My rating: **** out of ****. 120 mins. R for violence.",10,0,7,24 November 2007
The Love Guru," Guru Pitka is a less likable version of Austin Powers.
","Of all things about this mess of a movie, the most surprising to me was the character of Guru Pitka. I thought he would be a silly character, but one who cared about others. He was surprisingly more crude and horny than Austin Powers, and the character, and Mike Meyers himself, just couldn't stay away from the wiener jokes. I took a count on how many male genital jokes were in this film, and I came up with 39, which means every 2 minutes there was a genital joke, which shows how far Mike Meyers was stretching for a script.Guru Pitka (Mike Meyers) is a self help guru who focuses mainly on people's love lives, and gives stupid seminars in which he uses mnemonics for his multi-step programs that usually spell out dirty words. Pitka is living in the shadow of a rival guru Deepak Chopra, and more than anything, Pitka wants to get on Oprah so he can become a more respected guru. He tries to help a hockey player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), who's marriage is on the rocks, to get publicity. The manager of the team died a few years back and his daughter Jane (Jessica Alba) is running the team now. Pitka both falls for her and wants to help her self esteem. Bad jokes ensue.There are so many negatives to this film, and very few positives, but there are positives, and this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact, this isn't even the worst of the year. Meet the Spartans was worse, and this was a treat compared to that. But nonetheless, I'll start with the negatives here. The characters are just awful. As I've said, Pitka was very unlikable and acted like an annoying 12 year old. Justin Timberlake was obnoxious as a rival hockey player who was dating Darren's wife. Every joke based around him has to do with the size of his privates...funny, huh!? Verne Troyer aka Mini Me plays the Hockey Coach and he was better when he didn't talk much. Steven Colbert is seen throughout as a hockey announcer, and though he can be funny, he needs the right material to play off of, and this is not it. Ben Kingsley plays my favorite character, who's name is so long I don't want to spell it out. He plays Pitka's mentor is flashbacks back in India, and though he's not funny, Kingsley just has a presence that no one else in this sorry picture could even try to emulate. His character is pretty similar to Mike Meyers in View from the Top, so he's really not bringing much new to the table, unfortunately. We also are treated to some really random cameos, like Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Mariska Hargitay and the very random Val Kilmer. What an eclectic group they have. The direction is okay, but it doesn't really matter, because it's the writing that does this one in. Mike Meyers wanted to play Austin Powers again I guess, so he created an Indian carnation of him that manages to be a lot less funny, more crude, and dare I say, a character that's even more sex starved.Onto the positives. There were a few moments where I laughed, and they were generally ones after long sustain periods of boredom, and the scenes caught me by surprise because they were mildly amusing. The acting isn't bad, the characters are, so the acting is a positive. I was mildly entertained at moments throughout, but overall this was just a horribly written mess that relied way too little on brain, and way too much on jokes about the male second brain. I found Pitka's appearance on the season finale of American idol funnier than anything in this movie.My rating: * out of ****. 85 mins.

Twilight," Flashy, but not too much more.
","Would you like to see a romance movie where every character gives a similar reading to Ben Stein? Is a vampire movie about vampires who play baseball and eat deer to survive interesting? Now how about mixing Ben Stein-like characters in a boring romance, with the vampire addition. Sounds boring? It is.Bella (Kristen Stewart) is new to a boring Washington town. She goes to school and eventually makes friends with a guy who initially seemed to be repulsed by her, Edward (Robert Pattinson). He eventually reveals that he and his friends are vampires, so Bella joins Edward and his vampire buddies in their mundane chores, and along the way forms a romance.The problem with this movie is really the style of acting. Every character acts as though they have gone through some terrible tragedy, and none of them show any emotion except for a sad depression. The conversations here are unrealistic, and the characters all feel flat. They are given traits, given to them through conversation about them, but never show any personality. Watching cardboard boxes is more exciting than watching these guys act.Despite an uninteresting script, this movie is stylishly directed. It looks pretty good, and the dark, grey look it has throughout sets a tone that the actors only made boring. One scene that goes overboard with the glitz is a baseball game between the vampires, and this scene is just dumb. The film is sped up and slowed down at random, and it feels like a bad music video. But other than that, this is a good looking film.'Twilight' is a well made film for the money that went into it. But just because something is well made, doesn't make it good, and the script is just not very interesting, and the actors only make it worse. Hopefully the sequel film will introduce us to these characters, because this only introduced us to clichéd cardboard characters.My rating: ** out of ****. 121 mins.

28 Days Later...," The first hour was fresh and entertaining...then comes the climax and there goes the picture.
","'28 Days Later' stands above the typical horror movie, and by a lot too. Unfortunately, the average horror movie is so bad, that this would have to be terrible not to be better. This is actually really good for a horror movie. It has realistic acting, characters we care about, scary antagonist zombies that lead to several heart racing scenes and dialogue that's just fine. The climax is what brought this movie down a notch. It was loud, and nonstop, and everything that defined what the first part of the movie is, is not used in the climax.After an outbreak of an infectious disease, the world's population is moving away from humans and now is being lead by brain dead and blood hungry zombies. Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma 28 days after this disease took hold of the human race. He ends up meeting other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris), a tough woman who will kill anyone infected in a split second, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). These few survivors go off to find more survivors and end up finding a military base where the study these zombie creatures by chaining them up. Chaos ensues when one gets loose.The first part and good portion of this movie is different from most horror films. It's quiet, except for zombie attacks which will catch you by surprise, and the characters act very reserved, but it's not boring. It's like a character study, and the characters are interesting. Instead of showing lots of zombie violence (which it does have some), it's more about the characters and how they're coping and what they're thinking. Once on the military base, this movie takes a turn for the worse. It grows overly violent, and the climax is equivalent to a bunch of loud screaming while throwing blood and guts at the camera. This type of climax works better in comically violent films, such as Peter Jackson's 'Dead Alive' or Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead II', but here it's a step in the wrong direction. Then we get to the ending. It may not be anything new, but it's an effective and good ending.I enjoyed everything about this movie, except for the climax. But even with a climax like this has, this is an exceptional zombie movie. The acting and writing are realistic and the characters created are ones we care about. The direction is good, as is the camera direction. Much better than the sequel this movie produced. Overall, this is a similar plot (The Omega Man) but it brings enough new to the genre to make it a success.My rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins. R for violence and language.",7,3,4,2 November 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Pales in comparison to the first, and even to the third.
","If looked at alone, this Jurassic Park, is a technical marvel. The computer generated dinosaurs are fantastic looking, and even better are the animatronics that seem as real as any human character here. The direction is about as good as it can be, and obviously Steven Spielberg knows how to direct a good flick. However, in the future maybe he should spruce up the script a bit before filming just anything. 'The Lost World' Jurassic Park' tries to have a heart as big as the first movie's, but when your whole story is based around an uncaring sarcastic comedian, it's kind of hard.Dr. Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum), the character who worked so well in the first movie but falls flat here, is back for more crazy adventures. John Hammond (Richard Attenbrough), creator of Jurassic Park reveals to him a second island full of dinosaurs, and Malcom goes to the island to retrieve his annoying girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore), and ends up meeting some dinosaur poachers. The climax of the film involves a tranquilized Tyrannasaurus Rex being brought to San Diego, and of course escaping and causing chaos.Ian Malcom was great in the first Jurassic Park but not so great here...why is this? In the first movie, we had a wide range of characters with different personalities to root for or against. Here, we have him, his girlfriend, his stowaway adopted daughter, and the one dimensional poachers who everyone could care less about. Not much to choose from in the character department. The heart that we got to see from the first movie, particularly in the extremely sweet ending, is missing completely. This movie is all talking and action. And the action scenes are fantastic. The T-Rex going around San Diego is a great scene. The raptors trying to dig into a building is somewhat pulse pounding, as is the scene where men try going through tall grass inhabited by raptors. One scene involving an RV looks great, and in this way I can say this entire movie was built to be a roller-coaster ride film. And it would have the same thrills from the first film, if only it had some likable characters. Even the third film succeeds in that department.If this is looked at as anything but nonstop scenes of dino action, it's bad, and in the end, this was a very mediocre film.My rating: ** out of ****. 123 mins.

Cars," Though still a good movie, this is by far Pixar's worst.
","Cars is a good movie. It's got some really cool looking animation with detailed sets and well developed characters. It's entertaining and fun, and sometimes funny, though the funny scenes tend to appeal more to children's' senses of humor. The voice acting fits well and Cars has quite an ensemble voice over cast. So why is this the worst Pixar movie? Well, some elements of this film felt far-fetched to me, and I know I'm talking about a movie based around a world of cars, but still, some realism is needed.Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is the fastest race car of them all. After a big race he is being taken to another race in a pick up truck when he falls asleep and rolls out of the car causing damage to a small town called Radiator Springs. In order to leave the town, he has to fix up all the messes he made, and in the process he grows a connection to the town, and makes some friends, something he didn't have many of before because of his hectic racing schedule. He becomes good friends with Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a simpleton tow truck, and he becomes romantically interested in Sally (Bonnie Hunt). Lightning has now gone missing, and is needed for his next race. Will he choose his stardom, or the cars he's come to love?One major problem I had with this movie was Lightning's sudden connection to this town. It takes him no longer than 2 minutes to become connected to this town that he's only been in for a day...it's just a bit unrealistic, even for a cartoon. I also didn't like the cutesy pie lines thrown in, which weren't in any other Pixar film. Tow Mater, who Lightning doesn't even know very well, states that Lightning is his best friend. That either is a fault on the writer's part for trying to speed up the process of great friendship by 100 times, or it shows how everyone hates Tow Mater, and I'm pretty sure the latter isn't the case. Because this movie is only under 2 hours, it can only have so much time passing, but I just have a hard time buying the friendships that these characters make. Compared to the other Pixar movies the plot just isn't as interesting either. Luckily it has enough of it's Pixar charm to make it an entertaining adventure, if not a very lame one for Pixar's extremely high standards they've set.My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins.

Insidious," One of the best horror films I've seen in years!
","I rarely go to see horror films in the theaters anymore, mainly because 90% or more are complete garbage. They are only there to give a cheap scare, and feature bad acting, and awful scripts. This movie gives some cheap scares, but it also gives more than that. It features images that have been stuck in my brain. It's not all quick jump scenes, but instead, it also has scenes that scare without having a blast of music or a quick run across the screen. This is a film that wants to, and almost transcends the genre of typical horror fare, but kind of falls into a middle ground between trashy horror films and well thought out horror films. Either way, it is still one of the best horror films to come out in the last few years.After their son falls into a mysterious coma, Josh and Renai Lambert begin seeing and hearing frightening things in their new house. They decide to move, and still, mysterious creatures inhabit the house. After calling in a psychic, they learn that their boy is a skilled astroprojector, and in his sleep, his soul traveled too far from his body, and was trapped by malevolent spirits. It's up to Josh to think back to his repressed childhood and astroproject himself to find his son in a horrifying place called 'The Further'.This horror movie has something that most recent one's haven't, and that's likable lead characters that the audience actually cares about. Unlike typical 'kill 'em off' horror flicks, this film develops it's leads enough for the audience to root for them, instead of rooting for their death. The writing wasn't too bad, and the decisions the characters make don't usually come off as completely idiotic. Often in horror films, the characters never seem to remember the scene before and stay in the house for another night, and while there is a little bit of idiocy going on here, the characters seem real for the most part and don't forget previous scenes of terror just to keep them conveniently in harm's way.Horror is the genre here, so the question is, 'Is this movie scary?' I would say it definitely is. The atmosphere is tense, and even when nothing is happening, and we aren't waiting for something to happen, things can be really creepy. A scene where Patrick Wilson is looking at drawings is enormously creepy, and never does a jump happen, or does the film make you believe one is coming. A few images here have stuck with me, and when they appeared in the film, they were both genuinely startling, and disturbing, where they stay with you much after the movie is over. And this film is consistently scary. Even the chaotic musical score was scary, and fairly memorable, and I haven't had the music in a horror film stick with me since maybe 'The Sixth Sense'. Rottentomatoes has started writing sillier and less reflective summaries of their movies since they hooked up with Flixter, and this one is a great example of how much I disagree with them. They refer to the third act as shaky...I would actually say that was the most original and interesting part of the entire movie. The astroprojected world is an example of how this film transcends the typical horror movie. It's so creative, and understated at the same time. It's dark, and creepy, but also surreal and artistic, and the creativity of the third act makes this movie feel more like the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street' or 'Poltergeist' than say 'One Missed Call'. The dream world is dark and hard to see, but that only makes it all the more fascinating, and the whole trip to 'The Further' is worth admission price alone. It's an original aspect of a not-so original, but nonetheless effective movie. It was thrilling to see such a competently made and genuinely scary movie in this ever dwindling genre. I highly recommend this one, for a good and scary time at the movies, with a film that surely won't be soon forgotten like so many others of the genre.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for terror and violence, and language.",8,5,11,2 April 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," There could easily be an X-Men 4.
","stars: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Kelsey Grammar, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart, Ellen Page, Shawn Ashmore, Rebecca Romjin, Anna Paquin, James Marsden, Aaron Stanford and Ben Foster. Cameo by Stan Lee.This is a fairly short film that has a big plot, which is what is it's problem. The plot is that Jean Grey (Janssen) is back, but she can't conrtol her evil side. She goes with Magneto (McKellen) and is the most powerful mutant. Meanwhile, people have found a cure for mutants, and Magneto and his bunch rally against it, but Rogue (Paquin) feels its the only way for her to have a normal relationship. The actual action doesn't kick in until about an hour in, but it shouldn't displease X-Men fans. If you watch past the end credits, you should realise that a sequel could easily happen, though at the end, two of our X-Men are dead (again some will say three, but watch after the end credits). So, in conclusion I do recommend this, for the good action scenes, some funny lines and good special effects.My rating: B. 98 mins. (Not counting credits) rated PG-13 for strong violence, sexual content and some language.",8,6,12,27 May 2006
Across the Universe," The Beatles songs fit in perfectly (for the most part) in this otherwise mediocre film.
","'Across the Universe' is a brilliantly directed film that wants to be more than a typical love story, but has a hard time. The fantasy musical numbers are really half and half with wonderful and strange. Even the strange ones are enjoyable, though confusing.The film deals with a young man from Liverpool, Jude, who's in America to meet his dad, and Lucy, a well to do American girl. They fall in love, while the Vietnam war is still raging. Lucy's brother Max has to go in. Subplots from characters named after Beatles songs like Sadie the aging rocker, and Prudence the closeted homosexual come into play. It's really pretty standard fare material. The musical numbers make this a fun movie. With that said, 'Across the Universe' does have a good sense of humor for a drama/musical. Though the characters aren't overly developed, they are all still likable.I enjoyed this film very much, but it did have it's problems. Sometimes it felt like a surrealistic masterpiece, and sometimes it felt like 'Blues Brothers 2000'. Luckily the surrealistic masterpiece won over the other.My rating: *** out of ****. 126 mins.

The Mist," Did not live up to my expectations, but still a good enough movie.
","I guess I expected perfection from the guy who brought us 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Green Mile', and this movie was by no means perfect. However, it was a very entertaining horror movie with good characters, and even a few scares.After several strange accidents, a mist begins coming in from the mountains. All the residents of the town go to the local grocery store to get their supplies as the mist, and military roll through this little town. The mist eventually gets to this grocery store, and after a death, people realize that this mist has creatures in it. A large, eclectic group of people waits in the store while the mist waits for them. It sounds pretty stupid but it's actually very good. The direction was fantastic, and even though this wasn't mile a minute scares, it was still very tense throughout, while still managing to have a great sense of humor. The characters were exactly what you'd expect from a Frank Darabount adaptation of Stephen King's work; there was a wide range of characters, each (of the main) well developed and with their own unique personality. My huge gripe with the film in the end, was the end, which I did not like (and won't give away). But overall, the idea of making an entire horror movie in one place was scary enough and gave the audience an intimate feel with the settings, and this was a success, but not a huge standout film.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 122 mins. R for violence and language.",6,0,7,23 November 2007
I Am Legend," Not enough substance, but it was still very entertaining.
","'I Am Legend' runs at about 90 minutes without credits, and with very little background information or talking from Will Smith, we have no reason to support Will Smith on his conquest to survive.Will Smith plays Roger Neville, a scientist who tried to develop a cure for cancer, and ended up turning the people into vampire like creatures. He now is what appears to be the last living man on Earth, and he and his dog Sam try to keep on living life. Will Smith gave a good performance, but the character is so one dimensional. For most of the movie he seems very angry and serious, and then he has the occasional joke, that usually caused a light chuckle in the audience. He was still somehow likable, but he could've been a much better character, considering this whole movie is practically a one man show for him. Any other characters in the story don't have enough screen time for the audience to care about them, and they are very underdeveloped (even more so than him).A lot of action-horror movies are missing heart, and that's a big positive for this one. It has a heart, and it has some touching moments. This layered the movie and made it more than just a bunch of special effects and jump scenes right after each other.In the end, this was a good movie, but I preferred the Omega Man over this.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. PG-13 for violence.",7,3,6,14 December 2007
Shrek the Third," Didn't really care about this one.
","Stars: Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, Larry King, Amy Poehler, Cheri O'Terri, Eric Idle, Regis Philbin, John Cleese.This Shrek started out promisingly enough, but kind of fell flat. For some reason, this felt more like a television episode than a movie. However with that said, it still had enough fun moments to keep it afloat. The plot of this one is Shrek and Fiona are going to have kids. Shrek looks for a replacement king for Fiona's father, and travels to a high school to meet Arthur (Timberlake). Prince Charming and his bad guy goons take over the castle. All 3 plots are strung together to make the plot very diluted. One problem with this movie, is unlike the first two, it just didn't feel epic. It barely even felt like a fairy tale. The characters were also underused, including Donkey and Puss in Boots being there only to spout out one liners for no reason. Nonetheless though, it was fairly entertaining throughout, and most kids won't notice that this isn't at the level of the first, or even the second.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 84 mins. PG for crude humor and drug references.",6,0,1,2 June 2007
Back to the Future Part III," The worst of the trilogy, but still fairly entertaining.
","After the crazy fast paced special effects extravaganza second film, that takes us to not just 1985 and '55, but also 2015 and 1985A, you'd expect a just as exciting conclusion. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong, as the third film in the series is the slowest, with less plot than any of the others, and less at stake. With that said, the third film also gives a chance to slow down and see Doc and Marty's relationship, and a chance to no longer focus on special effects and cool set pieces, but instead on the characters. It's the least exciting of the three, but still a fairly good end to the trilogy.1985 Doc is stuck in 1885, and according to a grave Marty and 1955 Doc find, 1985 Doc is going to be killed by Biff's great grandfather, cowboy Bufford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. So Marty must travel back to 1885 to stop Doc from being killed, and to get both he and Doc back to 1985. Meanwhile, Doc has fallen in love with Clara (Mary Steenburgen), a science loving resident of 1885. After getting in the middle of things, Marty soon finds that he's the one that will be killed by Mad Dog, and he needs to find a way back.I'll start with the positives on this one. This was the slowest of the films, so it gave a time to stop and really soak up the environment, and linger on the characters. In this way, it was more like the first film than the second. The first one was pretty slow paced, but focused a lot on relationships, and this one does the same thing. The film has a nice atmosphere, and despite not being as impressive a set as the one's featured in the first, and especially the second, the western set is still impressive. This one also wraps itself up nicely, ties up all the loose ends introduced in the second film, addresses all the plot points mentioned in part two, and leaves us with a nice message to sum up the trilogy. The negatives? Well, this film just kind of feels anti-climactic. It's like the first film starts off slow and built up to the crazy fast paced second which is huge and puts everyone's life on the line, and then we get to the third, which is slower than the first film, and only prominently features Marty and Doc from the previous films. The film has somewhat of an exciting climax, that incorporates elements from all three films, but nothing is really new. Most of this stuff is just retread from the first two films, with only a few new elements. This is an entertaining film, and fairly fun, but definitely the weakest of the three films for me. It just feels like it's kind of running out of steam compared to the other two, but the ending leaves a nice message. My rating: *** out of ****. 115 mins. PG for language and violence.",7,0,2,26 October 2010
Transformers," A sci fi action flick, where everyone is a comedian, that isn't very funny or thrilling.
","Michael Bay is not the best director out there, but if there's one thing he can do, it's make a cruddy movie laden with special effects, ala Pearl Harbor. Transformers is so full of special effects my eyes practically burst from the nonstop effects. That's not a bad thing. In this case Michael Bay's big budget stupid blockbuster Transformers needed all these special effects. The problem with all his other films is how the effects consume the picture and there's no room for character development. There's character development here...so what's the problem? The characters suck! Other than Megan Fox who's on screen to bring in the teenage boys that would've seen this anyways, every character, including the Transformers, are comedians. That would be fine, but none of their comedic styles fit in what is supposed to be a popcorn munching action flick. There are many other problems to go with that, but this is what really annoyed me, though other people seemed to enjoy that.Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeuf) has a promise from his father that if he earns good grades, he will get a new car. He does, and he gets his new car...but it's not just a car. It drives him around sometimes, and plays music that fits the situation. In fact, this must not be a car at all. Of course not, it's a Transformer autobot named Bumblebee, and Sam is needed by the Transformers because of his late grandfather's run in with the bad bot, Decepticon, and Decepticon's code is imprinted on his g'pa's glasses. Meanwhile, Sam is going around with the popular cute girl in school Mikaela (Megan Fox), and she and Sam, along with several other story lines of people, featuring Anthony Anderson as a scared computer nerd, Jon Voight as the Secretary of Defense, John Turturro as a mean agent and Josh Duhamel as a military man, all have run in's with the Transformers, good or bad.I'll start with the negatives and move to the positives. The part of the movie where the car was playing love songs and driving itself was needed, I suppose, to move the plot along, but it reminded me of a bad rip-off of the Herbie the Love Bug movies. The humor was annoying (My biggest gripe!). Shia Labeuf has this manic, fast paced way he delivers each line, and after a while it gets very repetitive. The Transformers also do things that are supposed to be funny, like in one scene one of them drips fluid from their crotch area on someone, like they are peeing. This gets a big laugh from audiences, but for some reason only produced a dull groan in me. Anthony Anderson, known for his comedic roles, tells the female computer programmer he's with to be calm when the FBI comes in, and of course, he freaks out and starts crying...pretty obvious humor. Also, why does Optimus Prime want the cube attached to him? He doesn't think maybe they should attach it to the bad bot? I also didn't realize the Secretary of Defense just lets random people help him with problems...I certainly hope that's not the case.Onto the positives. I liked the constantly switching story lines, because it gave the characters just enough time to be annoying before switching them. The special effects were grand and cool, and expensive, featuring streets blowing up and many other cool things you can only see in a big budget like this (150 mil). Though the humor was often stupid, at least this has a light tone so it's not dreary to watch.Overall, this is a dumb blockbuster that put it's money where it's brains should be. But despite the problems, it was often entertaining, and I laughed a couple of times from the jokes that eventually just got to me ('Go to bed, handsome man').My rating: ** out of ****. 140 mins.

Men in Black II," Is this a movie, or a merchandising scheme?
","Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Stars: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Rip Torn, Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Tony Shalhoub and Patrick Warburton.This is a short and confusing, but quite entertaining sequel to the enormously popular Men in Black. The plot is confusing and kind of stupid, but it's a well done film (except for some of the special effects). One of my main problems with this, is that it all seems like a big merchandising scam. They introduce cute characters and not so cute ones that are quite memorable, just so they can make dolls of it, however I did think Frank the pug was a good addition to the film after making only a cameo in the first film. It's an entertaining film, but in no way is it good.** 1/2 out of ****. 82 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor.",6,0,1,31 July 2006
The Evil Dead," Night of the Living Dead meets the Excorcist...and this is better than both.
","This is a very silly movie...not as silly as the two sequels it spawned, but it's still silly. The violence is very over the top, and the villains of the film are creatures inhabiting the bodies of the characters, brought to life through black magic. The girl in the Excorcist said some pretty crazy stuff when she was possessed, and the characters here are just as rude and over the top. It's actually sometimes hilarious. At the same time, this is one of the most nerve wracking scariest horror flicks. You have no idea what's going to happen at any moment, and you feel for the protagonist Ash (Bruce Campbell) who's going through Hell trying to get out of this abandoned cabin.Five kids go into the woods to an abandoned cabin, and after playing back a tape recorder, and evil force is unleashed. They try to survive as these strange spirits try to kill them off and possess their bodies. In order to kill the possessed people, known as deadites, their heads must be dismembered, leading to a lot of gore, and some violent and scary scenes.Evil Dead, more than any other movie I've seen, has such a perfect mixture of slapstick and horror. These creatures are so vile and nasty, but at the same time somewhat humorous in their over the top nature, and the extreme gore effects. Someone could be chopping another person's head off, which would normally try to be scary, but here it's so over the top and the camera work is so fast it becomes comical. It's a really great mixture of humor and horror.Overall, this is a great movie, which spawned off two sequels that were actually superior to it.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins.

Fox, Darryl Hannah, Michael Bowen, Julie Dreyfus, Michael Madsen and Michael Parks.Quentin Tarantino is one of the most talented writers and directors out there. With this he showed off his directing talents, however the writing was almost nothing. This has less than half classic Tarantino dialogue and it's mostly consisting of strong bloody violence. This was a well done film, and many like it better than the much superior (in my opinion) Kill Bill 2. It was nice though to see Tarantino regular actors Uma Thurman, Michael Bowen (from Jackie Brown), Michael Madsen and Michael Parks. I recommend this but it's just a bit too flashy and not enough substance to keep it fully afloat.My rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins.

From Dusk Till Dawn," A fun and funny vampire horror comedy
","From Dusk till Dawn-George Clooney, Julliette Lewis, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Ernest Liu, Cheech Marin, Fred williamson, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, Salma Hayek, Michael Parks and Tito Larriva.WOW! This is one of those fun to watch on a boring night movies, and it is great. It is about two thieves (Clooney and Tarantino((Tarantino is also a murderer)) who take the Keitel, Lewis, and Lui family who take them to a Mexican strip club which is run unbeknownst to them, vampires. It is silly and gory, but at the same time, really great. Michael Parks plays Sheriff Earl McGraw in the opening, and is a great actor. He has been in Kill Bill 1 as Earl(despite the fact that he dies in this one), Kill Bill 2 as a Mexican pimp, From Dusk till Dawn 3 as the star of it and other films.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not bad, but unfortunately not as good as it could be.
","Stars: Freddie Highmore, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Missi Pyle, Christopher Lee, Deep Roy.I am a big fan of Tim Burton, so when I heard he was going to do a retelling of the book 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' I was excited. However this film is not as good as it could be. Johnny Depp, who usually gives perfect performances, gives a good performance, but goes over the top too often. As much as I found Depp's performance to be silly, I enjoyed Freddie Highmore's as Charlie. It's not a role that needed a particularly good actor, just one that seems likable, and Highmore pulled it off quite well. As for the movie itself, I felt that there is way too much building up to the Factory, and way too much time after the factory. The kids were only in the factory for less than half of the film, which defeated the purpose of it being called, 'and the Chocolate Factory.' Tim Burton has made worse, but he's also made much better.My rating: B-. 115 mins. PG for some violence",6,2,4,18 December 2006

The main plot is a series of flashbacks told by an old dying man, Ed Bloom, telling his son fantasy stories of his life that couldn't possibly have happened. His son, Will finds his dad to be crazy, but he tries to come to terms with him. The flashback story is very odd, including a poet turned bank robber, a giant, a town where nobody ever leaves, a witch that can tell you your death and even a circus master werewolf.This entire movie you know how it will end, and it does end how you think it will. The end is sad and touching, just like the entire movie. Without a doubt this movie is Burton's lightest project and I suggest you carry a box of tissues with you when you watch it.my rating: 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.

The Dark Knight," I had high expectations and they were met, if not exceeded.
","Leading up to seeing this movie, I had read dozens of reviews, mostly of praise for 'The Dark Knight'. But amongst the praise was critiques, and there were many reviews with the same critiques, making me worried this movie would only be good because of it's flaws. One of the mentioned flaws was that this film was very slow paced. I don't know what movies some reviewers saw, but though this is long, it is not slow paced, in fact, you could say it's the exact opposite. Especially towards the beginning, this is a fast paced movie, with lots of action. Along with that, it's one of the best movies of the year, and though it may sound clichéd to say this in a Dark Knight review, Heath Ledger will be remembered for this role, if any, as his finest moment(s) on the silver screen.Gotham City is in peril, and the only person who can save it is...Harvey Dent. New District Attorney Harvey Dent is bringing men to justice and throwing them in the clink, sometimes by the hundreds. Harvey's got a great girl, Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) old flame, Rachel Dawes (Now played by Maggie Gyllenhall). The Joker (Heath Ledger) is the new psycopath in town, and Batman, or Harvey Dent must stop him.What makes the Dark Knight so great is how well it works as both a superhero movie, and an action drama. If this wasn't a Batman movie, it would still be a fantastic action flick, not to say Batman is a throw away character, because he certainly isn't. The direction is very good, though there are a few action scenes that could have been filmed better.Heath Ledger is the performance that makes the movie, not because this was the movie that led to his unfortunate demise, but because he was amazing and captivating. Whether or not he will win Best Supporting Actor, he still has gotten critical acclaim for his portrayal of the psychopath. His performance is not a let down, he is just great. The other actors all do well too. Normally I think of Aaron Eckhart as being a B-movie actor, but here he shows what makes him a star. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, and okay as Batman. That annoying scratchy voice is, well, annoying. It's overused. Batman even uses it to talk to people that know he is Bruce Wayne. Maybe the suit cuts off his lungs or something. Maggie Gyllenhall is a fine actress in the role, though for varying reasons it felt a bit off having her playing Rachel. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman added a lot in supporting roles, and Gary Oldman plays a heck of a Officer/Commissioner Gordon.Now onto the negatives. The beginning of the movie had way too many short scenes of random characters that it felt like an anthology, and it didn't explain itself well enough until later. When the scenes began to be longer and stopped jumping from character to character, the movie got much better. One element missing from the film is drama that connects with the audience. Drama was plentiful, but I never felt connected with the characters enough to care what happens, probably because of the fast cut opening that helped to underdevelop the characters until later in the film.I miss Danny Elfman. His musical score brought life to the first two Batman films, and the musical score here is just loud and annoying and adds nothing. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard are talented, so what were they doing here? Overall, this was one of the better Batman movies, and is also one of the best movies of the year. It's not perfect, but perfection is hard to find, and even in it's imperfection, it outshines most movies this year.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. PG-13 for violence.",9,4,9,18 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Poor compared to the Goblet of Fire film, but still pretty good.
","I have not been a huge fan of any of the Potter films except for the fourth, and this wasn't as good. This Potter entry deals with a new professor of the dark arts, Mrs. Umbridge coming on, and she takes over the school pretty fast becoming headmaster. Meanwhile Harry, Ron and Hermoine get an army of kids together to fight Voldemort who has returned. Like most Potter films, this doesn't explain itself enough, so quite often if you haven't read the books, this will have you scratching your head. The acting, as always, was very good and all the kids and old British actors did a great job. One good thing that this movie has is it almost has a small time feel. Though there are many scenes with special effects, it is nowhere near as special effect heavy as the the last four, and it also has smaller sets and less characters. Plus, this is a long book, and the movie runs at 128 minutes without credits making it the shortest of the movies. It was good, but it could've been better.My rating: *** out of ****. 128 mins.

2001: A Space Odyssey," A classic for many reasons, but not a perfect movie.
","When released in 1968, these special effects blew people away...and I can see why. These are some great special effects, even for now. It seems as though Kubrick's whole reason for making this was to capture the beauty of classical music being played to long scenes of interesting space sets and special effects. While it was very interesting for it's time, it's lost some pizazz now that every movie has this. However the part of the film that is still really interesting today is the Dawn of Man opening segment where man's ape like descendent's learn how to commit violence. It's amazing how ape like they actually got these creatures to look, while still having a weird human like quality to them. The biggest story in the film was a spaceship's extremely intelligent computer Hal is taking over the ship. It's an interesting plot, but one that doesn't kick in until late in to the film. The main problems with this movie are it's lack of a real central plot and no explanation for many supernatural things that happen, but nonetheless, this is still a classic for many reasons, but even a classic can be flawed.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 147 mins.

Toy Story," PIXAR set the very high bar here for CGI films, and have been hovering around or above it since.
","PIXAR is a brand that is now synonymous with quality, and it's not hard to see why this is. They have consistently made wonderful animated pictures that are very funny and heartwarming, and all have memorable and soon to be iconic scenes. They never pander to children, nor do they rely on cheap gags or melodrama. This film is the epitome of what PIXAR is about. 'Toy Story' is one of the greatest animated films, that in recent years has only been topped by a few other PIXAR films.In the world this film sets up, toys are all alive, though they don't let that known to people. They play their roles are toys and when the people are not in sight, they talk about their job of being played with, and their personal lives. It's Andy's birthday, and all the toys in his room are worried about this fate with new toys coming in. Woody the cowboy doll is the leader of the group and is Andy's favorite toy, but Andy just received a new space toy, Buzz Lightyear, and now Woody is playing second fiddle and he doesn't like that. After mistakenly knocking Buzz out the window, the toys turn on Woody and he and Buzz end up on an adventure trying to find Andy and make it back to his house before he and his family move.The characters are always walking a fine line here, and never once do they fall off into one side. Woody could be very unlikable. He's always complaining, shouting all the time and he does some pretty mean things. Woody may be occasionally ill intentioned, but he is never malicious, and instead of being a complete jerk, he is often fighting between what is right and wrong and picks the former. The characters can be mean, but they're well intentioned in the end, and it's what shows in them. This film is of course a technical achievement, boasting that it's the first feature length fully computer animated movie. The animation looks great still today, but in a film world dominated by special effects and computer animation, it's very difficult to impress, but what still stands out about this film's look is it's visual style. From strange mid 50s interior designs to the atmospheric and beautiful golden hour look of certain scenes, this movie has such unique sets and shadows and just the atmosphere overall is very involving. The exciting chase and action sequences are also remembered and still today look dazzling. But what makes those scenes, namely the whole moving van sequence at the end, is the emotion. You feel for these characters, and the 'Falling with style' callback that could feel contrived and corny, comes off as heartwarming. All the great scenes in the film have a level of humanity underneath all the negativity and cynicism of Woody that makes this animated toy feel very human.Randy Newman can be a little samey in some of his musical work, but his songs and score work very well here. The songs give us insight into what the character is feeling, and raise the emotion. His score plays off really well, and is catchy and bouncy without being cheesy. You'll find yourself singing these songs and humming the music after watching this.Toy Story is animated masterpiece. Unlike many of Disney animation's masterpieces, like the wonderful 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'The Little Mermaid', this plays as a film instead of a great animated movie. It's a timeless film that will surely entertain many generations to come. It's a true classic!My rating: **** out of ****. 81 mins. Rated G.",10,1,1,11 March 2011
Blood Diamond," A fine film that's nonstop entertaining.
","Stars: Leo DiCaprio, Djimon Honsou and Jennifer Connelly.Wow!! That's all I can really say after watching this. Everything about this was great. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a jerk that cares only about himself, and he still manages to be an extremely likable character with a lot of development. Djimon Honsou gave an excellent performance as the determined father trying to get to his brainwashed son. Jennifer Connelly plays a held back, excellent role as the American reporter. Blood Diamond houses some excellent performances. It takes place in 1994 in several countries in Africa that are going in to complete anarchy, with kids being brainwashed and used as soldiers. Solomen's (Honsou) family is taken and he alone is left to save them by finding the biggest diamond he saw and buried. Billy (DiCaprio) meets Solomen in jail and gets him out. Billy sells diamonds illegally and wants this one. Pretty simple plot. Warning, this film is very intense. If you don't mind watching little kids get shot and have their hands chopped off, then you are the right person for this excellent film.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 133 mins.

Men in Black," Hilarious.
","Stars: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Rip Torn, Vincent D'Orfornio and Tony Shaloub.This is a good example of many things. One is a great science fiction alien movie. This is probably the best alien film I've seen since Aliens. It's a good example of physical comedy. Will Smith was excellent doing physical comedy in this and Tommy Lee Jones meanwhile plays the straight man, which was just as funny as the comedy. Barry Sonnenfeld has great style which shows in all of his films, and this is no exception.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 97 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.",9,0,0,31 July 2006
The Graduate," Very weird.
","starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and William Daniels.This is a strange movie. It's about Dustin Hoffman being seduced by his friend's mom and eventually buying in to it and meeting her places while her daughter's away. It has Simon and Garfunkle music splattered all over it and is very 60's-ish. All in all, it's actually a beautiful film in some way. I give it a 9 because I was entertained through all of it and the music was great and the acting was excellent too. I recommend it if you like cult movies. William Daniels gives an excellent held back performance as the father too.Rated R for sex and language. My rating-95%-A.",9,1,2,18 February 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Trippy, strange, but also very emotional and moving. This movie is perfectly balanced.
","Jim Carrey is known for his roles in screwball comedies, and it seemed as there was no way to get an actual clean break off from his normal goofy persona. It may have seemed that way, but this movie proves otherwise. What we have here is a mature film, with some funny moments, but instead of a stupid Carrey performance, we have a deep and moving performance, in a very strange and original, but nonetheless deep and moving picture. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) leads a fairly mundane and boring life until he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet). He and Clementine click right away despite their contrasting personalities. One day when visiting her and work, Joel finds she has no recollection of him, and discovers she had her memory erased of him from a clinic. Because of his depression over her, Joel decides to do the same thing. During the procedure, Joel realizes he wants to remember her, and must take her to places in his memory where she can't be erased. Meanwhile, during the operation at Joel's apartment, we meet the doctors working on him. Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) are the somewhat incompetent doctors, as they care about their own needs more than that of Joel, and Stan ends up inviting over Mary (Kirstin Dunst), the receptionist at their place of work. Joel jumps from memory to memory causing confusion by the younger doctors and a call to older Doctor Howard (Tom WIlkinsin) and secrets about the people performing the operations come out.For a movie that takes place mainly inside one guy's mind, this manages to be a very emotional film. Joel is a really likable character, and his progression throughout the film and in his memories is quite interesting. Kate Winslet plays a good opposite to Joel's introverted ways, and her performance as Clementine, and as merely a memory concocted by Joel is also excellent. All the performances are great, and what makes them great, is despite some stupidity even in the doctors, they're still portrayed as people, not just morons. They are just as deep as our protagonist, and have just as much baggage on the brain.The direction is phenomenal. The jump from memory to memory and the erasing of the memories gives us a huge feel of what Joel has gone through and takes us through all kind of interesting settings. In contrast, we have Joel's apartment where our co-plot is going on with the doctors, and the apartment in so many scenes gives a feeling of intimacy with the surroundings. The memories Joel has are so well done and even eerie at times, but also very sad and lonely when need be. Director Michael Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman really molded some brilliant contrasts, and some lovely and thought provoking characters.Overall, this really is destined to be a classic, or if not that a highly regarded cult classic. It's an emotional, beautiful movie, with Jim Carrey showing that he deserves more roles in dramas after pulling this off. Nothing's ever been quite like this, and chances are, nothing will again.My rating: **** out of ****. 108 mins. R for language and sexuality.",10,3,5,22 November 2009
The Mummy Returns," Entertaining, but very, very messy.
","If you're thrilled by amusing one liners and nonstop special effects of all kinds of weird creatures, then you're sure to enjoy this second Mummy picture. If not, you will probably turn it off after a few minutes. The first Mummy picture was quite good, in that it managed to fit in characters and plot amongst the big budget special effects. The first picture showed that Universal movie monsters could easily be remade into big budget, special effect extravaganzas, and still be good. Everything I liked about the first movie (minus the characters) was overdone to the extreme here, and about halfway through or earlier, I found myself loathing this picture. The overall feeling though was not one of hatred...this is just an overplotted mess, with moderate entertainment value throughout.Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is back, nine years after the first movie (I thought it was two, but whatever), and he and Evelyn (Racchel Weisz) are married and have an 8 year old kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). Imhotep's (Arnold Vosloo) mummy has been brought back to life, and he wants the bracelet of immortality, which is now in the hands of Rick and company. The bracelet controls the Scorpion King's (played in a pointless cameo by the Rock) army, which consists of easy to defeat dogs who with one hit turn to sand. Chaos ensues throughout.If you aren't paying attention in this movie, or you miss the first ten minutes, you will be extremely confused. Heck, you could be paying attention the whole movie and still be confused. So much is going on, and so many special effects and new plot lines are shoved in your face way too often. Special effects on the mummies and creatures are pretty cool, but the bigger effects are just a huge headache, and they look very artificial. The plot is virtually nonexistent. I guess there are several plot lines, but in between them are many sidetracked scenes, and by the end, this just feels like a bunch of random scenes shoved together.This movie is full of cutesy moments. I'm unsure as to why a mummy movie needs any cutesy moments, but since this is meant for families, writer and director Stephen Sommers made this both violent and cutesy and comedic, so it never fully works as anything (though it does work much better as an action movie than anything else). Jonathan (John Hannah) provides many of the movies cringe worthy lines. He's one of those characters that is scared to death from anything and everything, and still quips out the bad jokes. Brendan Fraser does the same, but he has a charm he brings to the character, and is one of the few positives of the movie. The kid Alex was a good addition, and for some reason, he felt more mature and developed than most other parts of the movie.Overall, this is a pretty bad movie. It's full of effects that add up to nothing, and characters that do the same. There is some entertainment to be found, but you may find after you finish this, you'll be in desperate need for something intelligent.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 125 mins. PG-13 for violence.",4,1,2,31 July 2008
Avatar," Wonderful looking movie, that doesn't live up to the looks in any other department.
","James Cameron is known for taking us to new worlds and places with his films, and this one is no different. In fact, Avatar might be his most visually appealing film, and for this aspect of the film, this movie is a complete success. Undoubtedly this movie will win the Academy Award for special effects, and it deserves this hand down, but this is not Cameron's best picture. This is a cool looking film full of many cardboard characters, clichés, and predictability. Not to say this movie's only positive aspect is the visuals, it's actually very entertaining and is overall a good movie, but in no way is this a cinematic masterpiece.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic ex-marine who is taking his deceased twin brother's place in a scientific/military experiment on a moon of Pandora. Using the DNA of himself and a native creature of the land, the N'avi, an avatar of himself as a N'avi is made which he can control through a machine. From controlling this creature he will learn the N'avi's home in the forest in order to figure out where a rare element, Unobtanium, is in their forest. Of course he soon becomes attached to the N'avi over the humans, and chaos ensues.I can see how this movie can be called revolutionary. The special effects are the best I've ever seen on characters. The creatures and the planet and everything character and design wise is very imaginative. The planet's inhabitants are quite a visual treat, and that's really the main thing this movie has to boast.This movie can't be called original, as the plot is completely recycled from many other films. If you've seen the Disney cartoon Pocohantas, than you already know the plot to this one. Not to say that it ruins the film that this is very similar to Pocohantas, Ferngully or dozens of other movies, it just adds a level of predictability to the story. In addition to the story, the dialogue in this movie is quite boring. Most action films have at least a little bit of humor, but this has so close to none it's ridiculous. Sigourney Weaver is mildly comedic when she's mean to Jake, and he's mildly comedic in his fish out of water routine, but there is no clever or funny dialogue in this.Overall, this movie has it's flaws, but it is an entertaining and great looking film. The problem is the plot and dialogue play second to the visuals which is what I'm assuming is drawing in these huge crowds, that and James Cameron's name. Definitely not Cameron's best, but it proves again how he can create new lands and places that can still wow an audience.My rating *** out of ****. 162 mins. PG-13 for violence, sensuality and some language.",7,2,8,2 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Fans of Sam Raimi or the horror genre in general should be in for a real treat.
","After Sam Raimi's last film, Spiderman 3, which can be considered by many to be a disappointment to Spiderman fans, Raimi decides to direct something completely different. Going back to his roots in horror, Raimi directs this film with the precision of the Evil Dead films, only this is much scarier than either of those films. And, to top that off, Sam Raimi uses his typical tongue in cheek style, that was largely missing from the first two Spiderman films, but all too present in the third, and he uses just the right amount here, never going extremely over the top, but reaching close many times. Really, this is the best horror film that's been released in years.Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) is a loan officer who really wants that new promotion from her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer). But her competition for the promotion is the new guy, a notorious kiss-up, Stu (Reggie Lee). In order to curry her bosses favor, she turns down an old woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), on her third mortgage for her home. Ganush ends up putting a gypsy curse on her that causes her to see a shadowy figure that beats her up and shakes up all the pots and pans and such. After going to a psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), she finds that she has a curse that will drag her to hell in three days. Chaos ensues as she tries to beat this thing, and as her educated boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) begins to see her mentally deteriorating.This movie has more jump scenes than most horror films do, but these one's actually catch you off guard. In a few scenes, Raimi tries to build the tension, and you know a scare is coming, but in many other scenes there is no way of knowing when something will strike the screen and your heart will start racing. Knowing that horror is better with a pinch of salt, Raimi adds humor throughout the film. The scares are genuine, but the action scenes are usually very funny. This includes random blood squirting, mucus jokes, and a running joke of gumming to the face. And to add to the humorous horror, there is funny dialogue also. It's really an excellent mixture.The performances were spot on. Allison Lohman plays her performance as a nice girl well, but also manages to portray the characters dark sides. Justin Long is convincing as the boyfriend who is losing faith, but constantly convincing himself that his girlfriend isn't crazy. Dileep Rao as the psychic is great. An actor who was surprisingly amusing was Reggie Lee as the kiss-up co-worker, and he really provides quite a few laughs, despite an over the top performance.The final touch on the film is the musical score. This had a really pretty score by Christopher Young. It's probably supposed to sound like gypsy music, led by a violin, and as a stand alone score it's still good for a listen.Overall, this is an effective, oftentimes funny and scary horror film, and an impressive return from Raimi to the genre.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 99 mins. PG-13 for some bloody violence.",9,3,7,30 May 2009
Grindhouse," Hilarious bloody fun.
","Grindhouse is shown as a double feature with 2 full length films and fake trailers before and in between. Planet Terror: starring: Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Mary Shelton, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, Tom Savini, Naveen Andrews, Quentin Tarantino, Michael Parks, Stacey Ferguson, Jeff Fahey.Robert Rodriguez directs and writes this hilarious zombie movie. Planet Terror is about a stripper Cherry (McGowan), an outlaw type guy named El Rey, and a gang of people trying to stop these government created mutants. This movie was absolutely hilarious. Rodriguez made sure it was as bloody and purposely dumb as possible. It was filled with purposeful mistakes and scratched film, along with one of the funniest scenes in the film due to a missing reel. The special effects were great and hilarious, as was the over the top acting. 'Planet Terror' was a bit silly, but brilliant over the top parody. My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 86 mins.Death Proof: starring: Kurt Russell, Vanessa Ferlito, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Quentin Tarantino, Michael Parks, James Parks.Quentin Tarantino directs the second feature length film which focuses more on characters than on extreme violence. This movie has a very odd setup that really had me confused until the very end which made the entire thing worthwhile. We start with four girls at a bar and Stuntman Mike (Russell) trying to woo them. The first 40 minutes are the setup for the last half, explaining what Stuntman Mike does to kill women. The second part is about some girls messing around by playing a game where one woman lays on the hood of the car holding on by belts until she can't hold on any longer. When Mike messes with them, he quickly learns his lesson. Where the dialogue between the women can get tedious and over-stretched at times, Kurt Russell gives such a screen presence and great performance that he makes up for it. The last 20 minutes don't let up with the excellently filmed chase scenes. By the end, you realize that this is Tarantino's homage to the women kicking butt movies from the 60s and 70s. Great character development and superb chase scenes make this a great movie, and a great way to end the double feature. My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 87 mins.The fake trailers were another part of the movie, and a part that had me hysterically laughing. Before the movie starts we see a trailer for 'Machette' starring Danny Trejo as a Mexican action star and Cheech Marin as a tough priest. The trailers in the middle of the movie are the great 'Werewolf Women of the SS', the true story of Hitler's army of werewolves. 'Thanksgiving', a horror movie about a killer who decapitates people quite well, and 'Don't', a cheesy looking horror movie about a haunted house. All the fake trailers were hilarious and filmed perfectly to look like the original terrible movies they're based on. Directors Rob Zombie, Eli Roth and Edgar Wright lend their directing talent to these. Overall this was a laugh out loud funny, exhilarating experience that any fan of Rodriguez, Tarantino, or any fan of great parody and action should not miss.Final rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 191 mins. Rated R for strong violence, sex, nudity and drug use.",9,1,6,7 April 2007
Up," Pixar's most emotionally involving film. Best flick so far of 2009!
","Early reviews of Disney/Pixar's Up made some statements that I myself could not believe. The main charge in almost all the reviews was that the audience was crying within the first ten minutes. This seemed impossible to me, that an audience of people could become so emotionally involved in a film within ten minutes as to start crying...I was wrong. The opening to this film is heartbreaking, and possibly one of the saddest scenes to be featured in a film. And they pepper these little scenes throughout. This movie is very emotionally involving, and that's a good thing.Carl Fredrickson (In his old age, voiced by Ed Asner) at one time was a kid with dreams of being an adventurer, visiting strange and exotic lands. As a child, he met Ellie, the girl of his dreams, and he got married to her. They had a life together, tried to have a baby, and as life went on, the explorer dreams went farther and farther away. After Ellie's death, Carl has become a bitter old man. Now 78, all that Carl has left is his house, which construction workers want down. After an accident where Carl injures a man, Carl is forced into an old folks home, but he isn't going. Being a retired balloon salesman, Carl has plenty of balloons left, so he ties his house up and takes off for South America where he and his wife dreamed of going. Unfortunately for him, boy scout wilderness explorer Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) came along for the ride. Adventure and chaos ensues while trying to get his house to the exact spot in South America.This really is an excellent, if not almost perfect picture. The characters have such depth, as is true with most Pixar main characters. Carl is a mean old man, but he is definitely likable, and it's easy to see the motivation behind his anger and bitterness. Russell is another deep character, written to be the comic foil, and to be a cute little kid, and to be the child from a broken home who has problems. These characters contrast so perfectly and have excellent chemistry, and are just well written in themselves.In many ways this is a touching film. Lot's of character development is featured, mainly from Carl, but from others too. Carl is such a tragic hero, and all he wants to do is set his house down where he and his wife dreamed. Carl's wants and needs should click with anybody who has nostalgia and just wants to live their past. He's a broken man, trying to redeem himself, for himself and for the memory of his deceased wife. It's really a sad tale in itself, but with the normal Pixar magic, it's also an uplifting, funny, entertaining film that will definitely be remembered as a classic.Pixar has yet again raised their bar even higher. Up is a beautiful adventure film filled with rich characters, great animation and very real emotion. Possibly Pixar's best picture yet, and that's including the amazing Wall-E. Best picture thus far of 2009! My rating: **** out of ****. 99 mins. PG for some tragic scenes.",10,2,6,6 June 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Very Bizarre, excellent though.
","starring: Malcom McDowall.In a futuristic England, groups of teens rape and brutally beat people. One group is led by Alex. The film is really 3 plots in one film. The first 45 minutes of the film are just showing the violent acts of this group including a horrible rape scene and a fast motion sex scene between Alex and two women. Alex accidentally kills a woman and he goes to prison (14 years is the charge). the next 45 minutes are Alex in prison and then being able to go through a treatment that will end his evil ways and let him out of prison. The last part is Alex out of prison, no longer able to do violence, sexually attack women, or listen to Beethoven (you have to see the film to know what i mean). It's very bizarre, but it adds to the film. Malcom McDowall is great, and the character is one where sometimes you want him to die, sometimes you feel sorry for him. The direction is really excellent and the classical music choices really added to it. Excellently done.My rating: 4/4 stars. rated R for nonstop full frontal male and female nudity, strong sexuality including rape, violence and some brief language. 134 mins.",10,0,2,16 March 2006
The Fly," A nearly perfect science fiction/horror drama.
","Horror movies put their audience through a lot. They jump and scream, and their heart races throughout. But, unfortunately, what most horror films lack is characters. They don't usually have a big enough heart, and their characters are all expendable. Whether or not this film fits into the category of horror is debatable, but this story is horrific, and dramatic. It tells us about characters we care about, and puts them through hell. It's as much a drama as a horror film, and the mixture of both is impeccable.Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is trying to woo magazine reporter Veronica 'Ronnie' Quaife (Geena Davis). Brundle has an experiment that he's been working on, so he shows it to her. It's a teleportation device, but it has a few problems, like it's inability to transport living things, and keep them alive. After finally getting it to work, Brundle accidentally, and unknowingly mixes his D.N.A. with a fly's, and soon starts transforming into a monster.The characters are what this picture is all about. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis have great chemistry together, and they play off each other well. This film starts off with Goldblum and Davis meeting each other, and the first half of the film is dedicated to showing us these characters. This is quite effective so the we care about what happens during the last half of the movie. The other main character is Stathis Borans (John Getz), and he's the most miraculous character of them all. He's set up as a chauvinist villain, but this movie doesn't give into stereotype that easy. This character, who has some horrible and rude qualities, has a heart and shows that just because a character has bad qualities doesn't mean they have to be the villain.The direction and writing is good. The scenes looked well thought out, and they could be pretty disturbing. The makeup effects, which won the 1986 Academy Award are very cool. The transformation scenes rival those in 1981's An American Werewolf in London for best disgusting makeup effects of 1980s cinema.Howard Shore's musical score for this film is amazing. It's grand and bigger than it should be, like the music from the '50s, but it sounds great. It's a perfect mix of a loud brass section and a soft theme on the flute.This story about a man's transformation into a fly is sad and horrific (with those words being used in the best sense). This is a must see for horror fans.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. R for sexuality, nudity, strong violence, and some language.",9,0,1,20 December 2008

Someone set them up, but who was it?review: This movie really has a good feel to it and has the usual good acting and cast that you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino, but maybe the dialogue goes way too far. This film starts out where Tim Roth(the undercover cop that they think is a thief) is shot and dying, and instead of being in extreme pain, he talks. I love this movie and could watch it over and over again and I do recommend it, but this is a movie that's trying to be more realistic. The way they just jibber-jabber on is stupid. On the brighter side, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi are great, and Lawerence Tierney is perfect.my rating-B(85%). rated R for some scenes of strong violence, language and some brief sexual discussions. 97 minutes.",7,2,4,26 July 2005
Total Recall," Stupid and confusing, but loads of fun.
","Arnold Schwarzzenager movies tend to be pretty entertaining, and this one is no exception. 'Total Recall' is a fun, often laughable, but never bad science fiction action psychological thriller....and it's also quite confusing by the end as to what actually happened, but it doesn't take much away at all from such a fun movie.Arnold Schwarzzenager play Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who's world is turned upside down when he decides to use total recall. Total recall is a place where you can remember memories from places you've been before, or even create a new fake persona for yourself. Douglas is attacked, and people now know him as Hauser. Douglas is confused, as was I, as will you be. But in all the confusion, this movie has lots of great action scenes, interesting special effects, hilarious one-liners and pure exhilarating entertainment.Overall, this is a very fun movie, that I'd recommend to any fan of sci-fi or action movies.My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins.

It's the best 2 and a half hours that you can watch in a movie! It is basically a bunch of mini-plot lines with some reoccurring characters. It's about hit-man Vince Vega(John Travolta) taking his boss Marcellus(Rhames)'s wife Mia(Thurman) out to dinner, only leading to disaster of a drug overdose. It's about hit-man Jules Winfield(Jackson) having divine intervention and realising what he has become...nothing but a killer. It's about a boxer named Butch(Willis) who was payed to lose a fight, but won instead and has the mob boss Marcellus mad. It's about two diner thieves, Pumpkin(Roth) and Yolanda(Plummer) who rob the wrong place at the wrong time. It's about a man's head who is accidentally blown off, and the only one who can help is the cleanup man called the Wolf(Keitel), and it's finally about two gay rapers(Whitaker and Greene) who try to work their magic. It's a terrific movie, and it's set up so cool. It's in three chapters and out of chronological order so it stays fresh. Also, all the main stars(not co-starring) are mostly only special appearances where they star in the film for a brief amount of time, like Walken as a war hero. Watch it...it's excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!! 135%/100%. rated R for some bloody violence, nonstop strong language, very strong drug content(very graphic), some off screen sexuality and brief nudity. 149 minutes.*watch for Steve Buscemi and Kathy Griffin in cameo roles.",10,1,5,14 August 2005

","stars: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Warson, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Warwick Davis, Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman and many others.The best Potter film by far. In this movie, Harry is put in a Tri-Wizard challenge, even though he is underaged, that he didn't put himself in. The challenges are to fight a dragon and take it's egg. Then to free a friend trapped in the bottom of the lake. Finally, to escape a maze, which ends in a death in the film (WHich probably got the film it's PG-13 rating). There's the extremely amusing sub-plot of a dance, which was fun to watch how shy Ron and Harry are...and how busy Hagrid's hands are. It was filled with many great British actors and actresses, including Alan Rickman in a relatively small role, Ralph Fiennes, looking extremely scary as Lord (He Who Shall Not Be Named) and a 4 minute cameo by Gary Oldman. I recommend this film a lot, and this is without a doubt the most entertaining film.My rating-A.

The Happening," So many elements of this film annoyed me, but I was thoroughly entertained throughout.
","M. Night Shyamalan seems to be having trouble keeping his writing and direction fresh. The Lady in the Water was his worst attempt at originality with not only a strange, boring incoherent plot, but with stupid flat characters and boring dialogue. In my opinion, this is his second worst film, and this was not bad...well, maybe it was, but it was still pretty entertaining.Strange events begin to happen, starting in Central Park. Everyone in the park stops, walks back a few steps, says some pointless drivel, and then kills themselves, in many various gruesome ways. The mass suicides begin to spread, and people begin to leave their homes to find a place not contaminated by whatever is causing this strange reactions in humans. Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher, and with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and his co-worker's daughter Jess, they travel to avoid this strange plague.The main problem with this movie is the terrible dialogue. Some lines had me cringing and wondering what Mr. Shyamalan was thinking when he wrote these clunky words on paper. Had he been watching corny romantic comedies and bad sit-coms and figured he'd make a science fiction/drama with the same bad lines? My least favorite line in the movie, and possibly one of my least favorite lines I've ever heard is where John Leguizamo's character dumps his daughter off on Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. When Zooey reaches for her hand, Leguizamo says 'Don't hold her hand unless you mean it!' What the heck does that even mean? He's dumping his daughter off on them, and he tells her not to hold his daughter's hand unless she means it...means what? Means that she wants to hold her hand? What an awful line and delivery, and there are many of these little 'gem' lines throughout. The writing for each character is the same, making even the little 8 year old girl seem like an adult, and I would rather hear diversity in the characters instead of hearing a movie full of M. Night Shyamalans. The actors seemed to even change for their roles. Mark Wahlberg gives an odd performance as a normal person who isn't a jerk or a tough guy. It's hard to tell if his performance is bad or good, it's still weird to me, but his character was likable, so I guess it was effective.The direction artistically is good. It looks nice, and the camera work looks just fine. But, when the characters talk is when Shyamalan's weaknesses in direction show. Instead of making individual characters, he has them all act the same. They all whisper for dramatic effect a lot, and they cry a lot, no matter the situation. It just gets annoying. It's similar to the writing in that it gets repetitive. This is one of the few movies where more establishing shots might have actually helped it, just to give the audience a break from unrelenting sameness.Now, this movie has some very bad qualities, but it is not a bad movie. From the very beginning I was interested and entertained, and even some of the awful writing caused an uncomfortable laugh in me and some others in the audience. The plot is pretty original and unique, and though it could have been handled a little better, the plot was developed nicely. There were also a few jump scenes, which is hard to produce when nothing really jumps out at you, and each scene takes place in the daytime, but the jump scenes are still thrown in there. The suicides are gruesome and fans of the violent and morbid will love the blood and gore, even though Shyamalan didn't go overboard with the violence. He wisely used it sparingly, but enough for us to get how horrible these events truly are.So M. Night Shyamalan has come a long way from The Sixth Sense...a long way down. The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece, and it seems his techniques are getting old, but aren't totally useless. He made a suspenseful movie, despite the silliness of everything. Don't expect a classic going in, because you won't get one. Put your standards lower than they would be for 'Lady in the Water' and you might find you can squeeze some goodness even out of the bad.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 85 mins. R for gruesome violence.",6,1,6,13 June 2008
The Departed," Just perfect in every single way.
","Stars: Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson.This is one of those rare movies that have your full attention from the beginning to the very end. Everything about this movie was just perfect. The performances were all excellent, with Dicaprio giving his most grown up and best performance. Matt Damon was great. And as always Jack Nicholson was crazy and great as the mob boss. The plot of the film is that the police in Boston are trying to take down crime boss Francis (Nicholson). There's a henchman of his that's a rat for the cops (DiCaprio) and there's a policeman that's a rat for the mob (Damon). In other reviews of this I've read how much everyone loved Matt Damon's performance, but I have to say, I actually thought Leonardo was even better. And Matt Damon was still excellent. Every single moment of this movie just screams at you, 'BEST PICTURE!!!!', and I have to say it deserves it. This was truly a cinematic masterpiece!!! My rating: ****/****. 147 mins. rated R for Strong Violence, Language and Drug Use.",10,0,0,14 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Almost like a spoof of Transformers, and a horribly unfunny one at that.
","Wow! This Transformers movie...what can you say about it? It's so unbelievably bad, with the only positives being the occasional interesting fight scene, but even those only lift this movie up to it's still horrible level. The constant jokes and strange plot points and nonstop mistakes and cheesy love scenes make this movie very, very hard to sit through.Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeuf), our hero from the first flick is now going to college. His wacky parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) are driving him, as Sam's not bringing Bumblebee, the lovable nonspeaking Transformer car. Also on Sam's list of leave behinds is his skin tight short short pantie wearing girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). Meanwhile, the Decepticons are coming back to Earth to go after an ancient device that could end all life on Earth. Not only that, but Sam has wacky mishaps in college, and Optimus Prime is killed, and the government takes control of his body. And then...everyone transports to Egypt for the conclusion. Oh the humanity!Where to start with the negatives? How about the robots. These are the most obnoxious robots ever! They linger on stereotypes and play the sole role of being comic relief, but instead add absolutely nothing. Mudflap and Skids (Skids is voiced by Tommy 'Spongebob' Kenny) are the most horrible creatures to hit the big screen. Their entire role is bantering back and forth, and making bad jokes. They're like Jar Jar Binks times 100 in terms of annoying CGI sidekicks. Then we've got Wheelie, who is also voiced by Tom Kenny. Before continuing about the character, I'd like to comment on Tom Kenny. He is only good at doing cartoony voices, like the Mayor on Powerpuff Girls, Heffer on Rocko's Modern Life, and his most known character Spongebob. Him trying to voice an actual character is pathetic. Both his characters sound like Spongebob. This guy can't change his voice enough to make unique characters. Anyways, Wheelie is also annoying. He's a foul mouth, but due to our PG-13 limit, he uses the word 'frickin'' like crazy. Very annoying!!!!Time to talk about bizarre elements of the movie. The Fallen had a...hehe...scrotum. Bahaha! Man, that's some real clever stuff. Sam goes to robot heaven...well that makes sense! Sam has a bandage magically appear on his hand to cover up Shia Labeuf's real life motorcycle accident. It's fine to cover it up, but when it's unexplained, it seems more like a continuity problem. A little robot has fun with Megan Fox's leg. These script writers must've been pulling all nighters for these hilarious ideas. Speaking of hilarious, Sam's mom eats a weed brownie and starts tackling people. Is this Transformers or Disaster Movie? A female human...turns out to be a Transformer. Hmmmm, these guys really can fool us humans. Somehow, the Decepticons not only made one of their own to look and sound exactly like a human, but apparently they got her into college...all just to kill Sam? Those sneaky bots. Bravo, you magnificent writers, bravo! This is a poorly acted, horribly written and dismally directed mess of a film, and yet it's a hit financially. Don't go to see this! All that will result is a headache, and possibly a story to tell your friends about how bad this film truly is.My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 150 mins. PG-13 for drug, crude, sex humor, violence and language",2,11,24,10 July 2009
War of the Worlds," AN entertaining movie.
","Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Tim Robbins and Miranda Otto. narrated by Morgan Freeman.Ray(Cruise) is a divorced parent of two kids when aliens attack. That's the basic plot. We've then got later in the movie where Ray and his daughter(Fanning) go underground in a basement with crazy Ogivily(Robbins). This is the full outline to this movie. It's a simple to understand film with its heart in the right place. Miranda Otto plays Tom Cruise's ex wife, and unfortunately, only has a cameo. It's a very entertaining film, so that's enough to make it worthy. Go see this movie, no matter what these reviews say.",7,0,1,20 July 2005
30 Days of Night," Stupid, predictable, and really loud!
","For those who say 30 Days of Night was a new and innovative vampire film, I have no idea why you'd think that. This movie has a pretty standard plot (really the same plot as Night of the Living Dead, except with vampires in Alaska) with boring characters and dialog, and with lots of violence.For my negatives, I'll start with the direction. I was glad that it wasn't filmed with a shaky cam. However to make up for that, it had this style where almost every scene was a close up on an actor's face. After about ten minutes of nonstop closeups, it got very annoying. The acting was not bad, but it was always too dramatic. Either the characters wait several seconds to answer each others questions, or the characters have close ups on their mouths to emphasize the drama of their lines. Again, it's an annoying technique. The characters were either cool calm, or they were a nervous wreck, there was never an in between with this one. Also, it was pretty annoying the scare tactics used in the film. The vampires run quickly past the camera and are loud then to scare the audience. But when they're coming up on people away from the camera, they're quiet (with the exception of their loud, extremely annoying vampire cries). These are the small things that bothered me.The movie itself was a really grueling thing to watch. The plot of the film is a creepy stranger comes into an Alaskan town. He's picked up by the local police and tells them somethings coming. Of course, he is correct, and vampires come into town, during the month of complete darkness. A small group of survivors (led by Josh Hartnett) find ways to hide out and avoid the vampires for 30 days. The plan of the vampires to eat a town in 30 days of darkness sounds like a great plan, except, apparently, they didn't think that this town only has few people, and half of them, they turn into vampires. So how does this group of several vampires (who turns into more vampires later) survive 30 days off of these few people...who knows? But they do. Why do some people turn into vampires in a matter of seconds, and some it takes days? Who knows. How did these creatures keep the blood on their faces in the exact same areas throughout the film? Who knows. And there were many more inconsistencies throughout.Aside from these problems, and the bad special effects, this had some good qualities. Some of the action scenes were interestingly shot, and even though there is no real reason to, the characters become somewhat likable. At times it feels like it might pick up, but unfortunately,, it doesn't.Overall, this was a typically average vampire film that wasn't very scary at all.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 107 mins. R for violence.",4,6,12,28 October 2007
Wedding Crashers," A good romantic comedy with a good comedic duo.
","Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher, Jane Seymour and Will Ferrell.Jeremy(Vaughn) and John(Wilson) like to crash parties to sleep with beautiful women. They go to a party, make up fake names and identities, and get women from all over. They finally go to a party where John falls in love for Christopher Walken's daughter(Rachel McAdams). Jeremy has sex with her sister(Isla Fisher) on the beach, and she falls in love with him, but he hates her. AS this movie goes along, it becomes more of a romantic comedy, which is fine. McAdams gets angry when John reveals his true identity. She already had a boyfriend and fiancée, but he is a jerk. Jeremy falls for Isla Fisher and proposes to her. John is mad at him, and starts literally crashing weddings drunkenly by himself. Jeremy had often talked about his mentor Chaz(Ferrell) and John went and visited him. He lives with his mom, but has hot women. He then tells John that he's out of wedding crashing, and he's on to funeral crashing. When John goes with Chaz to the funeral, he sees a widow and realizes how low he's sunk. I won't give away the ending, but it's a good movie. There's a hilarious scene with McAdams and Fisher's brother who turns out to be gay.My rating-B plus-88%. 114 minutes.rated R for some scenes of sexuality/sexual humor, nudity and language.",8,1,6,18 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Beautifully filmed, well acted. A great character piece.
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a self proclaimed 'family man' out to make a simple living in oil. He's got his adopted son H.W. who he brings along to prove what a swell family man he is. Daniel is nothing of the sort. He is a greedy, businessman, and this movie, instead of giving a solid plot, gives a view of his character from 1898 to 1927, and how he changes over the years.The cinematography is what makes even the dullest of moments in the film watchable. Every shot seemed to be thought out perfectly making even the smallest of things beautiful, and makes this movie a visual feast. The characters are interesting, as they should be, because this is not a plot driven movie, but a character piece. The acting is captivating. When Day-Lewis gives a speech, you want to hear it. Paul Dano was also a great addition to the cast playing two roles, his main role a crazy preacher who is constantly badgering Daniel for money for the church. The writing for the characters was also good. Even with the big theatrical over-exaggerated pauses and unrealistic bouts of silence for dramatic effect, the characters felt real.Don't go for the plot, but expect to see a time line of man's life and how he changes. The ticket price is worth it!! My rating: **** out of ****. 155 mins. R for violence",10,2,8,19 January 2008
Burlesque," Obviously the director/writer wanted to homage Bob Fosse girls, but this movie is pointless.
","From the ads, this movie looked pretty fun. Christina Aguilera has a great voice, despite not always using it, and Cher is an American icon who has charmed us for over 2 centuries (close to it anyways), so mixing these two together in a 'Chicago' inspired musical film seemed like it would be great fun. Unfortunately, in order to have a great film, you need great characters, an interesting plot, a clever script, and this movie has none of the above. It has a largely drama free plot, with boring one dimensional characters, and a script full of lame one liners. By the end, you just wonder, what was the point of all this?Ali (Christina Aguilera) is a small town Iowa waitress who wants to become a star, so she moves out to L.A., without a place to stay or much money. She ends up finding this burlesque house full of saucy female dancers straight out of the 1920s, owned by Tess (Cher), a boss with a heart of gold. She pushes her way into becoming a waitress for the place, and eventually tries out for a role on stage, while meanwhile she's living with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet). Then rich businessman Marcus (Eric Dane) tries to buy out the Burlesque house...GASP...will he be able to?Writer/director Steve Antin's sole purpose for making this seems to be to homage Bob Fosse. Literally, there could be no other reason. Possibly as a way of meeting Christina Aguilera and Cher, but story wise, there is nothing here to tell. This movie has no point, and could have easily been condensed into a bland 30 minute short film. There's such little drama in the story, and nothing ever seems very serious. There's never a moment where you pity any characters, or feel bad for anyone, and there's never any moments where you feel particularly sad or happy for anyone. It's such a middling picture that it just moves along, doing nothing, and thus that's what you get from the picture...nothing.The performances are okay. Christina Aguilera is...okay. She's not great, and not bad. Her character is kind of irritating, and hard to describe. She's kind of pushy, and assertive, but also bossy, lazy and obnoxious. Cher's character is even harder to describe because she is given so few traits. Tess just kind of goes with the flow, and tries to run things, but gets frustrated. That's about it. And sadly, these two are the most developed characters. The performances reflect the lack of depth in the script, and everyone is just kind of hollow. It's like a script full of extras. We never get to know or care about anyone. Despite a not great script, and boring characters, at least we can get some great songs and stylistic direction, right? Well, inside the burlesque club, we get an atmospheric set with some alright songs and boringly shot dance numbers. But at least the club has it's own charm. But any set other than the club, is completely boring, and everything not featured there feels like a bad romantic comedy. And many scenes shot in there just waste time through songs that don't have any point. In 'Chicago' or 'All that Jazz' or 'Cabaret', the songs in the film advance the plot, or tell us how a character feels, or set up some background information. Here, the songs do nothing but play as songs. They mean nothing to the film, and even less to the plot, and they are there to make this a 'musical' and for padding. Like anything else, the songs have no purpose to the story. In order to create a work that replicates the works of Bob Fosse and Kander/Ebbs, one must not scratch the surface and say 'We need costumes, pretty girls, dance numbers and songs.', but instead one must listen to the lyrics and what they mean, and the wordplay, and watch how Fosse choreographed those routines, and in his films how he shot them. And of course, look at their plots, and how the songs have meaning to the plot, and how drama intensifies the film and makes the audience care. This movie is so bland, with boring characters and a plot that actually seems to give up on itself. You can't expect the musical numbers and costumes to run the show, but they do here. Quite a shame too. With all the talent involved this could have been great.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for sexy costumes (really a mild film).",4,2,6,18 July 2011
A Hard Day's Night," Not much plot...but this really didn't need any.
","'A Hard Days Night' really is just supposed to be a day in the life of the Beatles. Of all the Beatles films, this one by far had the best dialog, and the most realistic plot. It's a chance to show off a few of their best songs at the time and make a fun and sometimes funny movie to go with it.I'd like to write a plot synopsis, but there really is very little plot. Most of the subplots in the film involve not the Beatles, but Paul's kooky grandfather, who's out to make a buck whether through gambling or selling fake signed pictures. Like in their next film 'Help' the Beatles all have an odd acting style. They sort of act like little kids, playing with toys in the bathtub and such. Surprisingly it comes off well, and makes them seem innocent and likable. Plus, the songs are enough to get anyone hooked.This is by far the Beatles best film, and it was a real joy to watch.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A downright good film.
","The story of a man, trying to lay low for a while by hiding in a crazy house pretending to be nuts. Jack Nicholson plays JP, a loud mouth arrogant man who finds any situation to start a fight. This film is about his interaction with crazy people and the situations he gets them all into. One of the most memorable things about this is the ending, which has been spoofed and redone on almost every sitcom. I can't even begin to explain how compelling this Best Picture winning film is. It's great. Watch for Christpher Lloyd, Brad Douriff, Vincent Schiavelli and Danny Devito as the residents of the Crazy House.My rating: ****/****. 135 mins.

Army of Darkness," Purposely terrible one liners, unique slapstick action scenes and retro special effects make this a great time.
","The 'Evil Dead' trilogy has to be the most diverse trilogy ever created. The first movie was sort of funny, but it was a genuine horror movie. The second film still had the same creepy sets and horror elements from the first film, but was much more comical. The acting was extremely over the top as were many of the scenes, such as the hilarious laughing scene. Then we get to 'Army of Darkness'. All the horror from the series is gone, and the slapstick comedy introduced in the second film is prevalent.Ash (Bruce Campbell) was the only survivor from the last film and he has landed in a time warp in the 13th Century. In order to get back to his own time he must recite a phrase and find Necronomicon, the book of the dead, and it ends in war between the living and the 'Deadites'.This is not an original movie in any way, and if not looked at as purposely bad, this will be viewed as bad. The script is full of some truly awful one liners, such as 'Give me some sugar baby!', many uses of the phrase 'Groovy.', and dozens more terribly hilarious lines. The action scenes here seem very Three Stooges inspired, from the slaps to the face and the blocking of the pokes to the eyes, to the cuckoo clock sound effects used when Ash is a little out of it. The villains are not as menacing as in the last movies because they all are comical, but this is not a complaint. The light tone of the movie makes the lines funnier and the movie enjoyable.If you enjoy silly comedies and/or slapstick comedies, then you will probably love this. If you are expecting horror after seeing the last two movies, then you are in the wrong place.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence.",9,2,3,12 June 2008

This is again about Sydney Prescott(Campbell), Dewey(Arquette), Gail Weathers(Cox) and Randy Meeks(Kennedy) being stalked by a killer. We, of course, have new characters also. Anyway, Sydney's friends and aquaintences go off one by onemand unfortunately lead to an ending that couldn't even compare to the firsts. Sarah Michelle Gellar briefly plays a nice girl.

August Rush," A good premise and good music....that's about all.
","This is a family film that looked like it might be different. It could've been an excellent movie, because the premise was actually quite good, but instead we end up with nonstop events leading to a ridiculous ending to an average film.All his life, Taylor (Freddie Highmore) knew his parents were listening for him, and music is what would bring them together. Taylor can find music in anything, and because of this he's picked on at the orphanage. He decides to run away and the plot goes from there. This movie almost felt like an anthology at times, because it would quickly switch plots from Taylor (later known as August Rush) to his mom to his dad, to the Wizard (Robin Williams looking a lot like Bono). It is a very sweet movie, and it has good music in it, but in all other categories it's lacking. The acting is pretty good, but the writing and direction ruins the acting. Keri Russell plays Taylor's mother, and the entire movie walks around with her mouth wide open, which gets very annoying. Clichés of all types are constantly being used, including the cliché bullies. There are also a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies, it just get's annoying. The last 20 minutes of the movie was the most ridiculous part and was hard to watch. But, if you don't care what the movies you see consist of, then this would be fine to see.In the end, this is a pretty serious family film with good music, and some occasional fun moments, but overall it's a very clichéd, flawed film.My rating: ** out of ****. 106 mins.

This is a stupid, but kind of funny comedy, with a great backup cast including Vince Vaughn as Ron's enemy Wes Mantooth, Jack Black as a mean biker that punts Ron's dog and Ben Stiller as a Spanish news anchor. Veronica puts a dirty thing to say on the teleprompter and Ron says it and gets kicked off the team. Silly dialogue, but very funny too.

Dark Shadows," A great looking, and often funny movie, in search of a plot and a point.
","A Gothic romance about a vampire...this sounds like primo Tim Burton material here. On a visual level, this world here is fully realized, but unfortunately, that's the only place it's realized. The plot is kind of a set piece to set piece episodic one, and the romance here is severely underplayed, making the ending kind of pointless. But what the trailer emphasized was the comedy, and a good chunk of this film features some well played fish out of water comedy. On some levels this film is a surprising success, and on others an complete failure. It's entertaining, but that's about it really. It's the late 1700s, and Barnabas Collins' (Johnny Depp) family started a small fishing town called Collinsport, and together they live in Collinwood, a luxurious mansion. Barnabas breaks the heart of a spiteful witch Angelique (Eva Green), and she kills his parents, forces his lover Josette (Bella Heathcote) to commit suicide, turns Barnabas into a vampire, and imprisons him in a coffin underground. Two centuries later, a mysterious woman 'Victoria Winters' is going to become the governess for David, a surviving member of the Collins family who is deeply disturbed. Barnabas is then freed from his coffin, and returns to find his living relatives in need of help, so he tries to bring life back into his town of Collinsport. Meanwhile, Angelique (who still appears to be the same age) has taken control of the fishing industry in Collinsport, and he must help his family bring their dying fishing industry back.For those of you who didn't like the visual style of Tim Burton's last picture, 'Alice in Wonderland', this one should be a refreshing return to form (visually that is). The sets are really neat, and Collinsport is quite a beautiful little fantasy town. The special effects are also really good when they are featured. On a visual level, this might be Burton's best looking film since 'Sleepy Hollow' over a decade ago, and the score by Danny Elfman is also quite good. And what do people think of when they think of Tim Burton movies? Awesome visual style (check), bouncy score usually by Danny Elfman (check) and Johnny Depp (check). But what this movie is lacking is a plot. Something to drive the story other than jokes and neat sets is needed. The layout of the story and overall tone is quite odd. The film starts off as a Gothic romantic fantasy telling the history of Barnabas Collins. By no means is this portion of the film meant to be humorous. Then we begin to follow a mysterious girl 'Victoria Winters' (who becomes lovers with Depp), who has taken on the job of being little David's governess. This portion of the film isn't particularly funny either, but it adds an element of mystery so the movie becomes a bit more interesting. After about 15 minutes of this girl as our main character, the film becomes an unfocused fish out of water comedy for the remainder of the film (sans the last 25 or so minutes). This part of the film is actually quite funny. Then the climax and last portion of the film becomes like a horror action film of sorts.There is a romance subplot, but it has no importance in the story until the very end. There is no chemistry between Depp and Heathcote, because they are only given like 4 scenes together, and none of them feel very organic. Also sadly underwritten are Victoria Winters, and David's relationship. Ar the beginning of the film seem like they could have an interesting dynamic, but instead they are given very little screen time. Every sub-plot is dropped in favor of Depp's fish-out-of-water routine, which is quite funny, but also makes this movie's plot slight and overall point even slighter.Visually, this movie is a real treat bringing back memories of older Burton films like Beetlejuice. The performances are also very good, especially Johnny Depp who does some great deadpan comedy here, but what's missing is a point. While it may entertain, in the end, nothing really matters here.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 124 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor throughout, some language and violence.",6,1,2,11 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Top notch action scenes....otherwise absolute drivel.
","George Lucas is a disappointing guy. He brings the world the first three Star Wars films, which were fun, funny and fairly low on their level of cheese. Now, CGI is much better, and George Lucas throws away the script and goes for lots of drawn out action scenes. And those action scenes are very cool looking, though they do make up quite a lot of the film, but is that a positive or a negative? If the movie had more action scenes, then there will be less story and dialogue. More action it is. The dialogue in this Star Wars especially is so god-awful and corny you might want to claw your ears off.George Lucas spins us a love story between two very boring people, Anakin Skywalker, played by the always dull Hayden Christianson, and Queen Amadellus, played by Natalie Portman. Their is no chemistry between the two, and the characters are so uninteresting, you'll find whatever fait's in store for them won't matter to you. The best characters are Yoda and Mace Windu. Yoda is a crowd pleaser and a funny little guy. Windu's not much of a character, but Samuel L. Jackson makes the character his own. Other than these two, every other actor and character falls flat (out of battle).What happened to the sense of humor, and good characters from the first three Star Wars? Maybe Lucas should've tried harder on the script and gave the animators a break.My rating: ** out of ****. 135 mins. PG-13 for violence.",5,1,2,11 March 2008
Bring It On," The girls ended up doing the stolen routine
","I find this movie to be just awful. It is the biggest cliché ever, and to top that off, the only thing that it has going for it is a fresh look. The acting in this aside from a couple of the main girls is just awful. Several scenes of dialogue with no camera cuts are shown, and the words said go in one ear and out the other. It's really hard to listen to this awful drivel. The only, and I mean only thing that this has, is it's stylish camera work. The movie looks very modern with interesting camera angles and a stylish, flashy look. To make this super appealing to 11 year old girls they added really unnecessary cussing. I think cussing can often help a film to express strong feelings or portray certain cultures, but this movie must use the s word 50 times, and in stupid cases. 'Our team is the sh*t.' Take off the, and you have what this movie is.My rating: * out of ****. PG",2,0,1,14 March 2007
Inception," Not the masterpiece for me that everyone else seems to see, but it was still very good.
","Christopher Nolan seems to be setting the world on fire with each of his releases. Generally critics like him, and it seems the movie going audience goes crazy for his films, and pushes his flicks up in the top 10 when they're released. Nolan is an imaginative fellow and it's quite obvious in all of his work, and he's a darn good director, but this film didn't stand out to me as being great. It was original, it was entertaining and action packed, and the premise was pretty cool, but the movie just didn't scream masterpiece, and for me, it's definitely not the third greatest movie of all time, as the IMDb ratings currently state.Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio) has the technology to go inside people's dreams with a special machine, and he and his team are sent in to plant an idea in a rival businessman's mind, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). Things go wrong when it turns out the mind can fight back, and if you die in the dream, you could go into a comatose state in real life, and be stuck in a dream for '50 dream years'. Cobb and the gang must escape with their lives, or they will be trapped. Meanwhile, Cobbs is haunted by the appearance of his wife in all of his dreams, and we learn about his past. This movie has a really great plot. Movie that deal with going into the mind are usually pretty interesting, and there have been many takes on what going through the mind is like, like in 'Being John Malkovich' or 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. This is an original take on what going into the mind is like, where you can actually build the dream world to be like the real world, and the subconscious attacks anything that seems abnormal. Interesting take, neat premise, and an original take on what happens in dreams.The performances are all good. Leo Dicaprio is a good lead, and as usual, brings life to his character. The other actors aren't given a whole lot of range to act with, but they all give admirable performances, with Ellen Page acting confused and interested, and Joseph Gordon- Levitt looking like Keanu Reeves, but thank god, not acting like him. The editing and music are what is off to me, and were off in Nolan's last film 'The Dark Knight'. Where scenes of dialogue should slow down to let us get to know the characters and gain some emotional resonance, the dialogue scenes in this film feel like transitions. Instead of stopping the music, or lessening it, and letting us just hear characters talk, we get the loud music, with way too quick cutting. Every scene that's only dialogue feels like a transition, and it almost ruins the scenes. I understand that what most of the audience wants action, but that doesn't mean we can't stop for a bit and just slow down. In addition to the editing and music, Nolan films never properly gain any emotional resonance. I never felt true emotion for Cobb, or for his plight for his children. It goes back to the action and premise before everything else. And Dicaprio is a good actor, and he could properly pull off emotion, but Nolan tries to work the emotional aspect, and I cared about the characters, but not enough to truly care what happens to all of them. Christopher Nolan is a good director and he may get his butt kissed by every fan in the world, but despite that he is good, he has some flaws (as we all do). Inception is a really good movie, but it tries playing emotion and nearly fails because of the editing and pacing. Still, an interesting premise with good acting, 'Inception' is original and intriguing. My rating: *** out of ****. 148 mins. PG-13 for action and violence.",8,1,7,8 August 2010
WALL·E," The most charming cartoon I've ever seen. Nearly perfect in every way!
","My favorite animated movie was, and still is The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Wall-E comes in at close second. Pixar outdid themselves in every possible way, and it seems that though they've done that with each of their films, this one stands above the others. It's cute, without those lame sappy moments that cause you to uncomfortably stare at the floor. It's emotional, with some scenes even leaving a lump in my throat. The animation is amazing and the story is both inventive and original (for the most part). Wall-E is the quintessential Pixar film...no, it's the quintessential animated movie.Wall-E (or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth class) is a lonely robot on futuristic Earth. The year is around 2800 and all the humans have 'temporarily' been taken off of Earth into a space cruise where they are awaiting Earth to be cleaned up. Wall-E's only friend is a cockroach, and he lives in a little storage shelter where he keeps interesting items he finds in the trash he compacts. One day a spaceship drops off another robot, this one named EVE. Her mission is to find plant life on Earth, which would signal that the humans can return. Wall-E is fascinated by EVE, and more than anything just wants to hold her hand, like in his favorite musical, Hello Dolly. EVE sees a plant that Wall-E had previously found, and they both end up being taken up into space on the space cruise ship. All the humans on board have lost track of reality, don't walk or do any exercise, and they are all morbidly obese. Wall-E and EVE end up having to save the plant life they brought up to show to the ship's captain so they can go back to Earth, but the ship computer doesn't like that idea.I have no critiques for this film. As I've said, this is about as close to perfect as you can come, I'll just explain what I really liked. I enjoyed the romance between Wall-E and EVE, which was so sweet, sort of sad at times, and more real than the typical teen comedy romance. The human characters were great. Jeff Garlin plays the ship captain and does an excellent job. One of the best scenes in the movie has the captain studying up on Earth wide eyed, learning all the things humans (now adays) have known since we were infants. John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy voice two humans who face reality before the others and get off their fat rears to have some fun and take a moment to notice the stars. The animation is the best Pixar's ever done, and even with the cartoonish designs of the characters, sometimes I'd forget I was watching a cartoon. Wall-E, as a character, was an amazing lead. Amazing in that he carried the movie flawlessly, and made me truly feel for the poor guy, and amazing in that the only thing that he says in the movie, along with some grunts and squeals, is 'EVE-a!'. I have no clue how Pixar molds these likable characters, but they did a fantastic job. I'd see it 10 more times in the theaters, and I hope it makes a billion at the box office.Pixar's done it again! They hit gold, more so than any of their other pictures, and Wall-E ranks up there with one of the best animated pictures of all time. It was the first film in months to leave me 100% satisfied. I loved it! My rating: **** out of ****. 100 mins. Rated G.",10,18,31,27 June 2008
Music and Lyrics," Very clichÃ©, but still very entertaining.
","Stars: Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Brad Garrett, Kristin Johnsten, Haley Bennett.I did not find this film to be anything new or exciting, however it was better than I expected. I found it 'cute' and amusing, and it seemed to go by very fast, so I couldn't grow tired of it. The plot is ex-pop star Alex Fletcher (Grant) wants to write a song for new pop sensation Cora (Bennett). He finds that the woman that takes care of his plants, Sophie Fisher (Barrymore) has a knack for writing lyrics, which is his weak point. The two become romantically involved...etc. etc....it was very predictable. But even though it was predictable, it still had a certain charm that made it likable. It could've been Drew Barrymore's neurotic Woody Allen like performance, or Hugh Grant's normal jerky, smart guy performance, but I was enjoying this. Its a film that many not be remembered in 5 years, or even 5 months, but it was still pretty amusing.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****.",6,2,4,19 February 2007

Earl Brown and Linda Blair.The original and true classic Scream film that redefined what makes a good slasher film. It starts off with a now classic opening starring Drew Barrymore as an unsuspecting victim that a killer is playing games with over the phone.

Back to the Future Part II," Faster paced, louder and zanier than the first...not always a good thing.
","The first Back to the Future film is very silly and not meant to be taken seriously. It's fast paced and full of goofy and zany acting. The first film leveled itself out with excellent pacing, and heart where it needed it. The movie is fast paced, but it's the right level of it, and gives itself time to cool down with scenes of dialogue. This movie starts, and it keeps going till it's over. This is one of the fastest paced movies ever, with a lot of stuff happening. There is no time to cool down in this movie as it keeps it's pace for almost two hours! With that said, it's still pretty effective as a sequel!Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) travel forward in time to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher LLoyd) so Marty can help prevent his future son from becoming a criminal. After several occurrences, some caused by Marty himself, Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) has his hands on both a sports statistics book that gives stats through 2000, and on the Delorean. After going back to 1985 where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley owning a huge casino, is married to Marty's mother (Lea Thompson), and Marty's father is dead. What ensues is a trip back to the 50s to stop this ever from happening.This movie has some really impressive sets. 2015 Hill Valley is a great set, and an excellent variation on the 1985 and '55 version. The Biff hotel set is another really cool looking and impressive set, and everything about the settings of this movie are really atmospheric. Normally this is something you don't even notice about movies, but here the aesthetics are a real positive.The movie starts off really well, and the ridiculously fast pacing isn't a problem. Set piece 2015 is fast paced, fine, then we get back to the fast paced 1985 Biff takeover, which is fine. It's once we get back to the 1950s where this movie becomes somewhat tedious and despite it's quick pace, it grows slightly boring. The zaniness is here more than in the first movie too. The Doc is zany, Marty is zany, Biff is zany...in fact, everything is so slapstick and silly it grows somewhat annoying. Even the scene that the trailer eagerly showed off Michael J Fox playing Marty, future Marty, Marty Jr., and Marlene McFly is sort of annoying because every character in the scene is really loud, like each character is trying to one up the last one. And that's one of the major problems in this movie is how loud every character is. Constant yelling does not mean hilarious performances.The acting, despite being too over the top at times is as good as the first. Thomas F Wilson plays a pretty convincing bad guy, and definitely knows how to be evil well. Michael J Fox and Christopher LLoyd also give excellent performances, along with the ensemble cast.Overall, this is a very good sequel. It's not up to par with the first, and grows annoying at times, but it's still an excellent second part to an excellent trilogy.My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins, PG for language and violence.",8,0,0,17 February 2010
1408," No real substance, but a fun and spooky horror movie nonetheless.
","Stars: John Cusack, Mary McDonnell, Samuel L. Jackson, Tony Shalhoub.Though I had some problems with this film, it still was probably the most entertaining horror film I've seen in the last 5 years. One of the main reasons it might have been so fun was having actor John Cusack playing the frightened victim and having Samuel L. Jackson play the hotel manager. When you have two good actors, movies always seem better. The plot for '1408' is pretty simple. Mike Enslin (Cusack) is a disheartened author who used to write well liked novels, and now writes about scary places to go. Enslin ends up at the Dolphin Hotel, home of 56 deaths in one room. When he stays in the room, he learns the truth about the room. I thought the movie could've been really scary, instead of just scary (which it was). It all too often scared the audience by putting them into a cool calm, then having a noise, or something loud jump out. I really liked the music, except for towards the end where I thought it was just getting too dramatic and didn't work. Though there were a few things I didn't like, '1408' was still a great scary movie that I could easily see again.My rating: *** out of ****. 87 mins. PG-13 for language and violence.",7,0,1,7 July 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Disappointing, not to say this wasn't a great movie.
","The Silence of the Lambs won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1992, and though I did enjoy Beauty and the Beast more, I can understand this winning. It was the best of the nominated films and overall that was a weak year. This movie is highly enjoyable with well written and even better acted out characters, such as Anthony Hopkins who seemed to gain the fame that he had been searching for after years of acting with his portrayal of the psychotic Dr. Hannibal Lechter. The direction is good, and the situations, though horrible, are also believable. It doesn't seem to far-fetched that a serial killer would make a coat of human skin, does it? I think the problem here is a lack of true tension. Scenes trying to be suspenseful and tense came off almost as clichés, and weren't nearly as scary as they could have been.FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is on the case of a serial killer who is known as Buffalo Bill, but in order to get information on him, she must go to incarcerated psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lechter, who was put away for killing and eating his victims. As the story progresses Clarice begins to learn more and Buffalo Bill continues killing and skinning his victims.This movie is very good, not excellent, but very good. Many critics say this movie is so disgustingly violent, but that's just not true. Though violence does occur, none of it was over the top, and it occurred very infrequently throughout the picture. The acting is top notch, with as I (and anyone else who reviewed this mentioned) said earlier, with Anthony Hopkins pulling the most he could out of his scenes. Jodie Foster was also very good, and so was Ted Levine as the disturbed serial killer Buffalo Bill. The scary moments...well, for me there were none. Any scene trying to be scary fell flat. One scene involves a character being stalked by a man with night vision goggles in his dark house, and that scene should have had my heart pumping for the safety of the character, but it didn't. I found it clichéd and very typical of any slasher film. Another thing that just didn't work for me was constant flashbacks from Jodie Foster looking back at her traumatic childhood. It should have had real drama, but again felt contrived and clichéd. I also didn't like the musical score, which felt like something that belonged on an episode of NYPD Blue, or some TV show, and not in a good movie.Overall, this movie was great, and entertaining to watch, but it has some faults that drop it from a thrilling adventure I want to watch again and again to a very good movie, but a mediocre thriller.My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins. R for language and some blood violence.",8,0,2,19 June 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," As a whole this is an effective conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy, but it's not without it's flaws
","Where the last two films in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy played more or less like fairly intimate stories in the Batman universe, this one feels like it's going for the biggest scale it possibly could, with as much destruction and as many thugs as you can fit on screen. The problem here is the unrelentingness of everything that settles in at about the halfway mark. It grows tiring long before the climax kicks in because it's just too much of everything.Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse and 'Batman' has gone into hiding for the past 8 years since Harvey Dent's death. After an encounter with a cat burglar, Selena Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and an inspiring speech from his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce decides he needs to go back out to social events, and begin fighting crime as Batman again. Meanwhile, masked terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy), and a large group of followers take over Gotham city, destroying all ways of leaving or coming in, with the threat of setting off a nuclear bomb located on the island. Meanwhile (yet again), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) is severely injured by Bane and stuck in the hospital, a new hot head cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is trying to stop Bane through detective work, and Wayne board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) is given control of Wayne Enterprises. Bane massacres Bruce Wayne and throws him into a prison located elsewhere, and it's up to Bruce to summon his strength to try and escape. Meanwhile the criminals take over Gotham and anarchy ensues.There are a lot of characters here, but they are balanced in their sub-plots quite well. Anne Hathaway gives a really good performance as 'Catwoman', both hamming it up at times, and also remaining quite subtle when appropriate. Levitt is also a good addition to the cast, as we have a character to care about that is fighting crime, but through detective work and not through being placed in the action like ol' Batman. Having so many main characters was nice to try and avoid repetition, though from the last hour plus, it doesn't work well enough. The film grows somewhat boring by about the halfway mark. The pace becomes unrelenting, and it's just somewhat of a sensory overload. The editing is quick, the shots are quick, and while stuff is happening and Gotham is about to become a smoldering pit, too much is happening too quickly. And when the villains take over Gotham, you begin thinking of scenarios that would happen with the people of Gotham, and how they would react, but nothing does. They pretty much just go into hiding. Unrealistically, no vigilantes even try to take some of the villains out, but whatever, that's not what the movie is about. This movie is not above running on many action movie clichés that feel like they belong in lesser pictures. People saving others at the last minute after seemingly coming out of nowhere, and the old everybody else gets killed but the main characters (for no real reason), and then of course many coincidences that happen to effect the outcome of the picture. The same clichés you'd see in a movie like 'Sahara' from a few years back are prominently used here. Character motives also seem to be slightly off. Why does Batman turn to Catwoman for help exactly? No real logical reason except to pair the two up.Hans Zimmer's score is effective in driving the action, in that his music here mainly consists of low strings acting almost as drums to move everything along. It drives the action, but at the same time is extremely generic and not very interesting, but it does keep a rhythm going in the action. And unlike Inception, the generic weepy Zimmer music doesn't intrude on scenes that are trying to be emotional. It's a step up from Inception's score in that regard, but is still quite mediocre.The climax of the film is nice. After all the twists and turns are introduced, it gets down to the heart of the story, and the last ten minutes or so, minus some coincidental and corny moments, are really good and satisfying. For the most part, the conclusion to the film is satisfying and works on an emotional level. This film concludes the Dark Knight trilogy quite well. It's an imperfect film, with a lot of drag time in the middle of the picture, and just a few too many clichés thrown in, but the ending is mostly very nice, and as a whole, the picture is entertaining, full of action, and enough happens to justify it's nearly three hour length. My rating: *** out of ****. 165 mins. PG-13 for nonstop action violence.",7,4,9,24 July 2012
Toy Story 3," Just as good as the other two Toy Story films, and that's saying a lot!
","Since Pixar made the first Toy Story film in 1995, they have been consistently making beautiful and deep animated pictures, but in the last three or so years, they've really hit their stride. They've gotten down the emotion and the humor better than ever and Toy Story 3 just shows how brilliant the team at Pixar is, and how they've learned from their very few mistakes. Really a brilliant film company, and a lovely animated feature.Andy is now seventeen, and the toys are being neglected. In order to still be loved, all of them but Woody decide to be donated to day care. Woody escapes and ends up in a little girl's room, while the rest of the gang is tormented by the horrors of daycare and the scrutiny of the very evil ruler, Lotso Bear. A crime prison flick ensues.This movie, more so than any other Pixar film, jumps from genre to genre so flawlessly, and humorously. Drama, to comedy, to horror, and for a large chunk it was a prison escape film, and it was just as gripping and suspenseful as any live action prison escape film I've seen. Along with amusing dialogue and a captivating plot, the seamless genre jumping that Pixar knows how to work with makes their films never boring. And this film is really good at playing on every emotion. When it wants to be funny, it's funny, when it wants to be action packed and suspenseful, it is. The drama is on high too when it wants to be, and though this may not be as tear inducing as Pixar's last two outings, it'll choke you up all the same.The direction on this thing is fantastic. Each shot seems to be so expertly laid out, and depending on what the shot is, the scene is played a different way. Obviously this is true with any competent film, but it's noticeable here. To go with the direction, the animation is fantastic and the 3-D, which normally just adds a level of gimmickry, instead makes the animation all the more vibrant and the danger in the film all the more real seeming.Climaxes are always a difficult aspect of the film, because some people will feel it's too light a climax, some might feel the characters were never in any danger. This movie has a fantastic climax, where the danger feels as real as in any other film. The emotions are high, and the animation again makes this scene so beautiful, in both the surroundings and the character acting.Overall, Pixar has yet again made a masterpiece. They are so experienced at playing on real emotions and making things sad without being hokey, along with being funny and pacing a film. This is one more notch on their belt of perfection, and yet another destined classic!My rating: **** out of ****. 109 mins. Rated G.",10,2,4,18 June 2010
Signs," M. Night Shyamalan's annoying direction style actually works here!
","Mr. Shyamalan has made three good movies in my opinion (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs), which happen to be his three consecutive drama/thrillers. Shyamalan's most recent films may have some good qualities to them, but they aren't exceptional in any way because of his poor and repetitive direction. In Signs, he got lucky that his direction of the actors happened to work. In every one of his movies, he has the actors at moment of 'extreme drama' whisper to each other, no matter where they are, and it's a strange and usually ineffective technique. Here, for some reason it worked...probably because Mel Gibson is a good enough actor to actually convey the drama that was meant to be shown in the scenes. Shyamalan also does this annoying thing where he has a character ask another character something and they look away and give a belated answer of a nod or a small head shake. These techniques don't seem that bad, but when every movie he makes has the same character direction, you wonder how diverse or good of a director this person actually is. Luckily, any of his techniques were lost among the powerful script, enthralling story and overall real drama that this movie has.Alien crop circles are appearing various places all over the world. One of them is on the Hess's farm. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is an ex-priest who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a car accident. Also living on the farm are his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and his two kids Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin). Aliens start appearing on the farm, never actually visible, usually hiding in the cornfields, and Graham feels he must board up the house. Drama and some pretty tense and suspenseful scenes ensue.M. Night Shyamalan's screenplays seem to try to be deep, and this movie actually felt sort of deep. Not to give away any spoilers, but signs can be found in many ways, not just in the crop fields. The movie is funny when it's trying to be, and sad when it's trying to be, and even at times it sent a chill down my spine from some of the scares thrown in, and they aren't just the typical jump scares. The characters are likable and pretty easy to connect with as real people. It can be slow at times, which is true with any of the director's (I'm tired of writing out his last name) movies, but most of the slow scenes added to character development. Up to this point M. Night was known for his surprising twist endings, and the ending is sort of a twist here, but it was also just a great ending.I've come to realise that M.N.S. is not as great a writer or director as he was once touted, but he still has made some really good movies, and this was a wonderful one. Please Mr. Shyamalan, come out of your stage of mediocrity and come up with another great movie like this one!My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG-13 for terror and language.",9,0,5,18 June 2008
Beowulf," Great animation, good characters, and a dull, predictable plot.
","'Beowulf' is not at all what the trailers portray it to be. They make it look like a nonstop action scene. Where there are a lot of action scenes, and they all are done very well, this movie is actually quite slow moving, and has very little plot for the long time it fills.The plot of 'Beowulf' is an amazingly simple one. A creature kills many men during a party, and the king needs a hero, so here comes Beowulf. Beowulf slays the beast, but can he kill an oddly seductive animated Angelina Jolie, or will he give into his primal instincts....not a hard one to figure out. I'm not going to go too deep into the plot, simply because I don't want to spoil anything.The movie is split into two separate times, one a bit earlier than the other. The first half of the film was really enjoyable. I liked the characters I was being introduced to, the action was fun to watch, if not just to show off how much money they spent to make it look this good. The dialog was mildly amusing too. The second half was boring and predictable and led the movie nowhere. Where in the commercials it looks like this movie has nonstop action in many sets...it doesn't. The movie is mostly localized inside the King's mead hall, where much of the action and all of the drinking takes place. It was good that it took place in one area almost the entire movie because it gave the audience an intimate feel with the area, but it also never let us see what beautiful 3D CGI world that could have been created. The animation was lush and detailed, but that didn't make up for lack of story.'Beowulf' could have been a grand and heroic tale, but instead was merely interesting animation, well choreographed action scenes, and a whole lot of nothing.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 106 mins. PG-13 for animated nudity and violence.",6,1,8,16 November 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," An animation style all it's own, and to back it up, great characters.
","Wes Anderson has been criticized for his works being too slow, and not funny enough, and for a variety of things. Like all of his other films, this is unmistakably a Wes Anderson film through and through, with offbeat characters, and quietly funny scenes, and subtle character development. This movie is quite subtle in the jokes and in a lot of lines, so children may or may not understand different parts of the film to be funny, but even if they don't they'll be dazzled by the odd, but amazing looking animation.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) has to give up his life as a chicken thief once he finds out Mrs. Felicity Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant. Two human years later he's working as a newspaper columnist to feed his wife and his not so athletic son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox, being the wild animal that he is, grows tired of his mundane life and along with his buddy Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky), he begins robbing farms again, which angers three farmers who are dead set on killing Mr. Fox. Meanwhile, Fox's athletic nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) moves in and makes Ash jealous. Chaos ensues throughout.This movie's animation style is a style of it's own. It's stop motion animated, and has that extra dimension because of this, but instead of making all kinds of wide sets to put the characters on, everything is flat. This movie at times resembles a traditionally drawn cartoon, because of it's flat animation. That sounds like a bad thing, but it is actually very unique and great to look at. The sets and the characters and everything just look amazing.Character development is subtle...especially to kids. It will definitely either be very subtle or fly over kids' heads altogether. One scene Ash in mean to Kristofferson because he's jealous, and they bond silently over the running of a toy train. It's a sweet scene, but again development is quiet and implied. Another scene (not giving away any spoilers here), where the simple response of a creature after a long speech is to raise it's arm in an agreeing manner, is also quiet but meaningful.Problems with this movie range from some bouts of 'humorous' dialogue that aren't overly hilarious, to strange character quirks that have you puzzled until the end, but it's still a well done, original and entertaining family film. Director/writer Wes Anderson did a good job writing like himself but keeping the Roald Dahl touch in there.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. PG for fake cussing, drinking and smoking (Yeah, that's right, movies are rated up for smoking now!)",8,0,2,11 December 2009

John McClane (Willis) is now a detective who goes out simply to pick up a young computer hacker Matt Farrell (Long), and ends up trying to save the world. Like the first Die Hard film, this is only an action film. Any dialogue that isn't there for humor, or plot movement is non-existent. This film is pretty much pure action, and it is extremely enjoyable. Bruce Willis, though getting older, can still pack a punch, and he has some really fun action scenes. I highly recommend this, because this is the best McClane we've seen since the original.My rating: *** out of ****.",8,4,7,7 July 2007

The Sixth Sense," Great horror drama. The best and scariest ever!!!!!!
","Sixth Sense(1999)-Haley Joel Osment, Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Mischa Barton, Trevor Morgan and Donnie Wahlberg.All I can say is Wow! This is great. The beginning starts off with complete darkness and no music and gives you goosebumps. You are immmediately pulled into great music(It's really good and catchy, and also very sad and dreary). It starts off with Bruce Willis(Malcom Crowe) and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating over Malcom being a good psychiatrist. A former patient is in their bathroom and shoot Malcom and then shoots himself. It goes to a year later and Malcom is miserable and meets a boy(Osment as Cole Spears) that has a horrible secret of talking to the dead. It has some scary moments and is groundbreaking. when it is at a slow part, it has scary music to make you interested. Just a great film that is very sad. I won't tell the ending, but in my opinion, it's a tear jerker. My rating: 10/10.",10,0,0,9 February 2005
Rear Window," Hitchcock and Stewart at their best!
","What do you get when you cross a great script with Alfred Hitchcock directing and James Stewart starring? You get one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. Some films like this fail, but because 'Rear Window' focuses so much on characters, not only do you want to see and hear more, but you become really involved in their pain and in their lives. The plot of this film is L.B. Jeffries (Stewart) has broken his leg, and the only thing to do to pass the time is look out the window at his neighbors. When he begins to believe that one neighbor across the way had killed the man's wife, he becomes obsessed watching him. It's really amazing how a great film can be made out of this. The whole movie takes place in one set, with James Stewart only in his room the entire movie, but it works so well. Along with being a thriller, this movie also has some a lot of light comedy, especially in Jimmy Stewart watching the neighbors do various things. This shows what Hitchcock's direction is all about, and was a real gem for Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Jones and Thelma Ritter. I highly recommend you see this.My rating: **** out of ****. 111 mins.

300," Very well done film, excellent action, good dialogue.
","When I heard a movie was coming out about the Battle of Thermopylae, I figured it would try to be about as historically accurate as possible. This was accurate in some ways, but also delightfully exaggerated making the whole movie feel like a live action cartoon. The movie follows King Leonidas and his army of 300 fighting and defeating the massive armies. Where slow motion action can often be boring, the many scenes of slow motion action is this were extremely interesting as we got to see exactly how this army of 300 was prevailing. The film really didn't have any shortcomings, except sometime it got a little too strange for it's own good, but coming from Frank Miller you have to expect this. Another small thing that this movie had was amusing dialogue, which is odd, in a good way, for a serious war film. My eyes were glued to the screen from the moment it started, to the great ending. I highly recommend it!My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 112 mins. Rated R for strong violence, sexuality and nudity.",9,1,9,9 March 2007
Pineapple Express," Muddled plot and annoying characters. Truly a movie only a stoner could love (and they do).
","Seth Rogen who has become a famous name attached the the Judd Appatow line of movies, has written another movie since Superbad (and the horrible Drillbit Taylor). As filthy and profane as Superbad is, this movie is rife with drug humor and stoner references, that everyone may understand, but only those who have experimented (most likely right before the movie started) in that area will belt out the most laughs. For me, the drug humor really wasn't that funny, and was just kind of dumb, the plot was all over the place, and the characters were obnoxious. Of course, amongst all these negatives, this was an enjoyable movie at times, but the good and the bad evened each other out to make nothing more than a dumb, average stoner comedy.Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a normal working man, serving sepenas with a sense of humor. His two loves in life are his high school aged girlfriend, and pot. One night after buying a new, rare type of pot from his dealer Saul (James Franco), Dale is off to serve another sepena, and while at the house, he witnesses a murder. He drops his joint at the sight and drives off, hitting the murderers' cars. The first murderer is the head drug lord, and the second is Rosie Perez who for some reason is in this movie as a love interest (God knows why) and a corrupt cop. Dale and Saul end up going on a stoner trip to stop the drug lord and survive in the process.The acting in this movie is quite good, and fitting for the stupid characters. Seth Rogen and James Franco know how to act like stoners. Perhaps they both are, for Rogen to write this and Franco to write the Ape. But nonetheless, they are the correct choices to play these bad characters. The fight scenes are shot well, so the camera direction is fine. It's the writing and characters that truly lack.Like a child who has just drunk way too much caffeine, this movie is all over the place. The plot jumps from here to here to here, by the end it was as though I had just sat through an anthology of stoner stories, none of which were particularly enthralling. Many critics say the buddy comedy portion of the film is less enjoyable than the action. I partially agree. The buddy comedy parts, with Rogen, Franco and Danny McBride who plays Saul's dealer Red, were sometimes funny and sometimes irritating. The action scenes were more fast paced and fun to watch, but they always came on too quick and ended too soon. The movie's funniest moments come from the action scenes, including one scene where James Franco drives a car with his foot stuck in the glass of the front window. However, everything for this movie was a mixed bag and nothing ever fully worked.Overall, this movie will appeal to stoners, because of how relateable it is, and some teenagers will enjoy the raunchy material, but to anyone else, this is just your dumb, average movie. Let me emphasize dumb.My rating: ** out of ****. 110 mins. R for drug content, language and violence.",5,3,9,30 August 2008
Jackie Brown," Like Pulp Fiction, a story with clever dialogue and character development
","Jackie Brown-1997-Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forester, Robert Deniro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Chris Tucker, Tiny Lister, Aimmie Graham and Sid Haig.I'll go over the plot and then review it. Ordell Robbie(Jackson) is an illegal arms seller. One of his aquaintences Beaumont Livingston(Tucker) was put in jail for carrying a machine gun that he bought from Ordell. Ordell goes to Max Cherry (Forester) and gets a 10,000 dollar bond to get Beaumont out of jail. After getting him out, Ordell pays Beaumont a visit and kills him. Later.....while walking in the airport parking lot from her job as a stewardess, Jackie Brown(Grier) is stopped by two FBI agents Mark Dargas(Bowen) and Ray Nicholette(Keaton). They check her bags and we soon figure out that Beaumont told everything to get out of going to jail. Jackie is Ordell's money runner for the guns he sells. Unfortunately, in the money bag for him, the buyer had slipped in some cocaine for Ordell and Jackie goes to jail. Ordell goes back to Max and has him move the 10,000 dollars from Beaumont to Jackie. Max drives her to her house and is beginning to fall for her. Ordell goes to Jackies house to try to kill her, but Jackie stole Max's gun and protects herself. This all spirals into fooling Ordell out of 40,000 dollars.My review: 9 out of 10. Robert Deniro and Bridget Fonda were excellent together as Ordell's friend and girlfriend. Keaton has a gem role that's small but important. Grier and Forester are in their best roles ever and Jackson is good as always. This movie is not fast paced but has so much interesting dialogue that makes up for it. Tarantino knew what he was doing.R for language, some brief bloody violence, drug content and a brief scene of sexuality(between Deniro and Fonda)",9,13,17,2 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Just downright one of the most entertaining films ever.
","Stars: Mark Hammil, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Frank Oz (voice and puppeteering), Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels, ALec Guiness and James Earl Jones.The 5th episode of Star Wars, or the second film is by far the best. This episode is about many things, one of the main plots is Luke's training to be a Jedi master by the crazy little green puppet that looks a bit like Peter Falk, Yoda. This also has the surprise ending that shocked America, 'Luke, I am your father.' Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are good too as the feuding not quite couple. Good scripting, good direction and just plain a good movie.My rating: ****/****",10,0,1,31 July 2006
Sin City," Extreme violence, great writing, great direction and for the most part, great acting!
","Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Benicio del Toro, Devon Aoki, Nick Stahl, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Carla Guigino, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Rutger Hauer, Patricia Vonne, Josh Hartnett and Frank Miller as the priest.This movie is so entertaining, most of all because of the fabulous direction. The black and white, with spots of vibrant colors....it's cool! This movie is made up of three stories. The first story is about crazy man Marv(Rourke) meeting beautiful Goldie(King). He's really ugly, but she shows him compassion, but when they sleep together, someone kills her in the bed, and Marv is blamed for it. He goes on a killing rampage to find out who killed his girl. He ends up getting help by several hookers, including Becky(Bledel) and Gail(Dawson) and help by exotic dancer Nanci Callahan(Alba). The story runs at 34 minutes long, and is my favorite one.Story two is about Shelley(Murphy), a skimpy waitress getting a visit from her ex-boyfriend Jackie-boy(Toro) and her new boyfriend Dwight(Owen) teaches him a lesson. When Jack leaves, Dwight follows him around and sees he goes to Whore's Alley and tries to pick up girls and with the help of hooker and his new girl Gail(Dawson) they stop him and stop crime boss Manute(Duncan) from taking over the alley. 39 mins.Story 3 actually starts the film off with the first ten minutes of it, and ends it also. Nice cop Hartigan(Willis) has to retire from his job due to his bad heart condition, but he's not through. He needs to catch Junior(Stahl) who has skinny young Nanci Callahan(age 11) and is planning on raping her. Junior's dad is the senator and very powerful. Hartigan's ex-partner Bob(Madsen) realises that they will go down with Junior, and after Hartigan shoots Junior's ear, hand, and penis off, he shoots Hartigan and leaves him for dead. Hartigan is hospitilized and beaten merciless until he admits he raped her. He is put in jail for eight years and gets cleverly disguised letters from Nanci every Thursday. When he gets out, he sees Nanci, age 19 and tries to protect her from Junior, who had work done to grow his ear, hand and penis back, and has become a fat yellow freak. This segment is 38 minutes in length.The opening/closing involves a romantic hit-man(Josh Hartnett) that seduces women and then kills them.my review-A. Excellent coloring, when there is color. The blood looks even redder. The eyes look even bluer. It's cool!rated R for non-stop extreme violence, sexuality and nudity.*Beware..this is extreme violence including men getting limbs ripped off one by one, nonstop heads coming off, blood and guts all over and even a man getting his penis and testicles getting ripped off on screen.",9,5,7,16 August 2005
True Romance," Great movie!!!
","Christian Slater, Pattricia Arquette, Michael Rappaport, Dennis Hopper, Bronson Pinchot, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Conchetta Ferrell, Val Kilmer and Samuel L. Jackson.Extremely violent and extremely fun. Dork Clarence Worley(Slater) meets call girl Alabama(Arquette) and shortly after marries her, but it's not a real marriage until he kills her former pimp, Drexl(Oldman). After killing him, he goes to his father(Hopper) for help and meets a lot of interesting side characters. Great dialogue and dark humorous violence mix together to make this film. Also making up this film are the cameos by Samuel L. jackson, Val Kilmer and comic relief cameo Brad Pitt as Floyd the druggie roommate. SOme scenes let the violence take control, which are the worst scenes, but there aren't that many scenes like that. The film includes the breakthrough performance for Michael Rapaport as Dick Ritchie. The best performances were Walken as Vincenzo Cocotti the mobster and as mentioned earlier, Gary Oldman in a small role as a pimp named Drexl.R for sex/nudity, violence, lots of drug content and language. 116 mins.A minus.",8,1,3,20 August 2005
Donnie Darko," A scary, disturbing film that you need to watch at least twice.
","Donnie Darko-Jake Gyllenhall, Elizibeth Gylenhall, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Noah WyleThis film is a terrifying film in many ways. This has spoilers and the movie will be revealed, so be wary. One night, a disturbed teenage boy, Donnie Darko, wakes up because a voice is calling him. A six foot tall rabbit that you only get a small glimpse of is outside his room. It tells him the world will end in 28 days. This rabbit is a lifesaver, because the rabbit called him out, and saved his life. That night, a jet engine fell on his house and would have killed him if it weren't for this mysterious creature. The next night, it appears in his bedroom (scary) and tells him to flood the school. Because he does this, school is cancelled and he meets a girl that he ends up going out with, all because of the school flooding. This rabbit tells him his name is Frank, next time he sees him. He also tells him basically, that he has time traveled and tells Donnie about it. Donnie follows a time travel beam, only to find a gun hidden in it. He, meanwhile is suffering through a mean psycologists (Swayze) lectures. Donnie and his girl go to the movies and Frank appears and tells him to burn Swayze's house down, and he does. This leads to cops finding his underground children sex center, and he is hauled to jail. Frank takes the mask off, and is a person missing an eye with blood trickling down. One thing leads to another and Donnie and his girlfriend (on Halloween) try to find a book on time travel by breaking into an old lady's house and they get attacked by two other kids and they beat them up and throw the girl in the street, where she is hit by a car and killed. The driver is a young man named Frank that has a bunny mask for Halloween. Donnie, in his anger takes the gun he found in the portal and shoots Frank right in the eye and kills him. Donnie has ruined people lives and realizes that it isn't fair, so he finds a way to travel back to the day the engine crashed. He knows what will happen and stays in his room waiting to be killed. The engine crushes and kills him, and his girlfriend doesn't know him. It is very scary when Frank the bunny pops in, and very sad ending.My review:9/10 (Good!)",9,0,1,4 March 2005
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Mind numbing!!!!
","Transformers 2 was unbearably horrible, it was almost sure that part 3 would have to be better, as being worse would be nearly impossible. Unfortunately, Michael Bay has made a film about on par with his last trainwreck Transformers movie, and this, like this last movie is a thoroughly dumb and unenjoyable sensory overload full of poorly thought out plot points, dumb dialogue in this sort of surreal fantasy world where everyone is as goofy as can be.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is living in a nice apartment with his new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and needs some action in his life. He gets a new job, and is almost killed, and meanwhile Optimus Prime makes a trip to the moon to gain pillars and to bring back his old friend Sentinel Prime. Meanwhile again, Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) is Carly's boss, and Sam is jealous. And then Megatron and the Decepticons take over Chicago. And then there's action. And then it ends (thank God).Transformers 2 must have been too serious for people, because Michael Bay just had the actors go all out slapstick performances. It was like an unfunny reproduction of the Three Stooges or something. Comedic scenes are comedic only because of these cartoon like performances where everyone is a comedian, and nobody seems to care about impending danger, but instead just want to lighten the mood with their nightclub routines. The first hour of the movie is so silly and lightweight, it literally serves no purpose whatsoever. No scenes had any effect on the next scenes. Shia Labeouf is almost killed, and this scene is followed by a 5 minute speech about love with his parents. Chicago is destroyed by Decepticons, and immediately following we see people casually walking through destroyed Chicago like they're going for a stroll before work or something. An entire sub-plot about Sam getting a job is completely dropped, and serves no point in the movie except to introduce these bizarrely eccentric characters and give the audience some very dumb yuk- yuks. A bizarre scene has Russians pulling guns on Sam and John Turturro, and it literally is just there for laughs. It's so over the top, and cloying for cheap laughs, it's almost pathetic, and again, has no impact on anything. In fact, this entire movie could have been scrapped, and the big battle at the end could have basically been the film, because really that's all that mattered in the 'plot'.Character motivations are way off too. Patrick Dempsey wants the Decepticons to win, because he was promised he will be saved, and not killed by them. He knows that their plot is to enslave humans, and he also admits a dislike for Megatron. When the Autobots come, Dempsey goes and tattles to the Decepticons. So...does he want to be a slave? Not tattling would have had no repercussion on him, and actually could cause him not to be a slave. Also making no sense is Patrick Dempsey's henchmen and workers who stay loyal to him in the face of total annihilation. As the robots destroy Chicago and kill people, they stay guarding Carly like this job is of some importance. Humans are being enslaved and they are taking some meaningless job when they should be running for their dear life. Again, it's like no characters think through anything that happens. The Transformers are hard to watch. They walk around with English, New York, Italian and other accents and why? Are they from these places or just made to be exactly like Earth people? Megatron's henchmen robots are like Igor from Frankenstein, and one of them even has this giant rag on their head to make them seem like a lowly servant, but why? Why would a robot wear this? Did they see people doing this in clichéd sci fi movies? And to top that off, the robots know all the cool Earth slang and speak in it, and the little robots seem to have high libidos. The only purpose for them being so anthropomorphic is to get the audience to laugh at their lame one-liners, and they come off as horrible clichés. This is a movie that is pandering to it's audience through bottom of the barrel dumb comedy, big loud action scenes and a nonexistent plot. But it's terribleness goes beyond that. It's a movie where even the most idiotic of individuals in the audience has more brains in their head than any of the characters, and nobody thinks through any situation, and no decisions make any sort of logical sense. It's a series of unnecessary events that leads to an overlong finale that is more headache inducing than fun. This might be a tiny bit better than Transformers 2, but the two movies are close to being on par. If you just think about any aspect of the film, you will realize nothing makes any sense. This was just awful!My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 153 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.",2,15,32,10 July 2011
Goodfellas," A good script and plot are turned into a great movie through the performances.
","'Goodfellas' is an exceptional mobster film, but not because of it's plot or script. It's a good plot, nothing too exceptional however, and the characters are pretty solid throughout, every one being a complete sleaze-ball. The performances are amazing. Ray Liotta is the main character and actually shows off his acting abilities best through his super slick narration throughout the film. Joe Pesci gives an outstanding supporting performance as the tough, wiseguy he plays in most movies, but for some reason it stands out here. Robert Deniro also gives an amazing(ly tough) and powerful performance. It's all about the cool direction and great acting for this film.Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster ever since he was a young boy. We learn his background and how he gets caught up with the mobsters, from the good times to the bad. Two of his closest friends are Jimmy (Robert Deniro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci). Tommy (especially) goes crazy with power and eventually these three are working their way to the top of the mob standings.One problem with this movie is the lack of any soul or redeeming characters. The characters we are presented are interesting to listen to and follow, but we know each one is a violent criminal. Even movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Pulp Fiction' give us characters that if not redeeming, become somewhat redeeming by the end of the film and make us care about them. For all I cared, they could've massacred the entire cast of characters. I'd still have had a heck of a time watching them, as I did, they just weren't likable. Luckily, the most likable character is also the narrator and star of the film, Ray Liotta.Overall, this is a great mobster film, with some outstanding performances and snappy direction. However, the lack of any redeeming characters might annoy viewers who need at least one person to root for, though those people may find themselves rooting for the three main guys to murder to whole lot of them just for the entertainment value.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins.

Shark Tale," Has its moments.
","Stars: Will Smith, Renee Zellwegger, Jack Black, Robert Deniro, Martin Scorsece, Peter Falk, Angelina Jolie and Katie Couric.I can't say anything too bad about this film, but I can't say anything too good. I thought the animation was really smooth, and it was nice how all the fish looked like their voice actors. My problem with this was how much you don't care about the main character 'Shark Slaying' Oscar. The best scenes in this movie are the Robert Deniro/Godfather scenes. I found those to be great parodies, and I really got in to them. However I just found the rest of the film to be too showey, and not enough emotion. I do recommend this if you enjoy computer animated films however.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 91 mins. PG for mild violence.",6,2,4,22 November 2006
Beetlejuice," Strangely entertaining!
","starring: Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, Glen Shadix, Michael Keaton, Sylvia Sydney, Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett and Tony Cox.Extremely nice people Barbra(Davis)and Adam(Baldwin) in a freak car accident. After the funeral, they become ghosts and try to haunt the owners of their house(Mom-Catherine O'Hara, Dad-Jeffrey Jones and strange daughter Ryder). Lisa(Ryder) can see them and gets pictures of them. They go to the death side and talk to their agent Juno(Sydney), which doesn't do any good, so they resort to bio-exorcist Beetlegeuse(Keaton). Some problems with this movie are that some of it doesn't make sense, like the dinner table haunting song, and that title character Beetlegeuse, only has around 15 minutes of screen time, only having 5 minutes in the first hour of the film. But, nonetheless, Keaton does a great job as that little evil demon, Ryder is great, Sydney is really cool, and my personal favorite is Glenn Shadix as Otho, the flamboyant plumo interior designer that thinks he can control the paranormal. Stupid, but fun!Watch for Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet as friends of the family that are invited to dinner, at separate occasions.rated PG for strong language(the dreaded F-word is used), gory violent images and some sexual refferneces. 2 3/4 out of 4 stars. 87 mins.",7,1,3,9 September 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Bravo to the Simpsons. This was a hilariously brilliant movie!
","The Simpsons is without a doubt my favorite television show, and because of this, the movie obviously had to be perfect...and it was pretty darn close. It seems having 11 writers from the show helped. All the jokes used were the best jokes, and they were mostly new ones, not seen on the show. I was laughing through the entire movie because of this. The direction, by longtime Simpsons director David Silverman looks better than ever, and made the movie even better to watch. The emotion that many fans have said is missing from recent episodes was quite plentiful here, making it not just an 80 minute long joke, but it layered the film, making it a movie and not just an average Simpsons episode. Though the plot itself is pretty thin, it's still obviously there. The movie deals with Springfield deciding to clean up Lake Springfield because of Lisa, and Homer dumps a silo of pig excrement into the lake, causing the Environmental Protection Agency to go nuts and lock Springfield in a dome. Once head of the EPA Russ Cargill (Voiced by A. Brooks) decides to blow up Springfield, it's up to the Simpsons to save the day, and Homer to grow up. A gripe I've heard by many people, is the movie didn't have enough of the side characters. Where it is true that the Simpsons were in much more of the film than any other characters, most of the other characters had many funny lines, like Moe, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse, Nelson, Lenny and Carl, Barney, Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Grampa and dozens of more classic characters. So, in the end, in no way was this movie a disappointment, and this is coming from a huge fan of the early Simpsons, who has remained a fan over the years. Long live the Simpsons!!!!

Evil Dead II," Like the first, this has next to no plot., but it's one of the funnest movies I've ever seen.
","The 'Evil Dead' trilogy stays about the same each film in quality and entertainment, but as they go on each one is more silly than the last in seems. The first 'Evil Dead' was funny in a morbid way. It had some very dark humor, and was more of a horror film than a comedy. This movie has many horror elements to it, including several jump scenes and a very creepy atmosphere, but this a comedy. People who take this as a horror movie will probably be disappointed, but most people it seems in the first few minutes will figure out that this is meant to be funny, not scary.To (sort of) retell what happened in the first film, the first 10 minutes of the film show a different but similar story as the first movie, including leaving off exactly where that one did. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is stuck in the woods in a cabin haunted with 'Deadite' demons that possessed his girlfriend and caused him to dispose of her. The demons are brought to life through a professor's recording of the Book of the Dead, and the professor's and a few others end up in the cabin with Ash. Blood, guts and hilarity ensues.Some say this is a remake of the original, and it's not, though it is similar to the first. Both take place in the cabin, though this one obviously takes place right after the first. Where most sequels pale in comparison to the originals, this one was even better than the first. The special effects were amazing. The over the top direction and acting were hilarious, including one scene where a moose head in the cabin begins to laugh and it's obviously infectious because soon the whole cabin including Ash in uproariously laughing. Weird and funny creatures are around every corner, as are the one liners from Bruce Campbell that go with them. There's little plot, but that's a good thing here so we get to see more creatures. One problem in this is the ending. It's a great, though bizarre cliffhanger, so make sure to have a copy of 'Army of Darkness' to pop in right after to pick up where this leaves off.Overall, this is a hilarious, sort of scary comedy/horror film that takes from many genres making it an extremely fresh film. It's probably the best of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence.",9,2,3,5 June 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Usually very entertaining, It certainly looks great.
","From the opening of the film, almost to the end, this movie has a great feel. The cinematography is beautiful, and following around these three escaped convicts is interesting to watch. But, unfortunately, these characters are only so interesting, and the situations are what the movie has to rely on. The situations become tiring, and then the characters have to run the show. It would've been good if both were great at all times, but they just weren't.Everett (George Clooney), Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (John Turturro) have just escaped from prison. They go on several long adventures, sing a few songs, and more than anything, try to avoid the police. All 3 of the leading actors are very good, and have an odd (but great) chemistry with each other. Tim Blake Nelson, especially, stands out acting wise as the confused convict who wants to be erased of all his sins. The movie has no real plot or center, which is fine, but some of the sub-plots are dull, and bring this movie down a level from where it could be. Overall though, this is a beautiful looking, interesting character piece on three good hearted convicts.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.",8,4,4,3 February 2008
