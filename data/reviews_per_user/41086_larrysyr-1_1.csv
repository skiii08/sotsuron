Ali," A disappointing movie
","I looked forward to seeing this movie for a long time. Unfortunately, Will Smith does not capture the deep solidity Ali brings to life.Throughout the legal battle over the draft, Smith portrays a sullen person refusing, for no particular reason, to be inducted.My memory of this period in Ali's life is that he was open, honest and steadfast in his refusal to be drafted. The man never shrank (publicly) from the consequences of his decision, a decision based on principle, not on whim.In this film, Ali not only seems smaller than his public image, he seems smaller than life. If this is the 'real' Muhammad Ali, how did he ever hold anyone's attention? As I remember the real person, he was loud, engaging, charismatic and exceptionally tough. Not a comic book superhero, simply an amazing man. In this movie, there is nothing amazing.",2,1,3,15 April 2006
