Catch Me If You Can," When Frank Abagnale JR escaped out of the airplane bathroom toilet
","I hope I am phrasing this correct, but I am referring to the airplanebathroom scene, when the Paris to New York plane was landing near theend of the film. Frank, unscrewed the toilet and escaped out of theplane. My first question is can that actually been done? Not that Iwould ever try it LOL. My second question is wouldn't Frank havegotten soaked from the toilet water. Yes his shirt definitely looked dirty, but it really did not look wet. Plus his hair looked dry too Another question is wouldn't the bathroom floor be soaked as well. Finally why would Frank leave the screws as evidence. That essentially made Carl aware of what Frank did.",Null,0,2,14 November 2004
