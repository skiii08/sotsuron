The Avengers," The Hulk stole the show!! Excellent film!
","When I saw previews and commercials for this movie, I got really excited. I was a big fan of the old 70's Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk show. I loved Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and the 2008 Hulk, so I knew Hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw Avengers. Tony Stark was just flat out hilarious. 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was not the greatest Marvel movie. I still liked Cap. America, but I just thought it was too in the 40's (kind of boring). I loved the Thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene (like the Avengers). The Avengers tops every Marvel movie I've ever seen and I can't wait for the September 25th Blu-ray/DVD release! I LOVE THE AVENGERS!! It might be hard for The Dark Knight Rises to top this film.",9,17,33,9 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace
","Before I get into detail, I just want to say that this is one of my least favorite movies ever made. Alright, so this movie takes place before A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi - a few of the greatest movies EVER made. You would think that this movie would be good, or even remotely interesting, but it's not at all.The Phantom Menace is about when Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor go to Tatooine and meet young Anakin Skywalker. Just when you thought the movie couldn't get more annoying (with Jar Jar Binks), you meet young Anakin Skywalker, the kid who makes C-3PO just to make the movie relevant to A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. It's just very hard to believe that that kid becomes Darth Vader and scores Natalie Portman.Completely uninteresting, weak plot, dull acting.But Darth Maul was pretty cool, though.",3,2,5,28 November 2013
The Hangover," 7,9/10?? Should be getting higher scores!!
","So this is my review of the Hangover. My older brothers and I had been wanting to see this movie ever seen it came out in 2009 (two years ago). But my oldest (17 year old) brother, still hadn't seen this, went with a friend to see Hangover Part 2. He liked it a whole lot and kept talking about it, so, about a month later, it was very rainy outside, so we did nothing but watch the t.v. We were going through the guide and the first Hangover was going to come on in about an hour on CineMax. My brothers and I still had not seen it. We were so excited. The movie wouldn't be half as good without Alan, Chow, or Mike Tyson. (The nerdy hillbilly) Stu was a little funny but Alan is hilarious. I think Phil is just cool. But I am not allowed to see Hangover Part 2 until it comes on DVD. But I asked my brother which Hangover was better. He says they're about the same. The IMDb rating is 7.9/10. I have read a lot the user reviews and it looks like the rating should be 6.6. The Hangover Part 2 has a present rating of 6.9. But that could change because it is still in theaters and there are stills more reviews to come. Because of the user reviews (so far) looks like it should be 5.9/10. Well, thats my opinion of the Award-Winning 'Hangover'.",10,1,3,20 June 2011
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3: wasting Ben Kingsley's talent (SPOILERS)
","Alright so I've been anticipating this since last year's Avengers, and I was just a tad bit disappointed with this sequel. So, I said in the title there will be spoilers in this review. The ONLY problem that I had with Iron Man 3 was the Mandarin. In all of the trailers and previews, Marvel made it seem as though the Mandarin was a dangerous and extremely evil man. BUT, it turns out that the Mandarin is not real. We come to find out that Aldrich Kilian (Guy Pearce) just needed a cover-up, making it look like Ben Kingsley was the bad guy. But Guy Pearce was the bad guy all along. This is what disappointed me so much. It was basically as though all of the trailers were a lie.But on with the good stuff! The special effects in this movie were incredible! Almost 10 minutes into the movie, Tony Stark was suiting up into his brand new Iron Man suit. And also, this movie had the theater (which was sold out of tickets) laughing almost the whole time, mainly the Mandarin 'revealed' scene. That just shows how unexpected and silly it was. Yeah, the funniest scene was a Mandarin scene.If you never read any of the comic books or wasn't very much anticipating this movie (as I was), then you'll most likely have a really fun time. I loved the movie. Just that one little part kind of ruined the movie for comic book fans and me. I recommend this movie to a Marvel fan, or superhero fan, or someone looking for a fun movie on a Friday or Saturday night.",7,4,9,4 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Star Wars: Return of the Jedi
","I loved the movie because it is full of great fun and entertainment. The scene close to the end with Luke Skywalker vs. Darth Vader is so intense and so entertaining. The original trilogy is much better than the prequel trilogy, by far. The effects are so realistic. It's hard to believe that this movie was made about 30 years ago. James Earl Jones was the perfect voice for the legendary bad guy, Darth Vader. He just fits the voice so perfectly. George Lucas is a genius. His films changed the world. But sadly this was the end of the trilogy. But don't get me started on Episode I or Episode II. Episode III is great, though, especially the end when young Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. Return of the Jedi is by far the darkest of the trilogy, but not really the best. It is still a great movie, though.",8,0,1,6 November 2012
Interstellar," Best Movie of 2014
","Interstellar is about a man and a group of people from NASA that go into space to find a new place for the people of Earth to live because Earth is dying. The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, and Casey Affleck. The score is composed by Hans Zimmer. Interstellar is directed by Christopher Nolan.Now, first off, I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. He is my favorite director of all time. This was my most anticipated film of the year. Some of my favorite movies ever are The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and now Interstellar. I'm also a big fan of Hans Zimmer (the composer).So how was the movie: absolutely fantastic! The acting, the directing, the visuals, the score, the plot, and the script are all amazing. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his best performances. Anne Hathaway has never been better. Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely brilliant. Christopher Nolan has created one of his best movies to date.I only have but one minor problem with the movie: it takes a while to get things moving. And I will say that I didn't understand everything about the movie after I first saw it. The more that I see the movie, the more that I understand it. If you're a Nolan fan, like me, or if you're just a fan of good movies, then this movie is definitely worth checking out. I hope that it at least gets nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year at the Oscars. Don't let me down, Academy.",10,1,4,3 January 2015
Watchmen," One of my favorite movies of all time!
","I'll be honest, when I saw the commercials for this movie, I thought that it looked kind of dumb. I had no interest in seeing it in theaters. Keep in mind, I am a huge comic book/superhero movie fanboy. A few years ago, when it was released theatrically, it got mostly positive reviews, but I still had my doubts, so I waited for the DVD to watch it. When it came out, I rented it from Netflix. I put it in the DVD player and was absolutely blown away! From the first scene to the last scene of the movie, I couldn't take my eyes off of the TV screen! The plot was so dark and gritty. The visuals (especially Dr. Manhattan) were absolutely magnificent! The characters are extremely interesting. My favorite is Rorschach! The action sequences had me on the edge of my seat. I also love that there is a ton of dark humor in the movie. I like how they made the movie to be rated R, and that they weren't afraid to show blood and nudity. Overall, Watchmen is a breathtaking experience that I would highly recommend to superhero movie lovers, like me. A+",10,4,6,25 May 2011
Man of Steel," Man of Steel
","Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, and Michael Shannon. Directing the movie is Zack Snyder, who is known for directing Watchmen, 300, and Sucker Punch. Producing the movie is the director of Insomnia, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises.With the perfect cast, plus, the director of Watchmen, plus, the director of the Dark Knight trilogy, this movie has got to be good. And sure enough, it did not disappoint. In fact, it is the best movie of the year, so far. Hans Zimmer, who composed the music for the Dark Knight trilogy, and the Lion King composed the music for this movie as well, which made me pretty confident that the music would be pretty good. And it was.This movie was getting chewed on by the critics, which made me lose just a little bit confidence for this movie. But the 7.8 rating on IMDb brought all of that confidence back. I read the critic reviews and they hated the movie, which doesn't make a lot sense because they loved Superman Returns, which is an awful movie.But on with the review. The movie starts off on the planet Krypton, and Krypton is basically falling apart. So Kal-El aka Superman is launched from Krypton to Earth. The rocket that launched Kal-El drops into Earth. The rocket lands and Diane Lane and Kevin Costner find Kal-El inside (as a baby). They raise him as though he is just a normal human.Russell Crowe was Kal-El's biological father. Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon were enemies, so Michael Shannon goes to Earth to try to find Kal-El. Kal-El finds out who he is and where he came from, and in the process, becomes Superman (Henry Cavill). Michael Shannon comes to Earth and demands Kal-El/Superman to surrender, but Superman has other plans.Man of Steel is the perfect summer movie. I would recommend it to Superman/superhero fans, or just anybody looking for a good movie to see this summer. If you have children, you can bring them along, too. Henry Cavill gives a great performance as Superman. I was pleased that this movie wasn't all slow motion, just like every other Zack Snyder movie. Everybody looking for a good movie should definitely go see this!",9,2,9,3 July 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A good Harry Potter movie
","First off, I was never a big Harry Potter fan. My brother loved the books. as a kid. I saw previews for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and it looked awesome! I wasn't too thrilled about having to watch the Harry Potter movies first. I got to this one. I sat through 2 1/2 hours. I saw credits pop up and I thought, 'NO!'. I wanted to see more!! It just made me wonder, 'Where are they going to go now?!'. But then I remembered that it wasn't the end. I had to give it a 10/10. I didn't expect much of the movie. It is kind of like the movie Inception. It keeps you wondering. Every I watch it, my brain keeps on spinning with questions. The movie was completely amazing! I am SO going to see Deathly Hallows Part 2. The questions that run through my head are something like: are they just going to stay there? What is Voldemort going to do with his new wand? It is a must-see! The rating should really be WAY higher than 7.7/10. Amazing!!",10,0,2,15 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing indeed!!
","I saw this on the first day (July 3rd) and was really surprised. I thought it would be hard to top the other first three Spider-Man films. I also thought Spiderman's new look was better. Andrew Garfield was actually really good. I didn't expect his performance to be that good. The movie was also very funny at some points. It was a little more realistic than the others because he didn't actually have web shooting from his arms. He had little devices that he strapped to his arms that shot web. The Lizard looked very realistic. I read that the actor for Dr. Curt Conners/Lizard had to wear a piece of cardboard over his face. I don't how they made it so real, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray release! AWESOME FILM",7,6,13,9 July 2012
Saw III," It was really good!
","First of all, I don't know why people find this disgusting. It's called SAW 3! Everybody knows each sequel gets bloodier and bloodier! What do they expect?! The only problem this film is that the 'nudity' wasn't needed. I still have not seen Saw 4, but I intend to watch Saw 4,5,6, and 7. This movie is indeed very gory and gruesome, but it was still worth watching! Very worth it! The 'rated R' version may be less gorier because I got Unrated Version. But I do highly recommend this Saw movie to every hard horror fan (like me). I got the cleanest version that I could find on 'NetFlix'. They did not have the rated version. The had the regular Uncut version and the Unrated Directors Cut version. Be warned, there is a disgusting scene involving pig carcasses. The ending is very bloody! But if are looking for a good Friday Night Fright, this would be a great movie to rent. I very highly recommend this film. Look for Saw III. Enjoy!!",8,1,4,23 August 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: or There And Back Again by Bilbo Baggins 10/10
","The Hobbit is very different from the LOTR (Lord of the Rings) trilogy. This is filled with humor that has the whole crowd laughing, where Lord of the Rings trilogy is more serious. Ian McKellan, Martin Freeman, and Andy Serkis star in this unexpected journey, where an ordinary hobbit of Bag End in the Shire is chosen as the 14th member of the dwarf family, so that they can go get their home back from the evil dragon, Smaug.Personally, my favorite scene of The Hobbit was when Bilbo Baggins has an encounter with the creature, who once was a hobbit, Gollum. 'We lost it! My precious, we lost it,' Gollum says when he figures out that his ring (precious) is gone. This is a very fun scene because Gollum is so clumsy and very silly, as he is in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.It's very hard to believe that the same actor that plays Gollum also portrays Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Kong in Peter Jackson's King Kong.If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings, you should see The Hobbit!",10,7,16,9 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," The best Marvel movie! Better than The Avengers!
","It simply does not get better than this! Believe the critics! It really is the Star Wars of this generation! Once the movie begins, you instantly get attached to these characters (Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket). My favorite is Groot. This summer has been Marvel's high point. First, there was Cap 2. Second, there was Spidey 2. Third, there was X-Men. Fourth is Guardians. I went into this movie without high hopes. I certainly didn't expect to say it was my favorite Marvel movie. But, anyway. The character development is great in this movie. The characters are all very interesting. The villain, Ronan the Accuser, is probably the weakest link of the movie. He's really creepy and strange. I enjoyed his character, but he still wasn't that great. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely worth your time, whether or not if your a superhero movie buff. I don't think I've ever wanted a sequel for a movie so bad in my whole life!P.S. This movie has one of the happiest endings to a movie that I've ever seen. Also, stay after the credits!",10,1,4,23 August 2014
Saw II," Way better than Saw 1!
","First off, I really liked Saw 1! I looked and looked it at WalMart. I picked up Saw 2 (which I still hadn't seen) thinking it was Saw 1. After I purchased it I looked at the DVD case and I looked very close and it said Saw '2'. I thought that since I loved the first, I could try to watch it. But, actually, it was a lot better than Saw 1!! But it was HARD to find. I digged and digged down in the $5 bin. I finally said 'to the heck with it', and looked for any 'Saw' movie. Even though I only seen the first Saw, I kept wanting to get Saw 6, because it 'includes Saw 1. But, I highly recommend this one. So far, I have only seen (the great) Saw 1 and 2. I am headed towards Saw 3's way. I am only 11 years old and I can actually very easily handle this gory stuff. I am very, very excited to see Saw 3! The main thing that scared the crap out of me was the Jigsaw 'puppet' and its creep bone- chilling laugh. If you are looking Friday or Saturday night FUN movie, rent Saw 1 & 2. It's so extraordinary!! A man who is not killing people but testing them to see 'how much blood they will shed to stay alive'. All I'm saying is see Saw. If you don't like then maybe you shouldn't get #2. Great movie!! Go Jigsaw!! Just remember, legends never die.",10,0,1,12 August 2011
The Hangover Part II," Excellent film!
","The wolf-pack is back! Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Justin Bartha, Jamie Chung, and Mike Tyson star in The Hangover Part II, the comedy of 2011. I thought the movie was great, better than the first. Just don't let your kids see the movie because there is A LOT of strong sexual content and graphic nudity, and also coarse language. There is a scene in which a main character finds out that he 'spent the night' with a transgender person (we see this HAPPEN in photos in the end of the film, yuck). The hilarious character, Mr. Chow has the sailor mouth in this movie. He curses and swears a lot so watch out for that, too. There is also a lot of references to cocaine and a man also snorts it and passes out. There is even some images of a man cutting his finger off (bloody). Just see it for yourself.",10,3,6,13 June 2012
Saw," An okay late night horror.
","I had wanted to see Saw for about four or five years! I then heard that my cousin had purchased the Saw DVD collection. Right away, I asked her if I could just borrow Saw 1. So, one night, she comes and spends the night at my house. She brings it with her. But first off, I thought Saw 2 was better. This movie is extraordinarily, gruesomely amazing! But it had its boring parts. Saw 2 was better, but I still haven't Saw 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. This movie was extreme! I mean that in a bloody, gory way!! People with weak stomachs probably won't be able to handle this movie ( like my big brother). The boring weren't SO boring. There were like sleepy stories. It did sort of make me tired, but the ending woke me up. But this is so far the most suspenseful Saw that I've seen. But what kept me interested was that is was so intense! Especially the ending!! I recommend this movie to any people who like scary movies! If you want to be REALLY SCARED, you should watch Devil. Don't watch Devil! It's too scary!! Anyway, I do highly recommend this and Saw 2 to any horror fan! Go Jigsaw!!",9,0,1,13 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back
","By far, the best of the Star Wars saga! The film surpassed Star Wars fans' expectations in 1980. It surpassed my expectations, too. The classic scene that includes Luke Skywalker battling Darth Vader. But he is clearly no match for Vader. Vader forces Luke to believe that he is his father, 'No, I am your father. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy together as father and son!' James Earl Jones fits the voice of Darth Vader very well. Mark Hamill fits the role of Skywalker very well, also. The Empire Strikes Back has a lot more Darth Vader scenes than Star Wars did. It featured a lot more action including more light-saber fights.",9,0,0,6 November 2012
