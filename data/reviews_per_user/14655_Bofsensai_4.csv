The Lobster," Emperor's new crustacean!
","Ohh, did I wrestle with what to put in -if anything - a review on this  is it, brilliant allegory on modern world - by inference, online in particular - impersonal, strained, distant relationships  or utter 'fanciful rot' dressed up (pun intended) as a sort of emperor's new clothes style iconoclastic cinema?After a lot of thought plus, anyway, loving absurdism, and R. Weisz in almost anything  still, I'm gonna go with the latter = pure unadulterated twaddle.How so? Well, its deadpan, supposedly absurdist, humour occasionally got me to laugh out loud e.g. 'It's no coincidence - (a target) - is shaped like a loner' !, almost to the consternation of the sparsely filled cinema I was in, but which then also occasionally, latterly brought out hesitant sympathetic titters along with me. Coz yes; I love non-sequitur unexpected throwaway lines á la Ionesco and Beckett .. but in travailing through this to the 'er, what was that'?! end, enjoying the 'performances' (quite a few by minor superb dry humour Brit actors, too), and surprisingly, Farell's against type emotionless character, I got the distinct feeling that this was foisted on its audience (and actors for that matter) to test how far an 'out there / wacky / foreign (read different perspective)' director can get away with out and out utter tosh.And even despite the shades of almost sorta 'O Lucky Man' shock scenes only hinted at off-screen, the (presumably that allegorical?) actual 'results' of animal 'transformation' (from live to dead) shown were disconcerting enough, and y'know, even though I scanned the credits intently in my viewing, I don't recall spotting the standard 'no animals were harmed in the making of' disclaimer appearing, so that for Farell's, er, 'brother' (apparently!) that surely just had to be the case (well, I trust - but who knows with this, ah, 'mess')?! So, really: this is the sort of effort that those (cinephile dilettantes?!) who think they want to both, know, and prove it to you they know, better (the clever underlying allegories et al), but actually are only hiding they would be terrified to be called out on, like Hans C. Anderson's little innocent, but tell it like it is honest, boy, that this, really, is pure unadulterated b*ll*x!Or is it ? For, still- it remains an almost MUST SEE to form your own take on it! (by which, I really can't rate this, 2 stars max - or all up to full ten for daft outrageousness!)",Null,0,3,30 September 2016
Hereditary," True 'creepy', but really - just doesn't quite add up!
","I'll try not to plot spoil, rather than just observing, that in the end, much of this just doesn't add up as either remotely plausible to your necessary entrance with 'suspension of disbelief': there are just so many why is that, why should that occur? Indeed, if you go along with the premise, why the blinking heck would a nether world demon have to go through such a convoluted, improbable, palaver to get to ... up a ladder into a tree-house of all places?!
With so few followers that they ALL comfortably fit into ..
With all such, ah, beyond, demonic and the likes 'powers'?!
Come on!
And why 'Peter'? What was so demonically alluring about him ...?
Oh, yeah: it's in the title - innit.And as for some of the key conceits that also just don't add up / would / could not occur like that ... (where was (Grand) 'Mum' put? Oh, yeah, didn't know that until ...!)To the point that, yes, despite Toni Collete does indeed emote across her bewilderment terror pretty well .. but as to her latter 'upper' peripatetics .. why? To what reason to, well, have to ..
Well, I could go on to the point that a story fairly well set up just seems like lazily tossed away in the end:
pity, because the opening shot(s) are intriguing - but even then, I was expecting some form of relevancy to this aspect of the home 'like' disturbed theme .. but in the end, well, it even finishes outside in a .. ah, I've mentioned that!Why it's rated so highly creepy is beyond me - perhaps I have just far too many far superior efforts in my head ...(still try and beat 'Excorcist'!)Although, true, creepy and effective in the set up, but ultimately, utter con on its audience.",4,2,3,8 May 2019
The Intouchables," Uplifting 'based on true story', until you realise they d(r)issed* the real hero!
","* i.e. as in black hero's name in the movie. I came to this unusually for me, through the trailer, coz it seemed to be such potentially feel- good 'based on a true story' inspiration: and perhaps it was: but for me the ultimate betrayal was to see in the final credit sequence the two it was truly based on, the one who the real hero was  (da, da, da credits plot spoiler alert) NOT BLACK!! He was white and of mid Europe descent: Apparently, the directors just preferred the black actor; nothing to argue with there (if he's good - and he is) but, beware, that particularly relevant factor then, is NOT BASED ON THE TRUTH. The original inspiration has been marginalised/ 'white'washed outta da movie public's knowledge/appreciation/enjoyment.Then - as several have here also well noted - the (French?!) attitude portrayed towards women is positively neanderthal! Did they mean that? Or is that automatic to French storytelling? Even to excuse one women's (sensible) brush off of the black helper's unsophisticated bathroom overtures, in the end they make it all alright she declined him, by inferring the only reason she would turn him down is coz .. (da, da, daa) she's lesbian! NOT because she thought he was immature arrogant chauvinist As in spreading the fact that it was 'based on truth', then certainly as uplifting as the Omar Sy character is shown doing for his paraplegic saviour (he's saved from a downtrodden marginalised poor life by his 'service'): otherwise, 'based on' bordering a travesty of the truth.",5,5,12,31 December 2016
Pawn Sacrifice," 'Based on' what? Meandering travesty?
","What's the purpose to invest your (life's)time to watch any film?Cinematic / artistic depiction; tell a story; human endeavour in portrayal acting chops? If so, this film fails on two out of three and on that third (the last), even then is from an incredibly miscast T. Maguire - which affirming what other reviewers here have noted, in that not only his stature (in real life he towered over Spassky) but that when you see archival footage of the real Bobby, it's absolute obvious it should have been Nic Cage as a shoo-in to play the temperamental genius, even more so when you know of Cage's maniacal over-acting style of late which would have been ideal to represent the paranoid troubled Fischer.What about the other two failures then? Cinematically dull, jump shots and ponderously unwinding to what should have been the nail biting '72 Reykjavik held chess championship finale mind games only really briefly hinted at with (just) one shot of Maguire looking as though trying to put the hex on Spassky, which is exactly how many contemporary observers thought contributed to his crushing victory over him; even the famous Icelandic location, in which Fisher (supposedly) disappeared into for the odd no-show second game, little is made cinematically of its legendary landscape - one wandering along road scene when TM / BF is then met by a car  and that's it .. which leads onto story: as any film fan knows a 'based on a true story', ostensibly a bio-pic, is supposed to be marginally more reliable than 'inspired by', but as other reviewers here point out, (most notably 'Susie Bogus') this is almost a travesty of what really was likely: so much that, to me, the scriptwriters were either arrogant, or simply couldn't care less, about much fact at all, and yet of which there is plenty of archival material to reference: by which, I would advise you ignore this – for other than that last 'reel' / 20+ minutes when it finally does begin to excitingly represent the sort of real world politik shenanigans that seemed to accompany the erstwhile niche game of chess at that time, still it ends on only the fourth game – not, arguably, the real clincher 21st 'overnighter' where surely there was just as much drama as Spassky realised his position was so hopeless he was to finally concede the championship to his opponent, the lone hero (even Kissinger called him to patriotically carry on for American superiority against state machine drilled Soviets !) BF, which the film purports to represent: since, well, after that (only 4th) match, the story build up just closes up (did they run out of funds? Lose interest?), so that all the real mystery and intrigue on how Fischer's subsequent life developed is merely summed up in lame end credit captions.Interested in BF? Then instead I would recommend the far more revealing/informative 'Bobby Fischer Against the World' of Liz Garbus' documentary effort from the always reliable HBO imprimatur. Most disappointing travesty of efforts.",3,2,5,23 July 2016
