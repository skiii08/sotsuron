Blade Runner 2049," A Long and Dull Sequel That Nobody Needs
","I saw the original BR in a theater when it was released. This was the beginning of bleakness in science fiction movies and back then it was new and exciting.Fast-forward thirty some years later and nothing about it seems new and exciting at all. This sequel feels like it came from the marketing department where if a little of something made money then certainly, let's add more and try to make even more money.Long, drawn-out scenes (like the robot love-making), meandering sequences which mean nothing (the senseless killing of the new born replicant), redundant plot turns (the orphanage - I mean, how are all these kids feed?), not to mention huge gaps in logic (how does Deckard manage to live in a Vegas high-rise complete with electricity and one would assume, water?)We knew something was up with the matching girl-boy DNA so when that plot twist came it wasn't really much of a shock. In fact, nothing was really that exciting, perhaps because the dull pacing, 'music' and acting lulled me into a near comatose state way before I could even begin to care about who mighty be the actual child of the replicants. Let's hope this is the end of this franchise. Hopefully I will be dead before we see the next sequel 35 years from today.",5,6,13,18 October 2017
