10 Cloverfield Lane," Don't do it! Watch paint dry instead
","Actually created an IMDb account just to write this review. I have never written a review before but feel like I have lost 2 hours that I can't get back and need to warn others!I quickly skimmed this site before watching and saw that as Bradley Cooper was in it it may be OK at least and as it didn't mention anything about being related to the alien Cloverfield which I would never choose to watch anyway.The film wasn't that bad at first..There was some sort of murder/ missing girl plot which soon fizzled out, I like thrillers so could cope with the slow pace. Once she got out the bunker I realised I had made the mistake and watched a sci fi film instead of a thriller/ mystery. If you don't feel like wasting 2 hours of your life and watching an alien film.. Do not choose this film!!",1,5,12,20 May 2016
