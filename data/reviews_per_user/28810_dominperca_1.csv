Black Swan," Not what I expected
","This movie is trying to focus thing that happened in our real world but but the screenplay sometimes does not match with this objective. Some other things of the dancer life could be included to release audience from tension. One of the messages to get from the movie is that we have to listen the advices from our trainers or parents to improve some aspects of our life. Working hard we can get anything we want to reach but being careful to not follow the same strategy that other colleagues use to be successful.At the end I get confused if Nina has problems in her mind or not.Anyway, is the type of non common movie. Sometimes you don't what really happened due to Nina imagines things and then you see events. In my humble opinion, this movie is acceptable almost reaching good.",7,0,1,29 January 2011
