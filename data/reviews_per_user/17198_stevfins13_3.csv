Raiders of the Lost Ark," the greatest movie of all time
","this is by far the greatest movie of all time.  never before, or after has there been a movie that both parent and child can go to see the same thing and enjoy it equally as much.  i remember my dad bringing this movie home when i was seven and making me watch it, it was the greatist thing i have ever seen.  i will never forget how frightend i was at the end of the movie, or the snake pit, or the rock following Indy, or when he shot the sword fighter.  It's just a classic",10,0,0,16 October 2002
Happy Gilmore," the proce is wrong b*tch
",not a great movie but the bob barker fight was one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen.  i have to say that i am a sandler fan so i probably am biased but i think that he actually is a decent actor and it does show even in a movie like this,7,1,1,16 October 2002
Van Helsing," how bad can one movie be
","the answer is...this bad.  i have never seen a more disappointing movie in my entire life.  I have seen worse movie (a few at least, but now many) but those movies i was either dragged to or had absolutely no expectations for. this was a movie that i really wanted to see.  ooops my bad.  by the end of the movie, the four people i saw it with and i were laughing at how stupid it was and how stupid the writer of the movie thought we were.  they had to spell out every single thing in this movie (the end especially) like everyone in the theater was a bleeping moron.  the acting (other than van helsings little monk helper) was ridiculously bad.  the story was so stupid (i know its not supposed to be realistic, but come on) that there was no suspense at all because who really cared.  and there was no way that any of these characters could have been humans because of what they had them doing. this movie was just flat out bad...and its going to make over 200 million dollards probably, im just embarrassed that eight of those dollars will be mine (16 if you count the fact that i paid for my girlfriend to see it, im just glad she is still talking to me, because after all, this was my pick). this movie was a joke",1,15,30,9 May 2004
