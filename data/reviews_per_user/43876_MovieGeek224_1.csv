Requiem for a Dream," WOW!
","I watched this yesterday and I all I have to say is WOW. What an amazing movie! I can do nothing but rave about this movie. The performances (especially Ellen Burstyn) were all top notch, and who knew Marlon Wayans could act? He was really good as Tyrone. For those of you out there who have seen Aronofsky's first film Pi, you will notice a lot of cameos and small roles for actors from it, Sean Gullette as Harold sticks out in my mind. I liked his character in Pi, but here he was just repulsive and the scenes with him showed what lengths Jennifer Connelly's character (Marion) would go to for cash/drugs. The fact that Darren Aronofsky's superb directing wasn't nominated for an Oscar really surprises me. His directing and film were even grittier than Traffic (while Traffic is also an amazing movie, Requiem got deeper into the downfall of addiction) and he deserved at least a nomination (if not a win). The Hip-Hop Montages, Snorricam and the drug use scenes were amazing. This film shows the horror of addiction to anything. After I watched this movie, it stuck with me. The ending will get you, no matter what.",10,0,0,27 August 2001
