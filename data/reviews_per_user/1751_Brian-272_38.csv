The Devil's Advocate," Devilish Entertainment. 10 Stars Plus!
","The Devil's Advocate is by far one of the better films of the 90's. When I first saw it almost three years ago at the theater, I said movies and film making have come a long way, when a film such as this is wily outrageous. Al Pacino has a field day playing Lucifer disguised as the head of a New York law firm. Pacino's characther of John Milton has a member of his law firm recruit hotshot Florida defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) to New York City to practice law for his firm, but soon does Lomax and his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) learn not only are there cases to be won, but souls to be lost. Pacino gives in my opinion the best performance of his career, the name Milton is always associated with Satan hint: Milton's Paradise Lost. The Devil's Advocate gives us a message that some of us are simply chosen for certain roles in life. Giving into free-will can be a pain, but it is a must, because a person cannot always uphold the wrong side for argument's sake. Every one must watch this film over and over to get a more clear and better understanding. I tend to have different thoughts and questions each time I view the film.",10,2,2,21 April 2000
The Blair Witch Project," The worst horror movie that exist. Don't waste your time.
",Just a little over a year ago I rented The Blair Witch Project and after forty minutes I was ready to fall asleep. Don't waste your money or time with this boring piece of crap. It's simple three lost film students become the prey (note supposedly prey) of an unknown entity while researching a local legend (a supposed witch) in the Maryland woods. Tell me what is the scare? Anyone who has watched this movie knows that the hype builds up to nothing. Maryland college students with raging hormones who make a film for a class research project simply disappear out of the night. Not once does this movie show a scary scene of a supposed monster(legend-witch) these students just vanish one by one like it's a planned vacation using The Blair Witch legend as a scheme. To finish this criticism off of The Blair Witch horror movies should contain gore and murder to scare this one falls way short. Anyway if the people in Hollywood want to make a film about a legend please give a try at the Bigfoot/Sasquatch legend now that's a legend to get your blood pumping. Avoid The Blair Witch Project it's a waste to not only film but to everyone.,1,2,4,28 October 2000
Scarface," Tony Montana wanted and conquered the American Dream but with a vengeance.
","Scarface is another one of those classic movies we all have come to enjoy. When I first saw Scarface with my uncle and aunt about a year and a half ago I enjoyed it but still it was a disappointment. Scarface is good but still you find many other organized crime movies that are better. I must hand praise to Brian De Palma who did a terrific job with this work, plus this ranks as one of the better performances from Al Pacino. Pacino is nearly great as Cuban refugee Tony Montana who emigrates to Miami, Florida to make a fortune in the underworld of organized crime as he goes to the top of his game with a vengeance. I must say this about Scarface if you enjoy much cursing and the blood and guts violence then this is a film for you. I remember the chain saw scene in the motel now that was gore! Yet this is organized crime in Miami, Florida during the 80's so the film was certainly correct with it's demonstration of violence. The performance by Steven Bauer is also worth a notice. Scarface is a great film that shows how success of the underworld goes, this is one of the better films associated with Al Pacino a great film to rent and watch if you haven't.",6,0,2,3 June 2001
Erin Brockovich," Great movie! Excellent and well done work. Great to see how a true story character like Erin Brockovich can be made famous by the beautiful Julia Roberts.
","Julia Roberts can I say Julia Roberts again now talk about a performance to remember and Julia I'm sure glad you won a best actress Oscar for this work. Roberts is tremendous and sexy as ever as Erin Brockovich a research assistant who sees how a large company has kept hidden toxic secrets that caused a community increase of cancer and sickness. Julia Roberts is as sexy as ever with this role now the real Erin Brockovich is missing something any guess? Try Julia Roberts with the bust. I always wondered did Julia Roberts wear colored bras, and yes she does in nearly every scene of Brockovich you see many of the bra straps are exposed from the sleazy and short clothing she wears. I remember red, blue, black, black mixed with other colors, now how sexy. You find more out of this film than just the sexy Julia Roberts it gives a strong message to fight for what you believe in and never give up hope or spirit always fight against the odds and win.",10,1,2,9 June 2001
As Good as It Gets," Good movie with great performances from Hunt and Nicholson. Proving most of all a relationship of friendship is the most important thing even if no romance is present.
","James L. Brooks has done it again he took a story and made it great with interesting characters. The performances of Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt turned just great the chemistry between the two was the best ever, both Oscar winners that were well deserved. I have to hand it to Jack time after time he proves he can take on characters with the most complex and odd behaviors just plain out crazy people. Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as writer Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive with one of Manhattan's meanest tempers. Melvin is to be helped along after his gay neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear) is hospitalized and more unexpected kindness-comes along with waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who helps put Melvin back in the human race. This film as you see in the end and really the whole time that a male and female relationship can be based on friendship and not sex and romance. It is the things we do for others that helps and makes our world seem better. Remember a friendship is important no matter what the age of a person or who they are. This is much the way the relationship of the characters of Jack and Helen can be described. Jack Nicholson also continues to get better with age his performance in this movie is a knockout! As Good As It Gets is a classic movie to watch just to feel important and see the great Jack at work.",8,1,2,28 May 2001
Rocky V," Not the best of the Rocky series but not the worst. Stallone go for it make a Rocky 6 so you can have a better ending to this series than this.
","Broke and brain damaged Rocky finds himself forced into retirement in this fifth installment only to have a triumph of heart this time not in the ring. Rocky feels in ways born again when he takes a young heavyweight prospect under his wing who no one cares about when the training of Tommy Gunn begins it is victory after victory but Rocky sees that you can't teach a young lion heart no matter how much muscle Rocky learns of the young and bitterness path that Tommy Gunn takes. Only to lead this Rocky film up to a great fight scene that being the streets something that Rocky knows a little bit about. Boy does Tommy get a piece of Rocky as the hero once again stands at the end. Rocky V is not the best of the series but not the worst because it has the action the emotions and drama that is so common to Rocky. And Burt Young and Talia Shire once again give great support to Stallone to make this good like the previous Rocky movies. It is just hard seeing Rocky in a retirement state and I never liked Tommy Morrison I know he was a professional heavyweight but his real ring life turned out to show that he had a weak chin and his Rocky character had a weak heart much similar to his ring life and his acting abilities are not much the arrogant attitude just never went well Tommy, Rocky V should have cast another boxer or actor because Tommy Morrison sure is neither. Sage Stallone fit good in this movie it proves that a father and son relationship is rocky but love and hard knocks conquers all. Listen close to the words of the song The, Measure Of A Man by Elton John played during the closing credits of Rocky V it gives a true meaning to the Rocky series and also is related to every-day people like me and many others it's just a great song with true meaning. Rumors and news continue to fly around that Sylvester Stallone will return to make a Rocky 6 I have read many entertainment reports that say it will happen. Room is left for improvement and a new start two new ideas to throw at you either Rocky 6 has Stallone to start training his son Sage into the second coming of Rocky or Stallone has his Rocky character come out of retirement and win the heavyweight title like George Foreman did. No matter what happens Rocky Balboa is a American hero forever. The Rocky series is one of the greatest of all-time!",6,6,7,31 March 2001
Batman Returns," A Thrill Ride From Start To Finish! Almost As Good As The Original Batman, But Not Quite, But Still One Of 1992's Top Movies.
","Batman Returns is a explosively entertaining sequel that follows much the same pattern as the original Batman (1989). Tim Burton once again directs a dark moody film once again crafting expressionism and depicting Batman (Michael Keaton) as a dark but likable mysterious hero. The casting in Batman Returns is tremendous Danny DeVito fit the role of the Penguin perfect DeVito's physique was tailor made for the Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer was aggressively stunning as the Catwoman and she unlike Kim Basinger provided great on screen chemistry with Keaton, Pfeiffer (Catwoman) simply has more in common with Bruce Wayne (Batman) both are mysterious and have two sides of life (split personalities) Basinger (Vicki Vale) was to fragile for a romantic interest of Batman. The Batman-Catwoman love interest doesn't last because we know a hero and villain can't be lifetime lovers. The Penguin (Devito) is a grotesque human-creature who wants to destroy Gotham City due to his abandoned childhood and failed mayor attempt. The Penguin unlike The Joker (Nicholson) is more of a violent destructive villain searching for the past as Nicholson's Joker was a homicidal killing likable clown who plagued Gotham with his joking killer art methods. The Joker also known as Jack Napier had a past connection to Batman remember the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. Christopher Walken gives a good performance as the corrupt hated Max Shreck, but I felt that was immaterial because two villains were enough drama and excitement for Batman The Shreck character in my opinion takes away from the film. Batman Returns is second best in the Batman series trailing only the original all good performances from Keaton, DeVito, and Pfeiffer and good directing from Burton a great movie to watch many times.",9,0,0,25 June 2000
Home Alone," A holiday classic!
","This film is one of the all-time great holiday films, probably ranking a distant second behind A Christmas Story. I remember when ten years ago I saw Home Alone at the theater I said you have a instant classic. I guess my prediction was right, I know when I hear many people talk about a film for years that the popularity is overwhelming and also it must have sent a good message to people. Home Alone continues to get many airings just the other day I watched this classic on HBO. The ingredients for success in the form of the writing from John Hughes really made this film so enjoyable, and you know how good John Hughes delivers a sweet and likeable film. The story is crazy but also funny as Macaulay Culkin as a precarious 8-year-old who accidentally is left behind by his vacationing family, in the meantime Culkin must battle a twosome of goofy and inept burglars wonderfully depicted by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. I must say that Joe Pesci is a great actor not only is he seriously funny but he is just plain and simply the best at anything he does! Qualify Pesci as a very underrated actor. And Culkin enjoys the adventure of a lifetime filled with many laughs and giggles to crack you up! It just goes to show you many times an individual can have the most fun when left alone. No matter how many times you have seen Home Alone watch this classic every holiday season it's a film to enjoy for a lifetime.",8,1,1,26 December 2000
L.A. Confidential," Corruption, betrayal, and scandal. But a fight for purity and Kim Basinger giving the best performance of her career support claim to the best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90's decade.
","Based on a James Ellroy novel in Los Angeles during the 1950's L.A. Confidential delivers a knockout. Though the first time you watch L.A. Confidential you feel the intensity and high drama to find surprise after surprise in the complex and hidden plot. Then after many viewings and you already know how the story unfolds you still enjoy the great acting and admire James Ellroy for having such a fine script. So well written and directed you find yourself glued from start to finish you can't take your eyes off of it. Corruption runs amok in the L.A. police department only to be exposed by a eager young cop Ed Exley (Guy Pearce). Bud White (Russell Crowe) breaks away from the corruption to help Exley after he learns the third cop in the trio and sidekick Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is killed by the corrupt force. I must say Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors in Hollywood today I love watching any movie he plays in. The best supporting element of this entire film is Kim Basinger as Hollywood glamour call girl (Lynn Bracken). She did indeed deserve her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Kim gave a performance that just brightens up the film her beauty is touching. That's the best Kim has ever looked everything from her bold blond hair and body you just name it. L.A. Confidential gives a message to me that we should all search and try to experience some purity from time to time. With corruption as found in this film and many other places hope for more honesty and truth can be experienced more. I like the way Pearce, Basinger, and Crowe beat corruption. Now that's some purity. L.A. Confidential is a great movie due to the script, cast, and message it presents, the best of 1997.",8,1,1,8 December 2000
The Bodyguard," Average movie that produced a great soundtrack it's average due to the mediocre performances of Houston and Kevin Costner.
","This modern story of a knight in shining armor just didn't do it for me the acting and story is just to childish. And I must mention that Kevin Costner disappoints again folks this guy just doesn't impress me. Whitney Houston's hit songs on the soundtrack 'I Will Always Love You' and 'I Have Nothing' are great but I must say Whitney your acting is much to be desired. The, Bodyguard is a movie to watch but this film is more known for the music it helped make popular.",4,2,9,18 January 2001
Scary Movie 2," Very funny movie! Great use of slapstick this movie is just filled with the most parody that is mixed with sexy and odd moments.
","I have just recently saw many reviews which give Scary Movie 2 bad reviews, but I disagree after just seeing it in fact Scary Movie 2 is just as good as the original. The parody and slapstick is once again found just like in the original which was a parody extravaganza, only Scary Movie 2 is funnier with more sexy and odd moments. Scary Movie 2 does parody not only in the form of horror films, but action films are used as parody which makes great slapstick. Many say Scary Movie 2 went to far as many said the parody scenes are to gross, but I found this film very sexy even more than the first. Just to mention sexy how about Anna Faris she also stared in the first Scary Movie now keep an eye on this cute female in years to come people will see her in film after film. Kathleen Robertson gave a very sexy performance I was once again glad to see her getting some work I'm sure the sexy Kathleen will be seen again. Scary Movie 2 is a great funny movie to go out and see, people had better be glad to have films made like these because they are so much fun to watch!",7,0,1,7 July 2001
Rocky II," Rocky Balboa gets a rematch. The Crowning Of A New Champion! From Chump To Champ! The Second Time Proves To Be A Charm.
","Rocky II is a great follow-up to the original Rocky, the film starts by replaying the final moments of the original Rocky. Rocky II then builds up a new image of Balboa(Stallone) from his achieved success marriage comes to Adrian(Talia Shire) endorsements, commercials, money to buy a house and finally living the American Dream is obtained along with fatherhood. Despite the escape from poverty and the journey to the middle class reality sinks in. Balboa was born to be a fighter. Give me a break Rocky wasn't meant to be a Pennsylvania meatpacker! It is destiny that brings Balboa and any human back to what we were really meant for, as Balboa returns to boxing and wins the championship from Apollo Creed. Rocky II gave the message that all of us have a certain destiny to return to for success and the greatest happiness. This almost matches the original since the theme of destiny is restored in the original Rocky destiny was proven in Rocky II Stallone returned to his original destiny. That's why Rocky II nearly matches the original in quality and popularity. If enjoyment came from the original Rocky and speaking for myself and many others it surely did then Rocky II will bring great enjoyment also.",8,1,1,7 July 2000
Notting Hill," A Great Romantic Comedy. It Just Proves Lifetime Love Happens By Chance And When You Least Expect It.
","Notting Hill happens to be one of the surprise romantic hit comedies of 1999. When I first saw it last May I was impressed. Though many argue that Notting Hill has fairy tale written all over it they have a point based on the story of a Hollywood screen goddess(Julia Roberts) falling for an unassuming British bookstore owner(Hugh Grant) while in London to promote her latest film. Yet still Julia Roberts gives such a good performance that she makes this love story seem so real. Julia has really earned the reputation as Hollywood's leading lady. This movie gave me the message that love is based on chance and happens unexpectedly and when it happens it is generally between two opposites as in this films case fame and fortune(Julia Roberts) and the down to earth everyday average citizen(Hugh Grant). Remember the old adage opposites attract. Finally the soundtrack to this film is available on Island records and I must mention the songs (When You Say Nothing At All) by Ronan Keating as played throughout the movie and (No Matter What) by Boyzone as played at the ending during the credits, both are truly uplifting songs that will uplift anybody's spirit I highly suggest you purchase the soundtrack if you liked the movie. This film and the music on the soundtrack are both simply soul touching.",5,2,5,27 June 2000
The Shining," A masterpiece. A film of complex character discovery and probably the most known film of Jack Nicholson.
","Hard to believe it's been two decades since this horror classic first puzzled us. Though I didn't see The, Shining until probably 1988 on TV after countless viewings I still have many thoughts and questions about this film. If you know anything at all about Stanley Kubrick and his directing and producing of film you know that he always leaves the viewer to think and ask questions. I for one think that film should be that way, I know film is for entertainment purposes but viewers should think it not only helps them enjoy film but also educates them in the process. Kubrick has no pressure on him he always has a good concept and finds his work fun and his emotions help a film such as The, Shining. Stanley likes the mad with realism to make it interesting, and that is the entire concept of The, Shining. Think what you want about The, Shining many see it as the greatest terror ever. Really behind it all is a film of strong character discovery involving the issues of alcoholism and child abuse. Though I never read the Stephen King novel but I didn't want to because I know what a perfectionist that Kubrick is at doing film but both the film and story work good together. Jack Nicholson gave a monster and memorable performance as aspiring novelist Jack Torrance, who takes the job of caretaker of a seasonal hotel in the mountains of Colorado. Jack gave the most wild and out of control performance for an actor in film history. Jack was always the greatest and being unpredictable he really makes his work fun and puts every ounce of heart and soul into his acting. Jack Nicholson is by far my all-time favorite actor! Jack Nicholson was one actor who hit the mark on Hollywood for the century. The most memorable and quoted scene from the film is when Jack hacks his way through a door with his axe while his wife (Shelley Duvall) cowers on the other side. Jack cuts a hole big enough for his face to be seen and cries out: 'Heeeeeeeere's Johnny'. That line made Jack even more famous and brought a certain injection of light relief into a particularly terrifying moment when you think you're being brought down. Think back to the scene between Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd the conversation they have gives some meaning and insight to help you understand The, Shining a little better. Call it ESP or special powers but as Scatman says the ability to shine or they call it shining meaning the ability to know the future and know about bad things that happened in the past or even communicate with people without speaking by mind reading. I must say that Scatman Crothers gave one of the most beautiful supporting roles in film history he really helped The, Shining along. The only weak thing in The, Shining was the performance of Shelley Duvall it was like Kubrick and others had to pull her lines out of her she seemed overwhelmed with the part. The musical score throughout this film is absolutely great it has that chilling and tingling feeling to keep you in great drama. The setting of The Overlook Hotel and the winter snow made this film even more chilling. The big question is answered in the end though it will take you several viewings to understand and answer honestly, and that is has Jack Torrance ever been to The Overlook Hotel before? You find that the answer lies in a ghostly time warp of madness and murder. You name it a film of different meanings and a conflicting of past issues that are discovered and even (Danny Lloyd) Jack Torrance's son gives a fine performance. You have it all in this horror classic the best actor alive Jack Nicholson and one of the all-time great directors Stanley Kubrick make The, Shining a film that is very important to history for the way it makes a viewer search for hidden messages in a beautiful and lonely scenery.",9,0,0,31 December 2000
Rocky IV," A powerful classic. The most popular Rocky movie but ranks second in terms of quality behind the original Rocky. This fourth installment has a touch of Ronald Reagan.
","Since 1985 when I first watched Rocky IV in the theater then the many video viewings to watching it countless times on TV until finally buying a VHS copy five years ago with every watch this movie really uplifts me! I know that the boxing action and fight scenes in this Rocky are unrealistic it's like playing a video game with the sounds the punches make! People by now had come to love Rocky for the hearts and souls that his underdog performances touch and the lack of fight realism doesn't bother them. This installment is a very tragic and war like for Rocky when super boxer and fighting machine Russian Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) makes his arrival to the United States and first off he beats the life out of Rocky friend and former rival ex-champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) after Apollo's death we see the most determined Rocky ever as it's off to The Soviet Union to train! Rocky finds himself fighting for Apollo's spirit but also Old Glory! It's us against them. I must say the best done parts and uplifting parts of this movie are the training scenes which show the contrast between both Drago and Rocky it is displayed perfect in a brilliant montage that clashes the images together of Rocky's slogging through hip-deep snow while Drago has ultra-tech workouts. I know Drago has the best Soviet science and medicine and biomechanical makings of a champion but the blue-collar type training and determination of Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is the old-fashioned way we Americans not only love but want to do and be proud to be an American! The music played during this montage and also really throughout the entire film is so uplifting it forced me to buy The Rocky Story Soundtrack. The following songs 'No Easy Way Out', 'Hearts On Fire', and 'Burning Heart' really helped influence my life they all are great motivational songs for anything you do in life. When the bell rings, the war begins! Rocky proves a heart can beat a merciless machine. After the victory Rocky's message to the Soviet Union crowd is important he thanks the crowd and says most important of all if I can change you can change we all can change thanks and god bless! If you remember 1985 when this film was released you remember the tensions that our country and then President Ronald Reagan had to deal with. That is why I say this film had a touch of Ronald Reagan. Thankfully the tensions with Russia dissolved and Stallone got his wish even if it was years later. Once again great supporting performances were given by Talia Shire and Burt Young they always help Rocky deliver that powerful punch. Rocky IV continues to get numerous airings on cable channels TBS and TNT but I'm sure most have watched this numerous times this film just has that special feel present that not only makes you proud to be an American but also live life to your best with the most determination. Rocky IV is the second best in the series the 1976 original is the best due to it's sentimental start of a nobody who made a legend but Rocky IV gives you the action that the legend (Rocky) should give back to his fans. Great film one of the best ever!",7,0,0,1 January 2001
Die Hard 2," Another great action movie, plus a great performance from Bruce Willis make this Die Hard sequel a must see!
","Bruce Willis is back as Det. John McClane ready for more thrilling action and suspense. This time dealing with more terrorists and hostage situations. This sequel isn't as good as the original Die Hard but you will not be sorry if you love action movies, Bruce Willis does a great job once again. A must see!",6,0,2,21 May 2001
The Game," Mind Boggling! A Must See.
","The Game is the best thriller ever! I just want to mention that Michael Douglas has really hit the mark as an actor. Michael Douglas is one of Hollywood's best actors an all time great, his role in the Game his best ever performance puts him in a class of his own. The Game can best be described as a puzzler about a control freak billionaire (Michael Douglas) caught in a deadly swirl of cat and mouse when his younger disreputable brother (Sean Penn) gives him a gift certificate to participate in a mysterious game that invades his ordered existence. Douglas's role of Nicholas Van Orton has to win the deadly game or lose control of life. After Van Orton battles the mystery and ultimate terror challenge of 'The Game', surprise all just a birthday gift. The object of any game is fear and surprise. The Game is a must see due to Michael Douglas's no nonsense acting and the thrilling mystery that boggles your mind, only to harmlessly surprise in the end. A must see, Michael Douglas at his best.",10,0,2,16 April 2000
Ghostbusters," Who Ya Gonna Call! Ghostbusters.
","I just finished watching this film a couple of hours ago, and once again realized just how great this film is, one of the best of the 80's. Ghostbusters blends comedy and adventure nicely. The casting was brilliant especially the likes of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Sigourney Weaver the chemistry between their characters is what makes this film click. Just to mention a few negatives on this film the casting of Rick Moranis hurts because he simply doesn't connect with the other characters nice chemistry. Sigourney Weaver's bed scene of rising through the air and voice dialogue of a talking demon is Exorcist parody and a rip-off, please this wasn't intended for a film like Ghostbusters. This film also moves along to fast it seems to rush it's ending. Still one of the better comedy films of the 1980's. A must watch if you haven't already. I rate this film 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,1 June 2000
Back to the Future Part III," The last and worst of the Back to the Future trilogy.
",What was the time-travel charmer thinking? A trip to the old-west and 1885 please give me and all other movie fans a break. What a terrible way to end a great trilogy. Instead of ending Back to the Future with an 1885 era why not keep the drama unfolding in the modern 1985 era or the baby boom 1955 era it would have had more interest with an audience in 1990. Sure this film like the previous two from the trilogy has excitement and good performances I must once again admire the work of Michael J. Fox. Yet things just don't seem the same I personally felt the final focused to much on the life of Doc (Christopher Lloyd) as in the end he is happy that he finally found his mate for life and returns to the old-west of 1885 more happiness should have been directed at Marty as the film could have ended showing him happy with family and wife Jennifer in the future. Believe I happen to be right about part III it clearly does not get the same numerous showings that the first two Back to the Future movies do as I continue to see Back to the Future get numerous airings on TBS and Back to the Future II get numerous airings on the USA cable network or Sci-Fi network when part III is rarely shown it just goes to show which movies in the trilogy had the best quality and most popularity. Watch the first two Back to the Future movies anytime you will get the best entertainment of your life avoid the third and final it simply just lost it's luster and ran out of gas. Then again you might enjoy if you like the western genre of film but I doubt it.,2,6,23,26 October 2000
Major League," One of the best sports/comedy movies of all-time.
","Over the years many times I have watched Major League and each time I enjoy it. This film just seems better if you watch it during baseball season. The cast and plot of this movie is just great. You have a bunch of misfits and old-timers who come together and bring the Cleveland Indians out of many years of a slump, and finally contend for an American League Pennant. The movie has plenty of funny moments and mishaps that the characters do just to make you laugh while at the same moment you cheer for the team in each game of the season. Charlie Sheen is great he was perfectly cast as the pitcher. Plus the cast of Wesley Snipes, James Gammon, Dennis Haysbert, Corbin Bernsen, and Tom Berenger all worked very good together even Bob Uecker is a joy as the Indians very funny play-by-play announcer. Major League is just one of those movies when you watch it each time you enjoy it and you just love to cheer for the underdog. If you are a baseball fan and love a little comedy mixed with winning then Major League is a movie to watch many times.",8,46,52,26 May 2001
Total Recall," The best Sci-Fi movie of all-time. Schwarzenegger's best ever. Just goes to show you your past really can affect your present.
","I know that the plot of Total Recall is confusing especially for anyone who just watches it for the first time, or for anyone who watches Total Recall many times and understands the plot such as myself, still the film makes me have very different thoughts and feelings it entertains your mind. In 1990 I knew when I first saw this film in the theater what a blast it was! It showed just how advanced film had become and just what a genius Paul Verhoeven was. As Verhoeven showed with his other films like 'Robocop' he always gives great insight into what the future will look like as you can see this evidenced in Total Recall and 'Robocop'. Great story you have it Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger)who is placed on earth as a construction worker he finds himself happily married to the sexy Lori (Sharon Stone). Constantly Quaid continues to have dreams about Mars it's like he was once there. Then a trip to a memory agency called 'Rekall' it finally hits Quaid he has really once been to Mars! You name it all hell breaks loose as former Quaid friend, but now enemy and terrorizing dictator Cohagen (Ronny Cox) begins the search with the evil Richter (Michael Ironside). No sweat though Quaid escapes to Mars to search for his real identity after he learned that his identity had been erased. On Mars Quaid once again meets with his true and past love the exotic Melina (Rachel Ticotin). Together they both fight the forces of evil and help the Martian community finally gain a life of freedom. Along the way Quaid meets a cab driver but later it turns out to be a Cohaggen worker. Anyway Benny (Mel Johnson Jr.) provides the funniest quote in the movie and perhaps one of the funniest of all-time in movie history. I'm sure anyone remembers it's the bar scene which includes the hooker {Benny: (to the three-breasted hooker) You make me wish I had three hands.} I never will forget that quote from the first time I heard it I died with laughter, I once repeated that around one of my friends and they nearly cracked up. Great and funny quote! Mention must be made that this is by far the sexiest Sharon Stone has ever looked! The first time I viewed Sharon Stone in Total Recall everything from her face, hair, body, and just anything about Sharon she's just so sexy! It's a shame that Sharon's character no matter how deadly had to be killed by a bullet through the head. That's the one part of the movie I hated to see. I could continue to go on and on about Total Recall, but I will finish by just saying the acting is great this is by far Arnold's best movie {Note: Arnold you need to make a sequel to this}. Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox are tremendous as the villains in this movie an audience can't ask for better villain characters than these two. And Roy Brocksmith (Dr. Edgemar) seemed to get plenty of work in front of the camera in the early 90's I also remember him making guest appearances on two episodes of HBO's Tales From The Crypt series. Where is Roy gone to? Total Recall has the gut crunching, white knuckle, nonstop action that you action buffs will enjoy. So see for yourself it's total war, total Schwarzenegger and the thrill of your entertainment life. And remember just as this film has a theme of the past and as I have told many people many times the past can affect the present. Only if we could go back to our past and deal with problems and people of the past such as Douglas Quaid did. Total Recall has all of us wishing for a real fantasy world.",9,0,1,24 November 2000
Rocky," Human Triumph. A Tribute To The Human Spirit And Heart. Loved By The Underdog. A Classic For Everyone.
","Many are unaware that Stallone got the idea of a screenplay for Rocky from a professional fight between little-known Chuck Wepner and Muhammad Ali. A fight in which little-known Wepner went the fifteen round distance with the greatest Ali. It took Stallone only three days to write the story of an underdog boxer named Rocky Balboa. Shot on a shoestring budget in just under a month, Stallone had the sleeper hit of 1976, winning Best Picture and Director Oscars while Stallone received acting and writing nominations. Rocky is a beloved classic for many reasons the film has a certain theme to it the film has more to it than fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world. Most importantly Rocky gives a message of fighting and standing up for what you believe in. No matter how much of an underdog you are fight for what you believe and prove the doubters wrong. Balboa proves this by finding love with shy Adrian(Talia Shire) proving no matter how awkward a person may seem love is possible for anyone and they can live the American Dream together. Rocky is more than a movie about a fourth-rate boxer who gets a shot at the title. Aside from finding love the film is a study of finding one's self through hard work and determination though Rocky Balboa(Stallone) taste defeat at the hands of Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) he felt that of a winner for going the distance proving it's not whether you win or lose or draw , but whether or not you fight hard. Remember(Balboa) his whole life was a million-to-one chance. Sure Rocky was what made Sly Stallone a movie superstar, and Rocky also came to be a film that helped start what we call sequels. The main message in Rocky is for anyone who's ever won or lost hope and happiness are always possible. Success is possible to any underdog who works hard. Rocky is a symbol of the American Dream. Finally Rocky is one of the best films of the century a must watch for anyone and you will want to review the sentimental theme of the film many times. A classic forever.",10,1,2,6 July 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," The final movie from legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. A masterpiece. A film of character study and discovery. A must see.
","Anyone who knows anything about legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick knows just what a perfectionist he is when it comes to filmmaking. Kubrick takes the viewer down a haunting journey in every film he produces especially so in his final film 'Eyes Wide Shut'. The long length and creepy musical score of 'Eyes Wide Shut' along with many other Kubrick films keep viewers in suspense, those Kubrick methods keep viewers in haunting drama  throughout his movies, but that is only an element of intrigue that Kubrick uses in his plots leading up to surprises and hidden secrets to be discovered. 'Eyes Wide Shut' has Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star as an affluent couple in crisis. Cruise a Manhattan doctor begins to embark on a bizarre odyssey of sexual discovery after his wife (Kidman) admits to an unfulfilled romantic fantasy involving an attractive stranger. Cruise discovers a strange and underworld sex subculture through the streets of New York City. To his shock and amazement he finds that even close friends that he thought he knew well happen to be apart of this strange sex subculture. Cruise then tells his wife (Kidman) about his bizarre odyssey then in the films ending the couple both once again discover there sexual feelings. Though Kubrick's long drawn out pace and haunting score are complicated to many he sends some very clear messages with his final work 'Eyes Wide Shut' one when beginning with a crisis individuals must go through a journey of discovery. Second a journey can lead to a unknown subculture that test sanity. Third through a journey discovery is found as in this films case it's sexual and morality leading Cruise back to Kidman no matter how bad or insecure the situation anyone can learn to enjoy what they have. What one person learns through a journey of discovery the other can be eager to take part in related things, as evidenced by Nicole Kidman's last words in the movie after Tom ended his odyssey watch and you will understand. A masterpiece and a tribute to Stanley Kubrick it's nice his final film was so great he always wanted a film to be a search and discovery to the viewer no matter how complicated. You male viewers get a treat you get a couple scenes of Nicole Kidman nude, but this film has so much more it's a meaning of discovery. It took me two viewings to fully understand the meaning that's why I feel anyone should watch 'Eyes Wide Shut' it educates a viewer to explore and think.",10,0,1,14 October 2000
Pretty Woman," Modern-day Cinderella story that made Julia Roberts a superstar.
","I remember back in 1990 how this film captured many peoples hearts, but the story is so hard to believe. This situation is uncommon in life. Richard Gere as businessman Edward Lewis who meets by accident a beautiful and carefree hooker played brilliant by Julia Roberts. Both teach each other about love and life. Different as light and dark with Edward being serious and Vivian always on the edge this shows love is possible for any person. That's why many like Pretty Woman so well because it is that they always hope for the rags-to-riches romance. I remember this best for the big superstar status it gave Julia Roberts.",8,0,1,9 June 2001
Rocky III," A fresh life for the Rocky series. Stallone once again proves to be the master of making a sequel.
","Stallone goes the rounds as both writer and director in this the third installment of the Rocky series, and a winner is produced. Rocky III is often described as Sylvester Stallone vs. Mr. T. Much more can be found and learned from Rocky III the film for one contains emotion, love, sadness, dedication, and friendship but most of all the once again discovery of 'The Eye Of The Tiger'. You have it Rocky (Stallone) the heavyweight champion of the world makes ten straight title defenses with no problem, but complacency plagues Rocky who shows his odd manner by taking a circus act charity wrestling match against Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). The lack of training hurts Rocky and he suffers a crushing KO at the hands of punishing challenger Clubber Lang (Mr. T) nearly at the same moment Mickey (Burgess Meredith) suffers a KO to his life in a physical sense only later to die with Rocky crying over him in the dressing room. Death actually occurs in two separate means with the death of Mick it's in a literal sense really happening and with the knockout title loss that Rocky (Stallone) suffered in a sense a figurative death occurred though not in an exact sense, but a title loss felt like death to Rocky (Stallone). I could see the graphic match technique was used to compare the loss and death scene, that's exactly what graphic match does it ties the story together with issues representing both a literal and figurative meaning. After the defeat Stallone once again meets up with former opponent and friend and think god Rocky has a friend Appollo Creed (Carl Weathers) who trains to help him once again discover 'The Eye Of The Tiger'. Wife Adrian (Talia Shire) supports Rocky to bury the past and to not once again become complacent, and to not bear the burden of Mick's death because guilt will only destroy, by once again believing in yourself and soul searching 'The Eye Of The Tiger' can be found. In the rematch with Lang which went three rounds with a KO going to Rocky 'The Eye Of The Tiger' was discovered. See a fresh start and be like millions of others and discover 'The Eye Of The Tiger'.",6,1,2,18 November 2000
Die Hard," One of the best action movies made. A must see if your a guy.
","When I saw this in 1988 at the movies I said now that is an action movie! Die Hard is nonstop with action I mean you have it all the explosions, terror, hostages, blood, fights, and high drama suspense ending in rescue. All of this unfolds in a skyscraper building which adds that much more drama. Bruce Willis handles the role of Det. John McClane just perfect he provides many funny one liners. Now if this movie is not liked by a guy then they have a testosterone problem because action is what we guys like. Die Hard still even today shows every once and a while on both basic cable and channels like HBO because it is that good of a movie. So go have a blast! If you have saw it go have another blast!",8,1,2,20 May 2001
Psycho," A classic. Hitchcock's greatest film. Everything is perfectly done and the film has the most famous scene in movie history you know the scene 'The Shower Scene'.
","Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad.",9,10,19,4 November 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Great Movie! More thrills and excitement with Bruce Willis a must see!
","I  remember in May of 1995 seeing this at the movies with my friends and we came out to my friends car and talked about what a great movie we saw. This Die Hard almost ranks as good as the original, and better than the second. Bruce Willis is once again great plus you have Samuel L. Jackson who gives a fine performance. All the excitement and action of this Die Hard keeps you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy this if you haven't already. One of the better action movies made!",7,0,0,21 May 2001
Jaws," A Suspense Thrilling Classic! One Of The Best Musical Scores In Film History Also.
","1975's Jaws is now an immortalized classic after 25 years this film still brings suspense and fear to all beach lovers and swimmers. Jaws can be called a classic for many reasons to name a few the directing of Steven Spielberg the good acting of Richard Dreyfuss as a genius scientist studying and analyzing the Great White Shark and Roy Scheider's portrayal of a good-hearted cautious town sheriff(Martin Brody). Most of all the musical score at the films beginning and really throughout all of the film makes such a suspenseful climax that movie fans loved I remember owning the 45 record I wish I could now find the CD or tape soundtrack. Jaws is not really a horror film, but more a suspense-thriller that builds up to a horror climax. This film really had many people I know terrified to go swimming at the beach, because of the portrayal of a shark being a human-eating machine. Jaws is definitely one of the century's best movies a film to view many times for suspense lovers.",8,1,3,9 July 2000
Back to the Future Part II," One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made Almost Matches The Original Back To The Future.
","1989's Back To The Future Part II happens to be one of my favorite movies the film almost matches the original Back To The Future in quality and popularity. This movie has it all drama, comedy and most of all the biggest adventure of your life a great thrill ride! BTTFP2 can become confusing to the viewer it like many films is one where you have to pay close attention you can't miss a minute also you must have saw the first Back To The Future to get any enjoyment and meaning out of this film. The film does a good job of showing how the future that of 2015 could look like at the time at first in 1989 those future inventions and creations seemed long away, but not now as we are in the year 2000. This film also flashes back to the first Back To The Future that's why BTTFP2 almost matches the original in quality and popularity. Along with the technique of flashback irony is present in the form of Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox's) travel back to 1955 once again just as in the first film only this time to change it back to the original 1985. So this is a sequel which repeats the original in many ways. Once again the acting is great Michael J. Fox as always gives a great performance he simply is one of Hollywood's greatest actors ever.Lea Thompson gives another good performance. Hey I could just go on and on in fact I have seen this movie about 75 to 100 times, just as much as the first Back To The Future. This film has ran for many years on the SCI-FI and USA cable networks and should continue to do so due to popularity. Simply put one of the best ever watch it again and again it seems to get better with age.",8,1,2,19 June 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," Ready to explore the dark fringes of human behavior? And experience both enjoyment and terror at the same time while being educated by the world's best lecturer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).
","Finally after ten years I watched The, Silence of the Lambs for the first time and I must say that it is not as great as everybody had said. I can say that after watching it though I felt like I was educated by the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit! I love the script it seemed to have a real life ring to it. You have Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as an FBI trainee who wants to be a member of the behavioral science unit that studies violent crime and serial killings and once the brutal killings across several eastern and midwestern states begin all the work of 'Buffalo Bill'. Clarice enlists the aid of a former psychologist and now imprisoned sociopath (Anthony Hopkins) to help track the killer. And I must say that Hopkins gives a mind numbing performance he really made a great educated sociopath the movie explores the dark nature of life but mainly it proves all of us can receive a mind playing education just as Hopkins does so well with the Foster character as he brings out her dark fears and past mistakes such as the incident with a crying lamb as a child maybe we will later learn in the Hannibal sequel that a lamb doesn't stay silent forever you know Anthony's Hannibal will roar like a lion. The, Silence of the Lambs falls short of matching the gore and high drama of movies like Se7en but the script is so mind tingling and while the Hopkins character has the ability to know the future of all and any crazy individuals while he surprises himself and others with the rude nature and he can always play his own mind games to his advantage that is what makes The, Silence of the Lambs a classic. Let's hope Hannibal is this good.",6,0,4,8 February 2001
Any Given Sunday," Oliver Stone's take on pro football.
","Sure Oliver Stone did score several touchdowns and earned pro bowl honors, but still did not have a hall of fame movie. Any Given Sunday does it's best to show the life of pro football mostly the highs and lows that a team experiences in a season. Stone did very little to focus on the x's and o's of the game but decided to show more of the struggles, and I'm glad because it is how a team deals with differences and problems that makes them winners in the end. Al Pacino is veteran coach Tony D' Amato who deals with the pressure of life such as winning football and just basic everyday life only to have those matters become tougher when dealing with the tough and witch of a team owner the win at all cost Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) plus the struggle with young quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) who takes the team over when aging quarterback 'Cap' Rooney (Dennis Quaid) is injured Beamen who lightens up the game struggles with success in terms of team and clashes with old school coach Tony D' Amato only in the end when it is said and done you see that both Beamen and Amato taught each other how to win. After the championship season you see just how smart that coach Tony D' Amato is as he really shows this franchise what it is all about and how he goes about, the ending surprised me when I first saw it but each time you watch the ending you cheer for coach Tony more and more. Willie Beamen and Amato are on another highway to a championship. Al Pacino is great as always, Any Given Sunday also stars former NFL greats Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor the musical scores played during the movie are great. Basically Oliver Stone makes Any Given Sunday a little long but hey this is a Stone movie he likes many many minutes in his films, but this does show a pretty good look at pro football but still I would take watching a real NFL game over this.",8,0,0,3 June 2001
The Breakfast Club," An A+ film. And read my 80's icon film comment.
","I am shortly typing another Breakfast Club comment because I left the word a out in my first and with this movie great you want the comment to be great! Read my 80's icon comment but remember this a athlete, a brain, a criminal, a princess, and a basket case. Always remember it's meant for everyone to be different, everyone should be different, and it's OK to be different I had a friend tell me that once. I can see how that message is shown in The, Breakfast Club.",10,0,1,4 June 2001
The Breakfast Club," An 80's icon film, a great hit due to the strong message it brings that all of us can relate to.
","John Hughes I thank you for making a film that is so true in it's message times that we can all remember our high school days. High school is a point when you find yourself searching for that meaning well knowing what the world is about and dealing with problems and differences while always bumping over and stepping on others toes. The, Breakfast Club is a story of five Chicago, Illinois high school kids who spend a Saturday afternoon in detention and I will tell you that you find that in every high school in America you have students just like these characters in The, Breakfast Club. Even my small town high school had teenage high school students just like these that's why The, Breakfast Club is such a hit for the fact of the realism it brings. You have it in all different types first Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) as the athletic type a high school wrestling champion all brawn and no brains, next Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) as the brain and straight as the arrow student the next genius in the making, then the criminal and everyday rule breaker John Bender (Judd Nelson), then follows the princess and prom queen Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) a girl that any boy would desire to be with, finishing out with a basket case and odd Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). See what I mean now remember these types in your own high school. During the days detention these five discover they have more in common than they think. The, Breakfast Club has some of the better dialogue and acting in film history it's one of those films you learn to like and remember by heart and Judd Nelson gives the best performance of any cast member. The, Breakfast Club continues to receive numerous airings on cable many weekends you can find it on the TV as high as five or six times that's how well respected this John Hughes classic is, I have a copy of The, Breakfast Club in my video collection and view it many times. I think the Anthony Michael Hall character Brian Johnson says it all in the end that each of us found out who we are a athlete, a brain, a criminal, a princess, and a basket case. Remember it's meant for everyone to be different, everyone should be different, and it's OK for everyone to be different. I had friend tell me that once and I can well see how that message is shown in The, Breakfast Club.",10,0,1,4 June 2001

Back to the Future," Want To Go Back In Time For The Millionth Time! An 80's Classic. The Best Ever.
","From the first time I saw this movie 15 years ago in the theater, I knew it would be a classic. The film has all the major genres drama, adventure, fantasy, and comedy. Boy was I right Back To The Future continues to get numerous broadcast on cable networks especially TBS, I have probably watched Back To The Future 100 times and I own a VHS copy. The reasons I find the film so entertaining are first the wonderful acting of Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson, Michael J. Fox is always entertaining to watch due to his wit and comedic ability. Lea Thompson is eye catching she has underrated beauty. Second I first saw Back To The Future only by chance, I was going to see a minor league baseball game, but due to a rain storm that caused the game to be canceled me my father and uncle made a trip to the theater, despite being a couple of minutes late, we still watched a delightful movie. Hey just as in time travel things don't always go as planned. Hint: Back To The Future. Finally Back To The Future is a tribute to any history buff, if your like myself and enjoy the past it would be a dream come true to travel back in time, especially to see your parents fall in love, see the shape of a community and how it changed to the present, but to already know the outcomes. Finally you must have drama and conflict in the past so you can really enjoy your present state example: Marty's struggle to get his parents to meet and fall in love and to get back to the future, and remember you can't take the place of your father in the past it could be disastrous Quote: of Dr. Brown. At last a movie for all ages to watch again and again.",10,1,2,26 June 2000
The Wizard of Oz," A Timeless Classic. A Film For All Ages. Remember There's No Place Like Home!
","The Wizard Of Oz is by now a cult classic. So many themes and principles are present to name a few there's boredom, escape, exploring new adventures, dreamed fantasies, wicked enemies becoming witches, friendship, journey and discovery and finally learning the true meaning of home and family. This movie has been seen by a billion people many like myself have viewed it a couple hundred times. Many good things can be said about this beloved 1939 classic Oz is simply more than just a movie about a dreamy Kansas farm girl who takes an unforgettable trip down the Yellow Brick Road to a magical fantasy world. This film made Judy Garland(Dorothy) a star, just to mention Garland brought a certain sex appeal to Oz she was one of the most beautiful actresses of her time it was tragic her life ended so young. For some unexplained reason I tend to have sexual thoughts and feelings now every time that I now watch Oz I can particularly relate to my own past intimate relationships with females when viewing Oz, but I now see the trigger factor is the beauty of Judy Garland. Margaret Hamilton is perfectly cast as The Wicked Witch of the West her wicked looks use to give me nightmares as a child when I would view Oz, but as time past and I matured the terror went away. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are all lovable characters hey wouldn't it be great to have friends like that on earth to help guide you on your journey of life. This film became a national institution, thanks to perennial TV airings, the Technicolor brilliance of Oz, and the song 'Over the Rainbow'. Many believe Oz gives a message of a continued journey that travel should be a regular that people should continue to travel and see new lands meet new people and search for answers. I instead take the message of Oz as there's no place like home. I have found this out from my own experiences. The world happens to be a very cold and cruel place as in comparison to home love, comfort, and support which are present. Knowledge can be found at home, and home is where the heart is, and courage is found inside your home. Remember there's no place like home.",10,2,3,3 July 2000
The Godfather," Now ladies and gentleman it doesn't get any better than this.
","Long before serial killers, heroes, comedies, and dramas you had this masterpiece The, Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola knew just how to organize this so well by showing how a family made a living and going to elite power in the process. Marlon Brando is the greatest as Don Vito head of the family, then open the door for son Michael Corleone played perfect by Al Pacino. The, Godfather helped make Pacino a household name. The, Godfather also uses one of the best film editing techniques possible the work of Russian film editor Pudovkin as his editing technique of linkage of shots adds to the drama of The, Godfather. The scene of the baptism is linked just at the very same moment with the murder scene of enemies sure it is not the best pace but the scene is just perfect, and the drama of the events is increased through editing by linkage of shots by comparing death to a baptism both highly valued rituals in the mob. The, Godfather is the best from everything with the filming, acting, and the story. As you know The, Godfather will be the greatest classic forever.",10,1,4,5 June 2001
