The Rock," James Bond - The Sequel
","The Rock is arguably one of Nicholas Cage's best films and Sean Connery at his absolute best, almost reprising his Bond role. This film is a good action packed watch. Typical of Director Michael Bay, and you can see elements of many of his other films in the camera action ie Bad Boys. The music is typical of Hans/Zimmer (see Speed and Pirates of the Caribbean for similar themes) and packs an exciting punch.The pace of the film is fast, not mentally taxing but it has stood the test of time and stands up to repeat viewings. For a film that is almost twenty years old (and I've seen it countless times) it just doesn't age and is still completely relevant. The premise is believable and superiorly acted by Ed Harris as General Hummel protesting the deniability of black ops military by the US government when they are killed in action... An issue that could quite possibly come true. It's a protest that the viewer understands and can see that the General is a good man, wanting to do a desperate thing for a sympathetic cause. You immediately take to the General, but see that his self imposed mission is more than what it appears to be, and his men - some of them - are barking mad. The FBI calls on their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) who's a field rookie to go up against some of the best military men in the US. Michael Biehn convincingly plays Commander Anderson - leader of the Seal team on the 'good' side but you can see his empathy with the General and his respect of him. Lots of military pomp and hierarchy - a great film for military action fans - and the entire story and execution of it is almost faultless. Acting was believable for the most part - many superb performances - with a few 'comic relief' moments. The action is a little OTT sometimes and a car-chase that is pure Hollywood (complete with lorry carrying water bottles) but a joy to watch. Cage brings some of the one liners and comedy with his over-acting funnies, which lightens the mood sometimes when it would otherwise be quite a dark film.An entirely enjoyable watch, realistically rated 15. Some bad language but it's not unreasonable, and plenty of back-story/human interest surrounding the action and gung-ho machismo. John C McGinley, John Spencer and Vanessa Marcil as good other characters in the story, with a brief appearance from Claire Forlani. Lots of familiar faces, lots of strong characters even in smaller roles and totally engrossing cinema. Excellent action film well worth the watch. Not disappointing at all.",8,2,2,9 November 2014
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," enjoyable Simon Pegg comedy - nothing outstanding
","I love Simon Pegg; from Spaced to Hot Fuzz, Paul to Shawn of the Dead, so was expecting to love this too. Whilst I didn't love it, at least not on first watching, I did 'like a lot' this Brit-comedy with a lot going for it. Simon Pegg is clever, self-effacing and eminently watchable. He's not so up his own backside that he can't make fun of himself and in this - as with a lot of his films - he doesn't paint himself well, but comes good at the end.Dennis (Pegg) is a bit of a loser, a 'nearly man' and someone who never sees something through including marrying love of his life and mother of his child Libby (the beautiful Thandie Newton), leaving her 'at the altar' so to speak. Five years on and he's in a dead end job, and seeing Libby get it together with good-looking, rich, fit American hedge-fund manager Whit (Hank Azaria) who has the best of everything, and so the competition begins for both the favour of Libby and the attention of their son, Jake. The competition between the two is padded out by funny interactions between him and his landlord (Harish Patel) and Libby's cousin/his friend played by the timing-genius Dylan Moran. Spot Stephen Merchant, David Walliams and Floella Benjamin to name a few familiar faces dotted through the film.Whilst there's nothing particularly outstanding in Run Fat Boy Run there are some great comedic moments (the lingerie shoplifter and the spin-class portion were particular hoots), some heart and the take home message about how the underdog can win if they work hard. It's predictable to a certain extent but it's just a nice film typical of Simon Pegg's oftentimes cringeworthy sort of humour; always well executed and cleverly written. Sadly no Nick Frost in this one!",6,1,2,24 January 2013
Moneyball," Good biographical film, but I didn't get all the baseball refs
","Enjoyed this, although didn't understand all the baseball references. Basically a true story of a baseball GM who tried a new computer-generated statistic analysis to put a potentially winning team together on a low budget compared to teams such as the Yankees or the Red Sox. Set in the Oakland Athletics, Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane who was an ex player turned scout who finds Jonah Hill the Stanford Economics genius who has developed the equations and such to set up the system. Pitt, Hill and Seymour Hoffman were great, understated characterizations, Pitt bringing his eat & act modus operandi to the character, which always makes me laugh. It wasn't as gripping as some sports films, as it's about the people rather than the game, but exciting enough to follow the team, with some illustrated back story of Bean's career and also about his life out of the dugout (not that he is ever IN the dugout) with a cameo from Robin Wright as the ex-wife. His daughter was cutie with a good singing voice. Well directed film written in part by Aaron Sorkin - which didn't surprise given the tight economic script. Good biographical film.",6,1,1,22 July 2012
Men in Black 3," Not at all bad for the third in a series!
","When MIB first came out, the premise was brilliant, funny and really different. Usually second and third installments don't live up to the expectation of the first film and in this instance that is still the case, but only by a short way. This, as a third outing for the MIB duo, lived up to the trailers and is one of the best sequels I've seen for a long time. It's not as good as the first one, sure, but isn't at all bad. The jokes aren't so funny, or new, and Will Smith isn't as 'Will Smith' as usual but the content of the story makes up for that.This is about time travel, which I always like. The SFX were excellent - especially all the different aliens - and the homages/references to famous people always make me laugh. Did you know all models are from the planet Glamouria? Anyway, I digress. Time travel. It's about time travel and that part of the action is cleverly done. I liked how there was more heart and soul to this one, and we learn a little about Agent K. Emma Thompson was rather good, but I think my favourite character was the charming and cute Griffin, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, as an alien who sees many future permutations all at the same time. I think he brought the comedy to the film instead of Mr Smith! I don't know whether this is the last one that is being done, but if it is it ends well. There is scope for another one, of course, but I think it's a little tired now. The jokes and the patter has been done and there was little that was new, particularly. Yes I enjoyed it, and would even see it again but it's not brilliant but certainly a good evening's entertainment. Now, where is Bad Boys III?",7,0,2,11 November 2012
The Incredible Hulk," My favourite Hulk
","I'm not a Marvel fanatic, but I enjoy the genre generally as good entertainment. However, this one has Ed Norton (an awesome actor) and Liv Tyler - beautiful and talented. I love their chemistry together and Ed Norton is by far the most believable Hulk. I like the CGI and SFX in this and whilst they are cartoon-ishly overblown in places it's all appropriate as it's Marvel. Tim Roth as the adversary is good; because he's not a normal and obvious choice for an action anti-hero, but then nor is Norton. Liv Tyler's gentle way is a perfect choice and believable as the subject of his undying love.I like that Hulk, is a love story as well as hot action. It is tender and moving, and also funny. There's lots of physical humour, and the Hulk - although suffering with serious anger management issues - is likable and really rather cute.You'd expect this sort of film to be just for the boys but there is plenty for (non-fan-girl) girls too. That said, there are also plenty of comic references for die hard fans to enjoy. Marvel aside, it's still a good fantasy/sci-fi film. I have to ask though, what is it with mad scientists?!",7,0,0,29 November 2013
The Monuments Men," Entertaining, poignant and historical
","Set in WWII the MM's were specialists sent to Europe to save priceless works of art from Nazi stockpiles/destroyers. Real men women, were responsible for finding stashed collections and protecting art galleries and museums and returned family heirlooms to Jewish owners when they were taken by Hilter's men. Well acted, with a star-studded cast, the sets, costumes, locations and everything about the film was excellent. Damon, Goodman and Blanchett were stand out. There was a little comedy to keep the story rolling along, and realistic and poignant enough to be a valid war film but without all the gore and graphic tragedy. Some of the most heartbreaking scenes were of burning of pictures and books, one of the horrors of war which rarely gets much press. Based on a true story, possibly directly true but for film it needed a little more suspense and less contrived quick solution... for my money. Interesting spectacle of history, however.",6,0,3,3 April 2016
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," the climax wedding and honeymoon portion of the franchise romance
","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD). The first half of final book, which I believe shouldn't have been split into two halves as there isn't enough to spread out to four plus hours so consequently both films are riddled with montages and scenes that don't really move the story on; especially the honeymoon and all the chess games for example. The broken up bedroom after their wedding night is funny, and I like the Director didn't shy away from scenes with skin in them in order to keep it for younger audiences given the basic naivety of the majority of the rest of the films. It's a nice film, the wedding very sweet, and all the preparations lovely but again it's the interaction with the Quileutes and the vampire clan that are best. This gets interesting when Bella gets pregnant at super speed and the pregnancy causes a lot of issues including twitchy wolves and scary Volturi. Anything with the Volturi bring an added dimension to the story but they're all a little cheesy and camp rather than scary. Whilst Martin Sheen is a great actor, the fear factor works better on the page than on the screen.",5,2,2,20 May 2013
The Equalizer," Denzel being brilliant - a very good film
","I remember seeing The Equaliser, the TV show, when I was young, staring Edward Woodward. This is the same, but totally different.Denzel plays Robert 'Bob' McCall, and we see him initially start his days in simplicity, in a mundane job, in a simple home, reading, not sleeping and enjoying quiet solitude and routine. The pace of the film can be described the same way. Quiet solitude and routine. Nothing happens loudly or quickly and you have to pay attention. Denzel is at his charming best. Think Training Day, think Safe House and Magnificent Seven with the charm of the Prince in Much Ado About Nothing.Antoine Fuqua, Director, also working with Denzel on Training Day and Magnificent Seven, is flawless, seamless and deeply committed to a viewing experience that immerses the viewer. Often, more often than not, lighting is low in The Equalizer and little is said or explained. What happens in the dark, is salient but not narrated. This makes for a slow burning piece of great cinema; tension and pressure mount and you feel it. Like John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as 'Baba Yaga' - the bogeyman - Washington's dealings with Russian mob are equally devastating, accomplished and quiet.Watching the film, you don't know who Robert McCall is, just the guy in the 24hour diner reading through the list of 100 books before you die (incidentally I'm shamefully only on 30), and making tentative friends with Alina or 'Teri,' brilliantly played by Kick Ass star Chloe Grace Moretz, the young prostitute. You don't know who he is, but that is drip fed to you through the film. Unlike other heroes McCall doesn't do what he does for glory or recognition, he does it for justice and moral right. You don't hear Teri's story either, which is a blessing, but not having backstories and motivations narrated is a clever ploy for you to fill in your own blanks, or keep the pace quiet and slow. Moretz and Washington's friendship is lovely and believable. He is a trustworthy person, and like his unobtrusive violence, righting wrongs, you don't see sexual violence in this film either; the awful things Teri has to endure are not spelled out, which is a relief. Less is more. Martin Csokas, a good actor, but known for his hammy portrayal and terribly overdone Russian accent in XXX, was perfectly cast here. He too played it understated and deadly with the confidence or someone who has never been realistically challenged before, possibly drawing on his experience of playing Celeborn in LOTR ... quiet graceful and deadly! When I say unobtrusive violence, meaning you don't always see it, sometimes you do. This is not a film for under 15s by any stretch of the imagination. There's some very up close uses for common household items put to alternative use in the film. If you are a bit squeamish or sensitive, don't watch. That said, Fugua uses darkness and suggestion well even in these scenes. Everyone in the cast put in performances to be proud of, but Washington of course was the stand out. He truly is a phenomenal performer. Whatever he touches is golden, and I very much like seeing age and experience, and economy of violent movement, showing professionalism and realism over glamour and youth and showy unrealistic fight scenes any day. Especially with Denzel! Marton Csokas, known for his terrible Russian accent and hammy acting in XXX, is infinitely more formidable as a Russian mob fixer, here.",6,2,5,20 February 2017
Skyfall," missing the tongue in cheek humour, silly gadgets and kitch cheesiness
","This was a great 50 year Anniversary Bond film. I'm a fan of Daniel Craig as Bond; he's cold, detached and looks rather beat up most of the time (not pristine) just like the Bond in the books. Him and Judi Dench are great together, with Dame Judi as the irrepressible M. This film sees a new Q who's quite a nice addition but he didn't have the gadgets and gizmos - the silliness - we come to expect from previous Qs. The stunts in this are awesome; the stunt bikers need a whole heap of awards and the scene on the train roof was brilliant and some of the fight scenes were worthy of a Bourne movie, however, something is missing from the modern Bonds that I miss and I think it's the tongue in cheek humour. Craig's Bond is probably nearer to the books and a real-life Spook/Ghoul but the kitch cheesy one-liners and the over the top innuendo of Bond's conquests is lost. Yes, the films are slicker, faster, darker and smoother but I can't give the film the high marks that it perhaps deserves. I also find all the product placement really annoying; Bond has always been a big business and a franchise but I think it's gone too far.Javier Bardem was the star of this show, he was really creepy, mad and unrecognizable in the guise of crazy-freaky blonde bad-guy! Berenice Marlohe was stunning. Scotland views were beautiful and we learn a little about Bond's back-story and I love that Craig as Bond is broken and more than a little messed up rather than pristine like Roger Moore! The story was sadly lacking, not much suspense (courtesy of in depth trailers) and whilst I don't usually notice them I saw a lot of continuity errors and silly mistakes. Annoying.For a Bond film, it's great, fabulous entertainment and I'd recommend it. As a film generally, I'm giving it 6/10",6,3,13,8 November 2012
Iron Man 3," entertaining Marvel franchise film
","Marvel films are not for everyone, I accept that. I am not an expert, and so cannot judge Iron Man on technical Marvel merit, but on the basis of a film about a likable character, by known brilliant actor (Downey Jr). Paltrow is watchable in this film and many people have commented that it's one of her best roles; I usually like her (especially Sliding Doors and Shakespeare in Love) and she was no less good in this than I expected. Downey Jr and his comedic timing and dry straight style - always incredible deep into character - weren't disappointing but the stars were Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley, particularly the latter. Don Cheadle also reassuringly good and the child actor Ty Simpkins was perfectly cast and not at all annoying (as many child actors are). I could listen to Paul Bettany all day so him as the voice of the suit/computer was very pleasant ;-) The CGI was obviously front and centre with all the SFX, which is expected, and for the most part it wasn't obvious (aside from where the laws of physics made it necessary) except for a few places where I got annoyed. Generally though it was seamless with real action, and some of the SFX were brilliant especially the 'running hot' bodies of the terrorist army - especially Pearce. The script was witty and clever for the most part, but a little staccato and without much depth but it did the job and for such a visual film it was sufficient. Without the SFX and the absorbing skill of the actors, this film would have faltered as it really was a visually attractive experience even on a small screen. I was gripped all the way through, which I didn't expect and was emotionally involved with some events in the film. Really did enjoy Ben Kingsley and the humour, for me, added a great deal to the film. Not much in the way of life changing or expanding experience in watching this film, but in terms of entertainment - even for a super-hero/comic book franchise - I enjoyed and gave it 7/10",7,1,2,9 November 2013
John Wick," Astonishingly good. Stunning cinema.
","Reeves is back to his Point Break, Speed, Matrix action-best. Wick a violent, visceral fast-paced high kill-rate film with a vintage slick and eminently cool feel to it. Reeves owns the screen, and reveals a physicality which belies his age. He throws himself around and is believable as the suave professional 'mechanic' anti-hero.The story - I'll admit - is a little far-fetched if you take it too seriously, the bad guys are a little hammy and one-dimensional but Reeves brings a grace and gravitas to the role of Wick which shows off just how good he is. The martial arts are unusual, original and superbly choreographed and, like Jackie Chan, Wick uses anything to hand and is more fragile and realistic than most action anti-heroes, he is breakable and you believe he might just not make it. Cute puppy scenes, cuter puppy and Keanu scenes - is there anything better than a scene with a handsome man and a gorgeous puppy? The brutal scenes with the dog - Daisy - will upset some but bear with the film. It's quietness and lack of complex dialogue works well with Reeves and the story, there is a calm about him which is a juxtaposition to what he does for a living, is capable of, and this is depicted rather well with the unusual punky/rock soundtrack.Watch it. Probably a favourite for boys everywhere, martial arts fans, Keanu fans and definitely ladies that like guys with guns and an easy power that makes your knees wobble. It is a stunningly shot film... an old school feel, slick, and dark and totally entertaining.",8,5,11,9 July 2015
Gravity," Wow! a visually stunning film; this is what 3D is for.
","This is a film that was bound to do well; Bullock and Clooney, both big draw names and both very talented actors, popular and with appeal for both serious and comedic roles. They had good chemistry on screen despite limited contact, but mainly Bullock shines on her own for the majority of the film, and other than that the majority of anything happening you just have their faces and their voices and still the film carries weight in terms of gripping the audience. I can't remember the last time I was in a cinema when people were so quiet, I barely wanted to bite my popcorn! I think people were stunned.Difficult to review without spoilers but the premise of the film is well known; people in space, they run into difficulties... Apollo 13 was similar, problem after problem, tense like a roller-coaster. This was particularly tense and gripping as a) it's in 3D so everything is more vividly shown and b) Bullock has a way of drawing you in to her little world and c) you can imagine how mind bogglingly scary it would be very easily. Being in space, outside in it, free-floating... alone... Brrrrr...Bullock had worked hard for this role, she had worked out A LOT and it must have been physically draining as a lot of the scenes were weightless and unless they used CGI (which I think they did, a bit, very well) and/or some very clever wire work, she was doing long scenes in free-fall anti-gravity plane flights - difficult!! She did it brilliantly and convincingly and you could really believe it was all happening to her. The plot is very slim - but there is a little back story and in the absence of lots of varied events and dialogue and back and forth, there is pathos, existential epiphanies and some really touching moments. Sounds are made use of, music (a great score and soundtrack) and attention to detail in the sound effects. There's no glamour, and emotionally Bullock was very exposed without anything to hide behind just raw emotion and fear and struggle. I got a bit teary at one point, I will admit.The real star of the show was Gaia - Planet Earth; however they depicted it, whether it was real space shots or CGI or whatever, it was magnificent, it added the spectacle and the backdrop to a lot of very close in action sequences, and the infinite reaches of space were engrossing when you got to look out, it felt huge in the cinema with the 3D glasses on, really beautiful. I haven't really appreciated 3D much before but in Gravity it was necessary and it had a point to it. In the confined space of the space pods on the station, the effect was so realistic as to be there - and some of the scenes were shot out of Bullock's eyes making you right there in the action. Little details like that, the use of the lens as eye, things ending up on the lens to give the impression of intimacy and being there, the use of reflection (very arty in places) and the whole visual of the film was one of the best I've seen. The CGI in this film; the 3D effects though were incredible - mind-blowing = a special effect was tear drops floating in front of the viewers eye/the lens, tiny details were what made this film despite the scale of it. It had the same visual effect as... remember the first time you saw T2 or Matrix? Like that.Whilst I thought this film was superb in terms of visuals, stunning and very artistic, and the performance by Sandra Bullock was especially raw and worthy of accolade, I can't see that Gravity would translate well to DVD unless you had a screen the size of your wall. It is a big screen film, a 3D film, and without those two things I don't think the impact of it would be as great and so it has limited appeal. I don't expect its a film you could (or would want to) see over and over again either and once you know what happens, the tension is probably gone.",8,1,2,4 December 2013
Lone Survivor," Brilliantly depicted horror of modern warfare
","Wahlberg is a pretty good bet for superior acting and this film doesn't disappoint. He plays the titular lone survivor, no spoiler alert there, and lived to tell the tale and write the book about his horrific experience in the field. Whilst an American production, it wasn't as flag-wavingly red white and blue as I expected and whilst that's always good, we do expect a little understandable bias but I liked how the film pushed hard the fact that not ALL people from that part of the world are bad. The Gulab villagers were incredibly brave and true to their beliefs of hospitality and obviously Marcus Luttrell owes his life to the father and son, who risked their lives for him.The premise of the film obviously told you the ending, which does diminish some of the anxiety and stress of the action, but there is still a lot of horrific scenes of war and conflict. The action was generally graphic, realistic and powerful but a few bits were too 'staged' but knowing that it was a true story overrode any of the minute flaws in the production of the film. Photography and editing were good - the camera always in amongst the action and low level, almost like hand held and therefore emotion watching the film ran high as the viewer was in the centre of what was happening. Certainly not a film for those viewers who don't like blood and gore, but realistic SFX of combat. With my limited knowledge the procedural aspects of the film seemed good (Luttrell was involved in production) and I noted his documentation of the concept that the Generals in war were able to stand back and send their men into untenable situations like pawns on a chess board and they are safe back in the bases behind the lines was commentary on the unfairness of combat on the ground. All the actors in the squad were good at their individual personalities and characters and overall the film was engaging and exciting, if a little emotional. Whilst not necessarily the sort of film you could watch over and over, it is certainly one that would stand repeat viewing.",8,1,2,18 January 2015
This Is the End," half good, half bad. Funny in part but it went too far.
","Don't know how to review this. It's funny and a rather unusual premise - all the characters in the film are the actors playing themselves, in LA, at a party at James Franco's house, when strange goings on start happening: It's the end of the world, Apocalypse style! There are a lot of laughs but suddenly it all goes downhill and the jokes go from amusing and bawdy to highly aggressively sexual and in that context its just not funny. Ever. And in the cinema big laughs went to embarrassed awkward laughs. It was too violent and too crude, but still punctuated with amusing bits. I won't lie, it was entertaining and theologically speaking (yes, I said theologically) I liked the Bible reference and how good triumphed over evil and it highlighted that God wins over the Devil. Haha! Rapture, the beast with seven heads, the Book of Revelation and loving thy neighbour aside, it was just on the right side of irreverent and wasn't offensive to Christian views although close to the bone on just about everything else. It handled the Bible bits rather respectfully - and I can't believe I'm saying that of such a horrendously rude film! Rude, crude, violent, drug use, sexual reference, sexual acts, reference to sexual acts, scenes of a disturbing nature, flashing lights, cannibalism, Channing Tatum in a gimp mask (disturbingly gorgeous still!), demon possession, nudity, bad language... funny - hilariously so in parts - but too much of the above to make it a good film for me.",4,2,5,3 July 2013
World War Z," Excellent adaptation of a great book; different but complimentary
","This is a really tense film, exciting and visceral. It engages from minute one and keeps you tightly bound until the end. The premise is simple; zombies have spread wildly and are taking over the planet. Nowhere seems safe, and unlike 'traditional' zombies, these are fast and the turn around from bite to zombie is twelve seconds so infestation of an area is exponentially fast.Brad Pitt is believable as the ex-UN worker, who gets called up to help out, he's convincing as a man who's seen action in the field and picked up a thing or two, and is fit and able to run around and take care of himself and his family. He played the action guy but also the guy who is worried about his family, and those he's in a team with sensibly. The 'solution' isn't stupidly come across, by a leap or intuition, or without realistic casualties. It doesn't keep close to the book at all, but has taken the spirit of the story and made a huge film out of it. It was a massive scale film, with epic CGI vistas of zombies taking down whole cities - and the SFX of the film, the zombies themselves are brilliant. Everyone in the film acted it very real, and you hope against hope that there is a solution but you have no clue what it could possibly be.There are flaws in the logic of the film, and much is left unexplained, which is annoying, but it doesn't really detract from the film experience, which is a spectacle to be sure. I don't get the 'fast zombie' thing but in this genre-version it seemed to work. The end of the film left an opening for future films without being too obviously cliff-hangerish and I was pleased how international it was and wasn't too flag-waving American. Overall a great film, very entertaining.",7,2,3,19 January 2014
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," life after getting dumped... involving Dracula puppets
","I enjoyed this. It's a typical romcom, with all the clichés but it has a little bit extra. There's Russell Brand for a start - always entertaining - and a few other familiar faces in a large cast where everyone has very specific characters they aren't just incidentals; Paul Rudd (Object of my Affection, Friends) almost unrecognisable, Taylor Wily (Hawaii 50), and Jonah Hill (Superbad, 21 Jump Street), Jack McBrayer (30 Rock) and William Baldwin! I know Jason Segal from 'How I met your mother' and he wrote this as well as starred, and I liked him. I could have done without the full-frontals (plural) but hey. He wrote them in, he must be proud. I love Mila Kunis (Friends with Benefits) in everything I've seen her in, and this is no exception. Kristen Bell (Couples Retreat) played annoying want-it-all girlfriend well.Basically a girl dumps boy, boy can't stand it, tries everything to get over her movie... he runs into girl with new boy and fun in the sun ensues. Set against the stunning backdrop of Oahu, Hawaii, it's an easy going watch and you get swept along. As I say, it's not original, there are clichés, and you pretty much know where it's going but that's okay. It's not a rocket science film, it's not groundbreaking nor is it Oscar worthy, just enjoyable, funny, cringeworthy but also with a few interesting things to say. Good writing, and it looks like Segal can really play the piano! Bonus. Very watchable.",6,0,2,4 December 2012
Argo," tense, gripping and full of realism
","I didn't know much about the Iranian hostage situation, and thought that this film was going to be about how the hostages in the embassy were rescued, but it turns out that this is about six hostages that escaped and were holed up in the house of the Candadian Ambassador. Ben Affleck plays the CIA hostage retriever/negotiator sent to Iran to bring them back under the tenuous guise of a sci-fi film crew. I'm not a huge Affleck fan, or should I say I wasn't. In this - where he acts, produces and directs, he was brilliant. If he doesn't get at least an Academy nod for direction I'll be very surprised. The direction was tight, close and everything was done to increase the suspense and the tension. The whole style of the film was of the period (late 70s), with muted colours and even film logos were of the time, which was a clever touch, and wardrobe was great. It looked just like an old film! For a tense premise, there was some humorous moments and the audience reacted, which is always a good sign. Goodman and Arkin were so fun to watch, and Cranston had some hilarious lines - but he's an incredible actor in anything. Part of the tenseness of the film was - for me - that it was all so real. There were no SFX to speak of, everything was closely filmed and intimate; you were right there in the action.The downside of this film is that it is very flag-waving American, and damning of the Islamic Community. Yes, this is true story and yes the Iranians did do all this but, and it's a big but, in the film's favour, it did narrate at the start how it all came about and that didn't put America in a good light. It was presented factually and whilst not in an unbiased way, obviously you are 'cheering' for the USA/Canada, and it was fairly balanced.In the end credits - stay for them - the characters (the actors) are shown next to their real life inspirations. The only one that is not freakily similar is Affleck himself. As well as staying for the end credits, keep an eye out for a giggly extra in the car in the crowd scene. LOL! Overall a brilliant film, highly recommend both for style, content and realism.",8,2,4,15 November 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," another Ryan Gosling triumph although that's hardly a surprise
","Aside from the superlative Mr Gosling (God Bless Canada - and here I'm referencing his nationality not a movie he made previously) which makes it a given, this movie is both great and good, and easily one of the best rom-coms I've seen in a very long time (Friends with Benefits the only other one recently). Described by a friend as a 'modern day Parenthood,' if you remember that ?80s Steve Martin masterpiece, it too is a look at an extended family/social circle and how it falls apart and comes together again. Carell plays it straight and leaves his silly characters behind (much better than Date Night) and this is the first thing I think I've seen him in that I really enjoyed. He was perfect as the hapless cuckold, opposite the under-utilised but memorable Julianne Moore. Gosling and Carell seemed to have good chemistry (as did Gosling and Stone but who can blame her opposite Hollywood's rightful goldenboy du jour), with Gosling being the comedy-timing genius of the piece, and he was perfect. Flawless. Marissa Tomei often over-acts and is a little too samey but here she pitched it just right, and showed her superior quality for such a small rather silly/crazy role, Kevin Bacon the same bringing quite a bit extra into his few appearances. The younger cast were surprisingly good and I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Bobo, who showed maturity and confident delivery in quite a complex child part. In short, all the cast were great - also mention the actress who played Stone's best friend; very funny.Well scripted, acted and with a lot of heart as well as humour, CSL is up to date and relatable. A great family movie, or just for the eye candy that is Mr G it's worth a peek; if you can watch the Dirty Dancing scene without making an impromptu squeaking noise when he takes off his shirt - or react like Stone does - its time to call the paramedics - I'm just saying, as he is startlingly lovely. Overall its an interesting look at dating psychology, a rather cynical look at it actually, but also looks at true love and friendship too, and what matters in a relationship. Heart warming, and enjoyable, I prefer Parenthood although this one has Ryan Gosling (Parenthood has Keanu Reeves) so it's a close run thing. Loved the surprising garden scene - didn't see that coming, shock - was a little distracted.",8,1,2,26 August 2012
Ted," if children's films grew up - in a word, hilarious!
","In a word, hilarious. Saw this courtesy of work pal at a free screening, and really enjoyed it. Seth MacFarlane was the voice of the bear and brought his own brand of irreverent close to the bone bawdy and profane humour to the shana punim of Ted. Laugh out loud, this is primarily a boy's film (what's the male version of chick flick? actually don't answer that...) with lots of 80s and 90s references, and despite the teddy bear not at all suitable for children. My husband and I seemed to be the only ones in the cinema apparently to get the paraphrase of 'Stay Gold Ponyboy' but the rest were generally appreciated. A terrifyingly genius turn by Giovanni Ribisi with a Tiffany obsession ('I think we're alone now') gave the film a dark twist and there were loads of other cameo type appearances Patrick Warburton and uncredited Ryan Reynolds playing scarily believable gay couple, Patrick Stewart as narrator and Norah Jones, Tom Skerritt and Flash Gordon, Sam J Jones. Shockingly gross at times, but also with a good deal of heart to make the fantasy (superb SFX) of the living toy relevant, with a surprisingly welcome Hollywood ending that wasn't too schloky. Wahlberg and Kunis were cute and the acting by Wahlberg opposite Ted was brilliant- especially the fight scene. Watch it and weep, with laughter!!",7,2,7,21 July 2012
Troy," It does Homer justice, I think
","This is an epic film based on an epic poem, and it is well told. There is much that is missed out and much that they've used license on but it works well and in terms of Hollywood is brilliant. Brad Pitt is superlative; beautiful, his physical presence on screen is domineering and like a ballet-dancer in the fight scenes. This is one of his best roles, and I imagine one of the most challenging; especially with all the leather mini-skirts he has to wear! It's not brilliantly acted, by all the characters, a little hammy, but in terms of CGI/SFX, production, direction and general cinematography it is superb. I would have liked to see 'grey-eyed Athena' in the film but the gods and that aspect of the story were missed out completely (except as reference, of course). As spectacle the film rivals the old Hollywood epics such as Quo Vadis and Spartacus for scale and also modern greats like LOTR.There's lots to get your teeth into in this film; action, romance, history, good storyline and tragedy and you don't have to be a ancient Greek historian to follow/enjoy the film although you are likely to know the end given that everyone knows the story of Achilles (don't they?) The Set Design and Costume were great; just the right amount of modernity but suitable historical reference. However, it is Hollywood and you can't get away from that, but it's the kind of Hollywood like Anthony and Cleopatra, with wide angles of whole ancient cities, and a massive cast of extras which is just great to watch. I loved the score - the ancient style of chanting and singing. There's some awesome 'bullet time' (Matrix) slow-mo action in the fighting which will take your breath away - and some of the action is graphic and bloody but it's not so bad that it's offensive and as it's all in keeping with the era and genre and apposite to the story.The film makes me want to read the book again. It's not a perfect film and will never be a great classic, and the dialogue is a little confused, but visually it looks good and is an enjoyable watch if not taken too seriously.",7,1,3,29 November 2013
Midnight in Paris," strange and surreal, typical Woody Allen, yet not in NYC
","This film is a love letter to Paris, a picture postcard of the city at it's most beautiful, even in the rain. Owen as hapless Gil Prender is the artistically minded writer who dreams of Paris in the 1920s and through a medium that isn't mentioned or explained, ends up there - in the 1920s and meets many of his heroes, and falls out of love with his fiancé along the way.At first intriguing and exciting, the film becomes a little lack-lustre as the characters from Gil's own belle epoque come thick and fast on the screen; Hemmingway, TS Elliot and F Scott Fitzgerald to name a few, and so it becomes a little silly. It's a philosophical (typical of Allen) existential piece with thought provoking monologues on man's inability to see the perfection of where he is now rather than hankering for a time long past and much is made of lights at night in the rain, and art and the artist's search for perfection and beautiful women. Quelle surprise! Owen was perfectly cast; hapless, romantic, a little of the underdog but still attractive and witty and with plenty to offer, although his current fiancé doesn't seem to see that. From the start they don't seem suited and his Inez played by Rachel McAddam, is instantly unlikeable. Comedic only in a dry Woody Allen-esque observational way, there are few laugh out loud moments but the film is humorous, uplifting and ultimately pleasing whereas the first two thirds you are stumped how it is going to pan out. Time travel aspects aside, there is much to enjoy, and whilst I enjoyed the time travel bit, it would have helped if there was some sort of explanation but Owen's disbelief, to incredulity to joy were good enough, and really well depicted.A strange ensemble cast of many familiar faces, and a very well directed and realised story. The dialogue was a little bit staccato in places but overall I enjoyed this film a lot and felt 'good' after it. A sort of loss of romance romantic film... if you can imagine such a thing. Would watch again.",6,0,0,26 April 2014
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," stellar performances
","Brilliant film... Stellar performances from Gary Oldman, Colin Firth and Tom Hardy. Everyone actually - it was a real ensemble piece. The pace was slow and back and forth, and that added to the overall style and gritty realism of the film. The silences and un-answered questions were tantalisingly intriguing adding to the mystique of the spy genre, I felt I was investigating too... Having not read the book, I am ashamed to say, I didn't know what to expect of course. Lots of homo-erotic subtext, which added another onion layer to the piece, which I understand wasn't in the book, and I felt the cinematography, and spirit of the film was very in keeping with the era. The film was graphic in an emotionally gripping way, not in a gratuitous way, and there were so many scenes that will stick in the mind for various reasons and for the brilliant way they were portrayed; a certain bullet hole... the love scene... tears when a partner leaves etc. Smiley was always known as being invisible, a grey/brown character and the perfect spy and the whole film sort of took on that mantle. Superb film. Tom Hardy adds again to his chameleon status, he really was incredible. I don't quite know how he does it!! There will be gongs a-plenty for this!",7,1,4,16 October 2011
Ant-Man," great fun and entertaining Marvel film
","Along with Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor and anything with Hugh Jackman, Ant-Man is my new favourite Marvel film. I was unfamiliar with Ant-Man previously and was pleasantly surprised. The film passed quickly and enjoyably with sufficient action, story and comedy to make for an entertaining family film (rated 12). Paul Rudd as usual was fun and charming, and believable as the ex-con turned reluctant superhero out to protect his daughter (the very cute Abby Ryder Fortson). Corey Stoll as the bad guy was both credible and strangely likable, charismatic I think you could say, but he is a new popular actor having wowed in House of Cards. Michael Douglas was good. The action and SFX were slick and really well done. Ant-Man's interaction with the ants was really clever and it was fun to see ants with dog-like personalities. Marvel are known for good SFX and I think this was one of their best examples. Suitable for all the family, I think this Sci-Fi/Fantasy Comic Book/Graphic Novel tie-in would be a good addition to any Marvel fan's collection. Worth seeing on the big screen and this is one film where a 3D option would be valid and worthwhile.As with all Marvel films, look out for Stan Lee's cameo and stay for the very end of the credits for the sneak previews of the next films. Ant-Man will return!",7,4,10,7 September 2015
21 Jump Street," reboot of 80s TV series - undercover highschool drug-bust comedy
","I didn't see the original 21 Jump Street (unfortunately) but love that Johnny Depp puts in an appearance in this albeit heavily disguised. This is a fun back-to-front bromance, a reboot of the 80s TV series which is comically mentioned, and a funny undercover at a highschool drug-bust scenario. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as an unlikely pair of second-time-around students but they work well together - and Ice T is the funny and irreverent 'stereotypical angry black captain.' Hill (Schmidt) and Tatum (Jenko) are both playing characters similar to those they've played before but step out of their character comfort zones, they're clearly unlikely buds and this is referenced to comic effect, as is the fact that times change and coolness is fleeting. Loved seeing Jake Johnson (New Girl) and Chris Parnell (30 Rock) playing (ish) straight roles. Some of the funniest interactions in this are between Jenko and his Chem Teacher Ms Griggs - LOL every time - and the two boys on drugs. Hilarious. It's funnier the second time around, like Pineapple Express (another Franco) funny, though with lots of similar sick references and homoerotic gestures, which I don't know the point of to be honest and don't find so funny, but there's lots that is super funny and Tatum's physicality (!) is very impressive. Enjoyable.",6,1,2,18 May 2013
American Hustle," superb performances but oddly unsatisfying
","American Hustle is a real con-artist/hustle/heist type of film, and one of the best for plot, writing and complexity of the story, it has you guessing all the way through and is very suspenseful. I had absolutely no idea how it would be resolved... well, until the bit in the lawyer's office. Its a 'period' piece, set in 1970s America, and the fashions and styling of the film were very good. The soundtrack was great.Bale, Cooper, Adams, Lawrence and Renner ... and De Niro ... were exemplary of actors incredibly deep into character; they were all barely recognisable and each performance was gripping, believable and impressive. Jennifer Lawrence, girl du jour, was luminous as the unstable and rather irresponsible wife of Christian Bale's overweight, balding hustler; he was quite gross in many respects. Cooper was the over zealous FBI Agent who you sort of wanted to win out but the whole film was back to front in that good guys were perhaps the crooks, or were they? It was a little of a grey area. He was sexy, funny and obnoxious in equal measure. The script was great, the plot was great ... as a con-artist movie this is up there with the greats BUT it was largely unsatisfying emotionally. It was a really good film but not really all that enjoyable. Sure, it was entertaining and laugh out loud funny in places but it wasn't a comedy, was definitely drama, and watched more like a documentary than a film. It was good but one came away feeling a bit underwhelmed. None of the characters were particularly likable and whilst the story was gripping, you weren't invested in the characters, just curiosity about the story. It was, I can only describe it as, an empty and unsatisfying experience and the ending... I don't know, it didn't please. A film with cracking potential but just doesn't make its somehow, and I can't really put my finger on why.",7,3,6,22 January 2014
Oblivion," impressive visuals but a slow burner that fizzles out
","I was bored watching this film, it took a while to get to the point. It is visually very attractive, all CGI, and you are intrigued as to what will happen mainly because you can't believe that it's so uneventful, but ultimately I didn't care. Even Tom Cruise couldn't rouse any feelings of connection or empathy with his character and I found it was rather predictable - Hollywood. I remember thinking about what I was going to write for my review whilst watching it (never a good sign) and thinking that it was a hi-tech, hi-budget version of low-budget 80s films like Solar Babies or Steel Dawn but with aliens.The film plot didn't exactly make sense, I could see what it was trying to do but there were plot holes the size of a small asteroid, and what did make sense in terms of understanding was just silly and I didn't care and I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Even Morgan Freeman wasn't giving it 100% and the rest of the cast seemed to be very inexperienced - acting my numbers. The acting was pretty hammy or wooden and nothing about the film felt original; Independence Day was heavily ripped off. The end was without any surprises and over all I was left unimpressed and that the entire film experience was pointless and there was no allegory which might have made it more relevant. There were enjoyable bits I guess, a pleasing flash back to Top Gun, a few laughs with Bob - the bobble-head - and visually it looked good, and Cruise playing Cruise is likable, nice future-tech and a beautiful swimming pool, but I wasn't emotionally involved in the film at all and it just seemed like a long music video or disjointedly connected set piece scenes. Why the name Oblivion?This film could have been so much better, more tense and poignant.",5,1,2,26 January 2014
Man of Steel," very good DC superhero action movie - def one for the boys
","First off, I liked Henry Cavill as Superman, or Hopeman as the Kryptonians would have us see it. Cavill certainly had the look, and then some, and was convincing as Clarke Kent. Amy Adams I didn't quite get, and whilst I think she's a good actress, and I know she's always wanted to play Lois Lane, I didn't see it somehow. All the other characters were well cast and well utilised; well you don't have Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner in a film and not give them some space do you? I loved Crowe in the role of Kal-El's father Jor-El. Diane Lane as Clarke Kent's mother was delightful - I can't believe how far she's come since Cherry Valence in The Outsiders!! The film was, for me, a bit long, especially the big Kal-El/Zod battle... I got a bit bored and that brought the film down for me. It became all CGI (of course) but it was all so fast that it was totally fake, and I don't like that. Otherwise the SFX/CGI in the film were awesome - I particularly liked the breathers covering the faces of people needing breathers. The flying sequences were really realistic and good... and Adams and Cavill seemed to have good chemistry in their romantic interludes, including the times he flew with her. All very good.Very entertaining film, and certainly if you were a DC/Superhero fan this would be a superb experience and people who know more about these things than I do say it's close to the comics. Even as a non-expert I liked the nods to previous incarnations of Superman and some gentle humour. Look out for the sign saying '0 days since the last accident' on a building site, Lexcorp stuff and signs for Smallville etc.I really did enjoy the film, except the long winded bits towards the end, that got wearisome. One bit where Superman is fighting with a morphing silver snakey thingie from the space ship (see how DC-savvie I am?) the noise was too sharp and I flinched at that. A very good film and, I believe a very convincing and powerful reboot on the classic older Superman franchises. I thought Cavill reminded me of Christopher Reeve a little, which was nice. Loved the dog actors in the film - super cute border collie. Some humour, some emotion, some tense bits and then also a little romance. Very good film",7,0,3,20 June 2013
Warrior," the fight film that makes Rocky look like Disney
","Flawless, absolutely flawless. The (British) demi-god that is Tom Hardy has done it again... a superb performance as the broken embittered younger son returning 'home' to fight against the wreckage of his early years, and quite predictably (it's in the trailer so not a spoiler) his brother, quite literally. Nick Nolte (who I have never liked up until now - although I knew he was a great actor) is the regretful sorrowful ex-drunk of a father trying to reunite with his sons, who presides over the unravelling feud. Joel Edgerton is a relatively up and coming actor and I think this is his first shot at the mega-big leagues... and what a trial by fire working alongside Hardy and Nolte (in that order IMHO)! This is a brutal fight film - mixed martial arts (MMA) where anything goes; what you would be arrested for outside the cage for GBH is par for the course inside it, where you have no idea how it will end (although you can guess at scenarios) and it keeps you pinned up against the fence until the last, the bloody action interspersed with story of incredible depth, sensitivity and heart. The characters were so finely drawn - Hardy playing a man who's past is revealed bit by bit and despite his animalistic (boy is he like a crazed cornered tiger) hate and fear driven madness you love him. Frank Grillo and Jennifer Morrison were great supporting cast and really add to the drama. But the genius of this film is that there is no damnable Hollywood ending - you are left, tears running down your cheeks, feeling as ragged as if you had just gone a round with Kobo, raw, and spent, heart in pieces with no tidy conclusion when it fades to black. I couldn't have coped with this at the cinema!!",10,1,3,8 July 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," eye-opening and entertaining expose of mental illness
","Generally, this film is a romantic drama, confronting mental issues sympathetically and with some humour but keeping the poignancy of the subject. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the stars and rule the screen together with great chemistry and physicality. Robert de Niro was also (unsurprisingly) brilliant, depicting Pat (Cooper's) father - suffering with some mental issues himself and creating an unstable environment for a young man with vulnerability having just come out of a mental hospital. Jennifer Lawrence, also amazed by her acting skill; great range, as did Cooper. Portraying someone with bipolar or erratic behaviours is difficult to change posture and expression on the drop of a coin and these two actors did very well.The story is complex, gripping, nerve-wracking and quite complex. The story isn't spelled out and is revealed in the narrative and through the occasional flash backs. The scenes are a little choppy, certainly at first, but this probably is a technique to speed up the opening part of the film. The cinematography is plainly shot, with no surprises, and I think that it could have used some more artistic styles or variation. The language in the film was quite bad, given that I was watching with someone who was sensitive to that, but it wasn't entirely unnecessary in that it fit with the characters and the narrative. The story itself took in mental illness, love, disappointment, familial dysfunction, gambling issues, bereavement and is wonderful, uplifting and very interesting but sometimes worrying and uncomfortable to watch.I can see why this got lots of awards, including Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar, given the range of the actors and the complexity of their characters. Whilst it was brilliant, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but will certainly vouch for how good it is! A fantastic character led drama with a touching love theme.",7,3,4,31 December 2013
Save the Last Dance," formulaic but uplifting, with attitude... aaaa'iiiight?? ;-)
","Nothing in this film is original, you've seen it a dozen times, but this is more than an oddball in the new-school romcom with dance thrown in. This one is more adult, it deals with real issues and it deals with them in a not very glamorous manner ie it doesn't mince it's words. This I like. The music is good, the dancing is good and so is the script. For the life of me I struggle to see Sean Patrick Thomas (SPT) without a feather 'duster' in his hand wearing silky boxers (Cruel Intentions - le Chevalier Raphael Danceny character), which to be fair isn't a crying shame on the mind's eye, but in this he is good; convincing as the ghetto boy who wants out and gets out, and who can dance! Then comes the problem. I don't particularly admire Julia Stiles as an actress, she doesn't have enough range of facial expressions and always looks sort grumpy, blank, and reading off a cheat-sheet, so I just didn't 'get' her in this - although I did like her in Ten Things I Hate About You, and she wasn't bad per se it was just that whilst impressed that she clearly did her own dancing, I didn't see passion or feeling and that took the shine off for me. Kerry Washington was notably good as Derek's (SPT) teen-mum sister, and I really liked the quiet understated performance of Terry Kinney, Sara's estranged father. Save the Last Dance balances the emotions in the film well, and in parts it does get a bit emotional as it deals with despair, bereavement, confusion, fear, jealously, anger and loyalty, joy, exuberance, acceptance and a sort of redemption.People with interest in hip-hop should like the tunes and dancing in this, and there's enough of it, with a ballet fusion, and it's the mix of drama, romance, dance, music and realism that makes this film more than the sum of it's parts, for target-audience-teens or adults. It's not just another teen movie, this has attitude!",7,1,4,18 January 2013
The Intouchables," warm uplifting story of two different characters forging a friendship
","Amusing heartwarming drama about a quadriplegic millionaire who looks for a carer, but all the 'professional' applicants are condescending, unfeeling and all about their paper qualifications and academic knowledge reducing Philippe (Francois Cluzet) to an object. Driss (Omar Sy) is at the interview just to get Benefits but his irreverence and dismissive laissez faire attitude actually meant that he treated Philippe like a person. A heartwarming relationship grows with it's ups and downs, bringing in more about each of their pasts and hopes for the future.The film is simply filmed, with a witty and gripping script (subtitled into English), which isn't lost in translation. The actors Cluzet and Sy were brilliant in their respective roles with Cluzet brilliantly portraying quadriplegic, only able to move his head and face, but his acting is a commitment to trust in that he has to remain still and inflexible. Sy was exuberant, fun and wild but also showing sensitivity and well-portrayed comic-stupidity. There's music, art and dancing, love and sexuality, fast cars, adrenalin sports, laughs a-plenty but also desperation, struggle and prejudice.It's well acted but whilst the plot is based on a true story, and has something for everyone in true 'underdog makes good' or 'Rainman-esque' style, the screenplay is lacking something. I'm not sure what it is, I think perhaps it's that there are holes in the characters, and in the plot and you are left with questions; you feel it's going to go a certain way... I expected more with Philippe's daughter 'Uncle Buck' style but liked how Driss lightened the mood of the house and brought joy and friendship to the story but ultimately there was something unfulfilled with his character, there wasn't enough depth and finish. I felt that use of Driss played to stereotypes, especially finding out that the original carer wasn't from Senegal but North Africa/Morocco and I wonder whether the story was exaggerated for the screenplay.I liked this film a lot, highly watchable and enjoyable and a very good cinematic experience. I can see why this was lauded but it's not particularly original and did play to stereotypes and didn't feel exactly finished. I was glad I saw it though, and it is apparently France's second most successful film after Welcome to the Sticks. A wonderful soundtrack, the Chamber Orchestra scene was great.",7,1,3,27 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Reboot of Marvel's Spiderman; good film experience, not brilliant
","I enjoyed this film in so much as it was fairly exciting, interesting and the SFX were good, excellent in fact. I didn't mind the CGI, which is a good sign, it didn't annoy me, except I did wonder how much Andrew Garfield was actually IN the film. The character of Peter Parker did annoy me though; whilst watching I got sick of his selfish uncommunicative mooning around, I often wonder how quickly problems would be sorted if people just said what was going on. He was too fashionably good looking and intelligent, and a skater, to be the subject of such excessive bullying, and too confident, to my eyes, so didn't really cut it as a geek as well as the quiet and mousy Tobey Maguire in the role. That saying I really liked him, I felt he was believable in the character once he changed and how he dealt with it. The previous boot of the film had Spiderman finding his webtastic skills as the way he adjusted, and likened to adolescent change, whereas this skirted back to - I am led to believe from what I've read -the original Spiderman using technology to spray his webbing but this showed a similar transition in his inability to control his powers and strength, and so therefore perhaps his anger and mood-swings too. I preferred the emotional range of Garfield in the role. I'm sure Marvel fans will comment more knowledgeably on why there was a reboot and the authenticity of this one, but I was mainly hung up on a few things, that I saw as inconsistencies and imponderables that I found a little irksome which I should have just suspended my disbelief over. The pretty and wide-eyed Emma Stone was typically great, I like her a lot, and in this she was sensible and mature in her role. I loved Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), he was such a lovely character, as was Sally field as Aunt May, Peter's surrogate parents since his parents disappeared, and whilst I understood his anger and angst towards them, I didn't like it - but then you're not supposed to are you? The family brought the characterisation more to the fore in this adaptation, I think, so his anger etc did was it was supposed to; create a roundness to the titular hero. Rhys Ifans never ceases to amaze me as I always associate him with his character in Notting Hill and he's always so different, like a chameleon... also a Lizard! Great seeing C. Thomas Howell again as Jack's Dad, so I predicted we'd see him again as otherwise he was in too small a role, at least I would hope, and Captain Stacey (Denis Leary) as Gwen's father, was ideal as a comic book square-jawed Law enforcement hero, and I like him in most things I've seen him in, he has a dry authority which worked well. Overall an enjoyable and emotive film with a great score, atmospherics and performances. The teaser cliff-hanger in the credits - make sure you don't miss it - nods to obvious suspicions from the start of the film. Certainly an entertaining film experience, and I'd probably go see the sequel as it's got Emma Stone in again and maybe Jamie Foxx, which should be fun.",7,2,4,28 January 2013
The Fast and the Furious," Point Break, the remake or an homage
","Paul Walker playing Keanu Reeves, even down to his voice and choice of sandwich (albeit different bread); Point Break is one of my favourite films, and I really enjoy Fast and Furious but it is more or less a play by play copy of the surf-ace movie ten years on. Vin Diesel is the Bodhi-esque sensei-master surrounded by his acolytes and is convincing; it's one of his best roles (along with Pitch Black 1). He's a powerhouse. The film is attractive, stylish with a hot soundtrack and showcases the street-racer subculture in Los Angeles.Paul Walker isn't just an ersatz Reeves, he is glorious in his own right; beautiful, sexy, tough, controlled and engaging and his chemistry with Jordana Brewster (Dom Toretto's little sister) was nice, but is overshadowed by the bromance between Dom and Brian. Michelle Rodriquez is a great female foil for Diesel; she's gorgeous and convincing as a high-octane junky.Hey, F&F is never going to win awards for the most intelligent film in existence but it's pretty, amusing in places, a little cheesy and poorly dubbed but good cinema and must have had something to spawn itself into one of the largest grossing film franchises of all time. It plays like a music video, with touches of CSI in the filming but much of it is a little pointless and OTT. Vin Diesel is perfect as Dom and his chemistry with all the characters is sparkling. He plays the showman well. Paul Walker is gorgeous, he really is a loss to the acting world, and this film is his magnum opus. Walker and Diesel were obviously buddies and as such it makes this film all the more special. It's great cinema but is definitely flawed, especially in the realm of script. Don't take it too seriously, strap on your petrol-head and enjoy.",7,0,1,28 November 2015
Goon," more blood on the plexiglass than you can shake a stick at!
","Oh ice hockey, oh how I love thee! This was a great film, so much better than I expected (although knew I'd like it) and full of surprises. It had a lot of heart, bromance, humour, awesome hockey and more blood on the plexiglass that you can shake a stick at. It also has some close to the knuckle language and sexual innuendo, that might make some more delicately minded viewers weep then faint, but oftentimes it was funny as well as shocking. It's based on a true story; Seann William Scott plays Doug Glatt - the antithesis of his famous Stifler - a guy who wasn't too bright but was good at fighting and winds up as the 'Goon' in a local hockey team in the US then is sent up to Canada to play. He's a lovely, cute, winning guy, and you are right with him with every punch he takes, and as the film progresses it gets increasingly engrossing and compelling, with nails bitten to the quick. It is the clichéd story of the underdog does good, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the story. Marc-Andre Grondin plays Xavier LaFlamme who exhibits some jaw-dropping skating. Really loved this film.",8,0,0,6 July 2012
Now You See Me," trying desperately hard to be more intelligent than it is
","Overall a showman of a film. Flashy, loud with bells and whistles and big personalities, an exciting premise... illusionists rob banks using (supposed) magic but the four horsemen are just puppets in a game, but the hype is more than the substance of the film itself.You'd expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas (Eisenberg) says, 'Always be the most intelligent person in the room' or something similar, this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away, isn't as unpredictable as it should be (really, you couldn't see that ending coming?) and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious, were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement, as it's been laying clues all along - and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the 'twists' coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie, the end is the big reveal. But, unlike Oceans Eleven, for example, it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show, of course, with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting, stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while, Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the 'glamour' rather than a serious character, which was a shame as she was good.This was supposed to be a big blockbuster film, big back drops, epic stunts and huge crowd scenes, but it failed to deliver. As heist/magic genre films go it's not that great, and The Prestige was far more cerebral and gripping. Entertaining to a point but I got a bit bored, and some of the scenes were too long - chases etc. If you are a fan of heist films or magic you'll enjoy it, or are a fan of particular actors, or will just enjoy it for what it is and don't want to be challenged intellectually, it's a great film.

Ocean's Eleven," one of the best heist capers films
","Clooney and Pitt are a great duo; they have great chemistry, comic timing and are just an attractive pair. The plot is eleven men who are robbing one of the biggest casinos in Vegas on fight night for a possible bag of $150million, split between them. It's a completely ensemble cast including Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts amongst others. It's clever, witty, multi-layered and something of a film that you can watch again and again and see more things each time. It's one that I had to watch a few times to get the entire plot and each time I see it I don't remember the full points so it's a good yarn. The writers were brilliant.It's shot excitingly, with lots of crisp cuts, and jumping between scenes using a split screen occasionally, giving it a retro feel. The plot is convoluted enough that it's believable, if a little slick (given it's got Pitt and Clooney in it that's a given), with some clever time wasters to ramp up the tension, and I just adore Brad Pitt's characterisation - he's ALWAYS eating! Don Cheadle (uncredited, apparently due to a disagreement) is a funny Britt who speaks primarily in cockney rhyming slang is a bit of a hoot as well. The thrill of this film is in the details - silly little things that you might miss. It's a great watch and I thoroughly recommend it as tense comedic entertainment for everyone. I like this film a lot.",7,1,3,14 December 2013
Dirty Dancing," an all-time 80s feel-good classic by anyone's standards
","This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis 'Baby' Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love.Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film but definitely one for (predominantly) the ladies.",7,1,2,21 May 2013
Independence Day," this is how films should be - huge, loud and great entertainment
","Independence Day is a proper film. It is a truly great cinematic experience and even seventeen years on it's still got it! Sure you can get picky about improbabilities and moan on about it's overt American flag-waving and how this little thing wasn't entirely accurate because of so and so but you know what? Don't. There's nothing wrong with this film that a little suspension of disbelief wouldn't solve. Of course it's largely predictable, yes it's lays on sentimentality like a trowel, so what? It's fabulous and I love it. It's got a great (simple) story, lots of laughs, it says something and is good to look at.This film is BIG and LOUD. It was amazing on a big screen. It's action packed, suspenseful, emotive and it's even got a little re-finding of faith in there as well. It has cute children, good looking men in uniform, a scantily clad beautiful woman, a gorgeous dog, humour; Jewish humour AND Will Smith no less, a comedic hysterical gay guy, ridiculous stereotypes of different races & classic world landmarks together with subtitles just in case the viewer didn't quite get that the pyramids and people dressed for the desert with camels in the background is supposed to be Giza in Cairo, ridiculous English accents that make me giggle every time, tense aerial fight scenes, heroism, politics, patriotism, great sweeping vistas, an uplifting soundtrack and theme music, pretty slick SFX (still), a rousing and uplifting speech about the strength of the human spirit and the world coming together to fight a common foe, weepy bits... hell, it's got Data from Star Trek, it's got a Baldwin and, AND it's got long leggedy aliens. And long leggedy Jeff Goldblum, who's just plain awesome. And the lovely Bill Pullman. And Mary McDonnell.See? Just what you want from a film! Someone called it a popcorn movie, and I think that is entirely correct. It's not trying to be anything other than great blockbuster entertainment and it delivers.",8,1,2,31 January 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Peter Jackson's done it again... brilliant but long
","The second installment in the Hobbit story had a lot to live up to, first in terms of The Lord of the Rings, and secondly The Unexpected Journey. This sees the band of dwarfs and Bilbo (with ring) get to The Lonely Mountain to try and claim it back from Smaug the dragon. They go via Mirkwood and so we meet the elves and get introduced to Legolas (Orlando Bloom, who's a little less elf-sylph-like around the face in this one...) Adventure and fun ensues. There's orc-slaying a-plenty with a never ending supply of elvish arrows in the quiver, a barrel of laughs as dwarfs make a getaway and lots of dwarvish physical humour especially at the expense of the fat dwarf and I always get a giggle from Nesbitt's antics and his silly hat (Bofur, the dwarf). Even Stephen Fry does an almost unrecognisable star turn in this film as the hideous Master of the Lake Town. Richard Armitage (Thorin) has the most acting range, possibly, in terms of the adventure-party and his voice caries the gravitas of his Dwarf-King-in-Waiting status. There's a little romance, which is rather touching, but the star of the show is Smaug the dragon, beautifully realised and brilliant CGI - flawless. Wizard Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) has a relatively small role in this film, which is a shame but he does do some fierce battle with Sauron/the Necromancer. However, the main (non CGI) star I think is Martin Freeman as Bilbo; I love his little gestures and comedic timing and characterisation of the Hobbit, especially when he's in a quandary. Once again the special effect that allows hobbits and dwarfs to stand short next to men is really clever and I struggle to get used to seeing familiar (tall) actors made to look small but that is dwarfed (pardon the pun) by all the CGI which I really do get tired of, although it was less in your face and obvious than the last film; I realise it is necessary but sometimes it LOOKS less convincing. Overall this is enjoyable, accomplished and an entertaining part of the overall story for a Middle Earth fan, and it has all the elements you would want from a Hobbit story. I haven't read the book for a long LONG time so can't remember how close it sticks to the book but much of it rang bells. No matter, I know it was done by a fan of Tolkien and someone who would want to do it justice (note Peter Jackson's cameo in the opening scene) and he's done an excellent job. Again. I think I preferred the story of the first and it was more exciting (gripping/suspenseful) but this was a better film and the SFX were largely better. I preferred the first one over all in terms of opinion coming away, as I felt this one dragged a bit and got a bit bogged down, and it could have been shorter.For this film to make sense, I imagine you'd have needed to see the first of the films. Not a film for arachnophobes, as an aside.",7,0,3,31 December 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Entertaining children's film about computer games; fun!
","From the get-go, I really enjoyed this film. It was a clever premise, that computer game characters are real and interact with each other. The characters were well drawn, fun and endearing. Typical children's film in that it speaks to the underdog and outcast being the hero, and friendships being formed unlikely places. For children, to be sure, but certainly enough in it for adults to enjoy. Really enjoyable, entertaining and laugh out loud funny in places. Great voice-actor performances from an all-star cast including John C Reilly, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman and the design of the entire film is in the style of many video arcade games, which is clever. Lots of little in-jokes and asides for gamers to enjoy.",6,1,4,28 November 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," unexpectedly (though should not be surprised) brilliant
","As a huge fan of Tolkien, and of course having read The Hobbit, I had no idea how Peter Jackson could split The Hobbit - a much shorter book than Lord of the Rings (LOTR) - into a trilogy, nor how I could sit through such a long film without getting a little bored. That he could do it justice was never in doubt having seen LOTR. However, the time flew by and I was gripped from beginning to end. I was pleased to see Frodo (Elijah Wood) and the older Bilbo (Ian Holm) again before the 'flashback' that introduced Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo and thankfully all the major characters were played by the original actors; Gandalf (who else could play him other than the brilliant Sir Ian McKellan?), Lady Galadriel, Lord Elrond and Saruman etc so there was perfect continuity, albeit that The Hobbit is a prequel.So, The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey sees Bilbo at home in The Shire at Bag End and Gandalf appears and thinks him suitable for an adventure with a bunch of rowdy, raucous and determined Dwarfs but at first he is reluctant. I was looking forward to the 'chip and glasses and crack the plates' and 'far over the misty mountains' songs and was not at all disappointed with the latter's lovely tune. The adventure takes in Rivendell (home of Elrond, and the last safe haven before the East), trolls, orcs and goblins and various obstacles as the Dwarfs make their way to the Lonely Mountain - their old home - in order to reclaim it from the Dragon Smaug who has taken over their stash of gold. Also during the adventure, Biblo meets Gollum (the incredibly talented Andy Serkis reprising his LOTR genius), the character who possibly steals the show, and it is here of course that Bilbo first comes into contact with the one Ring. The precious.Of course the locations in New Zealand are wonderfully indicative of Tolkien's writing, the screenplay is gripping, laugh out loud funny and tells the story well and is translated by all the actors flawlessly. I really can't think of anything wrong with it. Of course there is a LOT of CGI involved in the SFX and whilst it is essential with a modern fantasy epic such as this, it is obvious and I get tired of it after a while. A lot of the characters and action are CGI which detracts from the film for me. However, it is very good - I'm not saying it is bad! The scenes with Gollum were hilarious, and whilst there was an inevitable darkness to the film as the story unfolded with the viewer's prescient knowledge of the LOTR already, it's a lighter and funnier adaptation than the original films and has more heart and is more of a morality tale. Peter Jackson has yet again done a stunning job with this incomparable ensemble cast including the likes of Richard Armitage, James Nesbit, Aidan Turner, Sylvester McCoy and Barry Humphries! Critics haven't been entirely complimentary about The Hobbit's first installment but we can remember that LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring received mixed reviews too but both are first parts of epic tales that require a build up and introduction and a setting of the scene but even that said it isn't as if this film is short of action, adventure and excitement. A superb film, and a credit to JRR Tolkien's genius yet again.",8,4,13,22 December 2012
Behind The Candelabra," incredible performances by Damon and Douglas
","I had no idea about this film before seeing it, although of course I had heard of Liberace and knew a little about his life/death. I cannot believe that people didn't know he was gay. This film, you find out, is the autobiography of Scott Thorson, Liberace's lover and it seems, the love of his life, who was played by Matt Damon. I think that everything Damon does is totally incredible and one of the best actors out there and he played the role convincingly, dedicatedly and with great courage. It was an exposing and difficult role, as was Michael Douglas' and both of them were superb. Douglas seemed to inhabit Liberace and gave the role 100%. Support actors Rob Lowe, Dan Aykroyd, Scott Bakula, and Debbie Reynolds were all superb. I barely recognised Aykroyd and Rob Lowe as the Plastic Surgeon looked ridiculous but was committed with all the facial taping and prostheses he must have been wearing, Matt Damon too post surgery. I don't know how Michael Douglas' facial effects were done but they were amazing. Damon's prosthetics were a little more obvious but still amazingly convincing. The costumes and sets were something spectacular but then there was a lot to work with given the eccentric flamboyance of Liberace himself.The film covers some intimacies of Liberace and Thorson's life but it was remarkably discrete with regards to the sexuality of the two, and I was impressed by that. There is some bad language and sexual reference that is quite gratuitous and drug use but it could have been a lot more overt. Damon and Douglas clearly were very professional and worked well together to be so discrete, covering their mouths for kisses (ie showing the passion and sexuality of a kiss but without the actors presumably having to do it, and the censor-certification for TV only release in the US) and decent camera angles etc.There was much to enjoy in the film, some comedy and happy moments seeing the burgeoning relationship and love between the two main characters, but also a lot of emotional scenes, sadness and feelings of sympathy seeing Thorson's descent into drug problems and their relationship failing. I felt for the characters such was the investment created by the superior acting. It is an exposé film, eye-opening and as a biopic it is a grand and rather ostentatious success.Bottom line, Damon and Douglas were superb and carried a film with rather difficult subject matter that I wouldn't recommend to everyone.",7,0,2,1 February 2014
Django Unchained," brilliant. poignant yet funny; and one of Tarantino's best.
","Tarantino is one of those writers/actors that whilst you sometimes abhor what they bring to the screen, in terms of things you don't want to see, you can't deny they are geniuses. I hate the bad language, gratuitous violence and most of the subject matter in his films but I have to admit his films are brilliant (albeit I have to look away occasionally). Django Unchained is one of his best, in my opinion. The story is interesting, gripping and really poignant... it's about slavery and addresses it boldly and holds a light up to it without mincing it's words. The injustice of slavery is portrayed to graphic effect but I was expecting the atrocities to be a lot worse, and so was pleasantly surprised by this film being so comedic. It was really really funny, even the cringeworthy bits have humour, which is very unusual. Tarantino has a gift; he stares deplorable acts in the face and still sees the humour in storytelling without detracting from the power or importance.Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx were brilliant together; Waltz was a lovely character, and there was great chemistry between them and I'm sure they had fun with their scenes. Foxx inhabited Django fearlessly and was really committed giving a very physical performance. Di Caprio's Francophile Candie was dreadful but well played, with shades of Johnny Depp all the way through, and was hateful despite there being humour, even when he was at his most despicable. Kerry Washington took on a brave and exposing role and was predictably superb. Everyone in the cast was incredible and gave grade A performances which in turn gave the film such added star quality... but I think Samuel L Jackson(almost unrecognisable) employed the greatest transformation for his role. A trouble with all of the characters was that they were all so horrible (except Schultz, Django and Broomhilda) that you really didn't care about the awful ends that befell them - in many cases they weren't untimely enough! Brilliant acting, great story, but as it was Tarantino there was lots of animation-style blood special effects which were overblown and unbelievable (not realistic) and one particularly shoot out was a little ridiculous. However, that added to the comedy 'One Night at McCools' kind of finale which added to the entertainment of the film and was hallmark Tarantino! There was much that was playful and homage to old films and art-direction, which gave it an older style look, and more serious. Lots of nasty things happened to horses, which I didn't like, but I was happy to see a 'no horses were harmed in the making of this film' note at the end. The scenery was fantastic and the soundtrack awesome - loved the John Legend track amongst others.Overall, great entertainment, gripping and well written, well worth all the plaudits, and praise, for the actor's portrayals. Whilst largely a drama that was highly comedic, intentionally or not, it was a stark reminder of America's past in terms of the brutality of slavery and some of the scenes - as such - were quite distressing, and difficult, but could have been a lot worse given what went on and what Tarantino (look out for his cameo - his brief and explosive performance) has done in the past. Also look out for a cameo from Franco Nero, the original Django in the 1966 film - a cameo and homage.",8,0,1,24 November 2013
Drive," quiet, slick and smouldering
","This film is brilliant. It's quiet, powerful, dark, slick and really understated, not coming across as a massive blockbuster. Gosling, yet again, smoulders - he really is an incredible actor. Not much dialogue but the quietness and minimalism of the Direction, is brilliant. A bit gory, but it's all so well done and not excessive. Something you could watch again and again for the atmospherics alone. Bryan Cranston was good (always), and the soundtrack rather mellow to contrast what is on the screen. Cliffhanger ending, love it. If you insist on your films having special effects, prattle, flashes and bangs and whistles, don't bother. Sexy. The elevator scene... Woh! 8/10",8,0,5,7 June 2012
Good Will Hunting," immediate classic that propelled Affleck & Damon to stardom
","This is a difficult film to rate as the fact that Affleck and Damon wrote it and it did so well, and the screenplay is so good is distracting. All the performances are good but it is the relationship between Matt Damon's Will and Robin Williams' Psychologist Sean that is the most compelling and the genius of the piece. Will Hunting is a broken yet incredibly intelligent young man who's not had the breaks in life, finds inspiration and meaning in his sessions with a compulsory therapist.Minnie Driver as the love interest gives one of her best roles but isn't a main character but the catalyst for some of Will's breakthroughs. Affleck as the self-sacrificing best friend plays a typical character for him, and I do wonder how they decided who would play which character given that they chose the best combination; Matt Damon as a boy-next-door genius and brokenness was perfect given that Affleck would have been more striking, pretty-boy privilege, bringing his angry intelligence (see Boiler Room) which wouldn't have been so attracting nor so inducing of empathy. Gus Van Sant's straight almost dull direction - given his spacey trippy and arty direction in other films - is ideal for the story and his choices with the screenplay for the style of the fast-paced dialogue, especially in the Williams/Damon therapy sessions, was superb. Clearly Affleck and Damon have a very clear and insightful knowledge and experience of psychology. However, the rest of the film - which the dialogue/screenplay distracts from - is average, with some special moments, but predictable and a bit Hollywood. It is, however, rightly, an immediate modern classic and Robin Williams and Matt Damon (and Ben Affleck for the writing credit with Damon) rightly were praised to high heaven for their performances. A great film in parts but a good film in general.",7,1,3,13 May 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Jason Bourne, gone but not forgotten. Renner is incredible.
","When I heard the new Bourne was going to be without the incredible Matt Damon, I worried that this was another franchise that just replaced it's actors. However, this isn't the case. Bourne is still alive and well, and the 'Bourne Legacy' is reference to him not being the only Treadstone operative. The events of the previous Bourne Film (Ultimatum) are referenced as is Jason Bourne and Jeremy Renner does a stonking job of continuing the action, physicality but humanity of the previous films... with that dangerous edge that we know and love. Renner is brilliant. I hadn't seen him in much before this but his ability to project power in a scene and believably do all the things that he is shown doing, with a grace and speed that surprises. He works well opposite Rachel Weisz, and I loved the evolution of their relationship in a natural and compelling way. Terminator fans will like the almost Michael Biehn/Kyle Reese 'come with me if you want to live' bit and Weisz is far more proactive in this similar situation to Chain Reaction, but realistically just as reliant on the resourceful and caring male. Unlike Bond films (Jason Bourne is the American Bond... and prior to Daniel Craig, better) where the female is just an addendum and something to fight/seduce, Renner and Weisz have a symbiotic relationship where her scientific and caring nature combined with the fear of being alone and lost, make for one of the most powerful and tender 'love' scenes in an action film...The action in Legacy is awesome. The fights, the survival, the scenes with the wolf (so realistic - I hope no wolves were harmed in the making of the film!), the parkour (OMG when he walks up the side of the house!), the shooting and the incredible motorbike stunts were breathtaking edge of the seat stuff. Renner is a force to be reckoned with in action films, and if he does a lot of his own work I'd say Tom Cruise has someone nipping at his heels.A great piece of action cinema. Big, loud, bold and exciting. Great entertainment, good dialogue and writing and interesting characters. There were parts where things were spelled out a little too much, and I'd have liked to see Edward Norton utilised a little more - although what he did was of course great, but then he is acting genius - and perhaps the bike scene went on a bit long... and it ended too abruptly leaving me wanting more!",8,4,7,9 June 2013
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," close to the book but not great a film. annoying & frustrating
","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD).Like first book in the series, the second film sticks closely to the books. In the book it works better than on screen despite the cinematography being very attractive and it's a nice film to watch in terms of the view. However the acting and lack of engaging script let the film down and it's a shallow experience. The interaction with Bella and Jacob and his family is the best, and the whole Cullen family scenes, but all the Edward angst and back and forth is just painful. It is in this film that we first meet the Volturi and whilst they are supposed to be scary they were a little too camp but it was interesting to see their workings and history. There's a lot of CGI that works to varying degrees of success, but sets and costume designs etc are good. Edward's desire to keep Bella safe are admirable in the book but in the film the lack of communication - dialogue - between the two is just plain frustrating and annoying. Jacob was the sanest thing in film number two.",4,6,9,20 May 2013
Lincoln," a masterly take on an immortal personality
","Difficult one to review as it's so multi-faceted. Abraham Lincoln as a character is without doubt one of the greatest, most famous, iconic, influential and brilliant men in the history of the World - especially the USA - and this is an educational, historically interesting, powerfully emotive depiction of that man and a snapshot of one of the most important moments in American (and World) history. The film is complicated to watch in that it's not slowed or dumbed down so you have to concentrate, and the writing is fast, intelligent and witty; I feel that the language was time-appropriate and the accents were good (to a non-American's ear) and Daniel Day-Lewis had clearly worked hard on his mannerisms to inhabit such a well-loved character. Day-Lewis's facial prostheses and SFX were superb, and the costume of all the characters fantastic. Sally Field was also well cast and performed well as Mary Lincoln and the scene where they both yell at each other/over each other's voices was particularly good; over the memory of the loss of their young son. Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader were both stand out actors/characters and some of the comic relief of the film, which was a surprising addition. The scene where Spader's is shot at and runs away and has time to run back while the firer is reloading his pistol is laugh out loud hilarious and Lee Jones has some funny lines too, which makes the dryness of the film a little more light hearted. Lincoln also was quite the raconteur and lover of funny tales which make Day-Lewis' character charming too. There's an all-star ensemble cast, so many of the actors are famous faces. One of them, Joseph Gordon-Levitt although a small role showed up how good he was an an actor, and the little boy who played Lincoln's youngest son was also particularly stand out talented.The screenplay and Spielberg's direction and ambition for this film were of a grand scale, lots of extras and little (apparently) in the way of CGI, which is good, and whilst I can find little to criticise with the direction and spectacle of the film as a whole, and it's emotional force, some of the cutting between scenes was a tad odd and jumpy, but I can't say that it bothered me so much, it was just worth mentioning. I liked reference to his diaries and, I thought, a sneaky reference to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter or perhaps that was just my imagination.",8,3,4,12 January 2014
Brave," beautifully drawn Celtic tale about finding your Fate; touching and funny
","Disney and Pixar are always a good bet. The artwork and animation are second to none, and even from the opening scene of landscape, it's a visually stunning film. The human characters are all individual and the lip movement for the dialogue is well done. The plot is original and sweet, very funny and heartwarming. It's a lovely story and I love the Scottish backdrop and traditions. It's tense too with suspense and lots of action. The Highland Games were great and there's lots of physical comedy to enjoy. It has reminiscence of some of the older Disney's ie The Sword in the Stone and like other Disney films there's something for children and much that is definitely adult ie Maudie's bosom and the naked behinds of the clansmen when they've used their kilts as a rope to get down off the roof of the castle. Hilarious.The use of the Druidic standing stones in the story was beautiful and the soundtrack was lovely. Well researched film. Loved it. Like a lot of Disney/Pixar films it might not be suitable for very little ones as some of the scenes with the bears might be a little scary. There is a little scene after the credits so be sure and watch out for it. Perhaps I felt more drawn to it being of Scottish heritage myself, and bottom line it is a children's film, but I really enjoyed it.",9,3,6,2 June 2013
Jerry Maguire," a good sports agent movie with some schmaltz
","I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles.Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.",6,1,2,15 January 2013
Jurassic World," Masterful sequel. Entertaining and visually exciting
","Remember Jurassic Park? How creepy it was? And original? Okay this doesn't totally match up to the first, but it comes very close. We're familiar with the big beasties but Jurassic World goes one step further and makes humans interact with them. Enter, the rather delectable Chris Pratt as the Raptor Whisperer who - of course - tries to save the day. Possibly more interesting than the earlier films in the series, as it's got more sensible behavioral ecology/science and quite interesting thoughts on the environment and our responsibility in it. Pratt is believable and controlling. He owns the screen. He has good chemistry with the animals (okay they're CGI so that's a bit of a stretch) and co-stars. D'onofrio and Dallas-Howard were worthy of the film and the entire cast did very well - especially the child stars. It didn't have the fear-factor and visceral tension of the first film - nothing will beat Ariana Richards' screaming - and I was a little disappointed not to see Jeff Goldblum as a cameo - but it took the franchise to a whole new level. Amazing SFX - the animals were beautiful. Really enjoyed the film, super-entertaining and a good evening out at the cinema. A big screen film for sure.",7,6,19,9 July 2015
Prisoners," a brilliantly tense and gripping story, terrifyingly and impeccably told
","Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard were incredible in this ensemble cast film. Viola Davis and Maria Bello were very raw and convincing as the wives but it was Jackman and Gyllenhaal that stole the show. A gripping a visceral tale about two girls being abducted and their parents and the Detective who is investigating the disappearance's experiences. It's a rather twisted psychological drama, cleverly written and powerfully performed. Set in (fairly) small-town America with poignant crises of faith adding a shadow and depth to the tragedy. Clues along the way were subtle and the unwinding plot was natural and not contrived. It was an intelligent film.Tense and edge of the seat all the way through, made darker by the weather, and simple non-SFX almost old fashioned filming. It had a vintage seventies feel, despite being set in modern times. It made the viewer question morality, choices and how far you would go to protect your own. Jackman's descent into desperation was relatable and understandable. His scenes with the Paul Dano were terrifyingly good.Dark but essential cinema viewing. Brave performances by all actors and great direction and screenplay. You may feel shredded as the credits roll. Possibly 9/10, not sure yet. Highly recommend it, but don't sit anywhere near chatting teenagers, you'll need to concentrate.",8,1,1,24 October 2013
Friends with Benefits," enjoyable romcom trying to be ironic about romcoms
","Olivier or Oscar worthy this is not. Enjoyable, likable and fun this most definitely is. Mila Kunis is the believable headhunter wanabe-happily-living-in-a-post-romcom-disillusion world, who falls in like with Justin Timberlake, the unlikely prince charming given his commitment issues. It's predictable, the trailer showed too much, and at times it's just a vehicle to show Justin's six-pack (I'm not complaining) against the back/front drop of the beautiful Kunis. Their chemistry is great, you liked them together, and that really added to the film's premise of the titular friends with their bedroom benefits.It's not all silly, there were touching moments, the two leads dealing with family and life issues - wayward Mum and Dad with Alzeimer's - but there's a lot of genuine humour with some very clever writing and witty one-liners (some of which I'm pretty sure were Harrelson (playing gay sports writer at GQ) ad-libbing) and he brought superb comic-extra-relief with his 'strikily dickily' rather sound but usually crude relationship advice.This IS formulaic, of course, but it actually mocks that... narrates it, even. It's trying to do romcom ironically, and it works rather well... it's quite honest, and I liked that. Also beautiful shots of NYC and LA (*sigh*) to add lustre to a rather stylish well-groomed GQ-esque look to the film. I liked this a lot more than I expected to; was prepared to be 'meh!' but actually wouldn't be averse to seeing it again. Maybe. If it came on TV.",6,1,2,2 July 2012
Annie Hall," superb classic Woody Allen existential romantic comedy
","Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film.Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane.",8,0,0,15 June 2013
The Artist," wonderful unusual cinema experience
","It's always telling when the cinema audience bursts into applause at the end of a film, as they did when I saw The Artist. It was a joy to watch, a lot of fun, and the time passed really quickly. Laugh out loud funny and with pathos, with strong likable characters, it was surprisingly more complex than I expected given the silence. I really liked the clever touches of the old style of the credits and the filming dimensions of the screen. The wardrobe/costumes were great too. I'm glad the actor who played George Valentin got an Oscar - he deserved it, I think.The story is of a movie star of silent films who feels he has nothing to contribute as talkies become popular as new technology is developed, and younger stars are becoming famous in Hollywood. The film is interesting as a look at Hollywood in the 1920s when the Studios ruled in the 'Golden Years'. Whilst the two leading players were awesome, with a strong supporting cast (John Goodman was great), the star of the piece was most certainly the incredible little dog! I would recommend this film to anyone. Not only is it a great film, it's also interesting as a different cinematic experience, for novelty. I don't think it's trying to be comparable to the silent films of yesteryear, this is clearly just something different, but it is reminiscent of the innocence and simplicity of plots back then without gratuitous violence language or sexuality where a man just fell in love with a woman and danced around a bit - like in old Debbie Reynolds films or Fred and Ginger where the only 'naughty bits' were the Butler seeing a lady in her negligee! This is just a really nice, fun, entertaining film. No subtext other than a hearty hello and well done to ol' Hollywoodland.",10,0,2,17 March 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," a damp squib of a climax, highlighting franchise flaws and naivety
","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD). This is the final instalment, the denouement of the story arc and should have been the screaming crescendo of a climax but was more or less a damp squib. Given the money that was clearly lavished on this film (and the others) it left a lot to be desired. The series' final book was split into two films which I think was a con as there just isn't enough happening in them to make four hours of viewing, they would have been TOTALLY better as one film with faster action. This film was relatively empty and jumped from point to point with little cohesion between. It got annoying. Then there's the acting, given the lack of intelligent script the actors have to act by numbers - jumping from facial expression to the next which makes the woodenness of the acting, which Pattinson and Stewart (both good actors) have been tarred with since the franchise began as if they are just reading lines rather than delivering them. Given, also, there's a lot of - invisible to the viewer - telepathy there are a lot of empty hand-on-face scenes. The CGI is prolific, and it's often hard to tell if there is anything real, which isn't necessarily a good thing as it makes the film less believable (despite being fantasy). The CGI of Renesme's face was so fake and ridiculous but the wolves are lovely again and one of the best parts of all the films, and the CGI on Kristen's face/make up is good. Regarding CGI, what was with the brief white sparkles in the love scene? Was that supposed to be an orgasm? WTH? The only other redeeming features of the film is the cinematography of the landscapes (real or CGI) and the sweeping panoramas which are legion and the fight scene at the end. It is an attractive film, the cottage in the woods very Thomas Kincaid, entertaining to a point but empty and rather dull and like the previous two-parter too montage ridden. The dialogue (what little there was) was banal and limited, and there needed to be more complexity, but that is the fault of the books as they were naively written (given the subject) but it must be remembered that this is a series for young adults not grown-ups and as such it is probably gripping and exciting. With that in mind, as a film, it's still disappointing.",5,4,8,20 May 2013
La La Land," 'a love letter to Los Angeles'
","I have the fortune/misfortune of my best friend living in the USA so she sees everything before me and often says, 'You must go and see this.' I had to go and see this. Aside from the fact that the Gosling-Stone combo is golden, and individually they are brilliant, I had the recommendation from Stateside. I am biased, in that I very much admire Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and I love all things Los Angeles and oldy-worldy Hollywood, but someone told me before I went that LLL isn't set in the Golden Age of Hollywood – the 1940s – its set in modern day Hollyweird. Shocker! What did this mean? From the opening scene, I had a stupid grin on my face, and it only left when I was crying. Such is the emotional roller-coaster of this film. It is the golden years of Hollywood because it transports you to another world, where singing and dancing are normal and love is forever and two people are star-crossed to be together, and it's sunny and people wear bright colours and pretty dresses, and proper suits still. It's a Hollywood where Gosling and Stone shine, and are playing characters that seem so natural to them, the fact that Ryan had to learn to play piano like that for the film defies belief. It's a beautiful film, a love song to Los Angeles, but also a stark portrait of Hollywood as well; the competition, the broken dreams, the fakery, the traffic jams, and the disappointment.Two wannabes – Stone, an aspiring actress, and Gosling, an aspiring jazz musician meet by chance and are wildly unsuitable for each other. But it works. Both are smitten, and motivated to chase the other, and each pushes the other with their dreams. It is beautiful, endearing, but also gut wrenchingly sad and challenging. These people knew exactly what they wanted from life and they bared all (figuratively) and went for it. What is in my life that is like that? What dreams do I have, did I have? I thought about it for days afterwards, that and the beautiful and haunting musical refrain.The music is wonderful, John Legend is a Legend and seeing him in the film was icing on the cake, and Gosling's piano playing is just beautiful. The sets and locations, whether the back lot at Universal or whichever Studio it was, The Griffith Observatory, or out on the road, were all perfect and costume, and Direction, all the ducks were lined up in a row to be brilliant. So many homages to past Hollywood films, little in jokes, which I didn't get but read about, so much depth, and twists for once a Hollywood film without a Hollywood ending, but it was more Hollywood because of that. I loved it. I get why some people didn't, those without the childlike suspension of disbelief and inability to see fantasy and imagine another world, or see metaphor; seems you either adore it or say 'Meh!' I'm not sure it is worthy of all the Oscar nods, if I'm being honest. Yes, it was dancing and singing and fantasy and real life and Hollywood and period and modern and all things to all Los Angeles, but it wasn't taxing or a stretch for these actors. But perhaps it was the nod to things past, the feelings it engendered, the emotional roller-coaster, what films are meant to be about, the story within the story within the film, the film as story and as narration, which makes it more than the sum of its parts, and the bareness and frankness of the characters. I think it is one of those films that will be studied, to peel back the onion layers of Director Damien Chazelle's vision. Go see for yourself.",8,1,6,19 February 2017
Jack Reacher," good Tom Cruise action movie... not much more
","Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is an off the grid ex military cop, who of course is a crack shot, ace assassin and general all-round hard ass. Hollywood fodder then. So far so cliché. Tom actually plays it well, calmly and consistently, but a little too human - a person genuinely like that would have fewer 'niceties' that Cruise brings to the role - he'd be less gentile, a little more volatile. So in this the character doesn't quite sit right but Tom is good in the role... underplayed cool collectedness. The plot is quite smart, more like an episode of NCIS than a feature length film, but with good twists and turns as evidence is deciphered. Predictable a bit. The end is silly and a little all over the shop - to be honest. The acting is fine and I loved the Direction of cinematography's style and use of reflection and different camera angles. The replay sequences are a little too over simplification of the story (we got it without the demo) but I liked the overall feel of the film. David Oyelowo was under utilised against Tom Cruise, he's a great actor but was dwarfed in a production that felt a little like an advert for Tom Cruise rather than a finished ensemble film. It was a little too 'Hollywood' to be an excellent action film - although there were moments of greatness; some of the fight scenes were gritty and awesome.I like Tom Cruise generally, but he does tend to be 'Tom Cruise' all the time... he can't step into a role and immerse himself. Compare Tom Hardy who disappears in a role. This was slick and good, but not enough of anything to make it great and other characters should have been given space to shine. Good but not great.",7,0,3,16 June 2013
Les Misérables," awesome, sob-worthy spectacle with superb performances
","The stage production of this had me in tears, the film version was even worse. I cried a lot; mostly because of the beautiful story, the powerful performances but of course the soul-wrenching music. Victor Hugo's story is one of the most beautiful and painful ever written and the musical score with all the motifs and themes is poetic and emotional as well as uplifting. The entire ensemble cast were clearly giving this one hundred per cent, and it shows. It was obviously difficult to film, live singing, and very difficult physical performances in terms of losing weight and looking pretty ragged, particularly for Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway and tells of the French aftermath of the Revolution.The main characters are Jean Valjean (Jackman), Javert (Russell Crowe) and Fantine (Anne Hathaway), Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) also and Samantha Barks (Eponine) with special mention to child actors Isabelle Allen (young Cosette) and Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche). Hugh Jackman of course as a song and dance man did well in the main role of iconic Jean Valjean with a very powerful voice but surprise songbirds were Anne Hathaway who did well with the most well known song in the production ('I dreamed a dream') - excellently in fact and well deserved her Oscar - but Russell Crowe it seems also has a lovely warm voice and did well with his songs. Jackman and Hathaway were able to act and sing, which made their songs even more emotional but the best singer was definitely Redmayne as Marius, the character almost a mirror of Victor Hugo himself and his rendition of 'Empty chairs and empty tables' I didn't know I had that many tears left to cry! It's a lavish, grand production, and the Direction and cinematography was flawless and had done well to copy/use inspiration from the stage production.The film is unbelievable emotive, and the saving grace of some of the comic moments in the story/play were not so well done, and Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen weren't the comedy players they needed to be to lighten the mood and be laugh out loud funny. The scenes in the Inn and the wedding were lacking and the film therefore was overwhelmed with the tragedy. It's the sort of film you have to be in the right mood for as it's just not uplifting enough to be a happy watch. You don't always want to be sitting sobbing, and I cried a lot at this - the music was incredibly emotive.A superb epic film. Spectacle, emotion and outstanding performances.",8,1,2,5 January 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," a good film in terms of essentials but I don't understand the fuss
","A very good film but surprisingly unsatisfying even for a viewer who loves seeing commando types running around in combat gear, with throat mics and guns. The scene at the end, in the compound was the best bit - and very tense - but the rest was not ... something. A bit 'meh!' I don't see what all the fuss was about in terms of awards. The Direction (Bigelow) was excellent, faultless really, but I think the screenplay had something lacking. It wasn't memorable or gripping enough generally. I think that the characters were too inhuman and too shallow, they didn't really relate to the viewer (or vice versa) and I didn't much care for anyone to particularly care what happened to them. Didn't want any of the 'goodies' to die, wanted Bin Laden to be found but had seen the footage/reenactments in so many other programs that it was a bit old and unoriginal.A good film, to be sure, but not brilliant, and somewhat empty and unsatisfying. Well filmed though and acted, but I feel the actors were not utilised enough in terms of scope of personality.",6,0,3,24 October 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," brilliantly acted and directed; not for sensitive viewers
","This is a superb film, but it definitely deserves it's 18 rating; it is gratuitous, the language is very 'colourful' and there is a lot of nudity and drug use-a-plenty. Usually I'd not particularly go for a film like that but it is a biopic and based on the book by Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio). It's a man gets super-rich by nefarious means and goes a bit crazy kind of film; women, drugs, big boy-toys and all the trappings of the nouveaux riche, and then his downfall. It's a sort of morality tale, his lifestyle is meant to be seen as depraved and excessive (in a bad way) not admirable and the Director (Scorsese) and the writers make that clear as Belfort (and the other men too) unravels.DiCaprio and Hill were superb; DiCaprio was horribly good and Hill has in one film jumped his way up from a comedian to a serious character actor. It has, however, a good lot of humour as well as stressful points and also scenes in which you are incredulous. For all the nudity and sexual content, it isn't titillating just bawdy and sordid. It still astounds me that men behave in that way - Boiler Room's extended cut had a few similar scenes but not so bad as this. Boiler Room is actually a good comparison for plot although - as I said - Wolf of Wall Street is way more over the top. For all the scenes where you think 'oh goodness I shouldn't be watching this,' there are plenty where the actors show their grit and the Direction is so superb. It is the sort of film where you almost forget you are watching a film, you are so engrossed and just 'there' absorbed in the action. I did think it was a bit too long in terms of duration, some of the scenes went on a bit, and certainly the debauchery was too much. Yes it was a (watered down, apparently!) telling of a life story but the viewer doesn't need everything spelled out. Jordan Belfort was played as a horrible man who got his just desserts but that didn't detract from the humour and superior production of this film. I would be very careful who I recommended it to given it's content, certainly NOT those of delicate dispositions or under eighteens. Brilliant film though.",7,2,3,31 January 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Dracula epic film, faithful to the brilliant Bram Stoker classic
","Coppola's film tackled the original story so well, the book being one of my favourites of all time. Written entirely through the medium of letters and journal entries, it is an intimate tale that is spine chilling in it's intensity. It doesn't rely on gratuitous frighteners, but plays on all our deepest darkest fears, the things that go bump in the night and not being safe anywhere against this kind of threat, and losing our mortal souls.The film captured the feel and nature of the book well. With Gary Oldman in the titular role - a very talented actor - and he played it elegantly and with a lot of style. Winona Ryder played Mina/Elisabeta, his star-crossed lover. I've always admired her and she suited the period nature of this film, and I liked the semblance of innocence in her way of playing her character compared to her worldly friend Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost). There's a lot that was a little cheesy, and the acting wasn't the best - everyone seemed to play it a little hammy. Much was made of some of the English accents in the film (ie how bad they were) by Reeves and Ryder but I'm afraid I judge the Director for not picking up on them. There's a lot that's a bit silly in the film, and the accents weren't the worst of it. Even the great Hopkins (Helsing) was touched by the silly-stick and played up his role to the nines. In short it certainly wasn't a dry production as he also ramped up the arrogance and insanity of his role too. At the time of release much was also made of the bestiality scene between Dracula in his wolfman form and Lucy in the garden, I have to say she was brave to take on that! It's shocking, a little, the first time you see it but it's really not bad. The famous Renfield (Tom Waits) was cringeworthily gross, as the craven and mad slave of Dracula. Reeves as the long-suffering Jonathan Harker was not at his best in this, but how do you research walking into a client's home to find he's crazy beehive haired vampire? He comes across out of his depth in this, and I don't know why. He's well cast as Harker, though, he suits the period gentility and properness exceedingly well, but perhaps he was playing up his discomfiture about his character's predicament (justified!) - especially finding himself in bed with three blood-smeared wenches! So much of this film was great, though, despite the over-the-top acting, laughable at times, but it works.Very well. This story is frightening, but it's not in the way that typical horror movies are, and the humour helps you manage it, but there is also intense love and seduction in this story; it is mainly a love story after all. The poignant scene where Mina meets Dracula and a wolf escaped from the zoo walks in... lovely. So much deeper than cheap horror. Victorian sensibility had the Vampire at odds with God, his immortal soul lost to salvation. Prior to Stoker vampires were vile loathsome creatures but he made them magical illusory and a seductive beauty who tempted impressionable young ladies into his eternal death. The film gives room for the spiritual morality tale, accurately and with a sense of the hugeness of what it represented; Vlad Dracula turning his back on God as he felt he had been abandoned after losing his love. Finally, the music used in the film was very good - Love Song for a Vampire by Annie Lennox was superb - and the costumes were stunning, particularly the dresses Winona Ryder got to wear. It's a beautiful film, if you see past the dripping yowling toothy wenches and Monica Bellucci stealing babies.",7,2,3,5 December 2012
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not as good as I hoped but amusing
","You see trailers for Hail, Caesar! and you expect lots of 1950s high jinx on set during the last decade of the glory days of the Studio System. Lots of homages and nods to real Hollywood actors. Clooney plays the main actor cast in the film within film of the Crucifixion (good for Easter release) and the centurion at the base of the cross who says 'surely this man in the Son of God' etc. Brolin plays the Studio Fixer who dances around Press, covers up scandal and sees that everything runs smoothly. Clooney gets kidnapped. Channing does some entertaining Gene-Kelly-esque 'there are no dames' songs whilst looking like he has painted on cheekbones, cameos all over the place. Cohen Brothers' films are generally brilliant, and this is funny, but it's not as good as was expected. The laughs get tired, the film is a bit too long and when you emerge from the cinema you think, 'what was that really about?' The film is a weaving of small plots which are good viewing but are shallow. I expected more than the communist subplot and the confessional bookends of story underlining generally good guy in a challenging world. For all the stars, and kudos, it's disappointing and if it wasn't for the stellar cast, or the writer's status, I don't think this would have made it to the cinema... Funny, and a good date night film.",5,9,10,3 April 2016
Hitch," A very enjoyable rom-com with fun comedy performances
","I've seen this film quite a few times, and really enjoy it. It's a gentle, fun, funny film, where you don't have to think too much, and you feel good watching it. Perfect for a quiet night in with a cup of tea or a glass of wine (or whatever your poison).It's an ensemble cast film, although Will Smith (Hitch) is undoubtedly the star as he just always seems to carry himself that way. It's therefore a star-vehicle type film reminiscent of old films as there's nothing offensive, and it's light and fluffy - a real romantic comedy. And the comedy is real, and fairly original. The comedy timing between Smith and (Kevin) James has most of the best laughs, particularly where Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta) first comes to Albert Brenaman's Office door... the film, whilst a simple premise, is actually quite clever and an interesting look at dating psychology. A lot of the points made in it are true and it's nice to see a 'chick flick' dating movie from the man's point of view for a change. Usually it is the girls getting together saying 'why hasn't he called? doesn't he like me?' etc etc.Eva Mendes plays the female lead, a hard-nosed gossip columnist who has lost faith in love, I guess. I like watching her in films, she's a good actress and of course is very lovely to look at. Her and Smith seem to have good chemistry, especially in the comic moments. I am glad that Jennifer Lopez didn't get the role of Sara Milas as I don't think it would have been as funny, and the chemistry wouldn't have been - perhaps - as entertaining. Valletta's character is fun and not at all stuffy despite who she is supposed to be (also, I just noticed an interesting point in the trivia section about her character name) and how rich etc.There is a lot to laugh at in Hitch, and also admire. The look of the film is attractive, and a great advert for NYC, there's some great picturesque shots and the soundtrack - which is really good - adds to that. It's rather Hollywood in that sense, everything is bright and pretty and idealised, again like the old star vehicle romcom movies. Enjoyable, multi-watchable, laugh out loud funny and possibly educational if you pay attention. It looked like the actors had fun with the film, and that always adds to my enjoyment.",7,0,1,14 December 2013
Arrival," excellent example of 'aim for utopia' sci-fi
","Remember Abyss? Where the benevolent - but still threatening - aliens showed the human race that war was futile and we wept at the (cut in some versions) montage of awful things that the human race was capable of? Arrival was similar without being so dramatic.Amy Adams lead the film well. In all honesty she carried the film as the other characters (other than her daughter) didn't really have much of a look in. It was interesting seeing Forrest Whittaker play very much the second fiddle, although he played it very much to type. Other characters were more or less obsolete, with the exception of a few nagging mozzies flying around to provide a little tension and the necessary conflict, much of which was - like a mozzie - just in need of a sharp slap. She was excellent as Linguist Louise, very understated and sedate albeit a a little too 'monotone' and 'internal.' The whole film was a little laid back, never quite enough tension to feel any real threat, and the characters other than Amy weren't deep enough to really care about. That said, Jeremy Renner was nice, but it was never really explained exactly what his purpose was, or rather what input he achieved, in terms of the First Contact, and was in a subsidiary role to Louise.That all said, I loved the film and I really enjoyed how it weaved the convergent narratives neatly and beautifully and kept you guessing. I wasn't surprised by the twist, and had suspected as much, noticed the little clues, but it was still really well achieved. The story was clever, simple (premise) yet intelligently brought to the screen. I think the quietness brought a strength to the simplicity but I think there wasn't enough emotion or variety of activity to make the film truly epic; not enough tension in the international political scene, or from the aliens themselves. The teaching/learning scenes were cut too short/too staccato and too much was implied and glossed over, it was if the editor was too heavy handed and trying to go for intrigue, just omitted some of the plot. There was too much process that I felt needed to be put back in, not for explanation (the plot was clear) but for interest. The learning of the language, went from 'my name is...' to sentences without actually showing the process - it needed a little delineation, more explanation of the circles, as I was interested.Mention must be made of the SFX - reminiscent of Independence Day - and faultless. The aliens 'Abbott' and 'Costello' were excellent; their mode of communication beautiful and the real first contact was really quite special. The (for wont of a better word) 'space ships' that the heptopods arrived in were beautiful too and some of the best SFX were their departure and their existence and presence on the screen with helicopters/ships etc, and the gravity scenes were well done.Overall a watchable, beautiful and intelligent film, and whilst on the surface it seems perfect, and I don't need linear story lines or over-explanation of things, and it did what it was meant to do in terms of storytelling, I feel that it was missing something, the profundity of gripping emotion and heart-pounding tension. It had more scope but just fell a little short. Less is more, and I like how that is generally employed here, going against the grain of Hollywood overkill, and also how America weren't perfect, and China (the great Tzi Ma) were the heroes and leaders of the conclusion (with Louise of course). An awesome experience of cinematography that I would recommend.",7,1,5,26 March 2017
Prometheus," Even 3D, IMAX and Charlize's catsuit can't make it more than a 'meh'
","I was never a fan of the Alien series, but saw them; Aliens (the funny one) the best. This was my first IMAX experience and I wasn't overly impressed, and it was 3D which didn't add much. I gave it 6/10 and those points are mainly awarded to Charlize's catsuit. Sorry, also Logan's gaminess, Fassbender and Rapace's acting and the SFX (almost the entire film was CGI). The plot was silly IMHO and the only sensible character was Elba who was constantly saying 'lets get out of here!' I can't review really without giving spoilers but I can say the film left me feeling sort of empty (in part due to the unprecedented event of me not finishing my popcorn coz it was horrible) and underwhelmed. Because of the schlok-horror it needed comedy, and there wasn't much. Elba's 'love the one you're with' and asking Theron whether she wants to get laid was the comedy high point. Rapace was the phenomenal dogged female and carried the film's action and all the 'twists' I saw coming a mile away. Too many questions at the end. Overall, 'meh!'",5,6,15,4 June 2012
Despicable Me," Funny, witty and touching animation
","Despicable me is, of course, a children's film so the bad guy (who's the good guy) isn't actually that bad at all. The bad guy, who is the bad guy isn't really that bad either, so that's good (for children). There's little in this that children would find really scary and compared to the horribly sad portions of The Rescuers - for example - where Penny and her teddy were completely alone, the orphans (all three) in this were feisty, self reliant and rather well adjusted. It still had tender moments but didn't have the darkness of Disney.Gru voiced by Steve Carell was very well drawn, and performed. He had a whimsy about him, which made me think of Austin Powers, and his minions - the little yellow creatures that were the stand out stars of the film - are just so cute, each with his (or her) own personality. Jason Segal as the nemesis villain Vector was very funny and I thought he was voiced by Chris D'Elia such was the vocal range, so was impressed with Segal. Very funny. Like Disney and Pixar, the film is for children but there is plenty for adults and I didn't once think 'oh this is a naff children's film' but rather was immersed and entertained for the duration, captivated in fact.With the combination of the minions' antics and the little orphan girl Agnes and how adorable she was, and the silly plot to steal the moon, the crazy gadgets and immediate one-liners I loved every minute. It's not meant to be taken seriously and those critics who are saying how it defies the laws of physics and point out the 'goofs' are just far too sad. It's a cartoon, and a very good one at that and I think Illumination have Pixar in their sights in terms of quality and skill. Its a fun film for all the family, with a lot of heart.",7,0,1,30 June 2013
The Wolverine," A good sequel to the Wolverine/X-Men franchise
","I'm not a Marvel super-fan so am not as clued up as some, but do enjoy the stories... especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). For obvious reasons. This appealed to me because of the Japanese/Samurai/Ronin connection, that I find interesting. The storyline was more convoluted, to my way of thinking, than the other Wolverine film, and even some of the X-Men. The film is shown through a series of fantasy/dream shots and also flashbacks as well as up to date action interspersed and shows Wolverine to be vulnerable and a deeper character.Hugh Jackman's performance was superb; physical, emotional and powerful, and I have come to really appreciate Hiroyuki Sanada (47 Ronin, The Railway Man), a superb actor who has just 'popped up' in Western films recently. The other actors were a little laboured in their performances but I liked Tao Okamoto (Mariko) and Rila Fukushima (Yukio) despite this, and there was much in their performances that was impressive most spectacularly some of the fight scenes. The Samurai sword - Katana - was shown to good effect in the film in some amazing sword fights often katana vs adamantium blades. The two girls, especially Yukio were very good. There was some humour, but it was mainly drama and action, fairly predictable and I felt the film went on a bit too long. The SFX were mainly very good, but there were a few bits that were a bit less slick and a little silliness - a few goofs. It was however, an enjoyable hour or so and I wouldn't be averse to seeing it again.",6,0,0,16 February 2014
Signs," suspense, intensity, twists, humour and intelligence
","This is my favourite type of sci-fi thriller; whilst fantasy, and ultimately set to shock and scare, it is still brilliant in terms of it's content, script, conception and intelligence. It is not schlock, the violence and suspense are gripping and plausible, there's no 'silliness'. You commit to what is on screen almost immediately. M. Night Shyamalan (who has a small but pivotal role as well as writing and directing) is a genius of creativity. He doesn't spell the plot out for you as if you were stupid, as much American film/TV tends to, but a lot of background is outlined in the opening sequence before anyone has spoken a single word, just by paying attention. Informational conversation is realistic and whilst it informs the viewer it still makes sense in terms of the characters, so the viewer has to piece it together rather than being presented with it. Brilliant writing - can't praise that enough.Over all the film is fantastic, there's nothing that I can fault really. All performances are perfectly gaged; Mel Gibson is great, Joaquin Phoenix in perhaps my favourite role and he looks amazing ;-) and the two child actors Rory Culkin and the adorable Abigail Breslin were played naturally and just right. There are no massive bells and whistles in terms of big budget SFX, sets and contrivances, the film offers its 'kicks' on suspense and the less-is-more, almost for-the-stage, attitude to filming. It was filmed, by appearances, simply and often in the dark, using limited light to add tension. The musical score adds tremendous amounts of depth, drama and spook-factor and silence is used cleverly too. What builds a crescendo of dread is the narration given by television news reels, often on in the background, and that reporting adds realism to the plot:- You get a view of the outside world, and imagine what it would be like if anything like this happened. Some of the worst bits of the film are things you barely see but have you on the edge of your seat, just like Merrill (Phoenix) watching the TV, and you need to keep your wits about you if you are going to see all the connections as nothing is superfluous in this film it seems.The title, Signs, refers to the crop circles but also in the context of faith and belief, and the emotional roller-coaster in this film is based around Graham Hess' crisis of personal Faith and the element of predetermination or lack of coincidence in our everyday lives. It is both touching but also challenging, and as the film keeps you intimate with the action using up close shots and unusual focus on eyes, to draw you in, so you are brought to think about how you feel too as another onion layer. Whilst a very tense film, there are delightful smiles and laughs dotted throughout, and some moments of comedic laugh out loud genius (Phoenix has some great timing) and even having seen it before, it still doesn't fail to please, entertain and thrill on every level.",8,1,5,24 January 2013
Speed," this film defines the 'action' genre - it just doesn't let up!!!
","I saw this film SO many times at the cinema as many of my friends wanted to see it and I loved seeing the reactions of people to all the 'shockers.' Of course I bought it, and watch it quite a lot, and it bears up to repeat viewing even when you know what is going to happen next. If you haven't seen it yet, where have you been? Reeves, Bullock, Hopper and Daniels are the key players in this and are superb. Reeves - Jack Traven - the hot hotshot SWAT guy (oh the uniform!) who's a bit gung-ho daredevil 'deeply nuts' next to the brilliant Daniels - Harry Temple - calm and measured, very sensible partner, apparently the brains of the duo, Hopper - Howard Payne - is the bad guy - and that's not a spoiler, you find that out in the first ten seconds of film and he plays 'crazy not stupid' wannabe 'eccentric'' very well, and Bullock - Annie apparently has the surname Porter but I'm sure it's not mentioned in the film - the useful pretty suspended-license-passenger who drives the city bus and keeps it above 50! Great chemistry between Bullock and Reeves, and whilst you can see she's acting in places, she's a fabulous gentle foil for hard macho character and almost makes him see that people are frail as he's so used to throwing himself around. Amazing and poignant scene where Jack gives up for a short while, and she calms him... goosebumps. And more goosebumps later in the scene where he 'didn't have anywhere to be just then' and doesn't leave her ...The action doesn't let up. Cinema-goers squealed, jumped and hid their faces through this one, and everything about it is simply great. This and Point Break made Keanu Reeves an acceptable household name for men as well as women, as no man could feel embarrassed liking a film in which a guy hangs under the chassis of a moving bus! This is definitely a boy film but lots of girls seem to like it too, can't think for the life of me why!! Jan De Bont's Direction was excellent. I'd call him visionary for having the ability to keep the action so fast paced and every little thing just frays your nerves. It's tight. I almost regret seeing the extras on the DVD - once you've see how they do a stunt it's not quite the same. Special mention has to go to the composer of the soundtrack too, that da da da da da daaa pumped the action forward and added to the frazzle-ness of feelings as you watched as it heightened your expectation.Despite all the action, there's unusually a really good script with some laugh out loud humour, great one-liners - who can forget Reeves' epic first line in this? 'The Basement!' when he's still just the cocky-boy in the team, or the dialogue between Traven and Temple, 'Was it good for you?'... But the best line of the film has to go to Reeves' friend Rob Mailhouse (drummer in Dogstar), 'Bob, what button did you push?' as most quoted! Great seeing Alan Ruck (Cameron - Ferris Bueller's Day Off) in this with some funny lines too.",8,1,2,5 December 2012
Flight," Brilliant acting by Denzel - a powerful heavy film that isn't Hollywood-style redemptive
","Flight is superb. It's a dark treatise in alcoholism, desperation and addiction and Washington is superlative. He portrays Whip the pilot as both genius and attractive but also pathetic, broken and fallen. He deserved his Oscar nomination. The film is absorbing, engaging and completely compelling. I couldn't look away it was so gripping. Up to the last you didn't know how it was going to end up - you can see how it could have gone either way but he demonstrates a strength despite it all.Nadine Velazquez, always beautiful and engaging, for a small role showed commitment to character, bravery at such exposure (there is total nudity in this film) and her physicality on the plane was great. John Goodman was comic relief given the seriousness of the story, and was really amusing. Kelly Reilly who played Nicole was also brilliant - another exposing and vulnerable role and understated believability - a really likable character. Tamara Tunie (Snr Flight Attendant Margaret), Co-Pilot Brian Geraghty, Lawyer Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood from the Union and Adam Tomei as the despicable landlord were the back up players - all of whom were brilliant. Everyone brought their A-game ensuring that the film is nigh on flawless. I don't think I can fault it and it only loses points really for how depressing the film is. Despite the religious overtones which were uplifting to a point, and not too overplayed, it's a dark film and whether there is redemption and whether the outcome is good bad or controversial is the genius of the film. The end doesn't tie up loose ends entirely satisfactorily and leaves it open for discussion and personal opinion. Overall a superbly performed, written and produced film. It is real, gripping and immersing. I defy you to watch it and not want to discuss it. Brilliant film for adults, I may be a bit out of touch but I would have put it at an 18 not a 15 although all of the 'adult' bits are real, relevant and not offensive or gratuitous. Really powerful film.",8,2,4,30 July 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," a great sequel, powerful but not as character led as the first
","This is the second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy; a dystopic world where the difference between the rich and the poor is absolute and what society there is, is largely based on fantasy (in the capital) and hard graft and scratching a living in the rest of the country. The idea behind the story is fabulous, extremely clever and rather original but in the films I find the eccentric dress of the 'society' people really overly flamboyant. I know it's a symptom of the greater problem but it's not adequately explained and doesn't make sense to me. The costumes are a riot though!There are shadows of the Reich in the way that punishment is metered out for those considered insubordinate, and certain sections of society are considered not in favour, and the way that revolution is quashed is insidious and frightening; the scheming of the higher powers behind the scenes. The rallying behind the tributes Catniss and Peeta is moving and uplifting and whilst that is emotive, the characters of the tributes (other than Catness and Peeta) aren't really as in depth as in the first film. I'd not read this one first, whereas had for the original film so perhaps that made a difference. It was however highly emotional and gripping for the most part. I found my attention waining, and there being too much contrivance in the dome this time, less suspense with the challenges they face, and some plot contrivance was predictable. There was some unpredictability in the film, however, just when I was thinking I was frustrated with the length of one bit, there was a curve ball and the film was over! It's an impressive film, like the first, with huge spectacle and drama, fast-paced action, but rather disjointed in terms of pacing to begin with. I found that a little annoying, as scenes are short and choppy and clearly heavily edited as they are trying to pack a lot of narrative into film introduction. It means that you don't have time to emotionally invest. Most of the acting is good, with a few hammy performances but as in the last film Jennifer Lawrence stands out by a long way and steels every scene. Her emotional range is excellent, and I imagine that some of the scenes must have been quite draining. I didn't feel so connected to characters in this film, and as such I feel this one slightly less successful than the first. I wasn't so invested and there was a certain safe predictability.Overall a great entertaining film, well worth the watch if you enjoyed the first. It doesn't really stand alone, so you'd need background, but I would recommend it. It's a good sequel in that it doesn't disappoint after the first, and has a point to it, and is quite a visually enjoyable film but wasn't as gripping as The Hunger Games.",7,0,10,28 December 2013
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Excellent comedy with quite a lot of genius!
","This film is an 80s classic, as far as I'm concerned in the same category as things like Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Everyone has seen it (if not HOW?) and everyone loves it, films like Real Genius too. 'Excellent Adventure is comedy at it's best; entertaining, funny, cleverly written and stands the test of time as good clean fun. It's great to watch over twenty years later, and still surprises whilst feeling warm, fuzzy and totally familiar. The premise is simple; two slacker kids with big ambitions get some help from the future where their simple rock band have brought harmony and peace to the world, ended poverty and seen in a Utopian age. It's silly really and naïve in many ways but the writing is most certainly not. It's like Innerspace, funny, daft and if you pay attention you might actually learn something (pulmonary alveoli came up in my Biology A-level so a quote from Innerspace was quite useful by way of revision) and if you know something already some of the jokes in BATEA are actually quite brilliant - watch Freud's corn dog in the Mall ;-) The script is brilliant, with some great and memorable one-liners, it's family fun, relatively clean and innocuous (quite rare these days), and whilst the main characters are supposed to be slacker idiots, they are actually quite profound and are fairly good role models! Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves play the lead roles (Bill and Ted respectively) and clearly had a LOT of fun making this film (ditto the historical figures) and the chemistry between them was excellent - apparently they were/are friends in real life. They look like they are having fun, the characters had fun and the viewer has fun. It's a popcorn movie, and what films should be about; feel good and uplifting. It's a joy. Their facial expressions and physical comedy are so enjoyable; Reeves especially (more well known now) is just fabulous to watch, and makes me smile all the way through the film. George Carlin is great, and I particularly like the actors who play Napoleon, Freud and Socrates. The SFX whilst a little simple are good and do the job, and haven't dated that much (a bit), and the music/soundtrack is worth an honourable mention.It's not perfect but then neither is life, and at least this tries to make life a little bit better by existing. 'Be excellent to each other,' is a good maxim, and the moral behind this film is as bodacious and relevant today as it was in the 80s.",7,0,0,3 January 2014
Looper," Not 'this year's Matrix' and thankfully doesn't fry your brain like an egg
","Wow. Just come away from the cinema and my mind is buzzing with this film. Not so much my brain is 'fried like an egg' but my mind has been taken out for a 10K run and told to do fifty press-ups. This film is an exercise in intelligence, clever script, direction and plot. It was billed at 'this year's Matrix,' but this is not the case. However, I don't see this as a bad thing as to me the Matrix was all about the SFX, shock and awe; remember the first time you saw it? Or Terminator 2? The SFX blew you away. Here it's the plot, the characters, the writing and the direction which is foremost. More on a par with Inception (another Gordon-Levitt film, notice). The Director Rian Johnson pulled all the strings of a great movie together without resorting to the whole film being obviously CGI - SFX were subtle so the movement of the characters, the realism of the action rang truer. The long shots of the futuristic city were clearly CGI but that was fine, most of the 'real' action seemed not to be. It was good. Not detracting anything from Johnson (who also wrote the film) but it had Philip K Dick overtones for me, and a bit of Harry Bates.Jeff Daniels was lovely as ever, Bruce Willis didn't play Bruce Willis so much and I really enjoyed him in this. There was one time I expected him to say Yippee Kay-ay but he didn't. More power to him. He played with a lot of emotion in this and you did root for him. Probably one of the best things I've seen him in. Gordon-Levitt should get props for doing such an amazing impression of Willis - it's like he's channeling him! The prosthesis/make up to make him look more like Willis (or some CGI?) is quite disturbing but effective and incredibly well done. Emily Blunt was feisty, convincing, and jolly good in this rather physical role - really great. But the star of the piece and special mention needs to be made for child-actor (soon to be super star I predict) Pierce Gagnon. Never seen him before but even Dakota Fanning would get a run for her money with this little thespian - and not a precocious, child 'actor' sign or fakery in sight; you'd have thought he was doing all this for real. He was superb. Worth seeing the film just for him, and I'll never look at a child having a tantrum quite the same again! Wonderfully, Hollywood didn't get a look in at the end - was there a cliff hanger, wasn't there? Who knows. Brilliant. In short an incredible-watching, engrossing and exciting film. Tender, humorous, nerve-wracking, exciting, shocking and clever in equal parts.To sum up, Bruce Willis not playing Bruce Willis, Gordon-Levitt playing Bruce Willis and a young kid acting the pants of everybody!",8,1,4,17 October 2012
The Replacements," Fun, feel good and predictable, with miles and miles of heart
","I don't know much about American Football, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this film. Whilst it is primarily a sporting comedy - and there's a lot of laughs - it also has some serious point and Gene Hackman's presence adds gravitas. Apparently Reeves took a substantial play cut to get Hackman in the film and there's good chemistry (father/son) between the two. Reeves plays the film for drama and character and does a good job, bringing his famed physicality and dedication to character with incredibly dry humour (lovely comedy timing when he gets grass in his grill). The majority of the laughs come from the antics of the rest of the team, especially Rhys Ifans as the 'wiry' Welsh chain smoking kicker, and Jon Favreau the SWAT team psychopath! Great physical comedy and for an adult film with a high-school peer pressure feel, it's suitable for young adults with not too much bad language and the love interest doesn't resort to explicit bedroom antics despite having a Hollywood leading man. Reeves was well cast - quiet, a commanding presence and perfectly happy throwing himself around. Gene Hackman of course was brilliant, dry and witty and the perfect coach to a bunch of wannabe, has been, washed up 'scab' football players called in during a players strike. Brooke Langton (head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell) was really convincing and sweet. All great performances and despite it being predictable and a little cheesy it's great feel-good watching. Hey where else do you see Keanu singing Gloria Gaynor's I will survive and doing the electric slide??",7,4,6,10 July 2013
Cloud Atlas," an epic masterpiece film of a great book
","When I read the book, many moons ago, I didn't fully understand it, or I did, but was aware I was missing something. I looked forward to the film but was also - like most admirers of the book - anxious that it did it justice, and couldn't imagine how the pieces of broken stories would translate to film. What I didn't imagine was that the film would finish the stories, which I loved. The film and book together make a formidable entertainment experience and the film alone is simply spectacular. Using the same actors was an inspired decision, and each did their job brilliantly. I loved the make-up, styling and prosthetics employed especially the cross-nationality work. Critics have said that some of the prosthetics are like amateur detective disguises but I didn't have such an issue with that - though admit some were better than others. There are aspects where you have to suspend your disbelief, some of the CGI etc but taken in toto this film is an immediate classic, I am sure, original and groundbreaking and the SFX are in places jaw-dropping. The story itself spans centuries and is told through six separate narratives and each speaks of evolution (of character), freedom, integrity, love and belief. It shows that all through time we are connected, our stories intermingle and bring us forward in time and time is transcendent.The writing and direction is intelligent, witty and varied; there is love and passion, pain and suffering, honour and integrity, fear and prejudice and moments of comedy and also emotion. You may cry watching this film and you may laugh. It will make you think, stay in your mind and also you may learn something about human nature, and perhaps about yourself. The film is almost like a religious propaganda film, evangelical, written to advertise a belief system or faith, and perhaps that is just the passion that it was made with. All the actors were clearly incredibly committed to their roles, everyone was acting at 100%. I hope this film does well but I don't think it will matter if it doesn't get lots of gongs (despite fully deserving them). People are going to be against this film because of the story it tells, people may not understand it or agree with it's philosophy - it might be controversial. I think Tom Hanks' contribution in this film should be lauded, as he was superb. Hugo Weaving was also quite spectacular in some of his roles - I'll never look at Elrond the same way again. Jim Broadbent and Doona Bae were noteworthy, and Halle Berry, of course! It was such a big, well known cast, and everyone was so good.I recommend this film highly and would emphasise that seeing it at the cinema and the big screen does it justice.",9,1,3,24 February 2013
The Hangover Part III," Funny but not Hangover 1 Hilarious
","I think Hangover 1 was a comedy game-changer. Two and, now, three, just don't match it, there's no denying it. Whilst three was an adequate comedy, with quite a few laughs, in jokes and addenda to the first and second films, it's just missing something. I don't know what. The final Wolfpack trilogy sees the gang back together: Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug (Cooper, Helms, Galifianakis and Bartha respectively) pitting their wits against Chow (Jeong) and also a new character played by John Goodman.The gang are back in Vegas but also travel to Mexico, there's lots of high jinx, car crashes, crazy animal scenes, embarrassing scenarios and as always credit extras. Anyone who leaves straight away after the film misses the climax as with all of the trilogy. It's an entertaining film, well worth the view, and not regrettable by a long shot but it's missing something that would make it a great comedy rather than a good one. Perhaps it's that the first one had the element of surprise and it was so different. Cooper, again, is the star, the alpha wolf in the pack, and is more or less the straight man across from all the back and forth of Alan and Stu. Chow of course is off his head insane and he Jeong does that so well, but he's not as freaky as he was in the first two. Not so offensive, but still not vanilla, rude, crude and silly it's a giggle but it is not an exaggeration to say that it seems the writers have run out of laughs and ideas.Would recommend it, but go in knowing it's not as good as the first one. Don't have your hopes too high and you'll come out pleasantly surprised. Watch to the end.",6,0,1,1 June 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," the best of the Twilight films - but still not great
","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD). Out of the films, this was my favourite. As most with most of the films - and general comments translate across the franchise - there's not much to it but the interaction/rivalry between Edward and Jacob makes for fun watching, and often quite humorous. The increased interaction with the Quileutes and their mythologies is possibly the most interesting part of the entire five films and there's a lot of it in this film. Bella's increased to-and-fro with all the angst about her future is tiring as her reactions as no less stilted and limited than at the start. You'd think her character would develop. Edward at least has the excuse that he's dead! It's an entertaining film, a big, cinematic piece as with all the others with lovely panoramic scenes, but it's not great.",6,2,7,20 May 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," more of the good stuff
","What can you say about John Wick2? Well Wow. I really enjoyed it. Chapter 2 is still slick, dark and gritty. Keanu is still gorgeous, ovviamente, beaten up and the deadliest thing both sides of the Atlantic (this time) and whilst he is bullet proof he's still barely standing; as it's apparently just a few days after the first one finishes. The story is still simple; people want to kill him, he wants to retire and be maudlin over his wife, and pet his new dog, and so he has to stop them by killing them first. Thing is, in JW2, more people need killing – someone from his past calls in a marker (a promised favour). I had been itching to see JW2 since the first one left the cinema, and saw it on a Valentine's Day preview and wasn't disappointed. As sequels go, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the first, but it exceeded expectations by a long way. I loved it. Entertaining and exciting, some amazing kills by Reeves and his physicality again proved to be awesome; but whilst it's as good as the first one it doesn't have the emotional element or the more intimate settings and direct threats to his life. I say direct, I should say the whole film is a direct threat to his life but it's not so personal. Somehow. The body count is like a first person shooter video game. If wall to wall violence isn't your thing, this film isn't for you. Reeves says more, and the scene is changed from NYC to Rome, and there's more story in terms of the 'high table' underground royalty and the wider net of the Continental Hotel world; the Sommelier (awesome scene with Peter Serafinowitcz) and the Jewish bank vaults, the tailoring service etc as he prepares for his mission, but something of the original's slick noir, graphic novel feel and look is lost. Ian McShane is still wonderful as the Continental NYC 'King' and Lance Reddick as the Concierge, Charon providing some very dry comic relief, and John Leguizamo puts in a reprise of his actual mechanic character – as opposed to a 'Mechanic' like John himself. It's less subversive, and whilst watching the first one was like an entrée into a dark world, a clandestine peep, this one feels like it's all in the open and everyone knows about it.The Italian bit is wonderfully showy and reminded me of the Vampire genre, but you have to contemplate how many hit men/women there are in the world that you can have a monarchy, a seeming government and entire community that large – and the Vatican is in on it – and it would appear that the whole population of NYC are trained assassins. It's more of the spectacle than the first and that was a negative for me. It is John Wick on a bigger scale sequels don't usually manage that (Terminator 2 is clearly the stand out exception) but this really does, but as I've said, it's bigger at a cost. It lost something in translation. As said, it's bloodier than the first. Some of the splatter in close up kills in the first were shocking, but in Chapter 2 almost unnoticed in the carnage left in John's wake. At one point in the catacombs of Rome I wondered whether it wasn't all CGI as there were so many bodies being dispatched and you barely saw them and I got a bit bored – the scene went on too long and I started thinking it was all getting a bit silly. But then there are a few kills and scenes which were brilliant – and made audience members exclaim – the pencil scene (yes, he does it again with a pencil), the sumo Japanese guy, and the scene on the NYC metro with Common and the 'professional courtesy' were very good to watch. Actually all Common and Reeves' fight scenes were very good, and the stunt men used were fantastic (I know Reeves does most of his stunts but I'm sure not for the stair falls). I really enjoyed it. Easily as good as the first but different. Not as good overall, in the same way, but along the same lines. Some may think it better but either way it is very good cinema viewing – it can fill a big screen – and a must see if you like this sort of thing. Direction was good, clever, and trying to capture the artiness of the first, and doing a pretty good job but for me, it was a little too fantastical – stepping over the border from thriller/action to dark-fantasy. As with the first, it doesn't explain anything, you are dropped into the world of Wick and you have to find your own way. It still doesn't explain who he is but there is another shower scene where you see the tattoo hinting at his past. There are even hints to Reeves' career past as well; Laurence Fishburne on set with Reeves for the first time since the Matrix and they exchange a quote from the franchise. I am trying to think whether Reeves and Common (previously in Street Kings) have the same thing 'exigent circumstance' or something. I will see it again before it leaves the cinema.",7,3,8,20 February 2017
Warm Bodies," the strangest adaptation of Romeo & Juliet I've ever seen - fun zombie romance!
","As loose Shakespeare adaptations go, this could be the most unusual; zombies and humans as opposed to the montagues and the capulets. This was another success for Nicholas Hoult, who is 'so hot right now,' and he was endearing, engaging and heart-warming in this as the zombie with a soul who falls in love with the girlfriend of the guy's brains he just ate, and got to know her through the guy's memories. She lives in the post-zombie apocalypse world, and her father is the general/leader of the army who is protecting humanity and obliterating the zombies outside of the city.R (Hoult) is the narrator of the film, with his inner thoughts that are still quite human. As he gets to know Julie, form a bond, he becomes more human again. Yes it's predictable, and rather fairy-tale-esque, a morality tale, but that doesn't detract from it's cute, romantic, funny and pleasing storytelling. It's definitely a feel good film, with a lot of heart. R reminisces about a time when people were together and connected, before they were zombies, and you see a flashback to people isolated all on their phones not communicating at all... poignant, perhaps suggesting that in the digital age when we are all connected but insular we are like zombies walking around in our own little earphoned worlds.Really enjoyed this, great special effects, stunts and make up and the CGI of the 'bonies' - the too-far-gone zombies who have given up the last of their humanity - was pretty good. John Malkovich in an unusual role of him, was good of course, and Teresa Palmer was also convincing and a sympathetic character as Julie. The viewer immediately is drawn to the gentle humour of R and he's just so adorable! Analeigh Tipton, Rob Corddry and Dave Franco were also good... Rob Corddry very good, actually, as the M the best zombie friend of R. Cory Hardrict - Kevin, one of the soldiers - was rather yummy! I recommend this, it's good clean fun; an improbable love story where true love conquers all, including being a corpse. A good zombie film for a girls night in or a romantic evening!",7,2,6,21 February 2013
The Godfather," acting masterclass. classic film.
","The Godfather, is most people's favourite film, and arguably one of the best films ever made. However, I only saw it in 2015 for the first time, so my impression of it is different to those who have grown up with it. I thought the film was brilliant, some really powerful performances and many huge stars now in their youth; Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and James Caan. The film has not aged well, but is still gripping and interesting, and in place visceral and emotional. James Caan as the protective older brother was memorable but of course Marlon Brando stands out as the much parodied, copied and admired main character to whom everyone defers. As I said, the film has dated and his prosthesis padded mouth doesn't look so good as I imagine it did when first released, and the make-up on Pacino was also distractingly bad. The film jumps forward in time quickly, and doesn't explain anything, as films are wont to do more latterly, which is refreshing, and the plot is complex enough to require full attention, and whilst it's not a laugh a minute 'enjoyable' film, or about subject matter which is pleasant, is bloody and violent, it is worth watching and certainly one of cinema's most brilliant masterpieces. I think my impression of this film is lessened by the fact that I didn't see it for until now so didn't have the loyalty to 'The Family' that longtime watchers have, when they've grown up with it, but it was amazing to finally see the original from which many other films have taken their cue or inspiration.",7,0,3,28 November 2015
