The Benchwarmers," This movie ROCKS
","This movie was 'AMA-ZA-ZING'! ha ha I had heard good things about it but in all honesty the movie was better than I expected, you know how you have the 'ugly laugh' that you only do around family and close close friends.. well I did my 'ugly laugh' out in public because of this movie, that should tell ya something!Watch it and Enjoy.. Hats off To Nick Swardson, Rob Schneider, David Spade and Jon Hedder (Napoleon Dynamite) for a terrific film, the comedic timing and expressions and characters were fantastic!PS. don't drink anything because YOU WILL spit it out and make a mess!",10,1,3,17 September 2006
