Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Super funny good time movie!!!
","If you like Da Ali G Show, you will love Borat! This movie is a must see for all fans of Da Ali G Show. I laughed so much during this movie. Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely brilliant. He has such great insight and the movie is filled with hilariously executed social commentary. Don't worry though, there is plenty of 'stupid' humor thrown in for good measure. I absolutely love the way he refers to normal everyday things in such a way that you have to really listen to figure out what he means. Then you realize what he is referring to and you have a funny time explosion of laughter.I can not wait for Sacha Baron Cohen to make another movie. I highly recommend Borat! if you need a good laugh, or thirty. In fact, I am going to see it again right now!",10,1,12,29 November 2006
