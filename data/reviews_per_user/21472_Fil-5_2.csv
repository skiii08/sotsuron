Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas proves his brilliance
","The Phantom Menace, Episode 1 in the Star Wars series.  Not the best movie, but not a bad one.  And regardless, this movie is just another indication of the amazing brilliance of writer/director George Lucas.
Think about it; what is your biggest complaint about this movie? For most people, it's the fact that it is just too childish.  But how many of you actually went to see it in the theatres?And that is why he is so ingenious.  Mr. Lucas already knows he has a massive audience in the age group of 20-80, I mean a lot of us grew up on this movie.  But this movie he did something different.  He aimed it (at least partially) at the kids.  And by doing so, he has gotten a whole new generation addicted to the Star Wars extravaganza.  He may have upset a few of his original hard-core fans, but they won't swear off Star Wars because of it.  And in the mean time, he has created a whole new dichotomy of Star Wars fans.Answer me one more question:  Even if you hated Phantom Menace, are you still going to go see Episode 2?  Exactly.",Null,1,2,21 July 2001
Lilo & Stitch," One of the best movies in Disney history.
","Disney made this movie fearing that the animation genre was dying, being replaced with the often more popular CGI genre.  In response to this fear, Disney made a move they have never tried before.  They made a movie that can only be referred to as vulgar, violent and somewhat abusive.  And guess what....  It Works!!!  Disney has finally let go of their attempt to make kid friendly, childish movies which spawned disappointments like Dinosaur, and moved in the direction that Shrek made: lets make a movie that parents can enjoy as much as their children do. The result is one of the funniest, most heart-warming movies in the long line of Disney pictures, one that puts together a perfect blend of comedy, sorrow, and warmth.  This movie is definitely one I'd recommend. I got into this movie with a special screening pass, but I'd more than happily pay to see it again...even at today's ridiculous prices.9/10 if not higher.",Null,1,1,20 June 2002
