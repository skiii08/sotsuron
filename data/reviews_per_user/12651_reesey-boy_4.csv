Blade Runner 2049," Worst hour of my life
","So I am always one to give films a try and ill watching anything despite the reviews. This is also my first review on IMDB. With an overall rating of 8 I had high expectations for this film.Ryan Gosling is normally a favourite of mine but his character in this does nothing to engage the audience. Is bland and boring. After an hour and a half I could not tell you of anything excited that happened in this film so I turned it off. I always read reviews saying not to bother with a film and I watch it anyway but seriously, do not watch this. Literally just nothing exciting happens and the character played is so slow and boring.",1,4,7,30 December 2017
Elf," Incrediable Christmas film
",Amazing Christmas family film. Have watched this every Christmas for last 10 year's!,10,1,4,17 December 2018
A Quiet Place," Anyone rating this 10 must be crazy
",Average film. Wasn't at all tense or scary. Having said that you could tell everyone in the cinema was trying not to make any noise! Worth a watch when it comes out on a cheap DVD but do not waste your time going to the cinema for this one. Interesting story but also very predictable.,4,0,2,19 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ignore the haters
","I saw this very recently and thoroughly enjoyed it, yes the plot has floors and yes there are un answered questions from the previous film but when you take that out and just enjoy it as a star wars film its great. Ignore the haters, give this film a watch and enjoy a great Star Wars movie.",8,1,3,30 December 2017
