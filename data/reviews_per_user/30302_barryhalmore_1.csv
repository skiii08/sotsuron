It," Unreasonable violence and CGI
","Don't get me wrong, several scenes including the very first one were masterpieces of gory horror but bluntly beating the life out of a terrifying monster pretty much killed the fear factor towards the end. Then again it was refreshing to see a modern adaptation of a classic horror novel with children playing the lead roles. Jaeden Lieberher's performance was above average and not being able to recognize adult actors is a very positive attribute these days. Having double checked my apartment for unnatural creatures last night I'd strongly recommend watching 'It' in case you're one of us enjoying disturbing horror flicks that spawn butterflies in your stomach. Overall a great candidate for the best horror film of 2017.",7,1,9,10 September 2017
