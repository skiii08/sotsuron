Hereditary," Good
","It slowly progress and it takes time for something big to happen, but at the end there's explosion. You need to watch everything, to remember the smallest details, everything is important and has a meaning. If you dont know anything about Paimon, you'll need a little research after the film to understand it completely. 
Somewhere in the middle I thought I'll be disappointed, but it all came to it's place and it's definitely worth watching.",10,3,6,3 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Ohhhh no
","This wasn't good at all. It was cringy and I couldn't connect with the characters. It seemed like parts of the film have been missing, that they skipped something, I don't know how to describe it. It was definitely leaking something and that resulted in this mess. Breadly was mumbling the whole movie, Gaga's acting wasn't on point, a lot of flaws here. The end could have been touching if the rest of the movie was at least ok. I'm disappointed and surprised that it is this well received. But hey, we can't all have the same tastes I guess...",3,2,6,27 January 2019
Mr. Nobody," It could've been better
","I like the idea, not the execution. It's too long and too boring for me. There are similar films that are far better done.",6,2,2,19 October 2018
The Witch," I'm not sure what I've watched
","It was hard and disgusting to watch this. There is a chance that I didn't get what this movie is actually about, but I really don't want to watch it again.
Give it a chance but be prepared for a lot of nonsense and horrific scenes (I'll never forget that crow, freaking disgusting).",3,2,3,3 October 2018
Cloud Atlas," Soooo good
","This was a true brain exercise. There is a lot going on and it's not easy to follow, in every time they change just enough to get you confused. Me and my friend had to talk about this film and connect all dots because it's quite hard to comprehend everything wile you still watching. I loved it, but it's not for everyone, so I can understand why some people are not happy with it. It's quite philosophical and intriguing film when you understand it's basic idea.
I definitely recommend you to watch it.",10,2,5,18 October 2018
Green Book," Must watch
","This film is such a surprise for me. After watching Blakkklansman I was expecting similar propaganda in this movie, but that's not the case. It is tasteful and touching depiction of the friendship between two people that are more similar than they think in such specific time period.I loved Viggo's performance, he brought just a right dose of humor and seriousness to this role. It was pleasure watching him.Also, great performance by Mahershala, and so important messages delivered by his character.This is one of the best films nominated for this year's Oscar. Definitely worth watching, especially during holidays.",10,2,3,15 February 2019
