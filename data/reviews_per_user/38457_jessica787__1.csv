The New World," They don't make many like this one.
","I know there are many mixed feelings about this movie but after leaving I felt it was very satisfying. The storyline was unique, actors-realistic and scenery/cinematography was pleasing. It is however one of those movies that you either like it or hate it. It's not recommended for those who need strong story lines or plots to be captivated by a movie. Great break-through role for Q'Orkianka Kilcher who for being only 15 does very well as Powhatan's prized daughter Pocahontas. I also enjoyed watching the way some Tribes lived in the 17th century, free from many of the disturbing traits common in the Americas. There were (I felt) a few loose ends but nothing serious. In the end I was happy with our choice in watching this movie.",7,3,7,25 February 2006
