The Blair Witch Project," About what I expected.
","I just watched this movie on VHS hoping it would live up to the hype surrounding it. It did not, and I don't know if it could have. This movie did not scare me at all. I was never able to forget that this was all a big trick being played on me. Once you know that the film you are watching is not what it is being presented as, the scare is gone. The acting is not bad; however, it is not good enough to make me believe in the characters. When one of the townspeople mentions a cable special about the Blair Witch, and knowing that this special was just a PR stunt, I could not from that point allow myself to be drawn into this movie. This movie bored me from start to finish and I have no desire to see it again.",Null,0,0,28 October 1999
