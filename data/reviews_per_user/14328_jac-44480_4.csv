Deepwater Horizon," Pointless Documentary with lots of explosions
","A movie that focuses on a single binary event- the Deepwater Horizon explosion. The film avoids delving into the political, social, or ecological ramifications of the disaster and its aftermath. This is a major disappointment for me. The directors could have made so much more of this movie. The film stars Mark Walhberg as a technician who works on the Deepwater Horizon. Wahlberg's character has no special skills that are apparent or ever explained. He has no interesting dialogue. He sits around surfing the web and chatting with his wife half of the movie. When things go south, he suddenly morphs into a super hero with super human skills who saves lives. But I digress. Wahlberg's role in Deepwater Horizon is virtually identical to 'The Perfect Storm'. He has a Suzy-homemaker wife played by Kate Hudson who sits at home watching soap operas all day worrying about him while Wahlberg is out at sea trying to earn a paycheck for his family. It was like they carbon-copied his character from 'The Perfect Storm', but changed the scenery to an oil rig. Other stars include Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Gina Rodriguez. Russell is the good-guy rig supervisor who the workers love. He is at odds with Malkovich, a BP executive, who only cares about corporate profits at the expense of safety and the environment. The most passionate scene of the movie involves a heated exchange between Russell and Malkovich, but this exchange is done awkwardly. It is not classic Kurt Russell. Both Russell and Malkovich have bizarre accents that are difficult to understand. Russell tries to speak with a Southern accent and Malkovich uses a New Orleans Creole accept. Both work poorly. It is nearly impossible to understand what they are saying, but you get the gist of their dispute. Gina Rodriguez's character is also a tech of some sort. There's really not much else to say on her. She is boring like Wahlberg. The other characters in the movie are background props. They are cannon-fodder. The characters do all sorts of tests that are never explained to the audience. You have no idea what is going on and it is never explained what caused the failure. The action scenes as the disaster begins are well done. Lots of blood, shrapnel, etc. There is a scene that looks like it was stolen right out of the movie 'Titanic' where a worker is blown off the side of the rig into the sea and hits a propeller of some sort before bouncing off to his death. Overall, the movie is an easy paycheck for Wahlberg and Russell. They are asked to do very little as the film focuses more on explosions. With a letter effort, the writers could have added some scenes in the beginning and the end about the politics and environmental consequences.",4,1,2,23 December 2017
Dunkirk," Disappointing Snoozefest
","I am a huge WW2 movie buff and enjoy pretty much anything WW2 related. However, this movie was a letdown of epic proportions. Pearl Harbor set a low-bar for WW2 movies, but this movie was actually worse. At least Pearl Harbor had action, comedy, and character development, albiet cheesy. Dunkirk was reported to have a 150 million budget. How? Where did the 150 million go? It surely wasn't spent on actors. To buy positive reviews? That is the only plausible explanation. The evacuation of Dunkirk was a major desperate battle involving over 400,000 British and French troops, thousands of planes, and hundreds of ships. This movie fails to capture the magnitude or scale of the battle. No historical or educational context is given other than brief exposition at the beginning and end. In total, we are shown only 5 planes, 3 British destroyers, and maybe a few thousands ground troops lined up on the beaches. The enemy is rarely seen and there are no fight scenes. 95% of the movie is British troops standing around moping on the beaches. The action scenes involve ships sinking and troops diving overboard. It is like Titanic on steroids. The movie focuses on 3 ridiculous subplots that are not worthy of explanation. All characters are nameless and undeveloped. The ground troops are lead by a skinny coward who repeatedly tries to skip the line to escape. The armada of private boats that arrives towards the end involves maybe a dozen vessels. It looks like a small town boat parade festival. One of the faceless, nameless pilots is revealed at the end to be Tom Hardy. He makes a brief 15 second cameo with no dialogue before being captured by faceless enemy. What the movie lacks in characters, dialogue, and action, it attempts to make up with constant eerie musical scores that are like running fingernails on a chalkboard. The music is supposed to create a suspenseful gloomy atmosphere, but becomes an annoyance and overshadows the conversations. Half of the dialogue is barely intelligible. I'm American and I understand British is a different language practically, but that wasn't the problem. The fact that the enemy is never shown is a huge disservice to this movie. It would have been interesting if they showed the perimeter battles and thousands of planes fighting in the skies. Instead all we hear are distant gunshots and a few occasional mortars. They could have shown the opposing forces and strategies of each side.",2,1,6,13 May 2018
Independence Day," So Cheesy its Good
","Aliens invade Earth's atmosphere using giant space ships with impenetrable defense shields. Modern human military technology is no match against the advanced space ships. As the aliens make final preparations, humans scramble for alternative solutions to prevent annihilation.This movie is an action-comedy featuring an ensemble cast, and a script that is filled with clich√©s, parodies, and some of the cheesiest dialogue in movie history. This movie is ultra-jingoistic with blind patriotism being a main theme throughout. Although extremely silly, the cheesy dialogue is highly quotable with numerous one-liners that keep the viewers constantly entertained. The special effects are outstanding, and there are plenty of intense action scenes with lots of explosions. Despite the ridiculous plot holes, Independence Day does not take itself seriously and makes fun of itself at every chance.The two lead characters are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Smith portrays a macho-military tough guy while Goldblum is a stereo-typical computer nerd who uses intellect to solve complex problems, but can barely tie his own shoes. Both leads give strong performances with plenty of memorable one-liners.Perhaps even better, the main supporting cast played by Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, and Harvey Fierstein. These three deliver some of the movie's funniest moments and quotes. Quaid plays a doofus crop-duster who suffers from PTSD and claims he was abducted by aliens. Now he wants payback against the aliens for his past experiences. Judd Hirsch plays the stereo-typical Jewish father of Goldblum's character, and the dialogue between the two features endless dry humor. Hirsch plays Goldblum's selfish, helpless, panicked co-worker who's natural response to the news of impending doom is to contact his lawyer.Then we have the government characters to include Bill Pullman as President, Robert Loggia as head military general, Adam Baldwin as second officer, James Rebhorn as CIA adviser to the President, and Brent Spiner as a crazy government scientist who works in Area 51. Spiner's character is particularly funny as he frequently goes off on long tangents about scientific stuff that nobody else understands. Other supporting roles, particularly the ones played by women, are not very funny or memorable, although I liked Margaret Colin as Goldblum's ex-wife and their constant bickering.By the end of the movie, all of these characters are forced to work together to come up with solutions on how to defeat the aliens. The final cigar-scene shared between Smith and Goldblum is a classic moment, where both characters display excellent chemistry for two guys with polar opposite personalities. Another highlight of the movie is Bill Pullman's impassioned speech to the troops and pilots, which is a remarkable moment for a character who is otherwise boring.",8,1,1,16 January 2017
The Nice Guys," Worst movie I've ever seen
","Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I gave it 2 stars out of 10 because of the girl who plays the daughter. She was excellent. There were no other redeeming qualities to this movie.Note to Directors: Russell Crowe is not a comedian and should never be cast in a comedy again! He and Gossling tried to be like Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers, but it failed miserably. Their prolonged back and forth banter was not funny and provided no comedy. Crowe was completely miscast. He is too serious and monotone, and lacks any comedic whit to pull off the part. Gossling fared only slightly better, but had no chemistry with Crowe.There was little situational comedy to offset the horrible dialogue. The attempts at comedy were slapstick with Gossling acting like a goofball, or with the teenage daughter reciting graphic pornographic acts in front of adults. Apparently, the writers thought this was hilarious to have a teenage girl speak like that. The movie seemed like it was 3 hours long. It dragged on and on and would not end. It was boring and tedious.I hope that the teenage girl's career isn't ruined by this film. She really impressed. Otherwise, save your precious time and do not waste it on this terrible movie.",2,3,7,3 February 2017
