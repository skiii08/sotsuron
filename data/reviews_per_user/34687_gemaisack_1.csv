The Avengers," Action without character is CRAP - quote Sam Peckinpah
","And that is exactly what we have with The Avengers. Sam Peckinpah, the master director of mayhem, action, and blood-letting who broke down these Hollywood barriers in film over forty years ago recognized the necessity of character development for any action to have emotional meaning. As technically well-done as the Avengers is in all the action sequences, it lacks any human emotional qualities. Nobody but the most simple-minded that like mindless explosions and destruction will find any interest in this movie. A MOVIE is simple entertainment that will not past the test of time. A FILM is a work of art with quality and intelligence that will endure through the years. The Avengers is a 2-1/2 hour movie.",3,16,34,1 June 2012
