First Man," Strikes a Beautiful Tone
","Acting couldn't have been better. This was an amazing film, certainly not only for what it is, but what it does. Let us be reminded of America's accomplishments, sacrifices, and future.

La La Land," A must-see for musicians and artists

I loved the film.",10,6,7,27 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," Amazing story telling, amazing film
","I love musicals.
The movie stops at multiple times in the film, the music is there, your ear and heart turn. And you listen. You hear the characters thoughts being sung, and you learn.
Because music is insanely amazing. dm",9,1,2,13 May 2018
Annihilation," Trippy in odd ways
","Annihilation has good acting, and a unique and intriguing plot- -though troubling at the same time. All in all I wasn't tremendously happy with the message of the movie. Which takes from its rating because good art is when good form and good content fuse together. dm",7,1,3,27 April 2018
