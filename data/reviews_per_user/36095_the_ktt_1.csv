Requiem for a Dream," Four people taking drugs...
","I watched this yesterday and i got a feeling i just didn't get the message. Four people are starting to get into an drug addiction by taking more and more drugs... When they get addicted they also get desperate as its usually the case... and thats all!So i don't know why this movie in on top 250. Maybe drugs taking is so popular? Maybe people that have never taken a drug before want to see how its like? For me is was just boring. For me it could be about four slim people eating chips until they get fat.Acting and Directing was great, especially Ellen Burstyn. Camera was a bit shaky trough, but i guess that is a kind of style (right?).Overall this movie for me was just mediocre.",6,1,2,28 November 2006
