National Treasure: Book of Secrets," boe_dye's secret review
","I really wish i could have given this movie more stars...What the main problem turned out to be, at least for me, was the fact that it just kinda jumped in. it was near a carbon copy of it's predecessor.Now don't get me wrong, it was an enjoyable movie that had many laugh out loud scenes. and it also did include a bit of masonic tradition as did it's aforementioned predecessor (i almost choked on my popcorn when the mentioned albert pike...).However what it had an abundance of puzzles... it lacked in character development.Now don't get me wrong, i am not looking for serious character development in a film such as this, that would be stupid. but in many cases it almost seemed as if this was an alternate version of the first one.One thing that kinda annoyed me was Ed Harris' antagonist character. he made no sense. now i know and understand the need for bad guy/ good guy conflict in a Disney film. however, harris' character just made no sense, and was really useless to the over all story.In one breathe he literally went from bad guy, to sorry about all this now he's a good guy, to bad guy, to just misunderstood and whiny.At least with Sean Bean's character in the last film you knew where you stood with the guy...All things aside, it was a decent film. My wife and I, including my bestest friend in the whole world next to my wife, enjoyed it.And while it was nearly a carbon copy duplicate of the original, and it did fall short of the original, it was worth seeing in theatres. Perhaps had the story been a bit more solid, and the bad guy being at the very least consistent, and the dialogue not seemed like dialogue that was left on the cutting floor from the first one, i would have given it more.And i probably will buy it when it comes on DVD, not because i have the need to keep collections and buy it just because it is a sequel, but because i did enjoy enough to want to watch it again.",8,4,7,24 December 2007
Blade Runner 2049," Stunning: An aural and visual experience
","The best way to start off with understanding Blade Runner is to point out that it is not for the casual sci-fi goer. This isn't Firefly, or Doctor Who, or whatever flavor of the month generic cosplay, comic-con, fanboy chic pseudo wannabe nerds get excited about. You have to be patient, you have to pay attention, you have to be intelligent and understand the themes that it is trying to present. You can't be playing it in the background or be distracted by your phone -- you are either watch, or you waste your time.This is deep sci-fi that envelops you and challenges you with a deep and engrossing story. It builds the world in a way that takes time and patience. It is a labor of love, and you can tell simply by it's use of models and miniatures, and not relying on CGI gimmicks (though there are elements of CGI, it is more like makeup on an already beautiful woman, and not lipstick on a pig).The other wonderful thing about this film is that you don't have to know or understand anything about the previous Blade Runner as this movie is it's own entity. It's not a sequel, at least not directly, but more on the order of what The Next Generation was to The Original Series.Unfortunately there is an element that does pull one out from the fantastical world, and that is Jared Leto. Leto is hit or miss for me, and while he is pretty to look at and I very much do enjoy 30 Seconds to Mars, his portrayal of Wallace was rigid and forced. David Bowie was originally slated to portray Niander Wallace however Bowie's untimely demise put a small hiccup in that plan. I almost feel that they should have replaced Bowie with an older British fellow, maybe a Peter Capaldi or even better, Jude Law, instead of Jared Leto who perpetually looks like he is 20 to play someone who has seen some years.I'm not terribly surprised that this movie did not break box office records; I believe world wide it broke a little more than even. In a culture where you almost need to have political statements, social justice, and lens flares just to keep people's attention for more than 10 seconds, how do you sell a masterpiece when all people are used to is pop-art? To be sure it did not 'do well', however I can almost guarantee that in 30 years no one will be talking about today's new Star Wars or Marvel Movies, but like the previous Blade Runner 30 years prior, people will still be talking about this and that is what makes a classic, that is what separates consumers and connoisseurs.",10,4,12,24 October 2017
The Incredible Hulk," boe_dye sez: ENOUGH WITH THE P'OEd CGI SHREK ON Steroids ALREADY!
","Honestly, that's what kills this movie, and the previous one before that. Yeah it wasn't as artsy as the first one, but I actually liked the first one better for it's believability factor as opposed to this one which was just plain silly.And that's really what deep sixed this film for my was the CGI. I could have dealt with Norton's Banner...Okay that's just not true, he wasn't good for this part at all. And Liv Tyler played basically the same airy whispery voice role that she plays in all her films minus LOTR...But when oh when, and yes this is a pipe dream, will Hollywood stop using CGI on everything known to man? Honestly, that's why Hulk movies will always fail is because once the puny human banner goes bye bye, angry cartoon Hulk smashes...No emotion whatsoever in the character. His rage makes me want to laugh because it's so fake and engineered.At least when Ferrigno did it in the 80's he looked more believable then this stuff.Yeah it was campy, yeah it was basic, but it had so much more feeling in it then what we get today.All the hulk is anymore is a multimillion dollar Shrek meet's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Honestly the only way to save the hulk is this: Put down the computers, put down the animation. Find a good makeup/costume designer and some super huge steroid head body builder, and go to town.It works with the Thing in FF. It works in Hellboy. It can work here very good here.In the end, this movie left me bored, and not caring less what happened in the 'surprise' left open for a sequel finale'.",2,8,15,20 July 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," my nose is already broken...
","I remember when this movie came out in theaters that my wife and I had wanted to see it, but for some reason every time that we had full intentions of seeing it, we just never did.So my father bought it on DVD when it came out.Was I disappointed that we DIDN'T see it in theaters.This movie was so well executed (no pun intended). It relied solely on acting, and dialogue, and plain good old fashion story telling. No big special effects, not jump up and down in your face action, just good story telling.The best part was, there was no scene stealing. Everyone complemented everyone so well. Too many movies come out where instead of it being a movie, it becomes a 'fill in name of big actor movie'.So there really isn't anything bad that I can say about this movie, so I will leave you here to ponder my thoughts. My wife and I enjoyed it, and therefore so should you.......................................................................................or not 8^P",10,7,10,30 August 2007
The Big Lebowski," boe_dye sez: it wasn't funny, it wasn't not funny, it wasn't much of anything really
","Certain movies you can sort of understand why they are cult classics, other films such as this one, seem to be funny and intelligent because someone said it was funny and intelligent and therefore must be funny and intelligent.I suppose you could find deeper meaning in this, or perhaps the meaning was right there on the surface. But like many of the Coen Brothers films that I have watched I either like them or I don't.The ones that I liked usually have a strong story behind them, the ones that I don't like seem to be more of a 'day in the life of' story about people who really don't seem to matter and about events that no one really cares about.Maybe there is some type of amusement in trivial matters, making bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really are, but I need something deeper for intellectual stimulation.For my comedy, I don't need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh. Cynicism, witty dialogue, sarcasm, commentary and so on, not one line random events that happen out of no where with no real context and then expected to be funny.(which is not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesn't make me laugh at times...) A very random film with very to little no substance to it. A few quirky one liners here and there, but in all honesty I was more looking at the clock waiting for this film to end then I was looking at the film waiting for it to be entertaining.Yet for some reason it has a cult following and there it is... However one should keep in mind that cults generally comprise of brainwashed individuals who really can't think for themselves anyways and generally follow wherever they are pointed to like mindless sheople...",1,183,355,29 August 2009
Star Trek," boe_dye sez: how about now we reboot the star wars saga in an alternate reality where Padme doesn't die...
","*****SPOILERS BEGIN HERE******** Words cannot describe how utterly disgusted I am at this. The teasers were right, this ain't yo daddy's star trek. This isn't even my Star Trek.This isn't even Star Trek and has no business being called Star Trek. Oh sure the names are there, and yes it's glitzy and expensive with lots of explosions...Spocks mom dies...for the really hardcore, there is a reference of Cardasians...OH yeah, and there is Uhura making out with Spock on the transporter pad, and before that asking him if, and I quote 'just tell me what you want of me and i'll do it' in a turbo lift as a way to console Spock after Vulcan had just been destroyed. What a way to make Uhura a cheap thrill ride...It's okay though, cause OLD Spock, played poorly by Leonard Nimoy says that is an 'alternate time line' and because of that it makes everything better...Let me put my view into perspective. I watch the Old series, I watch the Next Generation, I watch DS9, I watch Enterprise. And I'm not even one of those guys who wears the uniform and lives the lifestyle...But you know, I am so tired of Hollywood butchering the things that I grew up on.And Trekkies? Oh the Trekkies will hate this.Yeah, sure there is the Kobayashi Maru, which in all honesty is about the only thing canonical to this whole mess of a film, but other wise it was just one slight after another.Chekhov is suddenly this wiz kid physicist, scotty is basically a garage mechanic, Uhura is suddenly this linguistic genius, Spock is just a tool, Sulu is a ninja, and Kirk... Well, Kirk is apparently the smartest person in Iowa with a genius I.Q. and a pension for being a rebellious wild child.And for a moment let's talk about the Leonard Nimoy cameo. Why it's got Leonard Nimoys endorsement it must be good! And look he even says some key Spock Quotes! OOOO...Yeah so what. It is a cheap ploy to get the trekkies to spend their money on something that will very soon be universally known as the absolute worst Star Trek in history.It's even worse then 5...In my many years and dollars of going to see movies, I have only walked out on 1. Tonight was my second. I never in a million years thought that I would walk out on a Star Trek movie. Never. But I went in there expecting and knowing it would be a reboot...I never imagined this being a slap in the face.People who know nothing of Star Trek will probably love it. However when they go back to watch the originals, they wont get it.People who love Star Trek will hate this, and be thankful that there will always be the series.But you know? It's okay that Spocks mom dies! It's okay that Spock and Uhura are lovers, and that she throws herself at like a cheap call-girl, it's okay that Chekhov is even there and all these things are okay! Because it's an alternate time line! And that makes everything better!!!!!!!! True Fans, you have been warned. This is not anything remotely close to the Star Trek that we know and love. It is hurtful and near hateful towards the series that has inspired us to look up into the star and dream of boldly going where no man has gone before.It is disrespectful towards all of the black woman who were inspired by Nichelle Nichols to rise above the stereotypes of that day and age and become more then what they told they could be.It is a perversion towards all of us kids who dreamed of being Captain Kirk, and discovering new life and new civilizations. A Kirk who was a seasoned hero and not hot headed firebrand who was given command like being given an expensive sports car by a rich uncle.And it is an insult to all of us who crave knowledge and that delicate balance between logic and emotion.**********End Spoilers*********",1,230,358,10 May 2009
Captain Marvel," Avengers were named for Captain America, the First Avenger
","Finally; this movie was available for the low, low price of 5$ on iTunes, and I and a group of friends took an opportunity to watch what is sure to go down in history as the most controversial Marvel Movie in the MCU. The group consisted of 5 women, and 5 men, mostly of comic book fandom persuasions and we were all unanimously both confused, frustrated and left with a feeling of 'what did I just watch'?The plot (such as it was) really makes no sense. There is no real rhyme or reason for anything to happen, and it mostly just happens without cause. Other than the mention of the tesseract, there is no real tie-in to the greater MCU / Infinity Wars Arch.While Brie Larson did do some exercise training to 'toughen up' for the role, she is clearly out of her element. The most distracting thing about the movie is how you can clearly tell she is on a wire doing certain stunts, trying to convincingly tell us that she is no quitter. This is a theme of her life of constantly being told by men to just give up and quit, and that because she is a girl / woman, she'll never *fill in blank*. More often than not it just comes off as her being wreckless, and incapable, and never once (including the end) does she actually accomplish and overcome, she just stands up and grimaces.This re-occuring theme of 'not having to prove anything' comes in the end, which she had a really great opportunity to actually claim victory over her stronger opponent, is instead watered down to her just blasting Jude Law and saying 'I don't need to prove anything'. This is unfortunate because it sends a message that once again, you just need to show up to the race and win. This Carol Danvers never proves herself (unlike say Captain America who proved himself time and time again).Her powers are probably the most confounding of the story. She doesn't actually acquire them in a way that classic Carol Danvers did, but instead obtains them and basically becomes a living, walking battery. In comic books, there are places you can go in the realm of reason that make the character the character without breaking the world boundaries. Unfortunately in this, her powers just grow and grow, and keep growing with no real reason. First she can shoot proton energy out of her hands, next she can recharge battery cells and fix technology, and fly head on into warheads. How? Why? Who knows, that's just what happens when you get blown up by a light speed reactor, I guess...One of the more frustrating elemets is that of Nick Fury. Fury is a battle hardened veteran... This Fury is a Kawaii, Anime Character who goes soft over cats (Think like a Hughs from Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood). SO much in fact that he doesn't lose his eye in battle, but because the stupid cat scratched his eye. This again goes along the subtle repeating trope of emasculating men throughout the narrative (also blasting off Arnolds head in the True Lies cutout when she crashed landed in the Blockbuster... but made sure Jamie Lee Curtis' head was still intact).It was a unanimous conclusion amongst both men and women in the group that this is not the heroin they would want their daughters to emulate (which by the way, 4 of the 5 in the room had a daughter). She never shows that she can overcome obstacles or defeat -- she just stands and clenches her fist. If it wasn't that she was given immense power, she would just be eternally standing and clenching her fist, which is entirely what heros like Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thor, Black Panther all warn against that it's not the suit that makes the hero, but the person inside the suit. In the end, Captain Marvel is just a suit.",3,6,8,26 June 2019
Us," Low brow garbage.
","You know that feeling of 'uhhh huhhh...' when someone tries to sound intelligent about something, and they just came off and sounding foolish and morose? You know that person... They just watched a documentary, or perhaps read a Wikipedia article and then suddenly they were an expert on things like 'duality', 'tropes', 'Jungian Archytypes' and such?You could say it more succinctly: You know that person who wears the band t-shirt, can name the one hit song that the artist came out with... like... maybe... Thriller... and suddenly try to convince everyone that they were are the biggest fan in the world of that artist?Same difference.Thats kind of how this movie was. Peele tries really, really hard to sound intelligent, and to craft an intelligent narrative, but unfortunately falls so hard and so fast that the movie crashes and burns because he doesn't really understand what he is talking about in the first place. He can name drop an idea, he can loosely base an idea off of something ancient, but in the end he doesn't really get it.He is flat out writing well outside his pay grade and intellect, and trying to pawn it off as a deep metaphor.This movie is billed as horror, but the only horrific thing about it is that I spent 10.50 on half night movie for me and my wife. It was so bad at times it was cringy. Was it trying to be funny, or was it just so bad that it was funny? You have moments of suspense that almost pull you into the narrative, only to be immediately snapped out of it by a gag.****Spoilers*****The ending ultimately did it for me. I was kind of hoping the grand reveal would be a twist that would break my neck. Instead...it was cliche and contrived and really negated everything that could have been interesting about the movie. Oh boy, the old switcheroo... and now it's a revenge story.That, and for some reason we really needed to hear a 3 minute expletive explaining everything that just happened, rather than letting the viewer sort it out for themselves. I guess Peele never got the memo that like a good joke, you shouldn't have to explain it, and a good story should just explain itself and leave the audience left with a bit of wonder and intrigue.I've read some of the 'easter eggs' and 'fan theories' of the show, and for the most part the people who are getting most excited about it are people who got really into high school psychology. Beyond that it lacks any depth, any horror, and any 'gotcha' plot twist. In a lot of way's it was more like a cheap imitation of an M. Night Shamalyan film, who if anything was mostly just a cheap knock off of Alfred Hitchcock -- a Copy of a Copy of a, if you will.Granted M.Night started out pretty okay with Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, The Village and Signs... but even towards the Village and Signs you could kind of tell that he was stretching, and everything has been downhill since Lady in the Water.Casting was okay, dad was a dork, the other family was more of a mocking satire than anything else, and while I had high hopes for this film being interesting, it pretty much shattered my desire for ever giving Hollywood any of my money anymore, ever again. It's really time for the land of Stardust and Celebrity to go away at this point. If this is any indication of what Jordan Peele's direction is like, then I weep for his new Twilight Zone Series as it would just be another cheap, uninteresting knockoff of something great...",1,6,9,3 April 2019
Superbad," boe_dye sez: American Pie here.
","In all honesty, a film like this must be compared to it's peers. The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Ten Things I Hate About You, American Pie, etcetera, ad infinitum...It's a coming of age teenage angst film. Unpopular kids trying to get with the popular girls in their senior year of high school.But in all honesty, the cast was more like Middle School children entering into High School.Sure there were funny moments, jailbait eye candy, drinking and sexual innuendo's, and what have you...But after a while, it started to drag on.Whats worse is that when the ending came, it really didn't have a resolution or anything, just a very quick 'this is where we part ways' moment with the one character looking back.Not only that, but with the resolution neither of them seemed terribly happy about it, even though they ultimately got what they wanted.The fat kids obnoxious quips got old, and the skinny kids monotone voice made him seem bored all the time.And the geeky kid with the annoying voice... well he was funny as a Jon Cryer comedy relief aspect...Other wise a mediocre movie at best. Funny yes, replay value? Not really. There are considerably better movies of similar styling out there that make this on just get lost in the pile.",5,1,3,12 August 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," boe_dye sez: against my better judgement... i saw it...
","Lessee here...If there was a so-called work print edition, then I am amazed... The cgi and the effects in the theatrical edition were par with the standards of 10 years ago.That bummed me out...Let's keep going...Gambit... Yeah... Thick suave Cajun. Nope, not here, instead we have a sort of young looking Johnny Depp like fellow who kinda goes in and out of a very watered down version of a French Quarter accent...No 'Mon Ami', or trademark Gambitness...*****SPOILER******* Silverfox. She dies. Sabertooth kills her. YEARS AGO. There is no conspiracy in which she is involved in, and the White Queen is not her sister.Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds could have been a great Deadpool. He's such a smart alec wise cracking sort.... And in the beginning it started out well, minus the mask, but then for no apparent reason, they started giving him all these powers. Cyclops eye beams, Wolverines Healing Factor, Wraith's teleportation (which in all honesty I don't know much about Wraith to begin with), Mystiques acrobatic fighting ability...BARAKA FROM MORTAL KOMBAT'S SWORDS OUT OF THE ARM!!!!!!!!! (Yes, they turned him into Baraka!!!) Patrick Stewart - My God the man looked like the victim of botox therapy gone wrong and standing in the middle of an exploding wax factory. So bad in fact that he looked almost CGI.Cyclops - You know... Why was he even in this? He didn't need to be in it.and finally...Getting shot in the head with Adamantium bullets will make you lose your memory...let's try this again...GETTING SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH ADAMANTIUM BULLETS WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE YOUR MEMORY!!! I mean what is that? So now wolverine is walking around with two bullets in his skull and two matching holes? And lastly...You would think that Victor could have called 'Jimmy' AKA Logon, 'Runt' at least once? And what was going on with him running up the walls? And for that matter what was up with Gambit being able to defy gravity? I thought his power was the ability to charge objects with kinetic energy! ****Spoilers End Here**** The only real redeeming factors of this movie is Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine. The man is a great actor. It's just a shame that he got stuck with such a crappy script and director.Liev Shrieber. He is actually really great as Sabertooth. They both played their parts well.And with the exception of everything else, which in all honesty is what made the movie the movie, it was alright.The beginning started out well, and the credits were pretty good, showing Logan and Victor throughout history, but each subsequent scene after that just got worse and worse and worse.Like driving your motorcycle from Canada to Reno Nevada in one day? The from Reno to New Orleans in a few hours? ...Hollywood has once again failed me in a manner that makes me wonder: Why am I spending money at the movies anymore? Why am I even going out and wasting my money on big screen adaptations of my childhood that are only going to disappoint and criticize.I can understand some nitpicking. I can understand some variations. But this is just at total departure of what was.This movie would be great for a person who has no idea about wolverine or xmen... But for the fans that provided the bread and the butter for Marvel Comics all of these years, we are left once again standing on the outside looking in...",3,0,3,7 May 2009
Alexander," boe_dye sez: For some reason this had all the elements of a soft core porn...
","Yeah, it was weird like like.With Val Kilmer being the only person in this movie who was not beautiful and pretty, I got this weird vibe that everyone wanted to have sex with everyone.Now sure, the Greeks were known for a lot of things. Sexuality being one of them. However, while this movie did have absolutely gorgeous shots and scenes, the whole sexual undertones were just plain weird.Consider that Jolie is a year younger then Farrel really didn't help matters much, and would kinda sorta explain the ease of the oedipus complex that was being portrayed.And it wasn't so bad to hint that there might have been something going on between Leto and Farrel's Characters (for possible historical interpretation) it was over played.As i started to say in the beginning, this movie had all of the elements to make a soft core porn. Jolie wanted Farrel, Leto wanted Farrel, Farrel wanted Jolie Leto and Dawson (well sorta at first)...In the end it wasn't really that great of a film, and i've kinda come to expect that for some reason out of Oliver Stone.All and all this gets an 'Eh'.",5,2,2,19 April 2008
Terminator Salvation," boe_dye sez: Okay, I get why people didn't like it. here is why I did:
","First off, lets understand that this isn't really the 'finality' of Terminator. It's more on the order of this is a story how we get from point A which would be sometime after Terminator 3, to point B which would be before the war is over. In all honesty there is a considerable amount of groundwork to cover between here and there which, thankfully, McG did not choose to cover.What was good was that the story followed and respected the groundwork that had been laid before. Like all great heroes, they don't just pop up one day and say 'Here I am to save the world'. No, they are seasoned, experienced veterans who are alive and kicking because they were smarter then all the other people who didn't live all that long.Previous Terminator films almost made it sound as if the Resistance was nothing more then a motley crew of ragtag fighters fighting for survival. This made them considerably more organized.One thing that did surprise me was that this is NOT a Christian Bale movie. Yes, Christian Bale is in it, and I happen to believe that man can do no wrong when it comes to acting (yes even Newsboys). His Batman voice was a bit overplayed and at one point I was half expecting his to start muttering 'Whyrutryingtokillme'.Never the less, the film more focused on the Resistance as a whole, and Conner's affect on the resistance. It showed more how he grew into the role as John Conner, Leader.Lots of action. LOTS of action. One great thing is that McG chose to use more robots when possible as opposed to CGI. CGI is overplayed and makes everything look fake. This was about as real as a movie as I have seen in a while up to and including a very realistic auto rotation that as a former helicopter student, I was very well aware of the ramifications of.Again, it followed the storyline very well and as far as plot holes go, I will get into that with the 'cons'.The Cons.What most people are complaining about:The time line. Alright, first of the Terminator does create a mess of predestination paradox's. But without getting into a whole philosophical diatribe about something that could never really happen anyways I will say this: What is going to happen, is ultimately going to happen. You cannot change the future, only delay the outcome. It's not to say that you don't have a choice you do, however it's simply a matter of catching up to that choice and, to quote, understand that choice.If they changed the future in the second film then the time line creates a huge paradox anyways that says that Kyle Reese, while still being born at one point or another will never have a reason to go back into time to impregnate Sarah Conner and John Conner is never born...Therefore at some point or another, the events that happen have to happen.Which is why in the 3rd one, Arnie says that Judgement day is inevitable you only have to survive it.Nextly and this is what secret agent J had to gripe about, was the whole dropping into the center of the Machine City or Skynet Central and there being almost no resistance what-so-ever. Let's be honest. If the machines really wanted to wipe us out, then it wouldn't be that difficult. Drop a few nukes. The just mercilessly eradicate us all. Non stop slaughter. No rest no quarter. Thats why in a movie such as 'The Matrix', the machines effectively DID win. It was only by fighting from the inside out did humanity have a chance.That being said, you have to take certain liberties to make the machines less then what they are. And because of those liberties you can have static bases, utilities, aircraft weaponry and a whole other schlew of things at your disposal in order to have some semblance of hope.So, Skynet has to be vulnerable. And call it profound arrogance on the Machines part. Why should they need to have sentries and armed personal guarding it's most valued base of operations? Why? Because in all their logic and mathematical precision they can never compute something that is random chance. They cannot think outside the box of numbers and statistics. Getting to that point is in the machines eyes a mathematical impossibility.Next, and this is a gripe that I do agree with.Molten steel has been proved effective in the decimation of T800's. Why oh why it didn't work on the model in the movie is beyond me. Nitrogen gas, commonly used for cooling seem to be an effective method for immobilizing T1000's.Now physics states that if you super heat something, and then super cool it at an extreme rate that it usually shatters pretty quickly. like taking a hot frying pan and dropping it in water will most definitely warp it beyond use.Why it wasn't the case here is beyond me as it has proved effective time and time again.Lastly, the paying homage to the previous Terminator films by re-imaging certain sequences got old fast. It was almost on the order of history repeats itself or what goes around comes around. Yes we know, your mom fought the terminator walking up the flight of stair just like you are now.Yes we know your Terminator buddy in the second film got pounded with in the chest with a steel girder just like your Terminator buddy is right now.However, the use of Arnold as the T800 prototype was AMAZING! Well thought out, and well played and epic beyond belief.A definite redemption from the campy Terminator 3 debacle!",9,3,5,24 May 2009
Juno," boe_dye sez: So this is Oscar worthy...wow...
","It certainly wasn't all that great to tell you the truth...In all honesty, what it lacked in any type of character growth or maturity it made up for in cliché'.I suppose that my wife and I have an unfair advantage in watching this, because when we got married, and then found out she was pregnant, we made a decision to give our child up for an open adoption.So we can realistically tell you step by step the motions and the pregnancy...However this is Hollywood, and a movie, so we weren't seeing this expecting realism. However for something that everyone was raving about, it would have been nice to see some type of, i don't know, rising action.For the most part the film was a flat line of sameness over and over again. It was very bland and kinda dull.Ellen Page, was sarcastic and a typical genX'r the entire time. The characters were pointless and showed no real emotion the entire time, and. Jennifer Garner was a cliché' mom, who was all 'baby baby baby!'.Both male counterparts, were the most depressing of all. Neither one of them were involved in any aspect of the pregnancy. The fellow who knocked up Juno in the first place, couldn't seem to care less either way.It was no emotion what so ever, which you could sadly argue is many male reactions, however his character just didn't seem the type to be like. 'Wow, your pregnant... Huh... Well, i have to go jog with my team mates... See you at the end of the film...' Even Garners husband made very little sense, considering that he was the one who got the ball rolling in the first place.And that was about it. Every single scene was just one cutting remark after another from EVERYONE. I guess we are supposed to believe that this chick is carrying a child and everday for nine months, all she gets to hear is one snap after another from her mother, her father, and everyone else in her life.In the end, i just couldn't wait for this film to be over.Too sarcastic, too cynical, too cliché', and really pointless in the end.",5,6,16,19 March 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," ...well, at least we wont cook to death!
","Were to begin on this one? Well, as I have stated previously elsewhere, I feel that this is the third movie in an unintentional trilogy featuring, and in this order; 'Armageddon', 'The Core', and 'The Day After Tomorrow'.It is your typical disaster/survival movie, where man is screwed no matter what and his main job is to survive...So much in fact that the whole movie could be played and summed up in little over a half hour. However, that would not make an entertaining evening so you have to throw in subplots consisting of random CGI wolves, and an injury that is bad enough to make a squishy sound when it happens, but not bad enough where it is even acknowledged until the plot slows down enough where it suddenly becomes life threatening.Hence enter the random CGI Wolves...The film is basically a sensationalist view of Global Warming Propaganda. I half expected to see Al Gore surfing on the tidal waves that were about to sink New York screaming 'here's your Inconvenient Truth!'.If you are careful you might even see a cheapshot taken at some Saudi Arabian officials when Dennis Quaid is giving his speech...Every little cliché' that is out there in typical disaster/survival movies is here. From estranged spouses finding their love again, to cancer boy, to man pulling together to save the day, to the hero driving a hybrid car, to his son making it as a man, this movie has it all. And before I forget, it even has the typical 'hero cop' extra who needs to take charge, and not listen to anyone cause he's the hero cop and winds up getting everyone he is leading killed....And since when does Mexico have a border patrol to keep all those wiley Americans out of their country?As my wife says; 'Suspend all Logic and Disbelief!'",8,1,2,13 July 2007
Spider-Man 3," This was crap
","Okay, I understand certain things have to happen in movies. I understand things like dramatic license, and I understand that you have to fudge things around to take that 30+ years of history and make it work.Maybe it's cause I have a standing subscription to the current three Spidey titles, maybe it's cause I have a small collection of all the back issues from way before I was even born...Maybe it's cause I know who Todd McFarlane is... I don't know the maybe's could go on forever....But the simplest way to say this is this...THEY TOOK SPIDER-MANS GREATEST VILLAIN EVER (even greater then the Goblin)AND GAVE HIM 20 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME!!!! Essentially i saw this, and felt that I was ripped off. I totally wanted my money back. Oh yes it had venom, but it didn't have Venom. It had Venom as supporting cast. I mean what is that? They took Sandman, and instead of leaving him as the two bit crook that he was way back, and still is today, turned him from a villain to a tortured character....and Spider-Man getting honored? ...Spider-Man getting the key's to the city?? ...Spider-Man getting anything other then ridiculed and hated, and always being at the wrong place at the wrong time?????The whole movie was just to much, and not enough. I mean throwing random characters in the mix just cause they are in the books? Why not just have had JJJ kill off Gwen Stacy while your at it?I liked the cast. I liked Topher Grace. I liked Hayden Christiansen. I liked Tobey McGuire. I liked pretty much everyone else... However...Looking back at the Spider-Man Franchise as a whole, I have come to realize that there was one element that desperately needed to be corrected. Kiersten Dunst is no Mary Jane.Mary Jane is the hottest chick you could imagine. She isn't cute. She isn't pretty. She's smoking HOT. She's the party girl. She's the one that every guy wants and no man can have. Dunst does not do that justice at all.For all intent and purposes, she's a lot like Lindsey Lohan, minus all the drugs, alcohol, car wrecks, and random sex. That's who Mary Jane is...Anymore, I have come to realize that all Hollywood needs to do anymore is slap a familiar name on the titles, and droves of sheeple (sadly in this case myself included) will flock and give Hollywood millions of dollars on crap. But hey, don't forget that no matter how much you hated it, your still going to buy the DVD wont you? I certainly wont. I'll save my money and give it the real artist at Marvel....And thus concludes my fanboy rant...",2,0,0,13 July 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," It is like the Fifth Element, meets 300, meets Battlestar Galactica.... in neon.
","What made Thor Ragnarok enjoyable was that it stood well on its own. While it would have been helpful to know and understand the events of the previous Thor, as well as Avengers: Age of Ultron, it was not necessary as enough information was supplied to take what was happening at it's face value.Honestly though, it was just a fun popcorn flick.Hulk Smashed, Thor Zapped, and all in all it was just a solid film. No one character outshined the other, and though the dialogue at times was a bit wooden especially with Cate Blanchet's 'Hela', it was clear that everyone involved was just having fun with it.For the Comic Book Fans, the narrative pulled greatly from the Planet Hulk arch, and while it was not a direct retelling, it had enough elements to make it familiar and not feeling contrived. I personally would like to see a proper Planet Hulk / World War Hulk movie, perhaps where Hulk returns to Sakaar in order to lead the revolution that he in part started.After being disappointed with Thor 1 and 2, Thor Ragnarok could either be a nice way to end the franchise, or an excellent way to jump start it with 3 more proper films that actually get the formula right. This focused more on the mythological elements of the Thor legend, rather than the 'Thor in America' direction -- arguably making it a much more enjoyable film rather than it being a fish out of water tale.To expound on the Summary, this had the fun of The Fifth Element with over the top, yet not outside the realm of reality and reason characters, the epicness and cinematography found in the battle scenes of 300, and a finale that was very reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica.A solid 'A', and a film that I will hopefully re-watch once it becomes available in the usual places.",9,2,7,5 December 2017
Resident Evil: Extinction," boe_dye's review... NOT SYNOPSIS
","See, i have taken to making sure people know that my reviews are what i thought of the film... to many people read these things not understanding that there is a little synopsis link somewhere on the main page and by me telling you what you already know isn't much of a review...Well, the movie wasn't all that bad. if you go into it thinking that it's going to be anything more then what the previous two have already been then you are quite deluded. there really isn't much more to this film then it's predecessors.Zombies, guns, blood and Milla Jovavich looking good a kicking arse.Something that has been somewhat pandemic in these types films as of late are the action sequences. they are a bit overwhelmingly to much 'in your face'. yeah it looks quicker, and can be more intense, but after a while it just gets kinda annoying.The story line however is dwindling. sure sure, you don't really go into a film like this expecting gross amounts of character development. and story and plot tend to be backseat to lottsa action. but you still need something of a story. without that you are basically watching a porno, and who really wants to do that anyway? Now, while the storyline is dwindling what was there really didn't have any closure. yea, the people flew away, but so what? at least in the first and the second you had a general idea of what happened with the cast.And of course, they left it open for yet another sequel. if they do get around to making it, i will certainly be hesitant to see it if they base it on the absurdity of the ending of this one...However now that i think of it, if they do make a fourth one this could simply be a segue-way between 2 and 4 which would, at the very least be an explanation to the thin storyline....You know, make something on the cheap just to keep people interested in the franchise...Other then that there isn't much left to tell. essentially in the end it was more of the same. if you enjoyed the first two, you will probably enjoy this one as well. if you feel that you suffered through either of the first two then you will probably suffer even more, and unless you are sadomasochistic i wouldn't advise it.",6,1,3,23 September 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," boe_dye sez: If the powers that be ever decided to make 'Legend Of Zelda' a movie...
","Then this is the director to do it.(I know that had nothing to do with anything, I just wanted to plug that for a moment...) Having never actually read the Dark Horse comics, I have the advantage of being non prejudicial in my report of this film. As it stands, the more I watch these comics made movies, the more interested in the comic I become.Those of you familiar with del Toro's work will quickly recognize the 'Pan's Labyrinth' styling. In fact, I believe that that styling is really what makes this movie good.Aside from the dialogue, which is mediocre at best, the visual aspects to this film are quite beautiful.Some of those other companies who make movies based on large green cgi hulks ought to take a lesson and realize that you can do a lot with talented costume designers who can actually make something look believable with foam and prosthetic...There were some very good laugh moments, there were some very good groan moments. Thankfully, the characters had shown a bit of growth from the last one, and were now more comfortable with one another.The story was a simple one. It was a mix of Labyrinth (The Jim Henson/David Bowie one), Stardust, 5th element, Return to Oz, and a few other types of movies that those into this genre can easily relate to, humbly melded together to create this quaint little tale.All and all a slightly more sophisticated popcorn film then the usual fare. I say more sophisticated because of the care and beauty that goes into del Toro's films that you rarely see anywhere else.Of course, the critics complain and the the 'true' fans hate, but my wife and I had a very nice time.",8,0,2,20 July 2008
Cloverfield," boe_dye sez... actually secret agent j sez.... it's blair witch goes to N.Y
","So here's the deal; had i walked into this film not know that it was going to be documentary style, running around with lots of weird and wacky camera angles, sporadic monsters, and lots of hight pitched screaming, i probably would have been somewhat upset.However, i did walk into knowing all of this to boot, so there it is.I think the best way to describe this, and the most fairest observation about this, is that people who love it, are going to love the exact same things that the people who hated it, hated.Personally, i will never spend money to see another pseudo-documentary style film like this, because i don't care for the open ended story telling. i thought that it was far too annoying to enjoyable. although what was done, was done extremely well, what was done was done in a style that i just don't like.The scenes were very well played, and the footage was pretty good for what it was. my biggest complaint however was the character 'hud' who acted more like a 15 year old with a camera. too many stupid comments, too much idiotic chatter, and not enough substance. sure, he was supposed to be the stereotypical doofus who was given the camera because it amused his simple character, but i think that it was over played after the whole 'he and she slept together' bit.The monsters were done well, and i liked how the kept the cloverfield monster a mystery so to speak towards the end, but at the same time, i felt that they could have used just a smidgen more intelligence when it came to evading the monster as they escaped in the choppa.And yes, they do most certainly have to 'get to a choppa'...The ending was a bit of a disappointment for me, as i felt it was unnecessary, and really made the film pointless. They go to all this trouble avoiding the blasted thing, only to make a very predictable escape that parallels the monster path of destruction.Why they thought that a monster that could toss the statue of liberty's head half way across manhattan would not be able to jump a couple of hundred feet in the air from a standstill is beyond me, but hey, there it is...In the end, i and my wife, were both somewhat nauseous. she liked it, but then again she also likes me too, which goes to show where her tastes are at. my best friend, the man known as secret agent j liked it, but then again still lovingly referred to it as blair witch goes to N.Y.Those who say that it is nothing like blair witch really need to get a clue, cause it was almost exactly like blair witch, only with more running, screaming, and eye candy...... and no stupid man standing in the basement of a cabin looking all... stupid...I had to be fair and give it five stars. 5 cause, and again, what it did, it did really well, but i just didn't like what it did...... although the star trek teaser gave me chills... >8^P",5,2,6,22 January 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," boe_dye sez: It's sad that I had to view this as i did...
","to Tim, Helena, and Johnny, Alan, Sacha, and that guy who plays Peter Pettigrew in Harry Potter, sorry you didn't get my money, but if it's any consolation cinemark, center township wouldn't play your film. Even though they had a huge cardboard cutout advertisement of this film in the lobby since summer of 07, they still didn't play it.Anyway, the review...I really didn't know what to expect when it came to this film. I had sort of heard of it when it was mentioned in 'Jersey Girl', but other then that my knowledge was totally non existent.On one hand I had a fairly difficult time understanding much of what was being said, but only because of the incredibly thick cockney accents that were being used Which in all fairness made the film more believable. All of the players did a spectacular job in the making of this film.I was most surprise by Cohen's performance as the most i knew of him up until that point was borat, and i hardly call that acting as much as i would call it acting like a complete tool and getting paid for cruelty to his fellow man.But he did exceptionally well.I will say that both my wife and i were really kind of depressed towards the end. It's a sad movie, and while you totally understand why sweeny todd wants revenge, by the end of the film you shouldn't feel bad about what happens.It is a very dark tale, but an enjoyable tale. I would advise anyone who is a fan of Burton and Depp to see it, and actually pay to see it. It is worth it.",9,0,1,5 February 2008
The Devil Wears Prada," a bland review by boe_dye
","Perhaps this is one of those things where translation was lost between book and film, i certainly wont know as i don't normally read fiction, and if i did read fiction (that's what movies are for, but that is just me), i would not read this book.I suppose that what made me and my wife miss the mark on this film was the fact that the interpretation of 'devil' was not a malevolent devil, but merely a crafty individual who was pulling the strings of just about everyone and every thing.For the most part i could describe this film as watching the heart monitor of a dead person, who periodically spasms due to fluctuations in the body...I am not a doctor by any stretch, and i know the analogy is poor so let me draw it out for you...the movie kind of felt like this --------------------------^----------------------------^-------- It really didn't do much except have a blip of something sporadically placed here and there.I suppose you could argue that it was the overall message that was important, however by the time you get to that message your so bored out of your mind cause nothing really happened.And i am not talking about action, or bang em up shoot em up, but at least some type of dynamics would have been nice.Even something like 'great expectations' with ethan hawke and gweneth paltrow that could very easily be comparable to this, had a certain amount of dynamics to it, and i really enjoyed that film.The acting was okay i suppose, and streeps character was stereotypical to that type of lifestyle that was being portrayed. but considering that i don't know anyone near that income level i can't really say for certain. half the time she acted as if she had swallowed vallium or prozac before each take.Now perhaps that was the point, and if it was then she played the part well. however the overall boredom and lack of any type of fluctuation in her character simply put me to sleep.I get the idea that the moral of the story is to make one think how far would they go to further their career. what type of sacrifice would have to be made and all, but there are certainly better movies that portray this message, again with the aforementioned 'great expectations'.Thankfully my wife and i did not have to pay to see this, and decided to watch it due to a brief fit of 1am insomnia. however after viewing it, the insomnia was cured and our pillows awaited our drowsy bodies.",3,2,4,27 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," A car that 'grinds' a medium strip... Thats original...
","BtW, when I say grind, I mean like what skaters do on handrails grind...Don't worry it makes sense if you see the film...So what can I say? Yes, yes the camera's were a triffle annoying, but not really all that bad.What really threw my wife and I off was what at first seemed like a major continuity issue. Don't worry that also gets straightened out halfway through...I enjoyed this movie. I like all types of movies, and try to have reasonable expectations when it comes to certain films. Like seeing Snakes On A Plane, I did not expect to see something that it obviously wasn't going to be.Lottsa over the top action, and super human 'if this were real life this dude would be toast in a matter of 5 seconds' type of stuff...All done well...There is a problem however...The story line was waaaaaaaay to similar to the first one. Right down to the hair color the chick dies it too in order for her to hide from the government similar (yes i get why it was done, but it really didn't have to be done at all now did it?).The whole new 'forgotten love interest' was unnecessary as well. I mean it didn't make much of a point to do it, unless of course they plan on making a fourth movie and quite honestly the franchise is strong enough where it is quite feasible.Other comments have said that they 'wrapped it everything up'. I would like to know what movie they were watching because the only thing that they wrapped up was the loose ends from the previous movie and in doing so creating just enough new loose ends to continue the story...So yeah, I will be surprised if they don't make a fourth one...I give it eight stars for the story line being an almost carbon copy of the original, but at the same time coming up with new and creative ways to destroy stuff, jump 30 year old dirt bikes up five foot walls from a standing position, and inventing the 'Vespa' chase scene....yes i did say Vespa Chase Scene...",8,0,0,9 August 2007
Predator," boe_dye says: 'Get to da choppa' >8^P
","Fan-freaking-tastic! My wife and i decided to watch this in conjunction with alien after having seen the latest nonsense known as Alien Vs Predator: Requiem.This certainly cleansed our palates after the bad taste that was left over from AvP:R.It has action, it has adventure, it has a predator, it has apollo creed, it has the governator, and it has jesse the body ventura, it has two other skinny white dudes, and a black guy who shaves a lot.and an Indian!It even has a cute little south American chick.And it has a choppa too! As i said, we watched this after going to see the second AvP, and it really made me appreciate what people used to be able to do with limited amounts of resources. it really did rely on acting, and good makeup and costume. sure there is a bit of cgi, but it compliments, not overwhelms.We also really get the honor that the predator has by only hunting those that can hunt back, and not just the preying on the weak, something that really didn't come across in the new film.It's really a great film for those into the genre, and i know i am preaching to the choir on this.The new fanboys really should see this, as it will allow you to appreciate, and understand why many of us smile thinly at the crap Hollywood is feeding us nowadays.",10,0,1,4 January 2008
Burn After Reading," boe_dye sez: To Quote John Malkovich...
","W.T.F? This movie really wasn't all that good. With the random subplots, and poor attempts to tie the players into every ones lives, it just became a jumbled pointless mess.While I will say that Brad Pitts character did keep my wife and I in the theatre, his part was sadly cut short too soon.Quite honestly, Mr. Pitts performance was the only redeeming quality to this movie.Within 10 minutes of this film I was bored. Within 20 minutes I was thinking to myself, well it's not really all that long.By the time it was over, the dragging of a film that was only an hour and a half seemed like an eternity.Even worse, is that this movie had been marketed as being along the lines of say 'thank you for smoking'. A quirky intelligent film, but instead it wasn't intelligent. Quirky, maybe, but not really in a good way.If anything the cast is what drove this movie for a box office hit. But once you realize that all these wonderful actors and actresses mean nothing in movie where the script is a total waste of disjointed paper and ink, and that this movie is kinda 'meh', it's almost over and the time to walk out and get your money back has passed.",2,7,15,19 September 2008
Watchmen," boe_dye sez: It wasn't until someone explained it to me that I understood why so many fanboys were jacked about this movie...
","I will be honest. This movie was a great film. Visually stunning, gripping, story and flow. This movie was a great film.So much in fact that, and I will be honest, I like many posers out there went and read the original comic.And in many cases this is scene for scene the comic. Dialogue almost identical. But where it fails with the fanboys is that it lacks the spirit that was Alan Moores 'Watchmen'.Mostly subtle character traits were flawed. The subtle nuances that this film could have easily captured were completely abandoned.The book was not an action packed adventure story. It was a philosophical character study. A dark look into the behind the scenes workings of heroes, or more appropriately an answer to a question of what is the extreme a person with unlimited means can go to achieve world wide peace.Now of course, most American audiences would rather see something go 'boom' as opposed to something that makes them go 'huh...'. A movie like '2001 a space odyssey' or more recently 'The Fountain' is usually met with scorn and dismay simply because the audience did not understand it.This movie upset just about everyone to some level. Parents who were stupid enough not to notice the 'R' rating, and think that this movie was some kind of cute super hero movie like Spider-Man or Fantastic Four were met with a very unpleasant surprise.Fanboys were upset because it missed the Spirit of Watchmen.Then you have the childlike whimperings from the simpletons concerning Dr. Manhattans genitalia. Of course Silk Specters tits are perfectly fine to oogle, but a large blue penis attached to the perfected enlightened man is not.I have come to learn that with movies based on comics, you have to be able to separate the two. Like an alternate reality, or marvel's 'What If?' series. This isn't cannon. This isn't the comic. It is a movie based on the comic. It is a re-telling.Is it a good retelling? I believe so. But this story wasn't close to my heart like it was with so many people. I did not read comics when this originally came out.As a movie it was superb, and in the end, that is what I spent my money on.***Edit*** Second Viewing on DVD The Directors CutAfter watching it again, and only after having read the TPB, I can now say that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It really does the comic justice, and does in fact capture the spirit of the original Alan Moore tale.Admittedly there is much for graphic action then in the comic, however if the movie lacked the slightly exaggerated action then it wouldn't have done well in the end.One of the biggest gripes that I have argued against is that in fact the ending was changed. Of course when it was written we lived prior to 9/11. Today we live in a post 9/11 world. My contention is that the comic book ending simply isn't big enough for the story to be effective in today's day and age. Never the less, this film is superb and the directors cut is even closer to the TPB then the theatrical version. Ultimately though, I do believe that have the conversation with Jon and Adrian at the end would have been more prolific then having Lara utter the lines 'nothing ends, nothing ever ends', however with all of Alan Moores works his endings are a bit on the meledratic side and tend to be difficult no matter how you portray them.Otherwise this is a fantastic film and even more so after having read the original comic that it was based upon.",10,1,3,21 March 2009
Justice League," A thorough lack of understanding of the DC Universe.
","At best this movie was strange. It had all the proper elements of a good film, yet studio heads seem to have a serious lack of understanding the psychology of the D.C. Universe.By nature, the D.C. Universe is significantly darker and more mature than Marvel. As such, they have an opportunity to delve into more cerebral stories than Marvel, and yet they treat this like a kids film. I am thoroughly convinced that Joss Whedon has become the last person anyone would want writing, or directing, or even producing their film as he is little more than a generic story teller.While Zach Snyder get's a great deal of flack, if left to his own devices he often times captures the spirit of the grittier, darker comics, IE 300 and Watchmen (despite it's flaws). Unfortunately a great deal happened with Snyder during production which left this movie essentially in shambles and broken from the start.The casting was good, however how they were used was mixed. Ezra Miller's Flash stole more than enough scenes, but Jason Mamoa's Aquaman was a bit too fratboy. Cyborg was interesting, but underdeveloped and Wonder Woman seemed like an extension from the Wonder Woman film. I've liked Affleck as Batman thus far, much to my surprise, but this just seemed meh... Henry Cavill felt entirely wooden and his apparent CGI face was incredibly distracting. Steppenwolf was the most disappointing in that he was little more than Aries redux, and as an antagonist was boring, uninspiring and just another CGI cut scene.In short, this movie was just strange. It seemed that it had all the elements to make a solid film, but moves it too fast, establishes nothing, goes from scene to scene to scene, and is flat out generic and forgettable.It's a shame because this could have been absolutely wonderful.",6,1,1,26 February 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," boe_dye sez: In retrospect, it would have been cool if....
","Somewhere towards the end, there was a scene where the machines and the humans were watching the end battle between Neo and Smith, and one of the humans asked Morpheus how many 'Smiths' there were, and Morpheus could have turned and looked at him and said: 'OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' Cause really, that's about the extent of the intellectualism that this movie had.Sure it was a finality, and a closer. Yes, we get it Neo is the archetype Messiah, and sacrifice, and in the end there is peace, and the prophecy is fulfilled, and yadda yadda yadda.But really who cares? The machines ultimately won anyways. They still need the humans to survive because the sky is still black. And what human in his or her right mind would want to 'wake up' in a world that is basically a charred lifeless version of itself.Earth effectively is a dead planet.And even so, living in the Matrix is ultimately where you could gain enlightenment and 'free your mind'.Sure you could argue that the real lesson was synergy and co-existing with one another, which is nice and all. But if you think about it, the machines will always win.And really, we are to believe that a whole race of machines that are able to create the greatest MMORPG in existence, build hovercrafts, and find ways to convert humans into batteries couldn't once figure out how to clean up the sky, which ultimately would erase the need for humans in the first place? I mean c'mon?! In the end, this movie was more just an all out fight scene. The CGI was fantastic, the Cinematography was incredible, but the 'woah' factor that made the first one had simply disappeared.Fortunately, the only real reason to watch this is for the eye candy. There isn't much to be gained as far as knowledge or philosophy, unlike the original. In fact, one could watch the first one, and be perfectly content without having seen the second or the third.",5,0,0,3 January 2009
American Psycho," boe_dye's slap happy review.
","I saw this movie about 2 years ago from a friend who, in retrospect, to a certain degree patterned his life after patrick bateman.The title is certainly misleading to some who might think this is a horror/slasher flick. and while it may have a bit of blood, it is more on the order of a socio/psychological character study on what happens to an elitist nobody trying to fit in, and never quite fitting in.Now, i can't speak for the book that it is based on as i have not read it. however it does certainly stand on it's own two feet.The cast is absolutely remarkable remaking the 80's yuppie scene. the music, the clothes, the attitudes of the young urban professional trust fund babies is so well done, that it is too good to be a caricature.Movies like this that are so good rarely need to have long diatribes written about them as they will most certainly speak for themselves, so i will leave this review with two more points.Point one, this movie should be taken somewhat introspectively. don't just watch it and then put it away on the shelf or return it to your choice of rental establishment. think about it. think about what happened, why it happened. it is an intelligent film. somewhat artsy at times, but nothing that is so esoteric that you have to be an initiate to understand what happened.Point two. if you do enjoy this movie and you decide to learn more about it and the person who had written it, you will inevitably find out that he also wrote 'rules of attraction' (in fact james van der beak played batemans younger brother in that movie, although it wasn't spoken about...). be forewarned that if you do enjoy this movie and go out of your way to see 'rules of attraction', don't expect to see the same kind of depth. in fact, don't see it at all because it was a waste of time.Now if you will excuse me, i have to go and return some video tapes...",10,0,1,14 October 2007
Knowing," boe_dye sez: Zecharia Sitchin much?
","Or perhaps Erik Von Daniken? It took me a while to really catch on to where this story was going, and once I realized that it certainly wasn't a new tale, but instead a retelling of a story that is quite old.It is also interesting to note that this story is coming at a time that has been building up for years now as more and more people are jumping on the bandwagon that 2012, at least according to the Mayan Short Calender is when some great cataclysmic solar event is to happen.Never the less, it is refreshing to note that someone intelligent was able to point out that the earth is indeed warming not because of man-made carbon emissions, but instead because of that ginormous ball of fire in the sky.But onto to the movie...Let's just start out by saying that if anything, this movie was just downright creepy. Everything about it was simply un-nerving. The decor, the scenery, the 'Men in Black' if you will.It doesn't do it justice to call it horror, as most horror films are more about loud shocking scares, but it does excel in what most horror films fail to do, and that is make you squirm in your seat.And really that was just the imagery aspect of it...Nicholas Cage plays his normal character that we have come to expect, and as a rule if you are not a Nicholas Cage fan, then you probably wont like this movie.Around the end of the film, the pace started to get somewhat disjointed and almost felt as if it wanted to end in about 10 different places. This, however, was do to poor editing and scene splicing.The story line was solid enough and left little to the imagination. Of course the nature of the ending would make it hard to say that there were any loose ends...Some people will probably be put off when they realize that this story is actually a fringe interpretation of the Bible, and while it is not technically a Biblical story it's basis is heavily laden with scriptural interpretation.Pseudo-Intellectuals will probably scoff and dismiss the story as nonsense leaving the theatre grumbling that this is simple another one of those 'Christian Propaganda Films'. However the truly enlightened will see it as a caricature of factual events and possible interpretations.Ancient cultures were not as 'quaint' and 'simple' as many have come to believe that they are today. In fact ancient cultures were highly intelligent and very much aware of the world around them is very much evident in the writings and works that they left behind.The fact that they didn't have shiny blinking gadgets is not a testament to their advancement in mathematics or astronomy.Of course many people today forget that 90% our knowledge in mathematics and astronomy is hundreds and sometimes thousands of years old.In the end, this movie was enjoyable. Not too heady, not too quirky, and not too religious. You wont be seeing a film that crams dogma or doctrine down your throat.",8,1,3,4 April 2009
Wanted," boe_dye sez: ... the key word is 'loosely' based on the comic...
","But I still got a kick out of it! Honestly, it was an absurd, over the top, unbelievable action flick, and I got a kick out of it.So Westley didn't look like Eminem, and Fox didn't look like Haley Barry and the Villains didn't wipe the memory of the Hero's from existence, and so what if the similarities begin and end with the title, and the fact that it had something to do with assassins...So what...Mark Millar actually went on record to say that this film turned out to be the original idea of what he had in mind in the first place, but had forgotten about after the story was written...Who cares? It was a pretty cool movie if you suspend all logic and disbelief and for a second consider that you can actually shoot someone in the head across town through glass, and cars, and trains and so on all while lounging on your easy chair looking at your target through a telescope.Yes it's absurd, but it's pretty damn cool at the same time.I will say this, that the film and the comic both had one very distinct thing in common.The last thing said, in both film and novel, were both equally stupid.Otherwise it was a pretty cool film.",9,1,4,20 July 2008
District 9," boe_dye sez: pseudo-intellectual drivel with more plot holes then chicken wire
","I honestly went to this hoping to see something moderately original. And even if it wasn't original (which by the way, it really wasn't) at the very least something that would make me go 'huh, interesting' not waiting till the end of the credits for punchline that never comes.Within ten minutes of this documentary style film I was already wanting to leave. The pointless ramblings and the ridiculous plot holes are what really lost me. I suppose you could say that it was the 'bigger picture', the apparent commentary on race relations that is what made this film. But even in that, if you have too many unanswered questions in a story, at least to a person who goes to the movies more often then not for a good story, then the message becomes lost.We are meant to believe that this obviously advance race, just showed up on sunny afternoon, hovered over Johannesburg for a couple of days, only to be 'liberated' by the altruistic humans, only to be 'forced' into concentration camps for 20 years, while they scavenge for non-human alien parts, in order to return to their ship, so that they can go home and this whole time, while they not only have numbers and tech that could level the human race in a matter of months, they are doing nothing but hanging out in concentration camps and selling their incredibly advance weaponry (which only they can use due to genetic encoding), that is apparently illegal to have anyways according to the local government who are hosting these visitors as refugees, but they have it anyways, to the local gangs......For cat food...That's about as stupid as saying that the Jews wanted to be captured and tortured and then finally liberated during the holocaust cause they had nothing else better to do for the weekend...And then the subplot, or I suppose the plot of the social worker who get's a dose of his own prejudicial medicine by becoming the thing that he initially hates whom in the end he looks to as brother...A movie for pseudo-intellectuals who can look over the apparent questions and only look at the race/prejudice issue, and get meaning out of this. Completely stupid, utterly a waste, and not a shred of intellectualism in it what so ever.It's a scathing review because I myself am somewhat angered that I was suckered into this. However, PT Barnum speaks to me from the grave and reminds me that a sucker is born every minute.Oh, and for all of you out there thinking that this is so original and edgy and never been done before, it has. It was done in an episode of the Outer Limits Entitled 'The Grell'. It came out ten years ago. Only difference is that the budget was considerably lower, and the story only needed about 45 minutes to the get the point across, and not nearly 2.5 hours...However, It's not entirely fair to say that it's unoriginal because the Outer Limits has nearly covered just about every subject imaginable... But there it is. Technically speaking Babylon 5 did it with the Narn and the Centari, and so did Battlefield Earth, and even that was better then this...",1,110,224,25 August 2009

","that's not really all that fair...or maybe I could say: 'Micheeeaalll, Micheeeeealll' And then have the frog brothers jump out of their comic shop to do some serious damage on some po-dunk Vampire Arse.Which again isn't really fair but in all honesty if you did combine Lost Boys with Interview with the Vampire and sprinkle in some teen movie angst you generally have this film.It wasn't so much that the story line was bad. It was original, or at least as original of a story you can get in the 21st century. However what really killed it was that it was so melodramatic and over acted, I could not take anyone seriously.And it is obvious to anyone with half a brain that this movie is marketed to emo, angst ridden, dark teenage girls. But it was just so absurd, and so overplayed that it made it hard to get into the world.I don't know, maybe as I get older I expect more. And maybe that is the refinement of age is that the things that amused me as a child don't even scratch the surface anymore.And again, it's not the story so much as the acting. The majority of the dialogue was one worded, stuttered phrases that were just a slight bit above Neanderthal grunts.There was no real character development, and it seemed as if everyone was tossed into the mix solely because they were in the book, which I did not read.As always with any movie based upon the book one must keep in mind that the movie is BASED on and NOT the book itself so of course certain liberties must be taken. Dramatic license is expected. However with movies that are based on books it always seems that the film makers are either trying to cram too much book into the movie, and producing a random disjointed film that makes a bad film.Or.Not having enough of the book and changing too many things around, thus angering and upsetting the fans who made the series popular in the first place.In the end, it was amusing to me from the first moment that Edward appeared in the cafeteria. Almost as if walking out of a Calvin Klein ad of the 90's. Wind blowing in his hair, even though he was indoors. A cold, mysterious stare, a hip and cool air about it...So overplayed that I started laughing...But again, I am not a young girl just hitting puberty, and I have long since been that age when hormones were raging and overly dramatic romances inspired me.Perhaps I am just too old for this sort of thing, or perhaps this sort of thing is just as ridiculous as it was back in my youth.The fact remains that I do like a bit of cheese now and then, and I do enjoy a cheesy teen romance.This however was cheese that took itself way too seriously.",5,1,4,24 March 2009

","Often times when I talk about a movie I find it necessary to talk about how bad it is. Sometimes a film is so bad, it's good. Sometimes a film is so bad that it is painful.This film was so bad, that it was good. It was absurd, preposterous, over the top, and absolutely without any merit of intelligence what so ever.The gags were repeated for the sheer fact of filler space because of the lack of any real content. Literally, Three different death defying car/chase sequences with three totally different cars. Three death defying chase sequences with two different airplanes. And one death defying chase scene with a boat.One idiotic cliché after the other, silly little sight gags and about 45 minutes way too long.But you know what? In the end we laughed our collective @$$es off it was so funny. And in the parking lot the best that could be said was that it was better then the made for TV movie 'Aftershock' done by Hallmark.A movie like this you certainly don't go for the intelligence, you go for a brain stew. It can only exist to turn your gray matter into a puddle of goo, and in that it succeeded.Yes I rated it as awful, and it is. But it's so awful that you really should go see it just because it's so awful.",1,85,149,13 November 2009

","This was quite honestly, the best movie my wife and I have seen all summer (And my wife and I have seen a lot of movies this summer). There is absolutely nothing to complain about.The casting was good, the script was good, the continuity was good, the ending was good. Everything about it was good.Robert DeNiro practically stole the show with his scenes. I don't want to go into it, because it would ruin the enjoyment.At certain points of the film, I felt some shades of 'Princess Bride'. Not in plot, but in styling. Much of the dialogue and the chemistry is very reminiscent of that book/film.I just can't stop smiling, cause I just really really enjoyed this film. What was nice about it too was that it was original. It wasn't a rehashed follow the formula sequel. A lot of people said that it was like Shrek for grownups. That is rather odd, cause if you think about it, Shrek was for grownups in the first place.But if I had to compare it to something that already exists I would say this; It's a little of the above mentioned Princess Bride, with a touch of the Tenth Kingdom, and a twist of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...just a twist mind you...I know some people whined that it didn't hold up to the book... Quite frankly I never read the book, but do plan on purchasing it, and reading it. However if anyone in their right mind ever thinks that a movie is going to be everything the book was especially in the 21st century, then that person is either deluded, or does not see very many movies. Besides most people never even knew that this was a book to begin with until it was made into a movie, so quit complaining.It was a great film, with a great story, who cares if it didn't follow every little action and what not... Besides from what I have read of the ending of the book vs the ending of the movie, I prefer the movie ending rather than the typical dramatic bittersweet ending of the book...so nya >8-PMy wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and will most definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD.",10,1,1,17 August 2007
I Am Legend," boe_dye's infectious review >8^P
","The movie get's an 'eh' from me.I appreciated the story well enough, and will smith did his normally fantastic job as an actor. to date i don't think i have ever seen him in anything that i did not like.However, what really did it in for me was the stupid looking CGI. is Hollywood ever going to learn that computer generated imagery is like make up, it's best used to enhance what is already there, not try to create something that's not.it took near 2/3 of the film before me and my wife realized that all the 'creatures' looked like the mummy (the brandon fraiser one)Would it have been so hard to take a cue from movies such as resident evil, or perhaps 28 weeks/days later and made freakishly evil looking dogs? Truthfully i don't think i cared much for the movie. while i do know that the story was written way back in the 50's (don't quote me on that), i guess it's just that i have seen successors beyond this that makes me feel like i have heard the story over and over again.If you want a simple explanation of what this felt like, would simply be to say that it felt like castaway meets 28 days later.And the story wasn't all that bad but the ending, and apparently i am in the majority on this, was so random and quick and really didn't help the strength of the film any. Now from what i understand, the same thing happens in all three versions of this film, which apparently is the same thing that happens in the book. quite honestly with all that was going on at the time i think that this movie could have deviated from it's predecessors and done something different. it certainly was strong enough to stand on it's own two feet and do that. and it certainly wouldn't have seemed so anti climatic.So i would say that it while it wasn't bad, it certainly is not worth seeing in theatres (not that it's much of a point to say now as it has nearly run it's course)but might not be bad for a rainy night DVD rental.",6,1,2,27 December 2007
Transformers," boe_dye says... Baweep Granaweep Ninibong!
","Okay, that was kinda lame...Anywho, in my particular tradition of knowing that you already know what the movie is about I will spare you all yet another long and drawn out rehashing of what the movie was about and tell you all what I thought...Besides, that's what the plot/synopsis link is for...Moving on... I liked it... I liked a lot to tell you the truth.Many people knock Michael Bay. I really don't understand why. Before I even knew who Bay was, I have enjoyed his movies...See, when it comes to taking a cartoon and/or comic book and making it into a large scale movie there is a little thing that takes place called dramatic license. Way to many fan boys simply can't comprehend it, and usually whine about stupid things like 'Oh Megatron didn't look like Megatron', or 'Soundwave didn't look like Soundwave', or 'There was no All-Spark', or 'Bumble-Bee wasn't a Camaro, and was a yellow bug instead', and let's not forget 'it didn't even sound like Starscream', or how about 'Devestator wasn't a tank, he was a Constructacon'.Yeah, well robots don't bend like the do in cartoons either...Some dramatic license can be bad, like the debacle that was Spider-Man III, but don't get me started on that one... At least not here...Either way, to answer all those gripes, Megatron would have looked absolutely ridiculous as a handgun/cannon. When was the last time you actually saw/owned a boom box? The all spark didn't replace energon, it was something entirely different, and you have to admit a Volkswagen bug, at least in this case, has no menacing bad @$$ qualities as say a Chevy Camaro...Although they did kinda over do the whole GMC plug...A whiny tenor voiced Starscream would have been annoying in five minutes, and as far as Devesator went, well if you are really so upset over that then there really isn't much that can be said that isn't painfully obvious...Okay, so how was the movie? The movie was good. It was of course action packed. Eye Candy GALORE! But then again for this type of movie, you don't really go for deep meaningful character development, or in depth philosophical enlightenment...That's like going to see Star Wars for the dialog. No one in their right mind would want to see Star Wars for the god-awful dialogue that Lucas somehow managed to cobble together. You go because you want to see epic Light Saber Battles. Same difference here.We want to see massive robots kicking the tar out of each other, making that cool 'eh ah oo' sound that they make when they transform.At times the camera's were a little too in your face. A little too fast perhaps as well. At times it was somewhat hard to comprehend the action; you knew it was going on, but at the same time it looked jumbled and messy.Another critique I have, and this is going to sound odd, is the choice of voicing for Optimus Prime. I know, I know, using Peter Cullen because he was the original was like a dream of dampness to many, but at the same time Optimus sounded a bit old, and understandably so. I personally felt that Hugo Weaving who voiced Megatron would have sounded perfect for this Optimus Prime. But that's just me.Megatron, in this movie almost acted, sounded, and just a little bit even looked more like Galvatron then anything else... Which was kinda cool.Which in that case, what they could've done would have been to call up Leonard Nimoy (who still has a great voice, and sounds much as he did when he voiced Galvatron) and had him voice Megatron and have Hugo Weaving do Optimus. At least that way the bad guy would be gravely and hard while the good guy would be a bit more smoother... But again, nothing that would make me change my opinion of the film...In the end, it was a pretty cool movie with lot's of pretty colors, and well done cgi, (and maybe perhaps some left over Episode One sound effects). Had a simple to the point story, and left me with happy thoughts......doom doom dooooom the end...October 21, 2007*The DVD Review*So 'x' amount of time has passed and the movie that was in theaters in now finally on film. i, having enjoyed this enough to actually buy it on DVD, decided that perhaps it would be an interesting thing to write about any other thoughts that may have come up in my second viewing of this film.Movies often times seem different the second time around.My general reaction is still pretty much the same. it's a pretty good flick. the gmc plugging was just as annoying, and the movies effects and action sequences were more then enough for me to forget about it.I made a comment above that i would like to retract however, and that was about optimus prime sounding a bit too old. in my second viewing of this film i found nothing that sounded dated whatsoever. peter Cullen was a good choice to rehash optimus. i still think that they could have easily gotten away with using Leonard nimoy as mega tron, but perhaps that will be something for the sequels...One last thing that i can say before i sign off, is that the choice of music was too distracting. battle for honor and humanity, by tomoyasu hotei (i think i spelled that right, but just in case the 'kill bill' theme), and the linkin park end song are simply to popular to be used effectively for a movie. soundtracks ought to have original music for the movie, or at the very least music that isn't all that popular.",9,4,7,11 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," How can you be the ruling governmental body and still call yourself 'the rebellion'?
","There are two was to look at this film. One, as a standalone film that has nothing to do with anything and two, as a film that assumes to shoulder the responsibility of thirty plus years of history, fandom and anticipation.As a film it's convoluted with no real coherent plot or point. You have zero time to actually feel or care about the characters as they just move along from scene to scene, moment to moment without any real cohesion. One minute Poe is getting escorted off the bridge by the purple haired Admiral's guards, the next he is standing in front of her having a nice chat moments before committing mutiny.Rose and Finn are entirely throwaway characters that add nothing to the over all story. How a former janitor is able to defeat the highly trained, and skilled Storm Trooper Captain Phasma is beyond belief. However as most have come accept as believable is that anyone can come to the fight without any prior training and win, just because they believe.Rose on the other hand, valiantly 'saves' Finn from himself as he is about to sacrifice hisself in order to save the remaining rebellion from destruction, because she suddenly finds herself in love with him for no real reason whatsoever.Snoke, while having had a great deal of potential to be interesting was little more than another CGI villain, who met a quick end by the hand of Emo Darth Vader.It took me a while to reconcile what I was seeing, but the best way I can describe most of the movie is that it was more like going to an Anime or Star Wars convention where everyone is dressing up as their favorite characters and playing caricatures of someone else.As a Star Wars Film, it was a complete and utter travesty. Some have compared the unfavorable reviews to the unfavorable reviews that Empire had received in 1980. At the least, you could say that the negative reviews then were more shocked at the darker nature of the film, although the film stayed within it's nature. Others have argued that it's mostly angry white men hating on the film, but seeing as how it the crowd that I was with consisted with two men (including myself), and three women, there was no one who had anything positive to say about what was seen, and the general consensus was that it was Star Wars in name only and lacked any of the depth or understanding of the actual universe or characters.Kylo Ren continues to be an Emo Sith Lord, who ironically is the only one who suggests to Rey that perhaps they could team up and do something different other than be a Jedi or Sith. Of course Rey, who we also find to be no one or nothing of any relevance, aligns herself with the Jedi (or Luke Skywalker) for some reason or another. To be sure, there is no real reason why she would have any attachment to anyone as there is simply no development as to why she should care in any capacity.Luke is now a curmudgeon who just endlessly wallows in self-pity and instead of being the wise old, warrior sage that we had all waited 30 years for, instead turns out to be a weak, cowardly, broken man who maunders around his island, milking four breasted sea monsters for blue milk.Leia can apparently survive the vacuum of space and NOT kill everyone on the ship as she opens the door from the outside to let herself back in after getting blown out by an explosion, and Yoda can affect the corporeal world by summoning lightning and burning down trees.I'm thoroughly convinced now that Disney is bent on vandalizing the institution of Star Wars to make a point. I find it hard to believe that a multi-billion dollar company could screw up a movie that badly, however here we are. The truth is that it wasn't a good film. Sure there was a very cool scene where The Admiral plows her ship through the First Order Fleet at light speed, but otherwise this movie was little more than CGI cut scenes, explosions, and space ships. To it's detriment, it tried to sprinkle on some philosophy and metaphysics, however such things are way beyond it's pay grade, though it might sound deep and meaningful if all you ever read are young adult novels, or watch nothing but anime...And I mean the newer anime, not the older anime that was in no way meant for children....As an institution Star Wars is dead. It might be good for the fans looking for little more than a sticker slapped on a plastic box, but for those that want something to sink their teeth into, there are about 30 years worth of books that actually tell a proper sci-fi story. It was about 45 minutes too long and watching Chewbacca suddenly decide not to eat a Porgie (after capturing, killing, skinning and cooking one over the fire) because all the other Porgies were giving him sad eyes was just unnecessary and like the rest of the film left me saying 'wait, wha?'.",1,2,3,13 January 2018

","I must admit, I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. I also didn't expect Samuel L. Jackson to play slide and sing blue either.Cinemark of Beaver County PA does this frequently. They advertise movies in the lobby, get you all excited about seeing it, and then disappoint you by not showing it...I Expected that with such a great cast of Jackson and Ricci and even a former N'Syncer (Timberlake), that this movie would at least have shown for a week. But nay, at that time if I remember correctly MI3 was showing on 3 screens (that or some other type of supposed blockbuster).Like Blues Brothers, and Crossroads, this movie incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about. Passion, and hard times. Religion and Sex. Hell Hounds of the past. Redemption. I mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work.This was just a good all around story. Of course, not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging spiders. But it does have Samuel L. Jackson...Think of what happens to Jacksons character from Pulp Fiction after he walks the earth and settles down and that essentially describes him to a 'T'.Great and underrated, but aren't all the good ones like that anyway?",9,1,4,26 July 2007
The Dark Knight," boe_dye sez: Surprisingly, this is more like Batman 2.5
","Let me first say that I myself am surprised for only giving it 4 stars. When I first saw this film, and first reviewed it I had given it 10 shiny stars...However upon my second viewing of it, something turned me completely off to it.Now, in all honesty this movie for me could be looked upon like a very expensive sushi dinner: Everything is beautiful: All the players involved were amazing. The scenery was incredible, the dialogue (with the minor exception of Christian Bales' 9000 cigarette a day Batman voice) we not over the top in any way. The story line was well thought out, and well played.I mean from that standpoint you really can't say anything bad.It had substance, and wasn't just all fluff. It really was a 10 star film! So why do I only give it 4 stars? Well, like any high class restaurant, appearance and presentation, and quality of the food is simply the the beginning. And this film had it all, really it did.However, it lacked one thing for me, and that is...Taste...It simply left a bad flavor in my mouth and it took me the better part of a day to figure out why.With a film that is so incredible on every level, it did exactly what so many films before it has done, and failed miserably at every single time.Trying to fit in too much.The 'more bang for your buck' mentality.I was simply enjoying Heath Ledgers performance, and honestly did not seem him on the screen anywhere. He was Joker all the way. Sinister, psychotic, mad. Simply amazing.But where it killed it for me was with Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Yes he acted it well, yes the makeup artists were phenomenal. I mean everything about him was good.Except that all of his character should have been saved for Batman 3! Partway through the movie, it almost seemed that The Dark Knight could have ended, and another film began.It wasn't one particular point per say, but more of an overlapping of ideas. Here we are following the Joker, and then the Joker's story starts to overlap with Harvey Dents story.Like Venom in Spider-Man 3, Harvey Dent while integral to the story became an after thought.A very strong after thought mind you, but an after thought none the less.They could have done so much more with his character and the end result of The Dark Knight could have very easily been incorporated more into a third film.But instead they chose to cram as much as they could into one film, and there you have it.Had I done it, I would have had the transformation of Dent as the cliffhanger to the Dark Knight, and made an entirely different story line based more on Dent/Two-Face in a 3rd film.It is this reason that the film left a bad taste in my mouth.Petty? Over reacting? Nit Picking? Maybe so, maybe not. However, as most avid film viewers know it usually only takes one thing to screw up a great film, and for me, this was it.",4,8,16,20 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," oh my, a summer movie that was worthwhile to see!
","now there are, of course, two ways too look at this. One way is by looking at it from the perspective of the die hard Harry Potter fan who has the book memorized and would get all upset over the little things.The second way is to look at it as a film based on a book...Now, again and again I understand that to cram 900 pages into a 2 hour film you are going to need to do a little editing. Chances are you are going to want to focus on the main events of the story, and give the viewer a good taste of just about every. You certainly don't want to cram in every little element you can possibly cram into it just because it was in the book. You want the movie to have flow, you want the movie to be enjoyable.And this was...This was a very enjoyable movie (aside from the increase in people who feel the need to talk and text on their phones in the theater). The story was well told. There was good flow and the continuity was very easy to follow unlike the previous too movies which just seemed to be somewhat disjointed...My wife did comment on how she thought that the Weasley Rebellion could have been a bit grander, but that was really the only complaint that she could have warranted.As far as little plot holes, i felt that they kinda dropped the Cho/Harry relationship a little too quickly. It was like okay here they are, and then we don't hear anything about them at all after that. Then they sort of talk about it later, and loosely tie it up. But then again, the Cho/Harry thing was a subplot and you shouldn't get all upset over that.What else is there... Oh, Voldemort sort of looks like Marilyn Manson in a scene or two... And Harry's Scar somehow appears and disappears from time to time...Anything more then that is just mindless ramblings that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, so I shall stop here.",10,0,2,15 July 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," boe_dye sez: It was such a great concept, and then they ruin it with a sequel.
","In the first Matrix, we were given riddles and hyperbolies, along with esoteric sight gags so to speak, as well as a bit of philosophical meanderings.Coupled with Anime Style fight scenes and ground breaking cinematography, the original is in a class all its own....Like all great movies, someone realizes that its a huge money maker and goes and ruins it by making it a franchise. A fast food, super sized, version of the original.And like most of Hollywood, they figure that most people simply want to see epic fight scenes and explosions and car chases and oodles of mental masturbation supplied by the wonders of C.G.I.Which really is what hurt this film the most. It tried too hard to be deep and philosophical. Yes, the names of the majority of characters lent some inspiration towards a philosophical dialogue, but in the end the whole movie was treated as a porn: 'Okay, enough talking, let's just get to the action'.That really was what all of the dialogue and philosophy was in place for, at least in this particular film.Instead we have a few moments of 'wow that was really deep' in order to break the monotony of 'wow that was a really cool explosion!'.Which ultimately is why this movie fails on so many levels. Sure you could look at it from the college academia nut stand point, build a whole belief system on it, and tell everyone how deep the movie was. And admittedly I do own 'The Matrix and Philosophy', which is a real book by the way, but only to understand some of the more embedded sight gags.However in the end, the movie made itself way too complicated by introducing the idea that there were more then one 'Ones', and that Zion has been destroyed, and rebuilt 'x' amount of times.When all was said and done, one must wonder then what exactly was the point? Sure all of the philosophical breaks about 'choice' and 'causality', and 'no spooning', made a great deal of sense, but over all it made the story a bit convoluted.Sadly, it only get's worse when Matrix Revolutions came out as the majority of that movie was about 20 minutes of philosophy and an hour and thirty minutes of Mechs, Marital Arts, and Dragon Ball Z.",6,0,0,3 January 2009
30 Days of Night," boe_dye's review of 28 and 2 days of night later...
","Now, i wont say it was bad.I wont say it was good.I will say that it was bloody, and gory and lottsa people died very bloody and gory deaths....First off, let's get one thing straight. it's a freaking vampire movie. if you can't get beyond that then you really have no business walking into the theatre.So me and my wife didn't really go into this thinking that it was going to be some kinda epic story that had tons of character development.At first thought we figured that aside from the obvious it was going to be a vampire movie that at the very least seemed to have a quasi original ideae. instead of the vampires having the weakness of always having be in bed during the day, they can now roam free and slaughter all day long cause in alaska once a year the sun doesn't shine for about 30 days.... But then as the movie progressed something started to feel somewhat familiar... lottsa people getting slaughtered by blood thirsty undeads... always hiding out and huddling in the corners. keeping quiet so they cannot be found... scavenging the grocery store so in order to find food...Wait a minute... this sounds a whole lot like 28 days later!!!! I totally understand that it is rather difficult to come up with an original idea nowadays, but at least having somewhat of a unique spin on it? The vampires looked like something out of a resident evil (the game) and one of them looked like jocelyn wildenstein. and i could have sworn that at some points they were speaking something that sounded a lot like klingonese (at least that's what it was originally called in trouble with tribbles...) The end like way to many movies nowadays was anti-climatic, and left me wanting. almost like the same feeling that you get when you eat Chinese takeout... what was the point? I could go on and on about the why not do this, or why not do that. but it would be quite pointless.On the plus side, there were some new types of footage used here and there. and unlike like 'saw' where they make it as gory and absurd as possible the carnage does have the ability to make one wince from time to time....In the end, my final thought while as the credits rolled was that blade could have taken care of the whole town in about ten minutes...Selene could have done it in about 15, but only cause she's much more aesthetically pleasing on camera.",5,1,4,21 October 2007
Black Panther," CGI Rhino's and Moar
","In typical Marvel fashion, this latest movie adaptation of a comic book was as solid as the rest. The casting was good, the acting was good, the story was good, generally speaking this movie was for all intents and purposes, good. Shuri was certainly the most fun character, T'Challa inspires honor, dignity and humility with an 'always do right' attitude, M'Baku was just cool, Romanda was stately as a true Queen ought be, and Kill-Monger was a tragic, but despicable villain who carried with him years of misplaced rage -- they were all well portrayed, and quite believable.And therein lies the problem: It doesn't stand out in any real way, nor does it inspire repeat watchings, or even the need for a sequel. It simply melts into the Marvel Cinematic Universe without making any real or significant impact. It was a fun movie, but despite the hype surrounding it, and despite the overblown political nature, it was, in a very strange way, bland.That arguably is the biggest problem that the Haus of Maus faces with all of it's major blockbusters now: They have gotten so good at the formula, that they aren't daring, nor are they even trying anymore. They cookie cutter the formula over and over again, change a few things here and there, and call it a new movie. We are essentially living in an age of Pop-Movies, where there is little difference between A and B, other than the physical appearance, and maybe a little bit of dialogue here and there.After a while though, I started to feel a bit bothered in that a great deal of this movie felt trope-y, in that it had an idea of Africa, without really actually being African. Kind of like how many of us imagined China-Town was after watching Big Trouble in Little China, this started to feel like it was more of an Idea of what Africa was all about, rather than what Africa is all about. Naturally of course that makes sense as Wakanda is an idealized destination, however parts of it felt more like a Disney ride, exploiting the imagery associated with what folks might typically associate with Africa.Again, it wasn't bad, but it didn't really leave me with much other than being offended at the constant white jokes and jabs, and the turning the children in the end into little more than a stereotype where they said 'we can take this apart and sell the pieces', referring to T'Challa's hover-ship that landed in the middle of an Oakland California Basketball Court.However, I do understand why they made this movie, and the meta-narrative behind it is... a curious thing, if you understand the story.",7,2,4,28 February 2018
Beowulf," boe_dye's scathing review of this ruined epic.
","This movie, was by far the most awful trash i have ever had to sit through. it was terrible.Now, i will admit i have never actually read the original story, so understand that this is coming solely from a cinematic stand point.I like epic movies, i like stories and characters that are larger then life. all that i know about beowulf is just that. an epic tale of good vs evil, a struggle between powers. battles so huge that the very mention of them strikes fear into your soul. characters that legends are made out of.That sort of thing.This movie, however was so pathetic that within 90 seconds i wanted to leave.It (the film) was just screaming 'good lord, why do i exist because the audience knows that this story is so much grander, and yet i am merely a sick sad portrayal of one of the oldest stories known to man.'What really killed it was the CGI. now, i knew going into it, that it heavily relied on CGI. i am not going to be one of the snotty critics who thumb their noses at technology, it certainly has it's place. but this essentially made fun of the story.Grendel didn't look evil, he looked pathetic. he looked like a walking pile of burnt marshmallows and the mummy (from the mummy, 1999). and any emotion and inflection that the characters might have felt were all lost on the CGI.Try to imagine the LOTR trilogy trying to be serious if the whole thing was made to look like shrek or the polar express (and at times there were some scenes that made you think of shrek). Imagine frodo and his look of anguish and pain and desperation because of the burden of the ring being taken away because he looks like mr conductor, and that basically is what you get.Now what was done with polar express, i liked. it fit the story. this however is what destroyed the story. any cartoon character can ride a dragon and do unbelievable things, it's really nothing special. but seeing man. a real flesh and blood man kill a demon child, or a fire breathing dragon with his bare hands, that is the stuff of legends. yeah i understand that there needs to be CGI enhancement to make a human do certain things on screen, but not CGI with human enhancements. thats like an ugly woman putting on 3 inches of makeup and 10 gallons of perfume so that she looks beautiful....Oh, and angelina jolie looked AWFUL. nude or not nude, she looked ridiculous. imagine what lara croft really looks like in tomb raider and you get the idea......okay maybe not that bad but close......And to make matters worse, according to the other two film goers that were in the theatre (one of whom had actually read the original story), the ending was changed...This movie, to me, seemed to be desperately trying to ride on the coattails of 300. now yes, i know the script was being written in 97 and 300 (TPB) was written in 98. and regardless of which on was shot first, the point is, which one was released first. a lot can happen between here and now.300 is a perfect example of what this movie could have been.In the end, what the Hollywood trend seems to be following is this; let's try to copy what the real artists are doing and make our own version of it. kinda like what go-bots were to transformers. and while we are at it, let's make it so that the kids can see it too so instead of making it what it should be, lets water it down to pg13 and make more money out of it.I would suggest anyone wanting to see to simply not. it isn't even worth the time to watch online.",1,10,19,18 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," The Last Action Hero Is Officially DEAD!
","Now I could go on and write you a long summary of the movies plot. But you already know what the movie is about and the only reason you are reading this is because you want to know what I thought of the movie...That is what a review is.The story line was okay, and would have been better under a different name, but certainly not Die Hard. It was like watching Swordfish only with more action.This McClain was more like the recent cops that Bruce Willis has played (Ergo Hartigan from Sin City, and Jack Mosley from 16 blocks). An old tired beat cop who just wants to take it easy and get a promotion.The action sequences are very tired, and boring. Certainly nothing like crawling through an elevator shaft barefoot, or getting ejected out of a cockpit before it explodes, or even hanging off a bridge by a steel cable as a truck is about ready to swing onto a boat.Nay, it is mostly machine guns, explosions, and fisticuffs. Nothing that no one has seen before. Not that all of those aren't important to the Die Hard Franchise, but at least in the previous movies they were all larger then life.The dialog is bland as well. There is no wisecracking McClain. His chemistry with Justin Long is... Eh. After a while it felt more like watching 'I'm a Mac, and I'm a PC'. Long is the hip and with it, and Willis is old and outdated.Olyphant as the antagonist was boring as well. His character was more of a whiny emo anti-hero then an actual bad guy. Which is a trend we see more and more in movies; having the conflicted character who sees things differently then an actual bad guy.There was of course some humour to the film, Kevin Smith's character basically made the film...The end of the movie was very dry and without any type of excitement. It just ended...The best way for me do describe it would be to compare it to the previous three films...Die Hard - McClain pulls a gun taped to his his back and with only two shots left, pops the bad guy in the head and Hans in the shoulder and while Hans is dangling from the edge of the Towers, McClain unlatches Holly's watch and we see Hans slowly falling to his death. Very epicDie Hard II - McClain, opens the fuel line of the plane and falls to the ground after getting into a fist fight with Col. Stewrart on the wing of said plane and then ignites the fuel with his trusty zippo while uttering the famous Yippe Kay Ya, and blows up all the bad guys while making a landing light for Holly. Unbelievable? Unlikely? Yes and YES, but it's DIE HARD for goodness sake! Die Hard III - Looks Simon in the eye as Simon is shooting at him from the helicopter with a machine gun, says the Yippe Kay Ya, and shoots the power line causing it to get tangled in the rotor blades, causes Simon to die in a fiery death.Die Hard VI - Mumbles the Yippy Kay Ya Mother (f garbled mumbled line) shoots himself through the shoulder and kills the bad guy. Nothing epic, and just kinda ends with the possibility of the most unlikely dating scenario you could ever think of.So basically this is what we get. A no chain smoking, no f-bombing, no wise cracking McClain. A bad guy who really isn't a bad guy, but instead is some cranked off computer nerd trying to get even with the government for not buying him a pony... er wait, for not listening to him. And a PG13 rating so kids can see it.IF KIDS WERE ABLE TO SEE THE FIRST THREE RATED R FILMS, AND OBVIOUSLY LIKED THEM ENOUGH TO SEE A FOURTH ONE, WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU WATER IT DOWN TO PG-13??? So, there is my review. Die Hard in name only, and would have been a good story had it not been a Die Hard Movie...",3,4,7,2 July 2007
The Matrix," boe_dye sez: has it been ten years already?!
","I can remember seeing this in the theatre so long ago. I remember going to the movies, having an expectation that it was about aliens or perhaps some type of over the top b-movie, and then being totally blown away by just about everything that was in front of my face, and then blown even further away after learning about all of the symbolic meanings hidden throughout the film.And 10 years later, my wife and I decided to pop in a DVD and try out our new 42in LCD and sure enough the movie still blows my mind.Sure you can still enjoy this movie for the sole purpose of the eye candy. The story line while not directly original, was at the very least original to the generation who watched it.1999 was certainly the tail end of the appeal to the so-called cyber-punk genre. Previous we had the wonders of Blade Runner, Hackers, and Johnny Neumonic just to name a few. But this movie set a standard.Borrowing ideas from Anime, Post-Apocalyptic dystopia, and Terminator, and doing what Star Wars did for Generation X in the 80's by giving us 'The Force' and amazing ways to shoot models in epic space battles, this did for Generation Nintendo in the 90's by inventing new ways to use camera angles, and 'bullet time', as well as giving us the idea to 'unplug from the Matrix'.It gave 'woah' a totally new meaning, as well as catch phrases like 'there is no spoon', and 'see how deep the rabbit hole goes'.You can watch this movie two ways: For the utter enjoyment of what you see is what you get, or in the double meaning catch phrase by seeing 'how deep the rabbit hole goes', you can learn all of the philosophy that went into it, which there is quite a bit.A movie that brings back memories, it is certainly my favorite movie of all time. It was kind of a bummer that the sequels were more about flash and fire as opposed to substance and thought.But the great thing about this movie is that it does end with an ending that doesn't need to be taken as a cliffhanger. It can be taken as somewhat open ended, but with a great deal of finality.A great supplement to this film would be the Animatrix series which gives a great back story and history to how the humans and the machines started fighting each other in the first place. It also provides some other short stories which in many cases are better then the 2 sequels.",10,0,0,3 January 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Crap and something that looks like a cheese doodle...
","When a movie that was based entirely on 20 years of television comes to the silver screen, you want to see something that you cannot see on T.V. You want to see more then just the same thing...(BTW, I have a copy on VHS of the very first Simpson's Episode, The Christmas Episode one that most of the people who watch the Simpsons today have never, and probably will ever see...Basically saying, I am not just some guy who just discovered the Simpsons, I grew up with it) Essentially this movie was exactly what it said it was in the very beginning and we are total fools for paying for something that we can see on television for free...There was nothing special about this. There was nothing that you couldn't see on television.I think the main flaw with this movie was that instead of making a full length movie (which time wise it was), was that they took a half hour episode, and stretched it out filling in the gaps with something that was supposed to humor...The thing that makes show is that it gets to the point. It is a satire first and foremost, with a little bit of slapstick throw in between.If it is too long, it just gets boring. I mean I totally get the political references, and I get the sight gags. But so what? All they did was act as fillers to make a very short story way to long.Take the Southpark Movie: Bigger Longer Uncut (now I am not comparing them in humor or style, but merely as a parallel to TV to movie porting...) The creators of Southpark are under certain restrictions, as are the Simpsons creator. What they can show, what they can say etc. Southpark is very much a show designed for older audiences. Much like the Simpsons were in their original incarnation. Dark Humor. The thing is, is that when the Southpark movie was made, the essentially took every little thing that they couldn't do on television, and exploited it on the Big Screen.'F' this, 'F' that, no censorship etc. They really tried to make it over the top. I mean aside whether or not you liked the movie is irrelevant, the point is, is that you got to see lots of stuff that you wouldn't normally see...Another parallel could be the upcoming '24' movie. Again, the fans of the show want to see 24, but they don't want to see the 24 they see on television. They want to see the 24 to the extreme.In the end, there are 20 years of Simpsons episodes. That roughly 600 hours (give or take). You could buy the first few years DVD's and get more out of it then this movie gave us.Thankfully, I didn't pay to see this...",2,8,15,30 July 2007
