The Avengers," Highly overrated!
","Don't know what people linked in the movie... the action starts pretty late almost 1 hr into the film, action sequences pretty common based in city streets as seen in a few other movies, though little comedy by hulk makes action scenes bearable. One other thing 'why would the army build by Loki be of aliens'... thats funny right, why will be the person claiming to be God have an army of powerless aliens with guns and spaceships...The first hour of the movie is a bit drag and feels like the director had to try real hard to put things together to make some sense (which totally did not) and after that what the movie offers in the second hour is not all that great to have waited 1 hour to get to that.",6,7,22,1 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Yes an epic, but just too dramatic, conclusion!
","Yes i liked the movie, but i guess just the hype around it, overdid my expectations. The plot starts real fast with Bane coming into the first minute of the movie and very quickly after that sets the underlying story of the movie. At no point does the movie feel like a drag.. but the only question to my mind is was the movie so dramatic.. why couldn't it have been just as simple and unexplained as in The Dark Knight, the Joker, just unexplained as he was, just enjoyed the pain in people and Batman was just helpless against him but however gets better of him in the end. Whereas here the director gives a background for justifying why Bane wanted to destroy Gotham; as he was just angry and fulfilling someone's dream. So apparently there was no fun in watching someone accomplish a mission... there has got to be some randomness.And for the dramaticism, Batman had to be broken before he could rise, he could have just been helpless and fought real hard to get through Bane with all the extra help from Robin and catwomen. For Batman's timeline that the Director gives from origin to rise, he must have been easily over 40 years old (20 base age + 7 years with Rahs al Gul + 8 years of Self exile), common he is just to old to be that quick.And for the movies timeline: 5 months plot, you gotta be kidding me...what about all the SWAT teams national guards, Marshalls and every others guard possible could have done a better job.But in the end its all justified till you don't feel bored, and the movie just did exactly that.",7,1,3,3 August 2012
