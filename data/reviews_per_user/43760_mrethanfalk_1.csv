Come and See," A Traumatizing Epic
","'Come and See' was a film in which I really had trouble watching and enjoying. It goes without saying though that Elem Klimov deserves to be praised for his brilliant film-making. He was really able to effectively encapsulate this tragic event through the use of disturbing sounds and horrifying visuals, though it's a movie that would pain me to sit through again. It's one thing to remember and reflect on brutal, historical events, but to be involved in them first hand(which is what the movie essentially does to you), is truly overwhelming for the psyche. A film like 'Schindler's List,' on the other hand, is something I can sit through several times without feeling as 'mentally abused.' I recognize that this was exactly what Klimov wanted to evoke in me. His intentions were geared towards having me take part in this war alongside the films protagonist Florya. The film forces you to use all of your senses, making it a truly disturbing 2 1/2 hour journey.",7,1,1,13 December 2011
