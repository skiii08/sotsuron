Hereditary," I didn't like this movie
","This movie didn't have much of a storyline and was very slow.SPOILER ALERTThe only time the movie was interesting was when the daughter died but even then it was pretty slow it felt like I was watching paranormal activity and just waiting for something interesting to happen.
The movie finishes with secrets about the grandmother being in a cult .. because who couldn't see that coming.
the family gets sacrificed so that the boy in the film can become the quote unquote 'cult god'.
This movie just felt like it was thrown together and i don't see what's so 'Scary' about it whatsoever.
Sorry my honest opinion",1,0,3,15 March 2019
Split," This is one of the best movies I've seen
","Split is an amazing movie I don't know how they did it but they managed to make you really feel the main antagonist's different personalities.
I was so impressed with the story and I loved every second watching it.
Everything was in depth and it felt like it was well planned.
The movie definitely lived up to the hype and that is so rare now days.
This is a must watch for me.",10,1,4,15 March 2019
A Quiet Place," This movie was amazing
","I loved this movie it had a great storyline and you can really feel the pressure and the scares the characters are going through. It's the type of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat it even has a slight twist ending that is unexpected.
The actors were amazing and the plot and story line were even better.
I loved this new idea for their take on a post apocalyptic world.
Would recommend to anyone who loves their horror",8,0,0,15 March 2019
