Spartacus," it is brilliant
","it is a totally brilliant film,and i watched it recently as i have it on tape.i think all of the actors were well placed,the brits as the romans.the americans as the slaves.the story is sentimental and you can't help feeling sorry for the slaves.if you haven't seen it go and see it,its 100 times better than gladiator.",10,2,5,7 November 2001
