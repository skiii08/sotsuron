The Blair Witch Project," One of My favorite films!
","I enjoyed 'The Blair Witch Project'! It wasn't really scary to me, but it was enjoyable. The ending was very suspenseful and the acting was extremely convincing. I know that many people have had negative comments about the film. All I can say is that it is a shame that they couldn't enjoy the film and give it positive reviews like others have. I can't wait to buy the DVD so that I can enjoy it as many times as I please. Thanks for taking the time to read my comments and thaughts on this great film!",Null,1,1,6 September 1999
