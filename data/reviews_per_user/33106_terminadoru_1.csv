Iron Man 3," Better than the previous two, but you're in for a great disappointment
","This was a movie that I really enjoyed. It had action, drama, comedy, mystery and a more serious tone than the previous two.One of my problems is with the way they kind of hurried the storyline. The first movie showed us how the suit is assembled: lots of technology, experiments, trial and error. The second showed us a more compact version, a newer version, but overall just some improvements in the suits. Avengers showed us the Mark 8 that chases him and connects on him while falling. But here we have technology that should have been from Iron Man 7. The leap is too great in progress, and because of that the dozens of suits that he made between movies seem cheap, hurried.But that's not why I don't give this movie a 10. The real reason is the 10 year old me that exists in the more mature me, that was very disappointed with the Mandarin. He was my favorite Iron Man villain in the comics and the animation, and in this movie they wiped the floor with him. They made him a fake, an actor playing a role. It's like going to The Dark Knight to see Joker, only to find out Joker is not real, someone else did his actions. Because of this choice, Mandarin (the one we wanted) will never have a place in the Marvel Universe. What suddenly another terrorist with the name Mandarin , that by chance has 10 rings, shows up? Big mistake Marvel, big mistake.Overall the movie was very good, and that's the reason I don't give it 5 stars. The action was solid, special effects were amazing, RDJ fantastic as always and the storyline delivers.",7,0,5,27 April 2013
