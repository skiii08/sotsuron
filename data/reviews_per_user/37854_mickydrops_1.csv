Resident Evil: Afterlife," Silly story, but just about gets away with it
","The opening and closing scenes are the visual highlights of the latest addition to this franchise, so don't be afraid to go for a bite to eat in between. You'll catch up pretty quick i.e. kill zombie, zombie bad. OK - perhaps I'm being a little cruel but the reality is, unless you're a die hard fan of this franchise, you'll be left wondering where the last 2 hours of your life went. Milla Jovovich does what she can to rescue a weak story line. No 2 scenes really add up, however she is supported by a largely talented cast. Sadly, any chance of Oscar nomination (!) is well and truly swallowed up by the movie's over reliance on special effects just for the sake of special effects. One for the 10 year old.",3,3,7,27 September 2010
