The Devil's Advocate," This film is a stylish, atmospheric delight!
","Like all of his movies, you have to expect Al Pacino, to be in full shouting glory.  This film is no exception as he yet again hits you head on with his passionate, high-octane screen presence.The Film begins slowly but builds up Kevin Lomax's character (Keanu Reeves) well, as you quickly learn that his passion to succeed and 'never lose attitude', may actually be his weakness. His wife Mary-Ann played by gorgeous as ever Charlize Theron, is extatically happy, as Kevin is promoted to join a big shot international firm.  They move from their humble home in the South, to begin a new life, in bright lights big city, New York.  Huge pay cheque, exclusive luxury apartment and a stunning gorgeous woman, paradise....or so it would seem!As Kevin begins to realise the strain of his workload, his boss John Milton (Pacino), shows signs that he not only calls the shots but is much more powerful than he's letting on.  Unfortunately Mary-Ann begins too crumble under the pressure of a new life and is distraught by seemingly deluded hallucinations.  Is it a figment of her imagination, or is what she sees, really the interceptions of Milton himself.The plot is deep and interesting, as the truth awaits Kevin...who is John Milton?  I don't want to give anymore away because it was a pleasure to discover the truth but it's worth waiting for, believe me!
What I was most surprised about in this film was Keanu Reeves' believable performance.  Nothing has challenged him like this role and I can safely say that you will be impressed.  Not that Keanu hasn't been immensly successful already but he definately should choose more roles like this.Obviously, as Pacino cannot fail to give a awe inspiring performance to his audience, the film is launched into a web of suspense and spine twisting intrigue.  His portrayal of Milton is astonishing. No one else could have played him.  For every minute Pacino graces the screen with his powerful demeanor, he holds your attention and you want more.  He had to play this part with a sense of mystery because the whole film builds up to reveal who Milton really is.  Of course, Pacino pulls this off perfectly.All in all the cast is strong, with Pacino and Reeves proving that they work well together.  Theron is also very impressive and helps the film's sinister atmosphere.  For the film it's self, not one of Pacino's best but a stylish, highly entertaining must-see.  9 out 10!",9,1,2,22 October 2001
As Good as It Gets," Flawless film which utilises the supreme cast to fruition.
","Before I even considered watching this film for the first time, I was instantly biased because of the enormity of the casts talent; there's the monumentally charismatic Jack Nicholson (who would run out of fingers to count his Oscar nominations), Helen Hunt (who has a substantial collection of Golden Globes and Grammys), Cuba Gooding Jr. (who is the finest Actor of his generation) and Greg Kinnear (who's perfectly cast amongst the latter Hollywood greats).'AS GOOD AS IT GETS' focuses on Nicholson's character Melvin, telling  the story of how he copes with having an obsessive compulsive disorder, which is evidently destructive on the lives of those who surround him.  Exhausting ritualistic patterns such as washing his hands in boiling water, forbidding anyone to physically touch him, are among just a few of his alienating habits.  Aside from apparant intimacy issues, he is also a confrontational homophobic--suffice it to say that he doesn't appreciate living next door to Simon (played by Greg Kinnear) who is a gay artist.  Upon following events,Melvin aspires to win the affections of Carol (played by Helen Hunt) who is a compassionate yet lonely waitress.  Hesitantly she opens up her heart to him and discovers that beyond his appalling behaviour, is a man who is capable of demonstrating huge acts of kindness, who has sincere feelings for her.Despite having an emotional undercurrent the film should definately be stamped as being in the comedy genre; there are many instances of noteably hilarious material, in this positively shining script, especially in the classic scene, where Simon confronts Melvin, about throwing his beloved dog down a garbage shoot.  Expect to be surprised by this film; the rareity of the magnificant script, combining with the multitude of talent in the cast, makes it magnetically engaging from start to finish.Even though I'm in great danger of becoming repetitive, I have to give some more adulation to the cast.  Jack Nicholson gave us his finest performance, unsurpassed in the attention he gave to the complexity of Melvins' character.  Helen Hunt is THE finest actress on our screens today.  In giving everything her soul had to offer, the audience was able to see the sincerity of the pain Carol was experiencing.  Whilst Helen gives you heartfelt raw emotion, she has an amazing aptitude to channel her talents for comedy too.  Some of her scenes really did affect me emotionally, willing me to literally get hold of her and give her a great big hug--proving the impact she governs upon you.If you want to see one of the most superbly acted films of the decade, then look no further 'As Good As It Gets' is, AS GOOD AS IT GETS.",10,0,0,15 March 2002

LÃ©on: The Professional," An exhilerating motion picture that delivers pure emotion.
","From the opening musical score, which is phenomenal throughout the entire Film, Luc Besson gives us one of the most stylish Character introductions seen to date.  The Cinematography is outstanding as the camera focuses on Leon (Jean Reno) and his Italian Mob friend (Danny Aiello), with subtle shots, that pan onto his dark sunglasses or the glass of milk he's drinking (which actually becomes a running theme).Almost as soon as we are introduced to the seemingly cold, calculating Leon, the heat is on and we discover that he is an unstoppable, untouchable and lethal as a professional hitman.  The way in which he displays his expertise, is visually spectacular as he kills people one by one, appealing to all fans of Action, Gore and Suspense.  It is also gripping to see Leon hunt down the last remaining 'client', making the vulnerable man sweat with fear and me be riveted to my seat in anticipation.
As the gloriously original plot continues, Leon rescues a 12 year old girl called Mathilda (Natalie Portman) from iminant death, which begins an awe inspiring relationship between the two.  It's very rare to see such impressive characterisation in a Film and Besson manages to reveal the warmer, caring side to Leon, without clouding the presence of a ruthless and fearless killer.  Without sounding too 'soppy' it has to be said that their relationship and love for each other is beautiful and is always accompanied by the captivating score.Apart from the skilled and apparant capability of Reno....Portman's portrayal of Mathilda really is atonishingly authentic.  Albeit the stars of this Film are obvious but without Gary Oldman's performance, the film would have lacked the depth and tension that is so essential to the plotline. Oldman plays a crooked, psychopathic Drug Enforcement Agent, who is significantly agitated by Leon's diligent trail of death and destruction. The scenes in which his anxiety is at it's most extreme, commands your attention and is a pleasure to watch.It is a meritorious accomplishment for a Film of this genre to have such a rich plot and character development.  The transition of Leon, devoid of any feelings, to him embracing Mathilda's affections is a paramount example. There is a strong universal appeal to all movie-lovers for this extraordinary Film and it is totally justified.I personally found it a delight to watch and am sure that Leon is one of the only Films I can watch repeatedly, without the danger of becoming dissatisfied.If the rumours about a sequel to Leon are true, then expect another superb, stylish, Action-Thriller...that will be damn near close to being perfect.",10,0,1,8 December 2001
The Fast and the Furious," An inconsistent attempt at what could have been so much more.
","Taking one of the words out of the title, I am furious that the film did not live up to its potential.  By this I mean the fact that yet again, we have a dumb Hollywood script laden with the corniest lines imaginable.  Credibility is also riding high in deficiency, when you consider the fact that Vin Diesel's character must be invincible, seeing as how he manages to escape injury, after colliding with a truck at over 150 mph.  Retreating back from the criticism for a moment, the cars in the film are breathtaking and the score certainly pumps out serious wattage--although that's the problem, the cars are the focus point and being that's the case, shouldnt Rob Cohen (the director) have constructed better action sequences, that actually had depth enough to keep his audience entertained.  You would think so.Struggling to find a commendable word to say I can only consider the aspects about the film that could have been so easily improved, given the subject matter; if you think about it fast cars, babes, violence and sex should make for a solid, thrilling 90 minutes.  Instead we settle for the sluggish, dull experience that most of us would gladly replace with GONE IN 60 SECONDS any day of the week.  Let's face it at least GONE IN 60 had Angelina, not to mention action guru Jerry Bruckheimer on board.Despite the distinct lack of praise from, well a large proportion of the western hemisphere, 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' still managed to be lucrative by taking $144 million at the US box office.  Are those Japanese imports really that amazing?",6,0,1,16 March 2002
