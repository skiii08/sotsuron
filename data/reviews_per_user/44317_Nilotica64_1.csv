The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bill did a good job
","I love the books and enjoy the movies. I felt they did a good job for the most part, the only scene I felt was real cheesy was the werewolf scene between Jacob and Sam. But how else would you do it? It was pretty much the was it was in the book. I understand why they had Jacob, Seth, and Leah in human form most the time, but missed how it was written. They had Bella looking so bad, but again that's how she was described. I would have liked a little more of the Rosalie and Jacob animosity, it was always so funny in the book, my favorite was the dog bowl scene, wish it was in the movie. Over all I enjoyed it very much and can't wait for the next one.",9,7,16,20 November 2011
