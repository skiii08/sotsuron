Come and See," Come and See; You May Hide Your Eyes
","I've seen my fair share of films about the first and second World Wars, but none quite like 'Come and See.' This film tells the story of a boy of fourteen years, Florya , who joins the Russian army in their efforts to defeat the Nazis. His excitement at going to war in the beginning of the film is enough to make you want to get out of your chair, somehow penetrate the screen, and slap him into realizing what he's about to have to witness—and worse—do. Florya's excitement, however, doesn't last long. Over the remaining two hours, we (the viewers) watch as the hands of war reach inside his very core to steal what's left of his innocent soul. With every image of Florya's perpetually aging face, we are reminded that he is just one of thousands of young boys who faced the same fate—fighting to survive. Klimov's film only depicts the fate of one Byelorussian town—there were six hundred in total! Truthfully, after watching the film, I was speechless. I didn't want to talk to anyone and I didn't want to think. I wanted to go home, crawl into my bed and hope that the ruthless brutality that had played out in the film wouldn't terrorize me in my dreams. Intense, I know.This film is a must-see. Although very difficult to watch at times, it's important that we expose ourselves to that which makes us uncomfortable; to that which we sometimes just want to forget.",9,4,5,15 December 2011
