Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: So Good it's Arousing
","I went to the Black Carpet screening of Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan in Century City. It was jam-packed with people wanting to relish in the majesty of Borat, but they only had room for 294. Even though I got there 3 hours early, I was near the end of the line when they cut it off, saying they were full. But still, people demanded extra showings as they lined up by the hundreds outside the theater. It turns out that there was much more people than 294 that they had let in, so there were two showings -- one at 9:00 and one at midnight. I was apart of the latter.The only word that could possibly be used to describe this movie is 'glorious.' Offensive to every race and only one gender, Borat is one of the funniest movies that has ever come out in the history of cinema, possibly the funniest. Sitting here, typing, it takes a lot of self control for me to keep all the good parts to myself, but then I realized there weren't any good parts. So I was thinking of telling you some of the great parts, but there weren't any of those either. The entire movie was just one f*cking fantastic film. I was laughing -- really laughing -- from start to finish. This is the best movie of 2006, and very likely the funniest movie of all time.See it.No, seriously, see it. I was at half-mast the whole time. Remember the first time you saw Scary Movie? Not Another Teen Movie? Old School? Caddyshack? Airplane? Combine all of those experiences into one, and you may have some idea of the pure and unadulterated 'win' that is Borat.Maybe.",10,5,20,22 September 2006
