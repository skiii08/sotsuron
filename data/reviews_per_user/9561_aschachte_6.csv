The Blair Witch Project," Not a bad job considering the budget
","Spoilers First off, I applaud them for making lots of money with no real investment. A hoax like this can only be done once. There were a couple of nice touches in the movie, like them trying to follow a stream and winding up in the same spot. That's freaky. Also, good acting. But the effects were extremely cheesy, like the four guys beating the sides of tent. Was I really supposed to think it was anything else? Maybe it's because this movie never really 'took me there'. At least with the Ninth Gate, I could suspend disbelief long enough to accept the idea that the three books really are evil and the hero's life might have been in danger a few times, but not here. Also you never actually see the Blair Witch. It's kind of like making a song about a Teenage Wasteland and calling it Baba O'Reilly. Where is Baba O'Reilly? You might say the Witch is invisible to explain her pronounced absence. Ah, but then how did they have an old drawing of the Witch in that book? Hmn? Also the editing was impossible. If you're recording the same thing with two separate cameras, you will get the same action twice from two separate perspectives, not a smoothly-edited single thread of continuity. I especially chuckled when the one guy was talking into one camera and his voice carried over flawlessly into the footage of the other camera, all supposedly unedited. That was really obvious. By editing it professionally, it lost any credibility it might have had in my mind. And why did they go in that house anyway? How stupid was that? To make matters worse, they made a companion video for this movie (before Blair Witch 2) that you could rent, supposedly of 'newly-discovered' video. At least they threw it in free when I rented Blair Witch. It was the one guy and the girl sitting in the tent saying things like, 'Wow, that was a lot of weird stuff that happened today, huh?' 'Did you ever figure out what those twig figures were?' 'No. I never saw nuthin' like that. Crazy, huh?' This companion movie was obviously shot with a different camera than either of the ones used in making Blair Witch, making it an even more obvious fake, and it was twice as boring.While we're at it, didn't they film the inside of the Witch's house? If real, the cameras should still be in there. Who discovered the film without getting killed by the Witch? There was absolutely no way for me to get into the illusion of this movie with so many flaws continually shouting at me that it was a hoax. They might as well have put that kid from The Last Action Hero in here saying over and over, 'It's just a movie. It's not real.' It astounds me to think that some people actually thought it was a true documentary. On the scary scale, 1 to 10, I give this a 2, only for the few freaky (but not really scary) scenes. This was tied with Batman as most over-hyped movie of the 90's.",2,2,4,25 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Plot
","Spoilers (too late - spoiled movie) I would have killed the kid  too annoying. And why wager the queen's spaceship to buy the part you need to fix it? Everything else still works on that gorgeous new star-cruiser, so just trade it even-up for an ugly ship with a working hyper-drive. Oh that's right  there's no hurry. Your planet's just being overrun by evil aliens. Did they take a submarine through the center of the planet? I won't even allow for that possibility with futuristic alien technology. That was just a ridiculous pretext for showing an underwater sea monster. So why not just land next to the city and save the sea odyssey? Same goes for the invaders. Why did it take so long for spaceships ALREADY IN ORBIT from the beginning of the movie to attack the city? There was just no logical sense of timing or urgency. Also, they should have let Darth Maul live. I liked him. But Jar-Jar Binks could have been eliminated completely. Not only was he a ridiculous, pathetic, annoying racial stereotype, and looked too much like Ally McBeal with a green suntan, but he was hard to understand. Not that he said anything worth listening to. Am I the only person in the world who looks at computer animation and sees a cheap cartoon? Most of the movie looked more like a video game than a feature film. Oh, and if you're fighting a monster that will be added in later using computer magic and you want it to look convincing, your eyes should focus about 2 or 3 feet in front of you, not on the cue card guy 30 feet away. It makes it seem like you're talking to a ghost. They should make another Star Wars 1  The Adjustment. In this movie, we pretend that the Phantom Menace never happened and are treated to a real Star Wars movie, exploding Death Star and all! Hey, I can wish, can't I? It would make plenty of money and still leave room for two more prequels that need to be remade. This was utterly worthless. Third worst movie of the 1990's for hype.",1,31,60,25 November 2006
Batman Returns," Oh, so very very bad!
","SpoilersMy brother woke me up out of a much-deserved nap to tell me how great this movie was and that I should go see it immediately. And by that he meant at the theater. When I finally did, I waited until 2:00 in the morning to call him up and tell him at length how much it blew. Penguins for pall bearers? I have never taken my brother seriously as a movie critic since then. Any time he says, 'Trust me,' I bring up this movie and throw it in his face. And do they have to kill off the villains in EVERY Batman movie? Go rent the Batman movie with Adam West where they dehydrate the United Nations guys. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060153/It's better. Oh, can't find it? That should tell you how good Batman Returns is. Blegh!",1,120,214,25 November 2006
Big Fish," Meh - No big deal
","I've been putting off watching this movie for a couple years now. I was supposed to be an extra in Big Fish. One of my co-workers was an extra. He and his two children were supposed to be in the circus scene but I couldn't see them at all. He gave me plenty of pictures of him and the kids on the back set. He had a pic of the mechanical lion head and the giant guy hanging out at the food pavilion.Like I said, I was supposed to be in the movie. It was filmed right up the road from my house. They turned a local school into a Big Fish headquarters. When I dropped off my application, I remember seeing a mini model of one of the houses in a swampy bayou. It was in a room I wasn't supposed to be in but everyone was at lunch. In the movie it was that cat lady's house that he fixed up for her.And speaking of that quitclaim form she signed, why was it even laying on the table? They made it look like she suddenly decided to sign it, but it was already laying right on top of the table. I didn't buy it.I might as well claim spoilers now. The end wasn't the same as the book. In the book he actually turned into a big fish. And all the tall tales he told were completely true. I don't know where they were going with this more 'realistic' ending, but I wasn't impressed. The book wasn't all that good to begin with, and the movie was worse.Big Fish was a far cry from being a modern Wizard of Oz. I liked his red Charger and it was cool seeing local landmarks in a movie. Other than that, I wasn't impressed. I'm glad I borrowed the DVD and didn't buy or rent it. And I'm very glad I didn't see it in the theater.",3,4,10,15 April 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Excellent. Who needs the book?
","Minor spoilers. I'll try not to be too specific.If you're one of the remaining 27 people who haven't seen any of the LotR movies, go ahead and rent them now so you can see this. If you have a friend (like me) who has the extended DVD box sets, borrow them. The extra footage is well worth it. It'll take you about 3 days to watch both movies.(Edit: I wrote this when it was still at the theatres. And the extended DVD is longer!)RotK was as good as everyone says. I didn't see the other two in the theatre, but borrowed the extended DVD's before watching this. I read the first book in high school, and the first movie was better than the book. The second movie was better than that, and well, this third movie was just plain great.OK, if you've read the books, that's nice. Seen the cartoons from the 1970's? Yeah, me too. Forget all that. This is better by far.Acting - top notch. Costumes - perfect. Special effects - brilliant. Locations - breathtaking. Excitement - edge of your seat (my son was literally sitting a foot and a half forward on his chair, which made it easy for me to give him a 'gotcha' during the spider scene - yeah, cruel, I know).There was wonderful tension between all the characters. Should Sam and Frodo kill Gollum, or keep him as a guide? How would Eowyn overcome Aragorn's love for Arwen? How could Faramir convince his father he's as brave as Boromir was? Who would rack up a higher death toll, Legolas or Gimli? And none of this got in the way of the action. It added to the action. It fueled it, just like it should in a great movie. I can't wait for the extended DVD to see what all was cut.Fighting the Oliphaunts reminded me of The Empire Strikes Back, where they had to fight Imperial Walkers. That whole battle was amazing, and took up a huge chunk of the movie. And did the troop platforms on top of the Oliphaunts remind you a little of Jabba's dune barge in Return of the Jedi? Hmm.The immense scope and size of the story approaches the ridiculous as the movie unfolds. The white castle is larger every time you see it, because they keep panning back from a higher altitude. And if you look closely when Frodo and Sam have climbed about a mile above the great keep of Mordor, you will see the armies still marching out on that road. That probably took them all day to get up that high. Just how many orcs are there, anyway?Especially toward the end, they ran you through just about every emotion - elation, despair, victory, defeat, love, pride, hope, etc. It was hard keeping a dry eye. None of the characters wanted to be the weak link. Everyone displayed uncommon bravery and heroism, just like you would expect at the end of the world. Maybe Gollum or Boromir's father come close, but there's really no character there to hate or consider useless. There's no Jar Jar Binks here, folks.My only small peeve is that the movie ended several times. When Sam and Frodo were on that rock at Mount Doom, they made it look like the end of the movie. The screen even went black. OK, so let's all get up and. wait! There's more. OK, so now they do this last bit and that's it. No, I was just kidding. Alright, this is really the end. Psyche! Basically, just sit there patiently. If it doesn't actually say 'The End', it's not. In case you're wondering, it's when you see a round door with a central door knob.When it finally did end, I got up to leave. My son asked me if we should wait through the credits for 'end stuff'. I said you have to be kidding. It already ended 12 times.And then we finally left the theatre. Everyone in there made a bee-line straight for the cinema bathrooms. It's 3 and a half hour long. So sit near the exit.",10,0,1,29 December 2003
The Thin Red Line," It was WW2, not Vietnam stupid!
","SpoilersFirst, there was an hour of pointless new-age soul searching before the battle. Then they take the hill  that was pretty cool. The End? No. There's STILL another hour of soul searching. Right now I can think of two hours that should have graced the floor in the editing room. At one point near the end, that guy from Angel Eyes (and the Passion of the Christ) is looking up in the trees with a weird far-away look on his face. Are there Japanese soldiers hiding up in the trees? Are enemy planes about to attack? No. He's just looking at TREES! And then they made him look so 'enlightened' when he's contemplating his goofy Zen crap. Is this that Scientology stuff that Germany outlawed? 'The Human race is really one big soul looking out of many eyes.' I don't think a single American soldier ever thought that during the war. The movie had lots of big stars in it, thinking weird stuff like that all day. It couldn't have been cheap to make either. If you LIKED Saving Private Ryan, you are sure to LOVE some movie other than this one. Oh yeah, it felt much more like Vietnam than WWII. Overall, it blew pretty badly.",1,3,10,25 November 2006
