The Ring," Maybe my expectations were too high... (small spoilers)
","... but the movie was boring. sorry, but that's what i think.i like horror movies, like the old italian stuff or also some friday 13th or nightmare on elm street. some people say, that 'Neo-horror' just sucks, but that´s not quite true in my opinion, 'may' is a pretty good movie for example. but back to 'the ring'.when some friends of mine saw the ring they said they were too afraid to drive home alone, to watch a video or to answer the phone. they also told me that also the 'tough guys' were afraid after having watched the movie. so i thought that it would be cool, scary and maybe also gory. but i failed. i TERRIBLY failed.the ring seems like someone wanted to make a horror film and thought about a story. he invented some teenagers that went camping, like in some other horror flicks (not to mention some names ;)). then he needed something deadly to make the movie scary. zombies and other villains seemed to 'old fashioned' to him and so he came up with the idea of a deadly VIDEOTAPE!!! wow. scary.the whole plot of the movie seems like a kind of alibi for the film to take so long. there's actually not much action in the plot, not to mention the absolute minimum of blood and gore i;ve ever seen in a 'Horror' movie. the idea of that girl crawling out of the TV reminded me of poltergeist and DEMONS, so that was not too original either. also the scary atmosphere was missing in the ring.dont get me wrong, i dont HATE the movie. it just makes me wonder that (for example) 'the gates of hell' is said to have huge plot holes or 'the beyond' is said to have no plot at all. so i think its kind of strange that the ring gets a rating of 7,6 here at IMDB, while 'gates' gets only 5,8 because of the 'lacking storyline'.",Null,1,2,5 August 2003

","i went to the cinema with high expectations, but they were destroyed throughout the movie. the beginning is really kinda cool, but from the point when they (i even forgot the characters names) meet the father with his daughter, the movie is just boring. it offers nearly no story, the gore i was waiting for didn´t appear and the end was also stupid.seems like somebody wanted to mix up dawn of the dead (the apocalyptic thing, being surrounded by zombies) and argento´s demons (the way the infected are shown) but kinda failed. better go and watch DotD or demons instead if you want to be entertained.i´d give this movie 4.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,16 June 2003
