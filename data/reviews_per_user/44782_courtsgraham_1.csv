50 First Dates," More than what you think.
","This movie is so much more than what you think! It takes you on an emotional roller coaster. It is both hilarious and touching.I would recommend this to anyone that likes comedies or romantic comedies. I wouldn't recommend it for children, though. Some of the humor is too mature.Even if you're not an Adam Sandler fan, you'll love him in this. Same goes for Drew Barrymore.I love this movie, and I didn't think I would. The movie turned out to be more than what I thought. And it will be more than what you think, too!",10,90,106,2 October 2005
