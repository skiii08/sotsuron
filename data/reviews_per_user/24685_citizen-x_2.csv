Marie Antoinette," a trip to a present past
","In part due to all the beauty of the sets, and all the amazing talent, I was removed from the real world throughout this emotional artsy combination of modern retro teen flick.. and a historically correct assimilation of events leading to the radical change in France at the time..The acting felt so natural, as if just hanging out.. totally non pretentious..I felt so close,.. and as let in to their dreamy little temporarily over produced paradise of romantic confusion.. the scenes with the kids were so natural and well directed.. the feel, the music the sounds, and all the amazingly pretty pictures.. some worthy to be like the best paintings of that epic time of change that to me, in this film has been re-justified as a nice take on a modern free form interpretation of a time past.. i felt like in a time machine going back.. and being there as a modern person.. worth more than it's current rating IMHO",10,1,5,25 February 2007
Blood Diamond," a lesson in life..
","The cinematic craft at it's best. In a dramatic depiction of realistic events, describing the dangerous fields of enslaved child labour, in the African diamond industry. We see great performances from a talented cast, performing with intensity and dedication. I was never bored, yet appalled by the gruesome reality of this historically portrayed environment. As a dramatic piece, I was truly entertained. it was at times, like being on a roller coaster flying thru the amazing natural environments of the African continent. The accurately portrayed scenographics and cinematography was in addition to the well written story line, a truly entertaining experience. I would have preferred to have seen this on a big screen.",9,0,0,4 April 2007
