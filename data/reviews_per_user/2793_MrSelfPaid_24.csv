It," IT was brilliant.
","One of the better horror movies of the last few years, IT delivers in ways you wouldn't expect. I thought the praise from viewers was overblown before I saw the movie. Those thoughts were wiped clean right after. It's not that scary according to my taste, but it delivers. Go see IT, get it?",8,1,3,12 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Slightly above average.
",This is not the worst marvel movie but certainly not the best. I saw it with low expectations and it somehow managed to beat it. It's not an SJW movie in any way other than a few quips to show Captain Marvels absolute power towards the end. A solid 7 rating.,7,4,5,25 June 2019
The Irishman," Grandiose
","I've been an avid movie fan since the days of video tapes and sub par projectors.Nowadays, I only watch one movie per week due to other commitments so when I decide to watch a film it better be darn spectacular or I'm out in the first few scenes.This movie, simply put is a masterpiece. It demands your full attention, patience and effort in witnessing this marvel displayed on screen.Netflix is really stepping it up with recent original releases.",10,7,15,3 December 2019
The Prestige," Obsessive
","Film critic Roger Ebert described it as 'quite a movie â€” atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.'-Wikipedia. So true... I honestly can't recall how many times I have watched this movie, its just that good. I never get bored of watching this film no matter which kind of mood it finds me in. This film should serve as an inspiration for future filmmakers who wish to make intelligent movies that can keep the audience entertained as well as thought provoking. This movie is great in so many ways that I felt I had an obligation to express my feelings towards it. The acting is great, the directing is splendid, but what really made this movie awesome was it's script. Hats off to the Nolan brothers for bringing us another masterpiece. P.S This review was long overdue..",10,2,4,16 February 2014
The Hateful Eight," The last hour is a masterpiece in itself.
","An earlier review by 'gogoschka-1' pretty much sums up what I would have wrote about the film in a much better and detailed review. However, I would like to add my voice to the review section because of a few reasons.Reason 1. Some negative reviews almost made me skipped the film. I say onto you 'negative reviewer' 'Shut the hell up' in my Samuel Jackson voice. Reason 2. These same 'people' said the film was boring. I guess they expected the movie to play out like the trailer, full of spontaneous action along the way. So I say again to these 'people' 'Shut the hell up' in my Kurt Russell voice.Reason 3. The last hour of the movie is every Tarantino fan's wet dream, a masterpiece. Suddenly everything got turned up a notch: the acting, the dialogue, the cinematography, the little plot twists, the violence, the humor. So I say onto you 'negative reviewer' 'Shut the hell up' in my Walton Goggins voice. Happy New Year everybody and go see this film!",9,20,55,27 December 2015
Interstellar," Amazing... Trust Nolan
","Most Nolan fans - myself included - know that Nolan always has a powerful opening scene that sets the tone of the movie, and a powerful closing scene that stays in our memory a long time afterward. The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception are all examples of movies that follow that trend. Interstellar however, slowly builds up the tempo to a powerful climax reminiscence of TDKR. What this movie has is 'heart', a lot of it. Not since The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have I shed a tear or two, but this movie did it. The final scenes had me leaking like a faulty pipe. Amazing score, amazing story, amazing acting, amazing visuals. TRUST NOLAN.",10,1,7,22 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," How to enjoy this abomination.
","If you're a Star Wars fan, the best way to enjoy this film is to read all the negative reviews, watch all the YouTube videos, read all the leaks( they are mostly true) and head to the cinema a little drunk, with expectations lower than underground pipes.Just sit in the cinema and get ready to experience the most rushed, nonsensical, cringy, plot holes bigger than the Grand Canyon, crammed, ridiculous Star Wars movie ever made.Think The Last Jedi was a mess?Haha! You have no idea what awaits you.Update:Star Wars is now a comedy for low IQ people.",2,80,159,20 December 2019
Nightcrawler," Original, engaging and gritty film making.
","I must say Gyllenhaal is doing really decent films that can show an actor's ability to portray dark characters that delve deep into the mind of the audience and engage us from start to finish. Nightcrawler is one such film. With engaging performances from the main characters and an original and interesting plot that keeps us captivated, it's a must see. The pace of the movie flows smoothly by the plot's design and there is never a dull moment. What makes this movie great is the performances by the cast in relation to the script. I do believe that Gyllenhaal might be nominated for his performance come awards season. The suspense of this film is quite chilling because for a moment you get so absolved in the movie, you watch with baited breath as it unfolds quite unforgivably. Superb performances, original story and a lot of suspense. See-It!",9,3,5,7 December 2014
Bird Box," Engaging
","I saw this movie around 2am. I did not blink until the credits rolled. That's how good it was. This is horror done right. Granted, it no masterpiece. Far from it. However, it's definitely not as bad as most people suggest.Story 8/10

The Revenant," Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, carefully directed movie.
","To start with, a movie like this should be viewed multiple times to understand and absorb the little details the director tries to reveal. Every landscape shot, every breath exhaled, every bite taken, is all done in such a way that it flows like poetry.The plot is fairly simple, but it is the journey our hero has to undergo to seek redemption that grabs the viewers attention and demands all of it. The acting is almost perfect. The question is, what does DiCaprio has to do to get an Oscar? The director injects a little bit of mysticism in many scenes that have underlying themes that somehow relate to what the hero is going through.The movie is two and a half hours long but the time flies by because the editing compliments the story.Other aspects also help to make to make this movie great.Go see it!",9,10,25,24 December 2015
Avengers: Endgame," It doent feel like three hours.
","Pros<ul><li>You wont notice the time. 3 hours?? Pfftt, feels like 2.</li></ul><ul><li>Each character gets his/her time to shine.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot is definitely interesting enough to hold the attention span of action-only nerds.</li></ul>Cons:<ul><li>Don't compare this movie to Infinity War.</li></ul>I don't wanna spoil the movie by explaining too much.Go see it.",9,1,3,26 April 2019
Batman Begins," The best from The Dark Knight trilogy.
",This is the type of movie you'll watch on repeat and never get bored by. I've seen TDK many times and I always get goosebumps at the end; I've seen TDKR a few times and it's a great movie; Batman Begins triumphs both.What Nolan did was create a masterpiece and raised the bar of story telling in a comic book movie to an insane level. Many directors have been trying to replicate it ever since.Batman Begins isnt a generic comic book movie but a crime saga with dark undertones of brooding corruption.A Masterpiece.,10,1,2,20 September 2019
Gone Girl," The Devil you know...
","I must say Gone Girl is one of those few movies that keeps audiences glued to the screen whether they love the movie or not. It's totally captivating from start to finish. Rosamund Pike gives a 'killer' performance you wouldn't want to miss. I've haven't read the book - thank God for that - because it would have ruined my satisfaction; most brilliant books are better than their screen adaptations. If you haven't read the book, don't; watch the movie first. David Fincher is a master at making mystery movies and Gone Girl is one of the best mystery movies in recent years. All the actors brought their A game to the movie and deliver totally engrossing performances. Great film and 'do watch out for the Pike'",9,3,12,12 December 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Best out of the three.
","If aliens were to visit us and demand I choose the best movie scene in the history of film-making, I'd choose 'The Wolves of Isengard' scene in this movie as the greatest ever. Just typing about the scene brings tears to my eyes. Bless you Howard Shore for such an epic score.In a trilogy that explores themes of bravery, love, justice, fight against evil, loyalty, betrayal, family, honor, sacrifice; The Two Towers stands above its counterparts.",10,1,3,1 July 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Fun
","The Amazing Spider-man 2 is an 'amazing' film that takes place in an 'amazing' place where people stand a few yards from chaos to watch spider-man fight his enemies as if they were watching a Broadway show. A movie in which the villains wait until spider-man gives a speech to rouse the crowd and then proceed to spray bullets like skittles or shoot out electric bolts: none of which cause any fatalities to onlookers or people sensible enough to flee the scene. To really enjoy this movie, one has to let your inner child emerge and not to expect a superhero movie that will test your intellect. All credit most go to the director however for bringing back the lighthearted spirit of earlier superhero movies, before Christopher Nolan found success in making a darker superhero movie and every director copied his style since.",7,1,4,22 July 2014
1917," Gripping ... like the jaws of a crocodile.
","Beautiful, haunting, breathless, nervy, eye-catching, terrific movie. One for the ages.I gave it nine stars because no movie is without flaws but it deserves ten.",10,7,11,20 January 2020
1917," An Experience
","A great movie will leave you with a feeling, an experience, a moment on screen that's etched deep in your memory and stays with you forever. A scene or two where your heart rate rapidly increases or tears feel up your eyes. A score that matches perfectly with what is being portrayed on screen.In Lord of the Rings, it's the 'Wolves of Isengard' scene.In Fight Club, it's the final explosion scene.In 300, it's the slow motion fight scenes.In Godfather, it's the final shot.In The Dark Knight, it's the voice over of Gordon while Batman is making a run for it.In The Matrix, it's the 'he is the one' scene.In Braveheart, it's the 'Freedom' shout scene.In Joker, it's the scene where he is cheered by the mob and he gives a bloody smile.In Private Ryan, it's the final battle scenes where the heroes make their last stand.In Kingdom of Heaven, it's the 'surrendering of Jerusalem' scene.In Terminator 2, it's the 'robot self terminate' scene.In Drive, it's the final scene.1917 is a great movie. Enough said.",10,2,4,8 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force is now gender neutral.
",This film goes to show that reviews can be bought and Disney is now the real-life Galactic Empire of filmmaking. How critics rated this movie brilliant baffles me. The only emotions this film delivers is one of heartbreak and shock at what is being portrayed on screen. It's a slap in the face for all Star Wars fans intelligent enough to know a PC movie whenever they see one. THIS MOVIE SUCKED.,2,16,22,19 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Failed they have. Into exile Disney must go.
","Firstly, let me applaud Disney for episode 9. It isn't out yet but my Jedi instinct tells me all you cry babies who hate TLJ will probably go see it because Disney markets the f$#k out of their movies and they'll probably release a perfect trailer that will reel in all the fools like me that were disappointed with TLJ. Now on to the review. If you think the directors give a flying fart about hardcore fans like us, you must be out of your Jakku mind. Like my Indian friend said: All they kerrabout is moneeey. TLJ isn't a Star Wars movie. It's a science fiction corporate film so PC that it leaves a bitter taste even in the mouths of millenials. The reason I hate the TLJ , ok not hate but very close to hate , is because it had so much potential. Even I could have directed a better Star Wars movie than TLJ. After TFA gave us the middle finger, I thought TLJ would at least correct the mistakes of its older brother. Instead TLJ became the black sheep of the Star Wars family. Anymore jokes and it could have been a comedy, anymore fun and it could have been a musical. Maybe I'm not Star Warssy enough for you folks but this is my two cents advice: If you haven't seen TLJ, read every spoiler review about what sucked and then go see it. With expectations so low you won't be disappointed. That's what I did. If you've seen it and you hate it, don't think another viewing will wash the bad taste from your mouth. Forget about it. Sleep easy knowing you are not the only one in the outer rim galaxy that hates it. If you've seen it and liked it, my hats off to you or should I say: Disney got ya? Maybe the solo Han Solo film will restore faith in the republic, but I got a bad feeling about it, Disney being Disney and all that. May the force or whatever's left of it be with us all.",2,1,2,30 December 2017

The King," Splendid. Subtle. Elegant.
","As a fan of medieval movies, this movie is a classic example of simple storytelling done right with the exact amount of superb acting.Not too overbearing and it draws inspiration from many other epic films of its genre.A sublime piece of art.Well done Netflix. Well done.",10,6,11,7 November 2019
Sicario," When the credits roll, you will realize that Sicario is a near perfect movie
","I just finished watching the movie and though my review will suffer from the effects of just seeing the movie, I feel like I have to write a review somehow to get it off my mind. This is poignant yet simple storytelling at it's best. There is no overuse of action scenes, or bad dialogue. The movie flows as naturally as a leaf floating on a calm river.The acting is great and feels natural as each actor plays to their strengths.The theme of vengeance and justice shows that both are related cousins.The editing is done just right, enough to keep up with the pace of the movie.Kudos to those involved for making such a great movie.",9,1,4,22 December 2015
Mother!," I went in a skeptic, came out a believer.
","If you dont appreciate deeply layered movies that are woven with symbolism, you probably wont like this movie. Having read some lukewarm reviews, I was skeptical of the movie, but after finally watching it 'till the end' I couldn't help but fall in love with the movie. Watch it... till the end.",8,0,0,11 February 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Makes for an average movie if you haven't read the book.
","As 'scorpeeo' so rightly puts it, you have to read the book in order to appreciate the movie. That being said, I didn't care one bit if any character lived or die mainly because I didn't read the book. The main problem with the movie is that the director did not take enough time to create characters the we could care for. The movie does not live up to the hype of the first one, and being a movie of blockbuster status, it should appeal to all audiences and not just the fans who read all the books.I hope the decision to split the final book into two films will help us understand fully about the revolution and the role Katniss plays in it, and increase our interest in the main characters.",7,2,11,20 January 2014
