Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I couldn't stop laughing the whole time.
","I have never laughed so hard in a movie theater!If you don't know who Borat is, you should watch the Ali G show. Ali G and Borat are just 2 of Cohen's characters. Cohen takes his character Borat and finally puts him in the spotlight with his new movie.I have been watching Borat on the Ali G show, along with his other funny characters, and considering all the 'very nice' Ali G movies, its about time Borat gets his own. Cohen reminds me so much of Andy Kaufman. Andy created several characters that he was famous for. I wonder what will be next for Cohen? I just hope it doesn't involve wrestling woman.Cohen takes Borat out to expose the prejudices and ignorance of some people. I mean seriously, if you actually think that southern Russians are this way, then the joke is on YOU! Thank you Omar (from The Tarpaulins) for buying me a ticket!",9,1,9,18 November 2006
