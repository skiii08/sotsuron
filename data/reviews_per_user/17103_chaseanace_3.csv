Angels & Demons," Demons must have rewrote the story
","ANGELS & DEMONS. Sounded good so I rented it. Stupid movie. It makes the idiotic non-historical Da Vinci Code look like a masterpiece. Tom Hanks was bad. Ewan McGregor was dull in his role. Stellan Skaarsgard was just passable.The storyline was totally unbelievable from start to finish. I yelled at the screen during the scene when they run into the assassin. Yeah, like I'm really going to believe that the assassin would let Tom Hanks and Ayelet Zurer go scot free because they weren't carrying any weapons! What a crappy unbelievable scene! He would kill them because they are witnesses who could identify him as the killer. That's just a sample of how dumb this movie is.At the end, after the big explosion and helicopter scene, I almost cried that I spent money on this garbage. The only positive I can think of is the guy who played the assassin, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, was good in his role.",4,3,4,9 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," One time viewing only
","ALICE IN WONDERLAND. What to say about this lame movie? First off, maybe I'm biased because I like a lot of Tim Burton's movies and had too high expectations for this. But this is just as bad if not worse than BIG FISH. For the first time in a Tim Burton movie I found I was bored and waiting for this crap to end. The best part was when she falls in the room and gets bigger and smaller. After that, it was just one lame scene after another. Johnny Depp terrible. Helena Bonham Carter, the only redeeming thing the movie has. Crispin Glover was decent, but not great.And being a woman under 25, I found the fake feminist teen message a bunch of bull. The best part was was the production value. To be avoided unless you absolutely love Tim Burton and need to see everything he does.",4,5,11,8 April 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Blows
","SHERLOCK HOLMES. It's a bad movie. Soooooo boring. I saw every twist coming and that's totally inexcusable. The best thing about the movie is the performance of Lord Blackwood. He's played by Mark Strong, and that was okay. At least he was interesting because he was the villain. Robert Downey Jr irritated me with his over the top performance. Jude Law blah. They weren't a good team in my view. The directing was just okay. Ritchie is all over the place and makes you very impatient. That's because the movie goes along at a snail's pace. Maybe it's the editing? I don't know. The biggest problem for me was the story. It was just way too predictable. The best part was the production values, which is not saying much. 4/10",4,6,11,8 April 2010
