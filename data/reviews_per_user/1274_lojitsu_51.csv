Blade Runner 2049," All the best memories are yours...
","Here's The Lowedown on 'Blade Runner 2049' (R - Theatrical - US)...Things were simpler back then!!!Genre: Sci-Fi/Future
My Score: 7.5Cast=9 Acting=8 Plot=7 Ending=7 Story=8
CGI=10 intense=7 Pace=4 Tech=7 Future=8Thirty years have passed and a new Blade Runner is retiring past replicants. When he stumbles onto a monumental discovery, he seeks out the original Blade Runner to help solve the mystery.'Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real.' Other than the movie being 2 hours and 44 minutes...I liked it a lot!! It reminded me of the original film and brought some new elements I enjoyed as well. Some thought that Ryan Gosling was unemotional in his role, but that worked really well for me. You have to be ready for a marathon with some drag points, but IMO this is worth seeing for sure!! You'll find out when you watch that all the best memories are yours.",8,0,2,30 January 2018

","Here's the Lowedown on 'The Expendables 2' (An Action Theatrical review)...LOVED IT!!Genre: 8.5 Movie: 7What's it about? Mr. Church reunites the Expendables for what should be an easy paycheck, but when one of their men is murdered on the job, their quest for revenge puts them deep in enemy territory and up against an unexpected threat.What did I think? This was an action junkie's dream come true! I remember in the 80's and 90's when I wanted all the great action stars to do a movie together (Norris, Willis, Stallone, Van Damme, er...Arnold). I thought the first one was better, but this one was Van Damme-tastic!! Full of one-liners to bring back the memories of old, and full of enough action to put you into an explosion coma.",8,1,5,2 September 2012

'There are two places you can be in this world...you can be out here like us...or you can be in there like them.'

It honestly has a feel similar to 'It Follows'...slow and methodical at the start and then after a huge jump moment it gets really weird. By the end so many things are happening at once and there is so much symbolism that my brain locked. After I let it sink in...long after the movie was over...I really liked it!",8,1,3,19 October 2018

","The Lowedown on 'Captain Marvel' (PG-13 - Theatrical - US)I have been waiting for this since Marvel first announced it was coming. After making 455 million in it's opening weekend, I decided to wait a bit before going to see this.

Acting=7
Plot=9
Ending=9
Story=7
Movie Score= 8.4One thing to say about MCU is they always get a stellar cast...I guess that's the appropriate term for a movie like this. The acting isn't top notch strictly because movies like this aren't really about the performance.Plot: Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. I love origin stories that go back in time, but to be honest I was hooked as soon as I saw that Blockbuster in the trailer. With a mid and end credits scene, the ending is worth a watch as it ties into Endgame. Unfortunately, I found a few story holes that gave me pause, but all-in-all they did a good job.Favorite Quote: 'You know anything about a lady blowing up a Blockbuster? Witnesses say she was dressed for laser tag.'Let's see how the Genre scores add up...Imagine=10
CGI=9
Pace=8If Captain Marvel was to get full marks, it has to come at least close to the comic book. I saw good detail on the Skrulls and the war with the Kree...maximum effort here. The CGI was great, but not exceptional...loved the Anti-aging CGI on Fury, but Coulson no so much. The pace was solid, albeit predictable for a comic book film...all boxes were checked but no surprises.Comic=7

Knowing the connection between Captain Marvel and my favorite Marvel character, I was really looking forward to this. This was a solid watch...it checks all the boxes for an MCU movie. The only thing was there was no great story hitch or unique twist to make it great.Who's my favorite Marvel character? Silver Surfer",8,5,10,4 April 2019

Scare=4 Jump=3 F/X=8 Psycho=7 Disturb=8Friends travel to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.'Uh Ruben was - a product of inbreeding. All of our oracles are deliberate products of inbreeding.' I didn't like 'The Witch', but I liked 'Hereditary'...this one fell right in between for me. The format is the same as the others...as slow as a turtle going backwards with just enough weirdness to keep you interested. Culminated with a 20 minute ending which you can only define as 'holy crap'. I'm not a fan of the director's method, but I see the uniqueness of it. I can recommend this only if you liked both previous movies.",6,0,3,24 April 2020

Joseph-Gordon Levitt's portrayal of Ed Snowden was SPOT ON!! It was well written and directed by Oliver Stone...plus it has an amazing cast!!! The only bad note I can mention really is the pace of the film. It was interesting, but was too slow for me. 'You didn't tell me we were running a dragnet on the whole world, Corbin'. It's worth a watch, but your house may be bugged because of it. I think I'll stop talking now...did I mention how much I love America?!!",7,1,5,10 January 2017

Loved Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, and Luke Evans in their roles...then they started singing. It has all the elements you would want in the live action remake...if they hadn't have cut out the best line from the only song I liked from the animated film the score might be different.

I only stopped laughing long enough to enjoy the stellar CGI and action. I want to put a special shout to Ving Rhames...he didn't have much of a part, but he played my favorite character in the GOTG universe. There are so many Easter eggs in this movie...including the 5 end credit scenes (yes I said 5), so enjoy the big picture, but pay close attention to the little details within.",9,9,13,27 August 2017

I do not expect the sequel to be as good in most cases, but the fight scenes and the overall pace of the film really stood out as problem areas.
