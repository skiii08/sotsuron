Captain Phillips," It's so good, I'm embarrassed to talk about it
","Captain Phillips is a true nail-biter which also happens to be intelligently written. It is hard to believe that anyone could go through what the good captain went through and keep it together so well, but if anyone can make such an outlandish true story seem believable, it's Tom Hanks. Special mention go to Barkhad Abdi, who plays the front man of the Somalian pirates, for playing a truly engrossing and nuanced villain. But the biggest accomplishment of the film is that it goes to show that everything can go absolutely according to plan and something could still go wrong, as showcased in the pirate's invasion of the ship. I really don't know what else to say about it. It's just really good.",10,2,4,1 February 2014
This Is the End," A shameless side-splitter
","This Is The End is a movie that really shouldn't have worked, yet had me doubled over laughing for the entire film. The idea of a bunch of Hollywood actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves as a band of survivors in the Biblical Apocalypse sounds like something that should fall flat on its face, but it surprisingly carries the whole way through, in part because the actors look like they're having a ball making it. To say more would risk spoiling some hilarious scenes, so I'll give you some brief non-spoiler comedic highlights: Jonah Hill's shtick as the nicest guy in the world, Jason Siegel lampooning his own role on How I Met Your Mother, Michael Cera as an unapologetic sex and cocaine addict, anything that Craig Robinson does, the fake trailer for Pineapple Express 2, and EVERYTHING involving Emma Watson. So if you're into getting some unapologetically raunchy and ridiculous comedy with a surprising amount of heart, catch it in theaters while you can. That said, approach with caution if you're allergic to the Backstreet Boys because you'll have that stuck in your head after you're done.",10,26,47,30 January 2014
The Adventures of Tintin," A great adventure for the whole family
","I've got to say, I did not expect to like it as much as I did. I don't know how faithful it is to the original comic, but it was a really fun and insanely creative adventure film. All the characters were memorable and likable in some way and the CG animation was stunningly detailed while keeping the cartoonish quality on the animation. All the actors are good (I actually thought that the lead actor was Elijah Wood, but it turns out that it's the guy who played Billy Elliot), but special attention should go to Andy Serkis (who you may know as Gollum) on his performance of the drunken ship captain. It shows that he's got a great comedic delivery and can hold his own as a secondary lead. Hopefully he gets more diverse work because of this rather than just voicing monsters. Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright penned the script with one other person and they give the film a very offbeat quality that I think puts this above a lot of animated adventure films. All in all, a really good experience that I wish I'd caught in theaters. Also, gotta give special props to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who play two very amusing dry comic relief characters. I always love when those two are in a movie together and this is no exception. Go see it.",9,1,2,30 January 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol - A Reel Snippet Review
","Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation was fun, if a little dumb and convoluted. The movie doesn't exactly break new ground, but it has good laughs, good action scenes, and dynamic, charismatic characters. Yeah, even Tom Cruise. Admittedly, I'm a little disappointed that the main cast is such a sausage fest, but at least they worked off of each other well. A lot of scenarios got resolved in manners far too implausible to be credible (and anyone bringing up the title as a counter-argument will be punched) and the extent to which coincidence played into the success of their plans got a little tiring. But hey, it's Mission Impossible, so it's got enough action, intrigue, and rubber masks to keep me entertained. By my own admission, I haven't seen Mission Impossible III or Ghost Protocol, but this movie was good enough that it got me interested in seeing them. If you're down for a decent dick flick, I say check it out if you've got spare time.",7,1,4,10 August 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Ultimately squanders its potential
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty should have been heartwarming whimsical movie that I fell in love with, but instead frustrated me to no end. The biggest problem is that none of the characters act in a way that any relatable human being would, which culminates in a near end twist that really took me out of the movie. The parts that are clever or heartwarming come at the expense of being a paint-by-numbers clich√©. The dialogue comes off as very awkward, which is intentional, but not the awkward that lends itself to good writing that someone like Joss Whedon can produce. I am sure that I will appreciate the message and the intent behind it, but I was too frustrated and bored to enjoy watching it.",3,12,24,30 January 2014
