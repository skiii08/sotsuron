The New World," How Does it End?
","i have not seen the movie. i plan on it but i was wondering, how does it end. who does she pick, john smith or the new guy? I've read many many many lengthy comments about the movie. I think ide be intrigued in the depth of the movie. Most people are saying its slow, but beauty takes time and most people don't realize that. Im only 14 and i realize that. But along with that seeing the Disney version when i was a kid never left me. John her Pocahontas's's relationship was what love meant to me, just they way they looked at each other.By watching the trailer for this movie you can tell that the director recreated that and put it into real eyes. I could cry just thinking about it. So who does she PICK>?",10,0,2,28 August 2007
