Ali," I didn't realize Smith's acting until later
","Went to the theater expecting a Will Smith movie of a sort... For half the movie all I could see was Smith trying to be Ali, acting, recreating a persona and mannerisms from old television footage. Left the theater on a low note thinking, where was the catchy signature Rap that usually plays on the credit roll (Wa Wa, West, Wild West.)I didn't realize how brilliant the 'FP' was until I got home and happened to catch 'Classic Fights' on ESPN. Ali was fighting and all I could think to myself was, man, that guy looks a lot like Will Smith...",Null,4,7,9 January 2004
