Child 44," A rare gem!
","Wow! Where to begin? I had skipped this movie earlier when it was available for buying but after watching recent performances of Tom Hardy, I thought to give this movie a go and judge it for myself. And boy was I surprised! This is such an underrated movie for no reason at all. After watching the movie, it's baffling to see the negative reviews and low scores this movie received. It's totally beyond my understanding what could've been the possible reason for this movie to get such a hammering from critics. Everything in the movie was top notch, right from the layered story, the mood of the time in which this takes place, the performances, I mean everything! Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace, the two leads were just perfect. It's disheartening to see why this movie wasn't considered for any awards or a positive genuine review. There are some unanswered questions as to how Tom Hardy's character was fully reinstated and some other minor things towards the end but overall this is a really dark and powerful movie which raises some sensitive issues and is blessed with genuine performances. I sure am glad that I watched this rare gem.",9,1,5,18 January 2017
American Hustle," A Phenomenal Masterpiece
","There's no doubt why the movie got nominated for 10 academy awards. Everything in the movie whether its the impeccable cast, the storyline, character development and the occasional humor, everything is just mesmerizing and crafty. David O. Russell keeps on surprising us with his variety by experimenting with different genres, but the real turn on is that how easily he takes a paradigm shift from drama to thriller setting a SCORCESE-TYPE Ambiance in this masterpiece of a movie.Apart from the director, the movie belonged to the one and only Christian Bale who has garnered another Oscar nomination for yet again a David O. Russell project. What can I say, Russell keeps on trusting this man and he keeps on delivering . But the real USP of the movie is the unpredictable and satirical Jennifer Lawrence (portraying Bale's wife in the movie) who is just a phenomena in her every scene outdoing herself once again. In and all, American Hustle is a complete package with a spellbinding story and some great acting. Go for it if you prefer watching quality films over the span of your precious two hours.",8,0,5,17 January 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Zack Snyder's R- rated superhero showdown!
","Let me just come out and say this, this movie is exclusively for two kinds of people: a) The ones who are well versed with the DC comics and characters, and b) Those who followed the movie's every news with bated breath ever since it's announcement including all the castings, etc.The reason I point that out because of the experience I garnered while watching the movie multiple times with different people. The first time when I saw the movie, I wasn't able to make up a clear picture of the kind of movie that it really was, but I should admit that my excitement got the better of me and I liked the movie on my first watch. The second time I saw the movie with someone who is just the opposite of the first category of persons that I pointed out earlier and I came out with some interesting observations: 1) The flash cameo, was awesome no doubt, but it made no sense what so ever for a person who doesn't know about him (I'm talking about the one after the batman nightmare sequence). Even the people who knew about flash had trouble recognizing him! And that is a fact! 2) The nightmare sequence, again another cool sequence that just made no sense, so totally out of place for the movie. People felt like they were suddenly watching a totally different movie having aliens and all that, neither did it anyhow substantiated the plot of the movie. It was just there doing nothing except looking 'COOL', a word that Snyder loves to use. 3) The Justice League cameos: In the cameos we get introduced with two of the lesser known members of the JLA viz, AQUAMAN & CYBORG. And anyone who doesn't know that Jason Momoa is playing Aquaman or the other hero is Cyborg would be utterly confused and frustrated about what's going on. Seriously! These are only some of the basic problems that I am pointing out, they aren't even the major ones. I was so excited for this movie and for Zack Snyder before it hit the theaters because I thought that this might be his Magnum Opus and he'll finally get the respect and recognition he deserves. Unfortunately it wasn't meant to be so. He is now making the Justice League and i sincerely hope that he nails it, otherwise, Snyder would see the end of his big budget movie making career and would forever be remembered as the guy who took control of the most iconic comic book properties and made a big mess. He won't be easily forgiven by the huge army of fans the DC comic book heroes have!",6,0,0,26 July 2016
