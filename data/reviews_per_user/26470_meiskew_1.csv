It," Ehhhhh
","I really, really wanted to like this movie. Considering I love Stephen King, and how the book gave me nightmares every time I read it, I had very high expectations for this movie. Also, the Tim Curry version scared the crap out of me as a kid, so I could only imagine how scary the new adaptation would be. However, halfway through the movie, sitting in the theater, I couldn't think of anything else except how I wasted $10 on this movie. It wasn't absolutely terrible, being that the kid actors were the most redeeming quality. I was never once scared and found this movie more funny than anything. The number one reason though, that I didn't like it, was the CGI they used for EVERYTHING. I couldn't even be scared because I was laughing at how fake the 'scary' parts were. All in all, I don't understand the hype of this movie and I can only hope that the second part will be better.",5,0,0,30 December 2017
