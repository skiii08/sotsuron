Skyfall," Skyrise
","Yes, its a bad pun for a title but just take it for now and stick with me.So this movie has gotten some mixed but mostly good reviews by critics and some pretty damn atrocious reviews by the regular mortals who flock to the movies to look for disappointment. The good news is, however, that Skyfall, (the latest Bond installment as you damn-well know) is actually quite a great film.Sam Mendes introduces us to his refreshed Bond character, though still plaid by Craig, in a fast-paced chase scene in Istanbul, before pulling on the reigns and slowing the pace of the film to make way for some character development across the board (a swathe of new characters are introduced for this as well as some familiars).Though there are a few clich√©s' to be found here, the new James Bond story has got quite a lot to offer, including a great story centering around M, and a new villain who is fantastic (but not the best bond villain). The story also makes Bond face some of his demons as well as tackle with his loyalty to Queen and Country, but also his boss, M.The highlight of the movie is to be found at the end with a fantastic finale set in Bond's pre- MI6 residence of SKYFALL. (and some lovely shots of the Goldfinger icon, and worlds most famous car, Bond's (Connery's) Aston Martin DB5. This movie is in no way a traditional bond film. Though it does try to hark back to it's golden days with many a reference. But that is not to say it isn't a good film. Whether you view this as 'just a spy movie' or 'James Bon's return' you will be in for a treat. Bond goes to many locations, all of which suit the movies desired tone. As certain scenes require the feeling of desertion, a location is utilised and helps emphasize this and help the audience realise the emotions the various characters could be feeling. This could be a deserted island, or the grim, wet countryside of Scotland, used at a time when the situation that Bond ends up in is looking dire.It does not need to be said that some people wont enjoy this film. Some people will believe that James Bond movies should never-ever change (I am a huge Bond Fan and have not taken this view) and others are the kind of people that cut holes in the shoes so they are able to complain about having holes in their shoes. All movies can have holes in them. If you watch this looking for them, I'm sure you find things to complain about. However, I must then say, that if you are one of those people, who are always looking for reasons to hate things, then maybe there are some bigger problems in your life that you should be focusing on.Rating = 8,5/ 10",9,3,9,22 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The End of an Already Finished Story.
","Watching The Rise of Skywalker, it was hard not to feel that they were trying to end something which had already finished. This to me felt like a somewhat empty film.When Return of the Jedi finished, it wrapped up the Saga nicely. It gave closure to the characters, and to the story.Since The Force Awakens, they have gradually undone all of that work and have, bit-by-bit, left the saga with a sense of emptiness.This story picks up some time after the unfortunate Episode VIII and also has the unenviable task of wrapping up the story that, again, didn't need to be told.To jump right to the negatives and positives, this move features absolutely stunning CGI and John Williams returns, one last time, to deliver one of cinemas most outstanding soundtracks. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver give very solid performances as the two main characters and the supporting cast do pretty well for themselves as well.Sadly, there are not as many practical effects as one would like in a Star Wars film, so it feels a bit 'Avengers' and the script lacks enough depth to bring any real feeling to the film.I left with no real emotional connection to the characters or the story.This being said, it was a much better film than I thought it was going to be, however, the story came across as quite forced (no pun intended) and, of course, opened up a whole swathe of plot wholes that affect not just this film, but all Star Wars movies retrospectively.They simply tried to do too much with this film, but it is worth a watch.",6,2,7,21 December 2019
Salt," Salt left a bad taste in my mouth.
","A movie that is quite short on thrills and adventure: Salt is the story of an American agent who is declared a Russian sleeper operative trying to prove her innocence. The trouble is that she isn't innocent, yet, she is? It is a clever way to engage the audience, but the fact is, that this is something that is not resolved in the end, as if to point to a sequel. Also, Angelina Jolie's poor performance as Salt will confuse the audience as to Salts emotions and actual reactions to scenarios and events.While Jolie's acting is sub-par and the movie suffers for it, her character is worse. Salt is a cross between Jason Borne and James Bond and it is painfully obvious at times which character she has been written at, and this delivers the audience with inconsistencies throughout the film and it gets frustrating. Sadly, the direction also gets a mention for lacking. It happens throughout, making the movie look messy and the supporting characters look like idiots, but when you watch this movie, you will notice all these things for yourself.In the end, this was a great a concept, with a fair, yet foreseeable plot twist at the end. It was the execution that let it down. It could have been done in a much more compelling way. Angelina Jolie seemed to have put in a fair bit of effort for her character, but she still needed a lot of development.Now, for the worst part. The end suggests there could be a sequel. Lets just hope its better than the first.5/10 stars or 2.5/5",5,2,4,19 April 2011
The Bourne Legacy," The Stillbourne Legacy.
","So first up, like some other reviews dictate, the acting here was pretty good.Now, on to the story and script. Did you know that TBL is based on a new series of books (there are 4) written by someone who did't write the original 3? It is. Because of this, the story here is terrible and it could be argued that there really isn't one. If you told me that I would have believed you.Renner and Wiese try their best to make this movie work but it can not be saved. Trying to shoehorn so many references from the previous movies and establish new characters and sub-plots, coupled with poor direction, make this movie comparable to a trash can outside a nice resturaunt. It is full of stuff people used to like but is now compiled into a heap of undigestable crap.Give this a watch and a try if you love the Bourne movies, maybe you'll like it. I didn't, but then again, i might be wrong.4 stars.",4,5,12,11 September 2012
Evil Dead," A Bloody Sticky Situation.
","As modern Horror movies go, there are a few schools of thought: Make an original movie, make another equal to an established franchise or do a complete reboot. This film falls into the latter. The original 'The Evil Dead' has become something of a cult classic, and rightfully o as it is a tastefully delivered horror flick that did things a bit differently. As such this movie was released to an established fan base and did quite well at the box office. The reboot, simply titled 'Evil Dead' borrow only two elements from the original: The name and the gore. Beyond that, there are very few similarities to the original. Story: Five friends go to a Cabin In The Woods to help one of them overcome her drug addiction. However, while there they discover a 'Book Of The Dead'. After reading from it, demons possess and try to kill them all. Good Points: This is a well made, well produced movie with a somewhat interesting, if uninspired, score. The filmography and the special effects are carried out in a way that glues together well. The acting is on par for the horror genre, though there are no gold stars being handed out here for them or the script. Bad Points: The original was funny, gory, great entertainment and made on a tiny budget. This is only gory. I personally found it predictable and boring. Without seeing the original, I'm sure that'd be the case for most. This film appeared to me to be a montage of people falling over, trying to escape only using their arms and deaths that are aimed at the creative 'SAW' franchise lovers.The problem here is that nothing sets this movie apart, there is nothing to come here for that you can't get somewhere else. It lacks jump scares, it lacks suspense, the characters are written to do weird illogical things and the film winds up coming over just a bit silly for something trying to be so serious. It won't be keeping me up at night.5/10. A reasonable effort, though.",5,2,2,29 October 2014
Rio," Went to Rio and loved it.
","And BAM! Suddenly, singing and dancing. Rio explodes into life in the opening scene and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. An easy going adventure with fun and random musical numbers and breath-taking scenery.However, it isn't all sun and sand. Jesse Eisenberg and his character 'Blu' will annoy you from start to finish as will the slobbering dog.But these are very easy to dismiss, as Eisenberg is in no way a bad actor, nor are any of the other cast members for that matter. The fact is, that there isn't much to say about this movie because it is really good, not a master piece, but really good.So take you and your baby to Rio because you will both enjoy it. Unless you are a pessimist.7/10 stars or 3.5/5 stars",7,6,6,1 May 2011
Lucy," Lucy, I want a divorce.
","No. This is not something I am happy to pay money for. Before a movie like this gets made, they should go over the script that was loosely sprawled over a napkin and have a good think. This was bad. Why? The reason is complicated. In all honesty, there is a fair bit in the movie that can be liked. The performances are on par with a blockbuster movie and all have done well developing their characters. There is good camera work and the story is a nice original take on the 'becoming powerful' story that has become common place as of late. The film starts off with a powerful first act. This being said, the random cut-aways to stock footage takes some getting used to. This isn't a problem as throughout the movie this device gets dropped pretty quickly.After the first act is where the story starts to walk its fine line of good and stupid. It doesn't take long to find out that this movie sadly takes the latter path. The 3rd act finishes, leaving the movies great concept and potential in shambles on the floor. I really wanted something great out of this, but in the end it all felt rushed and not thought through. I am hoping in 25 years time someone re-thinks this movie and gives it another shot. 3 stars for trying. Everyone gets a medal.",3,3,10,19 October 2014
