3:10 to Yuma," Full of absurdity ... BUT
",If only the viewer can accept the absurdities (except perhaps a big one at the end) then it is (just) possible to enjoy this film. The enjoyment comes from the acting and the storyline (MINUS the absurdities).,4,0,1,4 July 2019
Prisoners," Too many flaws to be a great film.
","I enjoyed the film, but noticed too many implausible situations: 1. Holly's house was searched by the police (before it was known she was the kidnapper) but it was not noticed that the photo of her missing husband showed him wearing the same pendant recently discovered on a murdered child killer. They notice these things in most TV detective shows! 2. The rescued girls did not mention the pit, but they must have been conscious there at times (or surely would have died if dropped in that distance if unconscious) and would have recounted that horrific experience. Thus the police would have gone there to search for the pit, especially when Keller was missing. 3. It seems improbable that the first rescued girl would not have mentioned that they did go into the RV and, perhaps also, that a woman was involved at some point (I am sure she would not always have been disguised enough or said so little that it was not detectable); these clues would have sent the police to Holly's/Alex's house for a very detailed search. 4. Keller went to Holly's house fully suspecting she was the kidnapper; he had a gun but chose to keep his back to Holly for an overly long period (in fact, until she had the chance to produce her own gun!). A sensible person would have gone there with his gun out (he was already in plenty of trouble over the beating of Alex so this would have been a criminal risk he was willing to take). 5. Detective Loki drove at high speed with a bullet wound to the head to get Anna to hospital asap and narrowly missed several accidents (apart from the fact he may have fallen unconscious) and may have killed Anna and himself; he could have phoned the hospital and met an ambulance part way! 6. The derelict house owned by Keller would have been mentioned to the police at an earlier stage; anyway, the impression given was that the police accepted quite readily that Alex must have run away (and also later Keller), both cases in spite of this being a kidnapping case! Little serious effort went into finding these two missing persons.",7,5,9,1 October 2013
X-Men: First Class," Pretty crap
","One reviewer wrote 'This movie, would be great for someone who knows absolutely nothing about the X-Men and their abilities' .... well, I knew absolutely nothing about the X-men (in fact, I thought the movie was about The Men in Black) and I thought the movie was crap. Apparently I have to write 10 lines (a bit like at school), so I have to 'flesh out' my one-word opinion. I really only wanted to say it was 'crap' because that word summed it up so well .... less is more. The actors mostly seemed like a bunch of amateurs with a set of special powers dreamt up by a 7 year-old. The girl with the wings looked like someone out for a hen party. And I thought they said earlier in the film that the girl who changed into ice could not do it again because of what they did to her .... but she did it again later! I didn't really care about the people in the film, there were no real characters; it was mostly rather silly.",2,12,40,2 June 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Overall exciting but some parts ridiculous (like most movies!)
","I give it 8 for the huge battle scenes with amazing special effects. Unlike most people, this is the first Transformers film I have seen (I don't get out much)and I was impressed by the action (I am easily impressed, due to not going out much). My senses were stirred, rattled and rolled. But I question why the very beautiful Rosie Huntington Whiteley (Carly) was in the film .... she added nothing except a stunning body and big lips, but managed to keep her perfect skin totally unblemished and her white clothes unmarked, in spite of the carnage she was involved in. This girl may be a model, but an actress??? Also, it is impossible at times to know who is the bad guy and the good guy (transformer-wise); they look alike. At times the scenes were a tangle of metal and you hoped that it was the good guy who won; but were not really sure. And why do advanced aliens use bullets (or similar)? Humans can destroy whole cities with one bomb; aliens could do that, or even more. Instead at times they pick off individuals as if they are still in WW1. But in spite of those niggles, still worth seeing the film. As for the choice between 2D or 3D, I saw it in 3D but wanted something to fly out at the audience and make my girlfriend jump .... I was disappointed. But, as to whether it as good in 2D I don't know .... I would have to watch it to make that judgement but now I already know the ending .... and anyway, not sure when I will next go out.",8,1,5,30 June 2011
