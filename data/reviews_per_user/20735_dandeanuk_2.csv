Mission: Impossible III," Awful
","The worst most gruelling 2 hours in my life. Awful re-hash of a tired formula, spent the whole film wishing it was over. Didn't care about any of the characters, was hoping Tom Cruise would die, had no empathy for him at all. Some class actors were in it, but awful script and awful tedious boring story. Box office sales say it all - 'over the hedge' has made more money and deservedly so. If this is the best Hollywood can do than they're in for some rough times. What wrong with original exciting new work instead the churning out the tedious uninteresting sequels that they do, wasting the vast array of talent that they have at their hands. Stop at the first film, this film was so bad it makes me angry and I wish i could get my Â£6 back, they don't deserve any of my hard earned cash. No wonder so many people have taken to illegally downloading their movies, it's not worth risking your hard earned cash on watching a turkey!",1,6,13,11 June 2006
Children of Men," No other film is better than this
","This has got to be the best film in existence. The acting, the dialogue, the cinematography, the script, the music, the lighting the direction are all unsurpassed and combine to make the most excellent film I have seen.I have never ever watched a film more than once, and I'm an actor, I'm currently watching it for my 8th time, and its true, a lot of people say it, but every viewing brings something new that I've missed in the past.I'm an actor and am currently writing a film, and would dearly love to write a film even half as compelling as this one. This movie really did touch my soul, I will remember it forever, the future in the film is so well realized that the sense of involvement and escapism is unsurpassed. You really feel that you have just visited another world when when you finish watching this movie. A lot of that is to do with the fact that it's done in single shots with no close up, you feel very much like the voyeur, like your there. When the terrain is rocky the shake of the camera conveys that as it moves through the terrain.It's polished. It's brilliant, I love it! 'See it wasn't that bad.' 'Not for you'",10,2,3,5 April 2007
