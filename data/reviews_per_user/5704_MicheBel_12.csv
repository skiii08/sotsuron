Casablanca," The Best Movie Ever, IMHO
","Casablanca is my favorite movie ever, after seeing perhaps thousands of flicks.  This is  back from the time when screenplays were screenplays. Even after repeated viewings, there are new elements that pop up, new lines of dialogue that hit you a different way. So many familiar lines, not just the 'Play It Again, Sam' (which he actually doesn't say), or even 'this is going to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship,' but one of my favs, 'I stick my neck out for nobody.' Too many to list.  Or the continuously take-your-breath-away moment when Ingrid Bergman first appears on screen. Peter Lorre darting about deviously. Sydney Greenstreet, being despicable, as only he can. And Bogie...in my favorite of his performances. If there is a fault to the movie, it is this: what the heck was going on exactly, and why do we care? Put all that tedious World War II stuff aside, it's great cinema.",10,0,0,13 January 1999
As Good as It Gets," It Never Got There
","I pretty much hated this movie. The main character was obnoxious and annoying, and I don't care if he was played by Jack Nicholson, I still hated him. And I never believed that such a creep would in any way attract a gorgeous woman like Helen Hunt. Guess that's why she got the Oscar.Did like Greg Kinnear, though. That was acting.",3,4,12,30 December 1998
The English Patient," Separating the Men from the Boys
","This movie, almost more than any other, separates those who have a soul and can appreciate art from those who don't/can't. Usually, this falls along the lines of women loving it/men hating it. I'm not sure why this is exactly, but I've gotten into more fights over this movie.  I was swept up by the grandeur, the passion, the romantic settings. I believed it completely and loved nearly every moment of it. Many others snooze right through it. That, I don't understand at all. What no one can argue about is that it is visually stunning. Hey, I love Ralph (that's Rafe to you buddy) Fiennes, even in his burn casing thing. Juliette Binoche is luminous, rightly deserving of that Oscar (sit down, Lauren). Willem Dafoe is at his creepiest. What is not to like about this movie?",9,3,5,13 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Episode II overcomes the Fiasco of Episode I
","The applause began immediately, as soon as the familiar green letters crawled up the screen.Then Keanu Reeves did a back flip, and you could see his cool new haircut. Oh wait...that was the 'Matrix Reloaded' preview. (Very cool indeed. Great anticipation for that film, safe to say.)No, we were here to see 'Episode II: Attack of the Clones'. First showing in Los Angeles, 2002. No applause when seeing the familiar yellow letters crawling across its screen. In fact, more like mass tension. The audience still having the revulsion in its bones of how robbed we had been with the debacle that was 'Episode I'. Memories of Jar Jar danced in our heads. And so, we waited, not wanting to give in, not wanting to love this one.When I sit down to a Star Wars movie, I want to be swept away, as I was that first time in 1977. I want to feel the magic. I want to just shudder with awe. Well, I am happy to report, that happened with 'Episode II.'Fresh from its wounds at having lost the visual effects Oscar to the upstart 'Matrix' the last time, ILM took NO chances this time.  Thank you, Photoshop master John Knoll. (Indeed they were given a reprieve with Aaliyah's death, and the resulting delay until 2003 of 'Matrix Reloaded'.) From the first moment until the last, it is chock full of amazing visual effects. In fact, the only frames which didn't work for me were the ones with Jar Jar's face in them.Tending toward the 'Blade Runner' look this time, it was a science fiction film we could care about, at least visually. Not only new worlds to explore, and old ones which looked suspiciously like Italy and Tunisia, but whole new effects. Groundbreaking sound effects too. Some truly amazing stuff here.Oh yeah, the story. Hm. Well, it was better than the pathetic mess that was 'Episode I,' though not quite as heart-wrenching as the 'originals'. Jar Jar wasn't as jarring, and Yoda kicked some major ass (provoking laughter; with him, not at him). There was some nonsense about the beginning of the Clone War, which I'm going to have to return to understand. There was a love story, and the beginnings of Anakin/Darth Vader's hatreds. Not really such a big deal when we concurrently have Willow turning to the Dark Side on 'Buffy.' (MUCH more scary.)Lucas seemed to have cribbed from many elements of current culture. Watching 'Episode II', I could see the effects on this movie of: 'The Matrix,' 'Gladiator,' and even 'Buffy.'  But the good news here is that he seems to have listened to his detractors from the last fiasco. No pod race. Less Jar Jar, less stereotypical voices, less noticeably wooden acting, some actual real feeling even. God bless Natalie Portman. What a wonderful Queen/Senator/girlfriend she is.All in all, it won me over. So, I'm here to report that 'Episode II' is worth seeing. But so too, is 'Spiderman.' The difference, I believe, was noted by audience members afterward. Which one are you going to see again? 'Episode II' wins, sabers down.--Michelle Belaskie",10,0,0,16 May 2002
The Princess Bride," Swashbuckling! (if you like that sort of thing)
","My name is Inigo Montoya...you killed my father...prepare to die. Well, it's almost impossible to separate the great book from the great movie (so peruse both). Mandy Patinkin...Cary Elwes...Robin Wright...and that hilarious scene with Billy Crystal...don't take my word for it...just go see it.It's got sword-fights to die for. It's got beautiful women in peril. It's got a great love story. It's got a terrific revenge plot (if you like that sort of thing).Go see it now!",10,1,2,30 December 1998
The Insider," Truth Has Many Masters
","Sometimes I wonder how this movie got made at all.  'The Insider' is easily the best movie about journalism since 'All the President's Men.' And many of the forces at play here: big tobacco, network conglomerates, corporate lawyers, are still very much in evidence in the media/political landscape of today. One has to wonder how many other Jeffrey Wiegands are at this moment, slipping through those cracks. It's a  gripping, compelling story.Russell Crowe is amazing as Wiegand (write down Best Actor nominee right now). Not only does he look like him, but all traces of his heavy Australian accent are gone. Al Pacino shows us yet another shade in his multi-faceted repertoire, and is fascinating to watch. Director Michael Mann gives us his usual interesting tableau: visually arresting shots, quick cuts. Some may complain of its length, but I was riveted to the end.Another Best Picture nominee, for sure.",9,0,0,9 December 1999
The Graduate," A Perception Problem
","Actually, what this movie communicated to me, better than any other movie I can think of, is not about the older woman sex thing. It's the way everyone has their own perception of a situation, and quite often, they don't hear what the others are saying, so wrapped up are they in their own worlds. Plastics, my friend. Plastics, indeed.I also love how the three leads are, in reality, about the same age. A cosmic Hollywood joke.",8,2,7,30 December 1998
Singin' in the Rain," Donald O'Connor is a Gas
","What a glorious film! Just for the sequence alone of Donald O'Connor dancing with that dummy--over couches, on walls--this movie rates a 10. But there is also a sweet Debbie Reynolds, and a great story...and oh yeah, that Gene Kelly number with the lamppost. Love it!",10,0,4,30 December 1998
This Is Spinal Tap," Turn that Baby up to Eleven
","The ultimate rock star movie. A hilarious send-up of a rock documentary. Every scene is funny. And every time you see it, it gets funnier.",9,0,1,30 December 1998
Some Like It Hot," One of Marilyn's Best Roles
","This is a great script, funny, compelling, unexpected. Lemmon and Curtis are a great team, bouncing those zingers off each other like there's no tomorrow. But it's Marilyn Monroe who's luminous here. This movie, more than any other, proves why she was the object of so many people's fantasies. From the 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' song to the scene where she bravely tries to kiss Tony Curtis into feeling something (still one of the most erotic scenes on film), she is a goddess. And the last line always gets a laugh. Check this movie out if you haven't seen it.",8,4,6,20 January 1999
Trainspotting," Just Ignore the Baby
","Any movie that begins with Iggy Pop played really loud is OK by me. Not to mention the fact that it's the American debut of the wondrous Ewan McGregor. Imagine: He was simultaneously on screen as this doped-up heroin junkie and as a foppish dandy in Emma. Go figure.But the movie, in all its bleakness, presents one of the best images of living a heroin-addicted life that I've ever seen. And it has a great soundtrack.",8,0,1,30 December 1998
The Matrix," The Matrix Has You
","I can't remember the last movie that I saw in the theatre seven times. I just couldn't get enough of The Matrix. Still can't (I just caught it again on cable). It's got everything: cool sci-fi techo storyline, a love story, lots of slam-bang action scenes, great martial arts, wonderful actors, visuals to die for, fabulous Chicago brothers who directed...In short, everything you could ask for in a movie.But the best thing, for me, is how spiritual the movie really is. I'll never forget sitting in a huge packed theatre, with the entire audience SILENT, struggling to get the concepts being thrown at them between high kicks. There is a reason why this movie kicked Phantom Menace's butt at the Academy Awards this year. And it's not just because of the amazing visuals. It's because the STORY of The Matrix was everything we used to go to Star Wars for: the good guys winning, the connection with the Force, it's all there, and in a very 90s/new millennium way.God, I just LOVED this movie! See it, if you haven't already.",10,0,0,2 June 2000
