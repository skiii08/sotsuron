10 Cloverfield Lane," The movie that's full of doubts until the end..
","If you have read any comments before, you're already spoiled as this movie works best if you know the least (Just know that Cloverfield was destroyed by aliens from the past movie is enough!). Because if you know even a single piece of fact, the rest of movie will become predictable.*Spoiler* The end of story is really bad. I think better version should've been the protagonist was killed once she escaped and met the alien. This way the movie will end with idea of two choices: Either living with a lunatic(?) in a confined space or escape from it and die. Too bad the movie introduced a third option where the protagonist becomes a super girl and fight with aliens. Very stupid ending, though during first half period have me fun of guessing and pressure. Thus 6/10.",6,1,2,22 November 2018
