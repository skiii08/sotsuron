Alien 3," Not Bad
","Alien 3 is not really that bad of a movie. Everone seems to say that it is the worst of the Alien movies but I think that it easily passes Alien Resurrection. It is a very interesting movie because in movies I like to see action, but for some reason I tend to like this movie. I think it is because I am an Alien fan all the way(except Resurrection). One thing I noticed is their use of profanity in this movie. I'm not one of those 'OH, they said the 'F' word' people but I think they go a little overboard with it, probably because they are prisoners and not very good people to begin with.",Null,0,2,11 June 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Disappointing
","This is the worst of the Alien series of movies, which is unfortunate because it is possibly the last. It has a weaker script and storyline which is the main reason I did not like it, even though it has more stars in it. Some of the scenes im this movie are more violent and grotesque than the other ones. For instance, the finale with the Newborn Alien getting sucked out the window from a little hole in the glass. Overall I was very disappointed with it and cannot even compare it to my favorite movie Aliens.",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
Batman Returns," 2nd Best?
","Batman Returns is the darkest of the 4 movies and contends with Batman Forever for the #2 spot in my book. This time around Batman has two villains to contend with, Penguin and Catwoman. The fight sequences are decent as is the acting but overall I thought this movie was too dark and moody but that is what th director wanted.",Null,0,0,17 June 2001
Alien," Good Thriller
","Alien is a good thriller movie from Ridley Scott. This movie can be compared to it's(in my opinion) superior sequel Aliens. Both missions are sabotaged by a shady Company worker like Ash and Burrke. But unlike Aliens the theme of Alien is basically, 1=where is it? 2=what is it? and 3= how do we kill it? The theme of Aliens is 'There it is lets kick it's ass!' However Alien is an interesting thriller movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The main thing scary about it is that no one really knows what it is or what it is capable of. That is why it a good thriller.",Null,0,1,11 June 2001
Aliens," Best movie ever made!!!!!
","Aliens is the best movie I have ever seen. It combines action with more action. Basically the entire film is action scenes except the starting point and some scenes with Newt and Ripley which allow her to sort of take Newt on as her own daughter(Ripley's real daughter died while she was in hypersleep). I love the marines. This movie is one of Bill Paxton's best performances ever. The only rival would be his portrayal of Severen in Near Dark. Michael Biehn is excellent as is Jenette Goldstein. Lance Henriksen is good as the softspoken android, or as he prefers, artifical person Bishop. The effects are awesome and so is the music and sound. The countdown music at the end is cool. All in all Aliens is not just the best of the Alien series, but the best movie ever made. Good job James Cameron!!!",Null,0,1,11 June 2001
Army of Darkness," Funny
",Bruce Campbell returns as the chainsaw armed Ash for the third go with the deadites in Army of Darkness. Bruce makes a surprisingly good comedian and is absolutley hilarious with his almost famous one liners. He is probably the only person I know that would literally laugh in the face of an ancient evil monster. This movie is 'Groovy'!,Null,1,1,11 June 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Very Very Funny
","This is one of the funniest movies ever made.  If you haven't seen it you are wasting your time doing something else.  Even though this movie looks extremely dated it is exceptionally funny.  The one liners are great (french knight), and the slapstick comedy (killer rabbit) is hilarious.  The boys of Monty Python do a great job in one of their first films.  Go rent it right now!",Null,0,0,20 March 2002
Beetlejuice," Not Funny
","This is an unfunny comedy that does not deserve all the hype it got in the 80s. Beetlejuice is a stupid movie. The story is stupid, the plot is stupid, and the characters are stupid. And I especially hate the TV series cartoon.",Null,0,2,19 June 2001
