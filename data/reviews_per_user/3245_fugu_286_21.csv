Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What I would have done to make Phantom Menace less painful
","1. I would have made Anakin slightly older. I hated the cute little kid. A brooding teenager would have helped the storyline and foreshadowed things to come more.2. I would have killed off all the Gungans in the first 15 minutes.3. Darth Maul should have been in almost every scene. He was cool.4. The starships would have looked more primitive than they did in ANH. The way everything is rendered in this installment, you would think that the technology in the Star Wars universe regressed.5. I would have rendered Amidala/Padme entirely in CGI. That would have made her more life-like than Portman's portrayal.",1,27,51,26 May 2005
Ali," Ali is Forrest Gump
","The way Will Smith never loses that bewildered expression on his face. He's supposed to be playing a brash, arrogant, opinionated heavyweight black man but he might as well be playing an idiot savante. Even in the Zaire scenes, they keep doing close-ups on Will's 'What the fudge is going on?' face. Even the delivery of the lines sounds bewildered, the way Will sort of trails off at the end of a proclamation. Listen carefully, and you'll see what I mean.
The way time shifts rapidly from one era to another, with historical events occuring at a rapid pace with Forrest, sorry, Ali having something to do with them, but not fully realizing it. 'They shot that nice man,' you half expect him to utter after Malcom gets gunned down on that podium.When Ali beds Sonji, you just expect him to say 'I'm not a smart man, but I sure know what love is.'The film feels incomplete. They could have cut short that lenghty first fight scene and focused on these aspects of Forrest's life.His childhood in Louisville.His amateur career, culminating in his winning of a gold medal.His later years, following the Foreman fight. His epic struggle with Frazier in Manila. Hey Mann, this calls for a sequel.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
Spartacus," Suckiest Movie that Ever Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
","Ralph Ziffereti: THEY DIDN'T HAVE FLAT TOPS IN ANCIENT ROME!!!!!!1 That's just one of many, many things wrong with this silly 1960 movie that the great Stanley Kubrick attached his name to. So let's make a list huh? Spartacus was NOT a white man. He was most likely a dark-haired olive-skinned Slav. See the A&E miniseries to see how Spartacus should have been cast.The Gladiator from da bronx. 'Yo spa-da-gus'...Enough said.The slaves taking on all of ancient rome. If you watch the Hollywood version you would think the Roman armies were incompetent clods who were mowed down by a rag-tag group of slaves. WRONG!! The slave revolt while initially successful, withered in the face of the Roman military. They did not take on 6 legions and beat each and every single one of them. THAT NEVER HAPPENED!! THEY DID NOT NOT HAVE FLAT TOPS IN ANCIENT...Wait, I mentioned that already.The Gladiator combat was ALL WRONG!!! Spartacus was NOT crucified. NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM but he was most likely killed in the battle against Crassus.LAURENCE OLIVIER sucked!!!1 tHERE YOU GO",1,14,52,27 December 2004
The Birth of a Nation," Oh boy...
","Just because a film was considered ground breaking in its time, does NOT mean it is worth watching today. Please, you people, who have had the misfortune of seeing this dated film, do not deceive readers who may think this is some kind of technical masterpiece. It *was*, in 1915, when 'talkies' were a decade away and when minstrel shows were more popular than going to the 'pictures'. Some films made during the early sound era, like 'All Quiet on the Western Front' are definitely worth seeing. But be weary of any silent films made during the 'teens' as they are rather painful to watch. The novelty of seeing a 'picture' is just completely lost on the last few generations. Remember that people screamed in fright when they saw an image of a train moving towards the screen. So minus the novelty factor, Griffith's 'masterpiece' is one for the archives. But modern audiences would probably be bored to sleep by it or find it uproariously funny, which it probably wasn't meant to be. It is interesting, however, to see how a white southern man feels about Reconstruction. 'Birth of a Nation' may be historically significant. That's why you should read about it. But for goodness sake, don't go to the trouble of trying to rent it.",10,1,9,31 January 2002
Rocky V," Not so bad...
","This isn't the worst of the Rocky films. That distinction almost certainly goes to Rocky IV. There's no jingoism here, no larger than life characters, no annoying flash and glitz. This film tries to capture the essence of the first film, a likeable down and out bum who tries to aspire to greater things. Many have complained about the lack of a climactic boxing match at the end. You have to settle for a brief street tussle instead. But none of the Rocky films should be approached as sports or boxing films. If you want to see that, go rent 'Girlfight' instead. Rocky has always been about the underdog struggling in the face of adversity. It has always been about aspiring to greater things. The third and fourth sequels of this franchise really moved away from that in an attempt to create a larger than life character. If you can look past the cheesy music and 80's era schmaltz, there is a thoroughly enjoyable film behind it. And it has a heart too. Rocky V is for anybody who has struggled in life and denied their big break. 10/10",Null,4,5,23 February 2002
Malcolm X," Uncompromising...
","I must admit, I used to despise this film. I had to watch this tedious bio-pic as part of an assignment for a sociology class and write an analysis of it. Needless to say, I did not have a paper to turn in. I just did not think (and still do not think) that Malcolm X was a very pleasant person. Like Jerry Falwell, and Louie Farakhan, he had a tendency to push the wrong buttons in the statements he made. He seemed to be driven by pure hatred most of the time. And even after his conversion to orthodox Islam, following his Hajj, currents of racism still remained in his philosophy. That is what the Black Nationalist movement is/was. Keep blackie in one corner of the room, keep whitey out. That isn't reconcilation. That is segregation. What a way to move forward! But I saw the movie again on BSTRZ and imagine my surprise...I enjoyed the heck out of it. It is completely uncompromising unlike the pathetic 'Hurricane', which tries to sanctify an unpleasant person who was probably a murderer. Malcolm X presents the man as he was, based on what he said, what he did. It does not pull any punches. Most people will not come away from this with a greater sense of respect for Malcolm. Unless you believe in the things he said. Apparently, Spike Lee does, yet, he does not attempt to whitewash (pardon the pun) this controversial figure. And in that sense, this film is very enjoyable, historically accurate and heck, it is quite moving too. I did find myself thinking a bit differently about some issues.",Null,2,7,26 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Fundamental Problem
","I have heard the critics savage this film. I have heard people with great expectations for this film express their disappointment. I have figured it out for the benefit of all mankind. It is like this.STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE was NOT a good movie. Although it was innovative for its time, it also had a basic fairytale plot, wooden acting (no wonder Hamill, Fisher etc. couldn't get a job afterwards), pretty good FX, a great score, but a classic it was not. But those of us who remember it from our childhood have fond memories associated with it. And for those of us who were older during the Star Wars craze have a nostalgic view of this film and its sequels but it was NOT A GOOD MOVIE! It was AGGRESSIVELY MARKETED but it was NOT A GOOD MOVIE! If it were made today, even with souped up CGI effects, it would be sitting on the straight-to-video shelf alongside BATTLEFIELD EARTH.EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was a GOOD movie and it stands alone as a sci-fi classic. I shall comment on it no further as it detracts from the point I am making.RETURN OF THE JEDI was not a GOOD MOVIE! Although the end of the trilogy needed loose ends tied and a satisfying conclusion it did not need EWOKS! And the love interest between Han and Leia, wonderfully built up during the last film, was absolutely savaged here. All the elements of high drama are present in the Vader/Luke scenario but Hamill ruins everything with BAD ACTING! But once again, those of us who were 'there' have inflated opinions of this film. We remember how immpressed we were when we first saw the blocky stop-motion animation of the two-legged AT-AT's, etc.And along comes EPISODE I and we all had inflated expectations of it and lo and behold, it has impressive visuals up the wazoo but it feels like a Disney children's movie. The acting is shallow, the plot is weak, the characters are weak...you get the point. It is like spending $350 on an authentic Asteroids cabinet and realizing that the game just doesn't provide the hours of amusement it used to.And the same goes for Episode II. Folks, it has everything you would expect from a Star Wars film. Lucas went out of his way to please both the fanboys and the people who want to know what all this hysteria is about. But it just so happens that the 'magic' that was there, wasn't really there to begin with. So just enjoy the visuals and don't expect Lucas to come up with the Greatest Movie Ever.",1,1,3,16 May 2002
Top Secret!," Dromasca is a fool!
","The film makers didn't know the difference between East and West Germany, Communism and Fascism? Listen to the commentary on the DVD sometime, you blithering fool. This film was supposed to be a spontaneous spoof of three genres. War movies, spy movies and 1950's musicals. Therefore, it takes place during World War 2, the Cold War AND the swingin' 50's. And of course, anywhere or anything else they wanted to spoof. Get it? ;-)",Null,3,4,23 February 2003
Rocky IV," Rocky wins the Cold War!
","Rocky IV goes to the Evil Empire during the heart of the Cold War and beats their invincible Super Champion, Ivan Drago and instantly converts the SU from Lenin-Stalin to McDonalds-Burger King!

Pearl Harbor," Forgettable 'Epic'
","From the makers of 'Armageddon' and 'The Rock' comes...another film of 'epic' proportions with lots of explosions! Now I am aware that the producers of this film did not intend for it to be a historical reenaction of the events that took place on Dec. 7th 1941 (see the excellent 'Tora! Tora! Tora! for a more even-handed and 'historical' account of that fateful day) but what is presented here is weak. As usual, Bay and Bruckheimer are completely out of their element when it comes to HUMAN interaction, especially between the opposite sexes! The 'love' triangle in PH is about as scintillating as a wet fish. The Japanese 'villains' are stereotypically jittery and conniving and they even play 'evil' music when they appear! Quite simply, I could not bring myself to CARE about anybody in this film.As far as the explosions galore and action sequences, as long as you remember that this isn't supposed to be a historical movie, I would say that they are quite impressive. The Japanese Zero's do look like the speeder pods from Phantom Menace though. There's lots of explosions if you like that sort of thing.",Null,0,0,23 August 2001
Meet the Fockers," the horror! the horror!
","'Meet The Fokkers' is the worst movie of all time.There I said it! The fact is there's never been a good comedy sequel...ever! Was Beverly Hills Cop II better than Beverly Hills Cop? Were any of the Police Academy sequels any more tolerable than the first? Was Naked Gun 2 1/2 even remotely as funny as the original? Arthur II: On the Rocks, Arthur, Pink Panther, Pink Panther Strikes Again, Analyze That, Analyze This, you get the bloody point, right? The fact is it's a lot harder to write comedy than drama or just about anything else and the script writers always fall into the trap of trying to rehash what they thought brought the yuks last time. So having been talked into seeing this film by my girlfriend, I didn't think it would exceed my expectations of mediocrity. I mean, I was expecting nothing to begin with. SO HOW THE H-E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS DID THIS FILM MANAGE TO BRING THE BILE TO MY THROAT???Here's a breakdown.All the pee pee ca ca jokes. You would have thought that MTF would have at least retained the spirit of the original, which was witty and cringe-inducing (in a good way) with perfect comic timing. But Stiller and company took the low road with MTF. Hey, we find out that Gaylord's got relatives named Domme Fokker (haw haw), Randy Fokker (hehe HAW!) and Orney Fokker (huah! jethro mah sides is done splittin). The 'cute' kid going aaaaaaaass...hoooole of course was a new low.BARBRA STREISAND!! GOD WHO THOUGHT PUTTING THIS UNFUNNY NUDNIK IN THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA?? SHE'S GOT A REVERSE MIDAS TOUCH EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHES TURNS TO SH*T!!Rehash the old jokes. Yeah let's try the same jokes or variations on a theme. More boob jokes, more stupid pet tricks, THE GODDAMN CIRCLE OF TRUST!!!! AGAIN!!! Cameos upon unnecessary cameos. We get the stewardess with the 'sticks in her hair' for no apparent reason, we get Owen Wilson for no apparent reason...The sad thing is this film still had some promise that was never fulfilled. That brief scene where a sodium penthatol induced Greg gets on the microphone...that was funny. And umm that's about it. Gigli has got nothing on this bomb. I predict when people get wind of this and the people who wanted to like this so much stop voting '10's' on it, it'll drop from 6.8 to 1.5 and end up in the bottom 250.You heard it from me first. Hooah!",1,3,6,31 December 2004
The Longest Day," Best Thing about TLD
","Like Tora! Tora! Tora! it shows the war from different perspectives. You get to see it from the point of view of the Allies, including the British and the French resistance and the Germans. This makes it the single greatest WW 2 film ever made. And that is why Saving Ryan's Privates, the Thin Red Line etc. etc. have not outdone it. Simply because they insist on trying to convince the viewer that the USA won the war all by itself and by creating fictional plots rather than dealing with historical facts.",Null,0,0,25 April 2002
Rules of Engagement," Whoah Nelly!
","*SPOILERS SPOILERS*Before I comment on this film let me just say that I have absolutely no problem with movies about Arab terrorists. Unlike some of the pinkos here, I do not want to see all Arabs portrayed as noble dilligent peaceful people for the sake of political correctness.But Rules of Engagement sinks to new lows.The opening sequence clearly establishes that the snipers in the adjacent buildings are shooting at the Marines. Hence, when the Marines open fire on the crowd in response to three of their number being shot the scene is supposed to invoke pathos for the 80+ (!) unarmed men, women and children that are brutally slaughtered. But unfortunately, this is not what the director had in mind. And lest we feel *any* compassion for these screaming turbaned religious fanatics a later shot establishes that every other person in the crowd is armed! Where did they get all those guns? And why did the Yemeni government allow this to happen? Did the director even know that the Yemeni government is an ally of the United States? Why were they being so unresponsive? And WHY WERE THOSE PEOPLE PROTESTING? Did the film even hint at what why they may have been protesting? Does the director, who obviously has a fourth grade education, believe that Arabs spontaneously start violent protests for NO CONCEIVABLE REASON? And if there was a reason why was it not even mentioned?The audience is meant to believe and sympathize with Sam L. Jackson as he explains why he ordered his men to open fire: 'THEY KILLED THREE OF MY MARINES!' he bellows. Oh, that makes it OK! And of course the whole darn crowd was armed. USA! USA!Ugh. Avoid this film.",1,6,12,28 October 2001
The Hurricane," St. Carter
","Why was this man not canonized? Granted, he wasn't Catholic but wasn't Reuben Carter just about the greatest guy on the planet? Or at least, this movie would have you believe. What could have been a great, Oscar worthy film about a flawed, tortured HUMAN being is given the 'Men of Honor' treatment. Contrary to what the filmakers would want you to believe, Carter was NO saint. He was a thug, a low life and from some accounts, quite a dangerous person. He may or may not have been guilty of murder (the film leaves no doubt he wasn't) but that is beside the point, because there was not enough evidence to convict him (notice he was never pardoned, never exonerated he was retried and the case was thrown out)and as regards to his boxing career, this 'warrior-poet' was a journeyman at best (go see his record at cyberboxingzone.com) and he NEVER beat Joey Giardello decisively, it never happened! He was not robbed, it was a close fight. Perhaps this is the films greatest injustice. Good acting from Denzel though as usual. He almost saves this over hyped piece of tripe.",Null,14,33,17 December 2001

Rocky," Not So Far Fetched...
","I have heard people question the plausibility of this film and I had to say something. Back when this film was made, there was mostly one boxing champion in each weight division. There was, for example, one middleweight champion, one heavyweight champion. The days of numerous sanctioning bodies each claiming their own champion had not yet come. In this sense it was a matter of PRESTIGE for a fighter to hold a championship. And before the days of guaranteed multi-million dollar contracts, a champion might have taken on 'all comers' to try and cement his reputation. A case in point would be when Joe Louis fought Tony 'Two Ton' Galento, a short stout and overweight beer salesman. Galento was a 30-1 underdog although he did manage to knock Louis down before getting cut to ribbons. Muhammad Ali often defended his title against no-namers like Jean-Pierre Coopman and Brian London.
Now back to the film. Although the fight scene is remarkably over-the-top (if you want to see realistic fights, go see 'Girlfight'), it goes against the grain of your typical underdog movie, because Rocky LOSES. It appears that Apollo is the better overall fighter but Rocky's got the heart to go the distance. This adds credibility to the film (which the sequels destroy) even though it isn't REALLY a boxing film.Also the Rocky character is based on two real-life fighters. Obviously, Rocky Marciano, who used to train in meat lockers, and Chuck Wepner who was served up to Muhammad Ali so he could have two or three easy rounds. Wepner (a liquor salesman who 'wanted to go the distance') gave Ali 15 tough rounds before getting knocked out literally at the last minute.",10,0,0,12 March 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Do yourself a favor...
","Watch the REAL story of the Bridge on the River Kwai (it airs frequently on the History Channel) and listen to the accounts of the men who survived. THEN watch this piece of fiction before you comment on how it portrays the blah blah of war, and the madness of blah blah. BOTRK is fiction, nothing more. The fact that people have praised the film for its realism and frank depiction of war is a great dishonor to the people who were beaten, starved, tortured and even eaten in Japanese prison camps. Try to imagine, if you will, a film about Auschwitz where the concentration camp prisoners are all well fed, not a single walking skeleton in sight, as they whistle while they work. No mention of ovens, gas chambers or horrible 'medical' experiments. Pretty offensive, isn't it? Now try to imagine having lived through an ordeal such as that, and knowing that IMBD users have voted that film into the top 250. Anybody who feels they owe any debt of gratitude to the old men who gave their lives and minds for our freedom, please vote '1' for this film.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Moments...

Legolas storming an oliphaunt.Return to the Shire. The fall of Mordar.The Forbidden Pool.These are some of the greatest cinematic moments in history. The latest installment of the LOTR trilogy is a masterful adaptation of an eccentric book full of religious allegories. Nonetheless, Jackson did a wonderful job with this one, even if it was a little bit scattered compared to the previous installements. There's just so much going on.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," WOO HOO!
","I just saw EMPIRE STRIKES BACK for the umpteenth time and although I have given up all hope of EPISODE II being anything other than Disneyfied dreck, I am hoping that the coming third (and final installment) of the series will bring back pleasant memories of this exceptional sci-fi classic. In the meantime, I will revel in what is one of the greatest films ever made and indisputably the best sci-fi movie. I like EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE less and less each time I see it. I feel as if I outgrew it somehow. I still enjoy RETURN OF THE JEDI every once in a while but more on the strenght of individual scenes rather than overall. I never could stand PHANTOM MENACE because it was Disneyfied dreck. There is no doubt in my mind that ESB is the best of the four films released so far. It stands alone as a great film (although it does need much needed closer which the sequel provides) and the special effects are phenomenonal for their time. I can't wait for the DVD special edition! I've preordered it and the studio hasn't even made any plans to release a DVD yet. And finally, there are those who characterize all who love this film as action figure collecting, pimply-faced fan boys. </S>Well, they're damn right!

Born on the Fourth of July," The Vietnam War and the 1960's: The Stoned Version
","'Born on the 4th of July' has been scorned by hawkish right wing nuts who still believe we 'did the right thing' in that small South East Asian country all those years ago. This is because the events in this film are seen from a leftist perspective. Oliver Stone is a well known left wing liberal nut. In the Good Old Days, he would have had to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Commission and Good Old Senator Joe Mcarthy would have labelled him a no-good dirty low-down stinking milk drinking Communist.
