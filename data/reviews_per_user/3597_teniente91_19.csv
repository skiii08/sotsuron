Requiem for a Dream," The Best Alternative Movie of the Last Years
","first I mean this before nothing: now the first time that I saw Requiem for a Dream was several months ago in the TV of cable and from half of the film, and I really enchant myself just by to see half, now after several months I wanted to see complete the film because I never had the opportunity to see it again, and I been renting it for three days but for my bad luck the film was not of the region of my reproducer of DVD and I was sad, but today in the morning I start to look for in the page of the TV channel of cable when it was the next time that passed it, by my misfortune is in months, and I was disappointed but for hours I knew that God is loving me so much that in the other channel finished beginning when happens through and I finish it seeing and I really enchant myself, now single I said all that excrement because the film really is worth all that and but to spend one night seeing it, and now dire because: '' Requiem for a Dream'' is a jewel of the alternative cinema, first we must remember that we dealt extremely with commercial actors, but even so the performances were so good, God saying I am impressed as as commercial actors as these could act so or, were excellent, we have something glorious in the film which is the direction, from the coordination to the extension and composition, they were you throw perfectly and with great originality, now dire something that perhaps can contradict what I said at the outset, the film has a strong detail, the script does not have main idea, bad do not interpret to me, the script this very or written, but unfortunately it passes this, it is with respect to the union of histories, was not possible to be found a main idea in the history of the son drug addict with the history of the mother drug addict, outside that the script also it is a jewel, it has luck of which one rises because it uses expression means perfectly, and aside from that uses them! , thing that many scriptwriters prefer not to do, is reinforced still more with the handling of the climax and the alteration states, whom as much finally enjoys to see a film that handles properly not that to you push to them at the outset or to the 15 minutes, music, the photography and the edition, are a jewel, the film finishes being one authenticates jewel of the alternating cinema, but it is worth to see to them do not know it of which they are had lost",9,2,4,10 April 2007

","recently a friend as been f*cking whit ''dude you have to seen 'Disturbia' is awesome'', well i'm p*ssed whit that, the film in a lot of scenes it seems lik is copying Hitchcock, whit the music, the film is a regular film, is not a recommendation if you want see something terrific, it's predictable and the script doesn't have principal idea, and have a lot of clich√©s, and the characters are so stereotyped, and you never know why he kill the womens and why they are redhead, the performances and the direction are regular, any performance as bad, anyone as great, it's OK, the direction are simply regular, the film in self is very commercial, if you want to see a terrific film this is not the right",6,2,6,14 May 2007
Children of Men," Excellent!!!
","Finally I can seen this film later than all the sh*ts that as happen recently whit the ignorance of my friends and family, I can seen the film for i've waiting all the f*cking year!, And I sure i can said that it's one of the bests films of the year. Really not just because i'm fan of the director, really Cuaron it's a genius. The film as breaking all the thinking's that one have of an story so easily and is surprising the screenplay are excellent written, Alfonso Cuaron as show that not just a brilliant director, also are excellent screenwriter as been demostring whit ''Y tu Mama Tambien'' that he and his brother won a nomination for Best Original Screeenplay for the Oscars, the performances are EXCELLENT Clive Owen, Julliane Moore, Michel Caine, the actress that perform it to Kee, all, also the supporting actors and actress as perfect, the direction... Oh f*ck i said all whit just said ALFONSO CUARON ARE THE BEST Mexican DIRECTOR, all the escenography, the ac tings, the photography are very good directed, the music also is an aspect that are wonderful, the photography, Emanuel Lubezki is an expert, how can you take a photography so good also when you're running, the screenplay are excellent (i've say the same but are more) the characters are wonderful written, for got a story that is not very attractive are excellent, also in any moment the picture are predictable, you can thinking ''Who's Next, What's as Happen the Next Scene'' totally unpredictable, the only it's that exposed the climax some fast but for good not like ''Babel''. But the movie as leave you whit the message that that's can be happen next, before i'm agree whit the abort in 100%, because i'm stupid on the school and don't interested on the studies, if i f*ck whit my girl i can't leave her pregnant... And i can make it, nothing. But this movie for the excellent direction YOU get thinking... This can be happen if i still make the same that everyone i can f*ck all. This can be happen, it's something that probably happen in the future. You just seen this movie and you have to seen the same that i do.''Children of Men'' it's one of the best movies of the year and not just for as been excellent make it.",10,6,10,3 December 2006

The Departed," The Departed Should be win
","The Departed, as get rated for the critics like the best picture of the year, and the academy as rated to Babel, like the best picture of the year, and i have to admit that i start to saying that The Departed was better and all that, and i isn't seen the movie, but i seen Babel a few of months ago and i'm, ready to said that i totally agree of my opinions before of seen the movie, and i gone to tell why. First the movie was EXCELLENT, i get f*cking surprised after of seen them, the direction was for much the best thing in all the movie, for much as excellent, a few of takes as so excellent make it, really Scorsese you are my hero once again you leave me f*cking surprised, and later the screenplay as... f*ck i don't have words to described i'm supporting to Children of Men on the category of Best Adapted Screenplay, but if win's The Departed, i don't mind, as excellent, third the performances... for god saying, more excellent picture can't be, Mark Whalberg make for much of as been rated the best performance of the year, Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon, both make that performances that leave you shocked, and don't forget to the legend here... Jack Nicholson... of where pull actors like this, The Departed for much that it's the best picture of the year i'm sad that all of we know that Babel as wins the Oscar on the most important categories of the night (Picture, Director) and any of both awards as deserve the movie, you can said to me ''malinchista'' and i don't said that word in Spanish just for my English were terrible, is also cause all my friends and family as saying me that, i don't f*cking care, i support to the movie as have to win, and i don't be a ''malinchista'' i support to the Mexican directors who deserve the award (Cuaron, Del Toro).Oh god since i start here i don't make a comment like this",10,0,0,3 February 2007
300," Ends been more a visual show than a dramatic show
","''300'': I was really shock whit ''Sin City'', it was a great comic-book adaptation, and I have a comment for ''300''. first i start whit the good, the direction was very good, I enjoy a lot a direction like this, and some that stole the entire movie were the visual effects, that make an amazing visual show whit the entire movie, and all the entire cast make a pretty good performances, and the score was very good also, but ever exist a reason for put 7 of 10 stars, now is the screenplay, the first mistake that i note about the screenplay is that the climax were exposed so fast and some that it's not take like a mistake, but i think that it's very important for the movie it's that the movie start in the status of alteration and it's legal make that but i think that a really good screenplay start in the in-alteration state, cause make better the movie, but the worst it's that ends been another stereotype of an epic movie and also so predictable, it's like i said more an visual show than a dramatic show, until that the screenplay get this mistakes in the most important aspects as very good written until that the screenplay ends been regular, out of that the movie were very good make it, but in comic adaptation i prefer ''Sin City''",7,1,3,1 April 2007
