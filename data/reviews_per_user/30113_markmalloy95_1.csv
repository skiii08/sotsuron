Iron Man 3," A bit of a disappointment
","Alright I love the Iron Man franchise! I really loved the first movie and I liked the second movie as well! Now when I watched the third movie I was quite disappointed because of the following : <ul><li>Too many special effects in scenes combined with the real world making it look 'fake' ( non-immersive is the word I would prefer to use )</li></ul><ul><li>Not a great script and plot.... </li></ul><ul><li>The bad guys superpowers was quite lame and made no sense </li></ul><ul><li>The Iron Man suits were way too vulnerable and at least 10 suits were destroyed in combat ( AT LEAST! ) , if it's so easy to destroy a suit why the hell didn't this happen in the first movies?! It's not fun watching them blow up suit after suit because what the hell is the point then?! It just made no sense and made the movie meaningless to me..</li></ul>5/10 not impressed.",5,1,4,28 August 2013
