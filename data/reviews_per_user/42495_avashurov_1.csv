It," Think in terms of story
","This movie is based on the amazing book with the same name by one of my favorite authors, Steven King. The movie tries to portrays the story as accurate as possible, but the story cannot be fully understood in a movie form. In order to fully understand the story try describing every scene in story terms. All the details are there. Don't think linear. The story is timeless and spaceless subjective experience. I would give it 10 if it emphasize the important details by holding the camera just a bit longer.",9,3,10,12 September 2017
