First Man," Immersive, Historic
","The First Man is a truly immersive film that covers the historic span of Neil Armstrong's life from his entry to the Gemini program to landing on the Moon.Ryan Gosling is excellent throughout, Claire Foy is absolutely amazing and the ensemble cast really do a brilliant job.From the first second I was engrossed, the film really brings to life the events and keeps you engaged from start to finish.
I recommend this as a must watch!",10,0,1,1 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Just not that good a film
","Like all Marvel Studios films, this is well produced, generally looks really good, etc., but in this case, overall, it's just not a good film. It feel extremely rushed and not well built. It's not the worst film of all time, it's just simply not a good film.The story is pretty poor, I won't put in any spoilers, instead just to say the story is really rushed and a lot of pieces of the film are a bit thrown together; for example there's a particular moment where it's meant to be a big emotional speech: 'you know what's difficult....' as the entry point but the character has only been introduced to the film not 3 minutes and it's actually a bit cringey to watch as a result. You can add Captain Marvel screaming woo as she flies around in a scenario where her nearest and dearest are in grave danger.... why? It's a bit weird. Adding to that the cat; when you watch it, you will understand; utterly pointless but a vitally important character in the film - why?I don't want to get into the same tripe as some but I have to say, having watched it, the film is miscast.... honestly. Captain Marvels portrayal is just not likeable or entertaining, the captain is just dull while also trying extremely hard to be cool.... I don't think the actress fits what they were attempting at all.It's like a B movie in this universe all said. I hope they don't make any sequels and focus on a Black Widow series as that has huge potential.",4,1,3,10 June 2019
Aquaman," Worth a watch but not a great film
","I watched the film with no expectations either way and to some up - it's not garbage but it's not great.There are some ridiculous elements - every characters entrance requires a slow motion taking a helmet off sequence.... hammy as hell; in the realms of nipples on the Batsuit. There is a lot of stuff thrown in to try force humour into DC that doesn't land or is just awful.There are some good elements - fight scenes with Aquaman are good, his parents relationship actually means something, Dolf Lundgren being 100% Dolf, etc.,I would rush to see it but would watch if it was on the TV.",5,1,2,10 June 2019
Suicide Squad," Simply Awful
","This is just a poor film.
There is a lot of talk about one or two performances being exceptional but really there was no good performance in this film, the plot is very shallow, the characters are poorly defined and have strange traits that are very hammy like the way they move or walk, it's almost comedic - Killer Croc going down the stairs into water is just missing comedy sound effects.The joker is exceptionally frustrating to watch, even if you leave behind the source material and take it on face value, the performance is terrible.
Harley Quinn has also received a lot of praise but the reality is it is not a good performance and the writing is terrible, some of the lines she says are cringe worthy they are so bad and she takes a strange swing from murderous sociopath to all of a sudden being a 'good guy' and all about helping everyone.
Will Smith is miscast.I regret watching this film in its entirety as I feel worse off for it.",1,0,2,3 January 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Over hyped
","Sat down to watch what I expected to be quite a good film based on all of the amazing reviews and I am still trying to figure out all the gushing.
The plot is so bad it made me angry, a lady commits serious crimes and they are ok fornsome unexplained reason.There is some great acting but in a poor film.",3,5,6,3 January 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great Source Material Poorly Utilized
","When you think of Superman and Batman you think of the most iconic Superheroes that exist. There is so much material to use, so much depth but this film uses none of it.
The film takes itself too seriously and shouldn't as the script isn't strong enough and the plot is weak, not only that but they waste the opportunity to use the best villain in all comics who is instantly recognizable but made to be almost a cowardly wimp, Lex Luther is not well written. The main villain is a CGI mess. The overall use of CGI makes the whole film look, strangely, cheap. It is used in scenarios where it isn't needed.The next major issue is the plot itself, I don't want to leave any spoilers but the plot is woeful.Ben Affleck deserves better as he has potential as Batman but in the 3 or 4 appearances to date has been in terrible films with no impact.",3,1,3,3 January 2019
