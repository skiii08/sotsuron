The Benchwarmers," Winning is good
","First of all, I thought that this movie was very funny. I liked all the actors involved and I thought that they were all written well within their acting abilities. I actually LIKED this movie.However, I am getting a little fed up with all this 'competition is only fun if everybody wins' crap. This message is irresponsible. In every game there must be a loser. But that is what makes winning so fun; to strive your best and to achieve. Not because anybody GAVE it to you but because you EARNED the victory by your own right. Success in anything is not satisfying unless it is truly earned. Anything worth doing is worth doing right and doing best and worth STRUGGLING. The struggle is the best part! Now don't get me wrong, I do agree with the movie's other primary message that sportsmanship (winning with grace), is what makes the victor a real winner. I am glad for this message. Children can be so cruel to one another. I, myself was ostracized a great deal as a child. I moved around a lot (always the new kid) and was very poor. I smelled bad and other kids made fun of me ruthlessly. However, I stopped feeling sorry for myself and realized that no one was going to shape my destiny better than me.Why am I saying this? Because the other message this movie is sending out is everybody has just as much right to win as anybody else. If I adopted that attitude I would be bitter and sad today. No. Those who are honest, hard working, and disciplined are the ones who have earned that right. Those are the ones who achieve.Sure, sports are just games and should be enjoyed by all involved. And those who are more skilled should improve the experience of everyone involved by doing there best to improve the 'game' of the less advanced because 1) It increases the skill of adversaries, thus improving the competition 2) The losers become winners because they overcome themselves.But the FUN is the honest to goodness competition and the dedication it takes to watch yourself improve over time and eventually come out on top. I'll say it again; the best part is the struggle! Winning is not bad, and all winners are not bullies. I win all the time now. These days I expect to win. I expect to win because I know that I can.Anybody can win if they are willing to take on the challenge and the JOY of competition. Winning is good. Winning does not bullying.Okay, maybe I took this movie a little too seriously.",9,1,1,18 April 2006
Inside Man," eh.
","What was the point of this flick? The robbers risk life and limb for nothing. Oh but they are soo smart. Yeah, rob a bank and our genius plan: let's use toy guns because REAL guns might go off and hurt someone. Besides, we robbers are just political activists (all actions, no matter how obscene are good if politically driven) that want to expose corruption at high levels and get a little money in the process. So they end up with some diamonds. hooprydooo! The reward for their efforts is simply not worth it. Oh but the owner of the bank is a dirty Jew who used the Nazis to get rich. For SHAME! So?The problem is the movie is not as smart as it thinks it is and you can see what is coming years in advance. The characters are all stereotyped and the acting is...eh.I just can't help feel bad for Clive Owen. I liked him so much in Sin City. He did a good job here too but the more I think about it was seriously under challenged. And what is it with Denzel Washington? He plays the same guy in every movie he is in; the only thing that changes is the name and the job. Jody Foster's character annoyed me as I am sure she was supposed to. But she annoyed me because she was a little too over the top. Too condescending. I understand that that is exactly how she is supposed to be but like everything else in the movie it was just, just...wrong.Look, if you have got nothing to do, want to kill some time AND have the money to spare this movie isn't such a bad deal. Just be careful not to be too critical; they are trying their best after all.This movie could have been good but like so much Spike Lee is involved with it ruined itself with mediocre everything.",4,4,9,27 March 2006
