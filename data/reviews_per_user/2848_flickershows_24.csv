Casablanca," This Classic Is Beloved (Especially By The AFI)
","Casablanca---the beloved classic of love, sacrifice and usual-suspect roundups---is 71 years old. The movie could've started earning a pension 6 years ago, yet it endures. Somehow this picture never gets old. I think one big reason is its sense of humour about an ultra-sensitive situation. For all the Nazis and the talk of concentration camps, there's Claude Rains cracking wise with Humphrey Bogart. People love Bogie and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca, but the real romance is between Rick and Louis. Beautiful friendship? Get a room with Renault's casino winnings, you two!We all know the great lines of dialogue, but did you know the American Film Institute honoured six (6!) of those classic lines on their Top 100 Quotes list in 2005? They had so many that the AFI couldn't even cram the 'hill of beans' or 'shocked, shocked to find illegal gambling' lines onto the Top 100. Even if you don't know much about Casablanca, you've heard 2 or 3 of the legendary quotes. That's not even taking into account how the AFI ranks 'As Time Goes By' as the 2nd best movie song ever and the movie itself as the #1 romantic flick.But this picture is so much more than high rankings on Top 100 lists and witty bon mots. You've got tension, drama, romance, witticisms, love songs, duelling national anthems, flashbacks, drinking, rigged gambling, and Nazi death. Good ol' Morocco. You know how to show a girl and a guy a good time...before they walk off with other people. Or, if you'll allow me to put this movie in a nutshell: bar owner and cop casually walk away from murder scene.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the 'Podcasts' section for our 46-minute Casablanca 'castand many others.

Citizen Kane," The Two-Time, Two-Time AFI Champion!
","The American Film Institute has twice named Citizen Kane the greatest movie of all time. Gawd, pressure movie-lovers much lately?! What do you tell people if you DON'T like Citizen Kane? You're gonna sound as lame as Susan Alexander singing opera. Lucky for me, I dig this movie much. It's definitely in my own Top 10 (not #1, but it's certainly in a place of honour) and part of the reason I enjoy it is because it ISN'T the hard work you might expect when it's the 'best movie evarrr'.What this movie does best is tell a story of a rich man who wanted everything he didn't have. Since he had everything except bonafide love, he truly wasn't---unlike Jimmy Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life--- the richest man in town. He filled his sled-less life with statues, newspapers, giant houses, and a marriage to an untalented dimwit. But we've all made those mistakes. Most of us just don't act like megalomaniacs of Rupert Murdochian proportions along the way. And we tend to avoid cryptic words like 'Rosebud' with our dying breath. Most of us would just admit, 'I miss my sled.'Orson Welles wrote, directed, produced and stars in Citizen Kane, making the single greatest debut in cinema history. His cast (comprised mostly of New York theatre buddies) matches him step for step and Welles' collaborators behind the camera are wonderful too. Was there a better cameraman in old Hollywood than Gregg Toland? None of that would matter, however, if the script by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz wasn't so fantabulous. In summary, as the pull quote on the original poster says, 'it's terrific!'If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the 'Podcasts' section for our 78-minute 2-part Citizen Kane 'castand many others.

Madagascar," Wild Animals Become Politically Correct Idiots
","Random thoughts that ping-ponged through my noggin during 'Madagascar':-It would be more entertaining to listen to young kids pronouncing 'Madagascar' then to hear any of the weak jokes IN 'Madagascar'.-The best animated flicks are fun for both kids and adults. Obviously, the makers of this cartoon didn't get that memo.-Co-director Eric Darnell must have loved working with Woody Allen on 'Antz' because the 4 animal leads are just like the Wood-man's own worst characters---neurotic, whiny, and not as funny as they think they are.-Names like Stiller, Rock, Schwimmer, and Pinkett Smith provide the uninspired voices for the headlining animal characters, but Sacha Baron Cohen's goofy lemur is the only one who's...you know...actually funny.-Okay, this is just a rough cut, right? The real movie is going to start any time now?-Those animals are great at building things, considering they don't have opposable thumbs.-They beat the cute jokes to death. Spit takes are funny once or twice. Anymore than that and you're just making a mess.-Lame riffs on 'Cast Away', 'Chariots Of Fire' and 'Planet Of The Apes' in a cartoon made for the littlest of little kids? Know your audience, guys.-No, it seems this is NOT a rough cut. Do they have some pillows and a blanket in this theatre?-Okay, so the lion and the zebra are best buddies until the starving cat gets hungry enough to (guiltily) turn on his striped friend. And the none-too-subtle lesson is---if those two mortal enemies can overcome their differences and be chums, maybe we ALL can. Geez, now even our vicious animals have been turned into politically correct idiots.-If you offered me 1000 bucks, I don't think I could quote a single memorable line from this movie...and I thought that DURING the show.-And now the end credits---the highlight of any crappy movie.",4,0,1,22 June 2005
Coffee and Cigarettes," Java & Smokes, Bizarre Little Jokes
","Finally, a movie my sister can get behind! With a title like 'Coffee And Cigarettes', health nuts must be having a collective heart attack. And the title isn't ironic. Every single episode in this string-of-vignettes movie has enough java and smokes to murder a truck driver. Bizarro writer/director Jim Jarmusch shot the flick over many years, gathering a wildly disparate cast to co-star in his black and white art film. No scenes are connected (except by the ever-present cigs & a cup o' joe) and each quirky sequence functions as its own self-contained act.Most of the character's names are just the actor's names, but that doesn't mean they're playing themselves. In reality, Bill Murray might moonlight as a waiter and hang out with the Wu-Tang Clan (who always refer to him as 'billmurray', one word). Jack & Meg White from the White Stripes might have a remarkable interest in science. And Cate Blachett might have a resentful, rebellious cousin who looks exactly like her (because she's playing both of them). But I doubt it. Those are just a few of the oddball sketches in this movie. In fact, I mentioned those ones first because, of the scenes with the big-name celebrities, they're probably the weakest.Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan work together in the longest sequence. Molina is courteous and affable, Coogan aloof and mildly interested in why Doc Ock has asked for this meeting. In a gem of warp-speed character development, Molina goes from shy to eager to crushed to bitter. Both men are excellent. Also, musicians Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have similar oil/water chemistry, which is what makes their culture-clash one-upsmanship memorable. Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright set the tone with their jittery, nonsensical opening scene. There's more, but I've forgotten the rest already.So I didn't reveal much plot. What's there to tell, though? The terrific Molina/Coogan sequence could be lengthened into its own movie, but the rest of this picture wouldn't work if the short scenes played any longer. 'Coffee And Cigarettes' isn't really even about smoke rings or the caffeine rush. Jarmusch and the cast use those as props to create some zany bits with an 'opposites attract...or not' motif. The flick is funny, a bit too long, and light years away from the mainstream. I enjoyed myself, found my interest bobbing & weaving, then left the theatre. That's okay. Even art films are allowed to be fast food.",7,30,46,5 July 2004
The Best Years of Our Lives," A Sensitive Portrait Of Re-Acclimation
","When I think of World War II, my mental image is of veterans coming home with post-traumatic stress, with a bad case of the drinks, and with no hands. It's not about glory or feeling good about a hard-fought job well done. Winning the most-important military conflict of the 20th Century be damned. Now we had to deal with the, ugh, return of guys who fought for a just cause. Didn't they know they're supposed to go into some kind of isolation tank until we need them to fight again?Okay, that was a series of cheap-shots and I dropped all those bombs for a reason. We don't want to deal with the hassle of doing right by the people who've shed blood and brain cells to keep us all safe from tyranny. Many movies have dealt with this topic, although not many of them have done it as well as The Best Years Of Our Lives. The 37th movie on both the 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists released by the American Film Institute hits hard, but doesn't hit you with a sledgehammer.That's thanks to director William Wyler and writer Robert Sherwood (who was once a film critic). They make it clear that Fredric March (the drunk), Dana Andrews (the PTSD guy who has no place back home), and Harold Russell (the guy who actually lost his hands for real) are not necessarily better off back home in the American Midwest than they were during WWII. Teresa Wright and Myrna Loy play March's patient daughter and wife, respectively, who (unfortunately) are more saintly archetypes than they are real characters.Who's to judge someone for struggling to accept their post-war life on its lousy terms or for turning to the bottle to cope? There aren't easy solutions and The Best Years Of Our Lives (classic Hollywood product that it is) doesn't revel in their pain or just gloss things up for the camera. It suffers from over-length---although the first 30 minutes is positively brilliant---and the women have no depth at all, but the men are handled sensitively and with a keen eye. This is absolutely a fine film, quiet and true.If you liked this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the 'Podcasts' section for our 40-minute Best Years Of Our Lives 'cast...and many others.

The Alamo," Yeah, I'll Remember It
","I missed my chance to see 'The Alamo' on the big screen in April 2004 because it tanked so quickly. And while this isn't a grinning endorsement, you might want to rent the DVD and give it a spin. First of all, the disc itself is terrific, from a technical perspective. It looks good (Dean Semler and John O'Connor share the cinematography credit) and sounds great. 'The Alamo' is a solid western about a big-time American failure---and, then later, a success---down in 19th century Texas.Director John Lee Hancock's version of this story waves its flags and sometimes panders in patriotism, but it isn't dull...which is the ultimate cinematic sin. John Wayne's (very dull) 1960 Oscar-baiter featured himself as Davy Crockett, but this modern telling has Billy Bob Thornton playing the man in the coonskin cap. Thornton is introspective, multi-skilled, courageous, funny...and the best thing in the entire movie. When Davy Crockett leaves the picture, the movie might as well be over.The main character, actually, is Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid). With a 'Remember The Alamo' battle cry, he leads a vengeful charge against the Mexicans that climaxes the film. Other than that, the glowering Quaid is hardly around. Jason Patric has a showy role as Jim Bowie, dying of consumption at the famously over-matched fort, but armed for a fight anyway. Patrick Wilson (as Bowie's rival) and Emilio Echevarria (as Mexico's General Santa Anna) also have major roles.'The Alamo' is somber. It's different than westerns from 50 or 70 years ago, which were more of the carefree 'yee-haw' variety. These days, cowboys always have a sense of gloom & doom. It's a common affliction in modern movies, but at least the whole point of THIS film is that defending the fort was always going to be a tragically futile act. Apart from that, I can't tell you anything else about this legendary story. They seem to have gotten it right.",7,4,6,2 January 2005
Gone with the Wind," Overrated With Lots Of 'Isms', But An Opulent Epic
","Ah, the old days. Maybe not so good old. As much as people want to see Gone With The Wind as a story of a complicated romance between Rhett Butler & Scarlett O'Hara, we really can't brush aside the racism, sexism, elitism, classicism, and perhaps 1 or 2 other isms. For every powerful 'as God is my witness' line, there's the fact that Scarlett is a selfish jerk who only ever wants what she can't have. For every bold declaration of 'tomorrow is another day', there's the marital rape. And, hoo boy, we can't forget the glossed-over slavery.Not that we should dwell on those isms. The movie is 4 hours long. You can be cheesed off about those controversies for a solid hour and still have 3 more to wallow in the opulence! And it would be some decadent wallowing. Producer/mogul David Selznick spent a lot of MGM's money to build massive pre- and post-Civil War sets, then burned some of those sets to the ground. Enough different dresses to clothe a small southern town found their way to Vivien Leigh's back, only to be discarded after that first and only wearing. You know, reality.It probably sounds like I want to spit rail spikes at this movie. That's not entirely true. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are terrific as Scarlett and Rhett. Olivia De Havilland is fine too, although her character's halo occasionally gets in the way of anything resembling a real person. As good as the stars were, Hattie McDaniel (in a solid performance) was the only actor to win an Oscar. The film won 7 other trophies, including Best Picture of 1939. As for the American Film Institute, Gone With The Wind was on 7 different Top 100 (or Top 25) lists. The AFI likey. And so will you, if you can overlook that Scarlett is an ass and her last line is stupid.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the 'Podcasts' section for our 44-minute Gone With The Wind 'cast...and many others.

Blue Crush," It's Not Tubular
","From the thoroughly mediocre school of filmmaking, here comes director John Stockwell's 'Blue Crush'. Its graduates...uh, actors include Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and a bunch of other pretty people you've never heard of. Bosworth is Anne Marie, the super-talented surfer with a confidence problem. Before the movie is half over, she's in love with a pro quarterback and struggling to gumption up for the big all-girls surf championship. It's your standard 1980's Tom Cruise picture.If a movie with such modest ambitions is supposed to make you want to go out and take up surfing, I say, hand me my 'Point Break' DVD instead. Sure, 'Blue Crush' is professionally made and the camerawork is fine, but how hard is it to pretty up shots of the Hawaiian ocean when it's in the form of gorgeous, humungoid waves? That's a natural beauty that speaks for itself and doesn't need Hollywood to flaunt it. As for the screenplay by Lizzy Weiss & Stockwell, well, they're proficient with the surfing lingo. They're also absentminded enough to bury their various hanging plot threads in an undertow. The flick is not trying to be a deep meditation on the entire wave-lovin' experience, but that's no excuse for staggering along with such a sub-par story.As unremarkable as they may be, the female leads are about the best thing in the film. They all look smart in bathing suits---the words 'woo hoo' come to mind---and they're fairly natural. Plus, these likable babes don't grate with too many, 'you go, girl' comments. Rodriguez even smiled once or twice, which confirms that she DOES have more facial expressions than just snarling and pouting. But despite the physical beauty of the waves and the girls, the film they're in is generic goop. Parents will be happy that all the sex is kiss-kiss-fadeout, there's nary a drug, and only a handful of cuss words. All the same, I'm certainly not happy with the content of 'Blue Crush'. It's just not tubular, dude.",5,19,29,18 July 2004
Meet the Fockers," These Fockers Are Still Funny
","Right now at the multiplex...if you want a dynamic biopic of an obsessive compulsive pilot, see 'The Aviator'. If you need a stunning reminder of the worst of human nature, see 'Hotel Rwanda'. Or if you want a boxing movie that's got much more going for it than just pugilism, see 'Million Dollar Baby'. Other studios have their best Oscar foot forward with those films, but Dreamworks is making the most money with their critic-proof comedy sequel, 'Meet The Fockers'. And I'm a bit surprised to say this---it's pretty funny.DeNiro and Stiller are joined by Hoffman and Streisand in this go-round. Dusty and Babs play Stiller's hippie parents, which is too much for uptight CIA whiz DeNiro to handle. Director Jay Roach has 4 huge stars to deal with, but he juggles them all quite well. Hoffman is the treat here and he's a wonderfully zany addition. Streisand is okay too. Other cast members do basically what they did in 'Meet The Parents', which is to look good and play off the headliners. There's a baby in the picture now too---DeNiro's cute grandson. The big fight that nearly breaks up the family circle (similar plot development as in the first film) kills some of the smiles for a while, but things get back on track before it's over.So bring some chums because this is a crowd picture. It's bound to be funnier if you're with a bunch of people. And it's amazing how many chuckles they can get from the cast saying, 'Focker'. So will there be a 'Meet The Children' or some kind of 3rd installment? Since this franchise and 'Shrek' are Dreamworks' cash cows, Stiller and Teri Polo better have some kids in a hurry. The taxi driver and the graduate as dueling grandfathers would be even more comic gold.",7,0,1,12 January 2005
Before Sunset," White-Hot Passion Of The Mind
","That 'Before Sunset' succeeds almost as well as its predecessor, 'Before Sunrise', gives me hope that a romantic movie doesn't have to be hackneyed tripe. That it's stepping in the same places as the original DOES keep it from greatness, though. The first movie was about how American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Frenchwoman Celine (Julie Delpy) spend a day together in Vienna, talking about everything big & small and falling in love. They part and we didn't find out if they ever got back together. The sequel picks up 9 years later when Jesse is in Celine's French neighbourhood on the last leg of his book tour. See, he wrote a successful novel of their one night together, although he has trouble admitting just much she's really meant to him. She unexpectedly meets him in the book store and they conversationally pick up right where they left off.Experimental indie radical Richard Linklater (who co-wrote the script with his stars and also produced & directed) doesn't waste any time on extraneous material. It's all about the 2 would-be lovers. Jesse might be a married father and Celine might be committed to another man, but they belong together. We know it and they seem to know it too, even though they spend a whole movie fighting their primal urges. They're likable and intelligent people, largely because they're also funny, self-deprecating, and rebellious. Hawke & Delpy invest a great deal of delicacy into their characters too. Not only do the actors have wonderful chemistry, they know when to pull back and be guarded about their feelings.I recently saw 'My Dinner With Andre', which also sparked bolts of electricity in my brain. I desperately needed to debate someone after seeing that conversation-filled film and I wish I'd taken a date to each of the 'Before' movies. Both are sexy in the best sense. Who needs naked skin and moaning lust when you have white-hot passion of the mind? Since the story is essentially told in real time, these are two people who spend about 80 minutes holding something back. The 'will they/won't they' question will not be answered in this review, but that sexual tension keeps the whole production together.With the exception of his hugely popular ode to rock fun-fest, 'The School Of Rock', Linklater likes to leave loose ends. His pictures work because his characters do what smart people usually do with their free time---talk. And free thinkers usually come around to the subjects of literature and music. How fitting then that Jesse immortalizes Celine through writing, while we later she how she has immortalized him through music. If two characters have ever truly connected on the motion picture screen, it's these two. 'Before Sunset' isn't a perfect movie (partly because it's cribbing so much from the '95 film), but it's a glorious way for lovers and other strangers to connect within the confines of a movie theatre.",8,0,0,15 July 2004
City of God," Kids With Guns
","'City Of God' is not an easy film to watch, nor is it an easy film to like. Were it not for the stark reality that permeates most of the production, this could have been a modern zombie flick. None of the characters in this movie are really alive anyway. They're the walking dead, living each moment with the threat of death knocking holes in their front door. The actors do the best they can with powerful material that offers them no real hope. As I said, zombie flick.After 2002's searing documentary, 'Bowling For Columbine', it seems a little ghoulish to see a movie filled to the brim with shots of kids with guns. And they use their guns oh so casually, killing at will. It's not easy to make a viewer immune to the sight of a child brandishing a gun, let alone firing it, let alone shooting it at people. Repeatedly. After a while, I wasn't appalled anymore. 'City Of God' is relentless in its offhand violence, proving once again that ghetto conditions breed desperation and murder. Perhaps that's truthful. In fact, I have no doubt that this movie is bang-on.That's the rub. For every moment of authenticity, there's one of over-the-top brutality. Is it over the top, however, if it's trying to be factual? I'm not sure. See, I can't say I liked this film, but the energy and raw power brought forth is admirable. Certain audiences should see it (not children, not the weak-stomached), but they need to be forewarned of how rough things get. Director Fernando Meirelles puts the camera literally into the action (think 'Saving Private Ryan' in Brazil) and doesn't allow you to view the horrors from a safe distance.So why am I reserved about this film? Violence in movies doesn't usually bother me. Maybe it's that I found it difficult to relate to the characters. I have never experienced the squalor or pain they experience on a daily basis. And---I have to be honest---I had a hard time keeping everybody straight. Once the film gets going and it settles into the '70s time frame after jumping around a lot, that problem goes away. Still, I was supposed to be engaged from minute one and it took a little longer for me to get warmed up.The young, unknown cast is solid. They're not good enough to be etched in my memory, although Alice Braga (as Angelica) is one of the most beautiful girls I've seen in years. Since the actors are portraying biographical characters, they're already limited in what they can do. Meirelles rings genuine emotions from the legions of kids in this picture, who probably had a blast pretending to be a kill-crazy street gang.I think I'd get into the story and the characters more with a second viewing. But is it worth seeing again? Perhaps. I'd probably never enjoy it, though. There's something cynical going on here, a gloomier resolution than what's in similar subject matter (such as 'Boyz N The Hood'). That film is a tragedy, this one is a tragedy of such extreme proportions that you know nothing can save the people---especially the innocent---in the city of God. Judging by how popular the movie is with audiences worldwide, I'm in the minority here. All I can hope for is that this film illuminates this gangland mentality that we see in all downtrodden cities. If the film helps to correct that issue, it will indeed have served a valuable purpose. I recommend 'City Of God', just not very strongly.",8,4,6,1 March 2004
Garden State," To See This Movie Is To Love Natalie Portman
","Natalie Portman is back! Emperor Lucas released her from the blue-screen purgatory to co-star with Zach Braff in this goofy character study, 'Garden State'. Braff pulls a Chaplin by also writing and directing, but his lovely co-star is the focus here. It took about 3 minutes for me to fall in love with her. She's a kook in the Kate Winslet 'Eternal Sunshine' mode, yet THAT'S the appeal. Portman & Winslet have given the 2 best female performances so far this year. I'll be strapping on my 'Garden State' cheerleading pom-poms when they start talking about 2004 award nominations.Braff (from TV's 'Scrubs') is Andrew 'Large' Largeman, a struggling LA actor who's been zonked on prescribed meds for 17 years. When his pop (Ian Holm) phones to announce that dear old depressed mom has died, it's time to fly back to New Jersey. Once home, he renews long-ago acquaintances, kicks the pill habit, and meets the nutty-sweet Sam (Portman). The story is how these two oddballs fall in delirious love while dealing with their problematic lives. Sure, you've seen all that before, but everyone involved in this production makes it work beautifully. For a low-budget feature, it even looks quite good and the soundtrack is terrific.The movie doesn't always succeed. There's a lengthy sequence towards the end with the dependable Peter Sarsgaard that takes its sweet time achieving anything. At least it leads to something climactic for the characters, whether or not that trip is as meaningful to us. There's plenty of bizarre humour in this very funny film, but they manage to make most of it sing. Luckily, the rampant zaniness isn't forced. Braff even underplays in the Dustin Hoffman 'Graduate' mode. He might be playing a psychiatrist's dream patient, but he's actually as normal a person as there is in the movie.After the show was over, I found myself grinning like a happy fool. Good God, how I enjoyed this movie! I almost believed I could find my own Sam right there on the street corner. The last time a movie (and a character) warmed my black heart so much was 'In America'. 'Garden State' isn't nearly as fabulous as Jim Sheridan's masterpiece, but Braff's film is one I will see again & again, especially when a pick-me-up would hit the spot. The cinema was made for movies like this.",9,0,1,12 August 2004
Shrek 2," 'Another Whirlwind Adventure?' Kind Of...
","At least one animated film per year is worthy of the highest praise. One of the best cartoons of recent years, one of the very best films of 2001, and one of my favourite movies of the past few decades was the original 'Shrek'. Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney for DreamWorks and we finally got to see what kind of smart & hilarious film he was capable of spearheading in DreamWorks' animation department. A windfall at the box office ensured this sequel, which is a rock-solid movie in its own right. The first time out for the big, green ogre and his chums was definitely better, but 'Shrek 2' is still a happy piece of entertainment.So now Shrek and Fiona are married, they've returned to their lovely swamp, and Donkey is their own Kato Kaelin. Fiona's parents---the King and Queen of 'Far, Far Away', which looks a lot like Beverly Hills---want to meet their ogre-in-law (although they expect Prince Charming). In fact, that jackass Charming himself mucks things up for our heroes, as does a malevolent Fairy Godmother. They both intend to knock Shrek out of the picture and let the Prince weasel into Fiona's heart. The unhappy King even pays Puss In Boots to whack the big guy, which doesn't go quite as planned. Fiona is hurt that her husband and father won't even try to get along. From there, as the ass says, 'Shrek and Donkey, off on another whirlwind adventure'.Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), and Cameron Diaz (Fiona) are back. Antonio Banderas (Puss), John Cleese (King), Julie Andrews (Queen), Rupert Everett (Charming), and Jennifer Saunders (Godmother) have joined the cast of computer renderings. That sounds like a dynamite team, and they bounce off each other pretty well. Murphy's act isn't nearly as funny this time and the zing of the original movie just isn't there. Banderas is having a blast parodying his Zorro personality, though and his Puss character is a highlight. 'Shrek 2' does not fall flat on its face. I enjoyed myself and did plenty of chuckling.Still, it takes a long time for the truly funny stuff to get going. Eventually, Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, and some other 'fairy tale...things' arrive to help out the good guys. Then the laughs are aplenty. The climax has a lot of stuff to sort out at once, but it's nice to see that no character is forgotten. I don't think you'll be very stunned by the ending, which is not much more than a rehash of the first film. All the same, tykes will enjoy themselves, their parents will too, and quick-eyed viewers will have a great time trying to spot the amazing detail that went into this project. Indeed, the animation is awesome. You should see 'Shrek 2'. I just wish it lived up to its famous name with a bit more daring and originality.",7,0,0,25 May 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," Bailey Battles The Bully Banker
","George Bailey shouldn't complain. Yes, he desperately wants to get out of his one-horse town and see the world, but he's got a gorgeous wife, a herd of rambunctious kids, a big house, runs his own business, his brother is a war hero, and he even scrounges up enough time to build a model bridge in his living room. The life! It's wonderful!Okay, it's not all sunshine and lollipops. George (played so memorably by Jimmy Stewart) must go head-to-head with bully banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) on a daily basis. Potter wants to own the town of Bedford Falls and it seems like he's one man away from achieving that goal. It's not like the family business (the Bailey Bros Building & Loan) would flourish---or even survive---without George. Absent-minded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) would ruin the place within minutes if he was put in charge.It's gotta wear on a guy to take on a money-grubbing banker when that banker's morals are at pre-redemption Ebezener Scrooge levels. After Uncle Billy stupidly puts a large sum of dollars into the hands of the enemy (on Christmas Eve, no less), George feels he'll be blamed and finds himself in a suicidal bout of depression. Along comes a simpleton angel (Uncle Billy's counterpart, perhaps?) to show him a glimpse of what the town would be like if George had never existed.You know this story, obviously. Everybody does. Either you buy the cornpone or you don't. Some of director Frank Capra's projects lay it on too thick, but this movie balances quaint charm and epic darkness. The American Film Institute clearly loved it because it was in the Top 20 of both their 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists. I say this one belongs in the Top 5. I may not believe in angels, but I do believe in a movie that can still wring tears out of my eyes after so many Christmas viewings.

","Sometimes my taste in movies is as shallow as a puddle. 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is proof because, man, I love that poster. When you've got beauty like THAT to market your film, to hell with a plot. With Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie looking their spectacular best in this action-romance flick, I was too hypnotized by the beautiful people to be upset about the flimsy story. If you want an assassin story directed by Doug Liman with depth...well, go rent 'The Bourne Identity'. His latest picture might be vapid, but he lets his stars gloss over most of the plot holes.Pitt & Jolie play John & Jane Smith. Neither spouse knows that the other has a secret life as a 'hitter' for an underground government agency. Their day-to-day lives are a crashing bore because they've got to pretend to be white-collar drones who make scads of money. Then they're assigned to rub each other out and life is no longer such a yawn for the Smiths. That's the story and it takes about 2 hours to tell it. Even with such an over-long running time, there's no real ending. It just sort of...ends.The biggest brain-turned-on complaint is this---for people who kill for a living, they're both remarkably bland about it. In fairness, though, the movie is saucy and sexy. They've got chemistry and they exchange some nifty banter. I liked how Jane is better at the job than John, partly because Jolie is more believable than Pitt as an ruthless killer. At least he puts his usual goofy spin on the character. When Pitt gets to relax, he has more fun than most Hollywood heartthrobs get to. So take a date and see 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' make love and murder. They're pretty good at both.",7,2,4,2 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Vinny V Is On Fire
","This is a tough one to review. 'Wedding Crashers' has too many plot-driven scenes where no one acts in a remotely realistic way. But it's pretty funny (and, for once, the studio didn't wuss out and remove all the profanity & nudity). The unique talents of Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, and even co-star Owen Wilson are almost completely wasted. But co-star Vince Vaughn is hilarious and he steals his own movie (if that's possible). There are an equal number of bads & goods in this flick and director David Dobkin isn't creative enough to minimize the wrong ones while maximizing the right ones. But I laughed.Unless you have a chemical aversion to the fast-talking ingenuity of Vince Vaughn, you'll LOL too. His scenes with Isla Fisher (a cute fling who becomes a comedic psycho) pile up and the story requirements rob us of seeing Vaughn do more zany things with buddy Wilson. The early scenes are great---with their clever scheme to bust in on weddings and score with lonely women at the reception---and I wanted more of that selfish hedonism. The two man-children are at their best when they're putting people on. The climax requires sincerity and it's handled nicely enough. Give me more of the 'I wish I had the guts to pull that stuff' screwiness, though.Wilson's scenes with young stunner Rachel McAdams carry the plot. He falls for her at her sister's wedding and gets himself & Vaughn invited to the family home for the rest of the weekend. They're cute together, but Vaughn is the charming rogue of this picture, humorously fending off advances from more than 1 member of McAdams' screwy family. Not even daddy Walken can maintain control of his kids. There should have been more wedding crashing in 'Wedding Crashers', although the movie certainly doesn't need to be any longer than it already is. The movie is flawed, but Vinny V in particular is a ton of fun.",6,2,5,24 July 2005
Man on Fire," Hero Or Brutal Sadist?
","Tony Scott is one of the modern maestros of fancy editing, zippity camera-work, and slick violence. So it's a shame that 'Man On Fire' is closer to the ugly sadism in 'The Fan' than to his wonderful techo-thriller 'Enemy Of The State'. Scott's films are fairly empty and derivative at the best of times, but he knows how to shoot action. Reuniting with Denzel Washington (they made the dynamite submarine drama, 'Crimson Tide') and working from Brian Helgeland's screenplay, this seemed like a can't-miss flick. Well, it missed.What went wrong with 'Man On Fire'? Is it too long? Yes. Apart from the rock-solid Washington and the mere presence of Christopher Walken (playing *GASP* a good guy), is the cast mostly forgettable? Uh huh. Does Scott over-do the visual tricks when he should just let his story work on its own? Yup. Is the movie just too gruesome in the final hour when the hero turns vigilante and shows how they used to do things in Special Ops? Oh yeah. But at least the film is not boring or stupid. Denzel Washington is responsible for a lot of what DOES work, and he's given the opportunity to play a troubled hero in the first half and a sadistic hero in the second half. Actors love challenges like that and it's hard not to root for Denzel when he's kicking the asses of a bunch of guys who deserve it.Dakota Fanning continues to seem like she's an alien from far, far away. This little girl is too grown up for her own good. She can act, though, and her relationship with bodyguard Denzel is nicely developed. They're about the only characters who matter. Everyone else is window dressing. This isn't a terrible film, but it's not one of Tony Scott's best. He usually finds a way to make his violent flicks fun. There isn't much humour or fun to be found here, though. Even worse, there are no surprises in 'Man On Fire'. Geez, if you don't see the plot twist coming from 4 theatres away, you need to see more movies. But I liked the way he used (and sometimes OVERUSED) subtitles.Maybe that's the kick in the head. Here's a movie about kidnappings and children in danger and murders and torture and betrayal and money and Mexico. It's got Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken in supporting performances. The lead is one of the finest actors in Hollywood and his young co-star is the female Haley Joel Osment. The director has made his millions working in the action-thriller genre. And still...all I can remember is the subtitles. I guess that's the essence of Tony Scott, style over substance. In 'Man On Fire', the gap between style and substance was a gigantic chasm.",6,0,0,5 May 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Funny Idiots Of TV News
","Will Ferrell and company seem to be 2 decades late in satirizing the leisure-suit era of over-blown TV personalities. Then again, the biggest change from that time to this is that now the ego-twit types in the news game are not just local, they're national. So either 'Anchorman' is way late for the party or it's very timely. Look, I don't really care which. Is it funny? Will it show you a silly, good time? Sure, and I think silliness is the best you can expect from such a soft-boiled egg. This parody is not trying to hurt anybody for real, just poke them gently in the rib cage. But even though this one drives in the slow lane when it should be speeding down the humour highway, the movie made me laugh...sometimes in spite of myself.What surprised me was that it gets funnier as it goes along, especially when the cartoon violence escalates. It's hard to take anything seriously, but an old-fashioned rumble is so stupidly violent that it's just too funny for words. The movie sports plenty of cameos, most of them unveiled in this one scene. In fact, everybody Ferrell ever met seems to be in this flick. His rumble opponents are rival anchors from 3 different stations and they happen to be recognizable movie stars too. I enjoyed this one idiotic scene so much, that it made every limp moment that came before seem funnier.So what's the story then? Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a sensationally arrogant and dumb San Diego news anchor. His goofy co-stars (including Paul Rudd & the scarily dim Steve Carrell) are also his only friends until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives to spike their testosterone punch. Soon she's sharing Burgundy's desk and his bed. But the men resent this woman (the first female anchor ever, apparently) and humorous trouble brews. Fred Willard plays the boss and straight man, which is a bit of a disappointment. He's too hilarious to be so serious.Will Ferrell is so popular right now, his script could have been a fiery turd and the flick would STILL make a huge profit. He & rookie director Adam McKay (a colleague from Ferrell's SNL days) co-authored the screenplay, which was probably left wide open for hours worth of improvs. A stronger director might have held out for even better jokes. An experienced director might have tightened things up and paced the movie better. The abundant flaws don't do serious damage. I may not remember much about 'Anchorman' in 3 months, but lots of chuckles were yanked outta me this afternoon. If you want to laugh at foolishness by the Will Ferrell troupe, this fake news story might be the ticket. Or it might not...",7,2,2,20 July 2004
Ray," Jamie IS Ray
","If someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into 'Ray' and asked what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would have been time for a blank stare. After all, what is this (fictitious) person talking' about? That wasn't Jamie Foxx up on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is flat-out brilliant.The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with R&B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well-worn biopic outline. Super-talented youngster battles adversity, achieves greatness while also self-destructing, then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles' flaws (heroin abuse, chronic womanizing, persistent bastard-fathering) even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music.Kerry Washington and Regina King play the main women in Ray's life, one his long-suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses match Foxx stride for stride. What takes him to a different level, though, is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his headstrong mother and Curtis Armstrong as a music exec. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and---better yet---more starring roles.I was not a Ray Charles aficionado before 'Ray'. Apparently, the film has left out a lot (as do all biopics), but this picture functions as both an old-fashioned crowd pleaser AND a dark investigation of a brilliant/troubled man. For those who whine that Foxx doesn't actually sing (as if that somehow diminishes his performance), take a hike. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can't have everything. What the talented star does in this picture is about as close to 'everything' as we'll probably see for a while.",7,127,143,19 December 2004
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Vanity Run Amok In The Land Of Weirdos
","The Queen should've just looked into her mirror---and stopped listening to her mirror---to see that she is indeed fairer than Snow White. I mean, judging 76-year-old cartoon characters on the basis of hotness is kinda creepy, but I'll risk creep accusations. The Queen is a babe. Too bad she's a murderous psycho who's obsessed with winning a beauty contest. It's like she's trying to one-up her mirror. 'I'll show you who's more subjectively beautiful, you glass devil!' We're all a little vain sometimes, but don't you have a kingdom to run, lady?Not that the dwarfs are above reproach either. They're sitting on a fortune in gems and they aren't even spending any of it to improve their lot in life...or the lot of those less fortunate than them. Plus, they tend to wallow in filth. Geez, what a motley cast of characters. Snow White is one of the shallowest movie characters in history, but she should have just bailed on ALL these weirdos. Take the hardworking woodland creatures and split for Oz or Neverland or Belize.But I do love this movie. Irrationally, really. It's the dwarfs! Dopey is the cutest nitwit of all time and Grumpy is pretty much always right. Snow White DOES bring them misery and they would've been saved a lot of heartache if they'd just kicked her out. Still, it's sweet that even Grumpy relents. How can you not relent and fall for this gorgeous little trifle of a movie? The American Film Institute sure did, putting Snow & The 7 on five of its Best Of compilations, including both of the '100 Years, 100 Movies' lists.So, yes, the Queen is evil and everyone else in this movie is absurdly pure at heart, but I still think I'd like to live under the Queen's reign. Apparently she spends most of her time gossiping with a mirror and not, you know, doing her job. You could get away with murder, maybe even step-daughtericide! The Queen herself almost does.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the 'Podcasts' section for our 31-minute Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs 'cast...and many others.

Fantastic Four," The Thing Rocks
","'Fantastic Four' is a first-rate Marvel comic book crammed into a second-rate F/X movie. Director Tim Story doesn't do anything funky with the material (ordinary people turned into freaks after a cosmic mishap in space) and he's given us one of the lamest villains since 'Star Trek: Nemesis'. Maybe Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) is cool in print, but he blows violent chunks on the big screen. Super-stretchy Reed Richards and Sue Storm---also known as Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl---are not any better. At least Sue's brother, Johnny Storm (aka the Human Torch), uses his newfound fame to get girls...and more fame. He's one of the rare superheroes who actually ENJOYS being a superhero.I didn't have much use for Reed Richards or Sue Storm. It doesn't help that these soft-soap characters are played by a reliable bore (Ioan Gruffudd) and a marginally talented beauty (Jessica Alba). At least Johnny is refreshing in his youthful exuberance and arrogance, even if he's also a bit of a doofus. On the other hand, I couldn't get enough of Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), better known as the Thing. This one character nearly saves the whole movie. I liked him so much, I went right out and bought the action figure. Now the ugly rock man proudly sits on my bookcase alongside the Buddy Christ, Marv from 'Sin City', and Yogi Bear.The Thing is the thinking man's Incredible Hulk. Chiklis works hard to show the heart under a mountain of rock. He makes the most of his cumbersome makeup. I actually some genuine emotion for him 2 or 3 times. First, when he was given a well-deserved ovation from the crowd after saving some firemen and their truck from going off a bridge. And then when he gets kicked to the curb by his terrified wife. And once again at the end of the movie when he proves he'll sacrifice anything for his friends. A real hero. It's true that as a comic-to-movie adaptation, 'Fantastic Four' is more like the 'Fantastic 1 and a half'. But the Thing rocks. I've got his action figure to prove it.",6,0,1,1 February 2006
Hustle & Flow," It's Hard Not To Love The Singing Pimp
","Hustle & Flow is the Baadasssss of 2005. It's a well-acted, low-budget flick about black culture and it seems to have been made with equal parts heart & talent. Both films are emotional, entertaining, and completely riveting. The more popular comparison is to Rocky, which is perfectly valid too...if the Italian Stallion had been a Memphis pimp instead of an illiterate club fighter in Philly. I won't continue comparing director Craig Brewer's 2nd picture to ones that came before, except to add that it's not only similar to Rocky and Baadasssss, it's almost as satisfying as both of those. And for a movie with some dark themes, it's a lot of fun to watch.If you're a fan of music, you're bound to love the lengthy scene in which DJay (Terrence Howard, in a fabulous Oscar-nominated performance) is trying to lay down a track for his breakthrough hip-hop (and Oscar-winning) song, 'It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp.' It's fascinating to watch the whole process. Maybe the speed and success with which the song gets put together isn't realistic, but that doesn't stop the scene from being fascinating. DJay had been a fairly horrible guy up until this point in the movie. Here's his turning point. When his natural talent for hip-hop shines through with ample support from his friends and hoes (yes, they have a role to play in this music venture), DJay becomes a new man. Howard is a good actor and it's hard not to be on the side of a good actor, even though DJay does and says some terrible things to his ladies.His faith in Nola (scrappy Taryn Manning) and his apparently genuine love for Shug (a spectacular Taraji P. Henson, stealing scenes in the Adrian Balboa role) redeem his earlier thuggery. Those 2 actresses are terrific and so are Anthony Anderson and DJ Squalls, who play Howard's music gurus. Brewer, who also wrote the script, guides them all with a steady hand. He even manages to create some real tension in the climax because the end result isn't telegraphed from the start. Can the guy who sells women for a living sell himself to super-rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris)? The final scenes that follow are bittersweet, although more sweet than bitter. What's ENTIRELY sweet about Hustle & Flow is the music, the acting, and coolness factor. Definitely 2005's Baadasssss.",9,3,5,16 August 2006
The Wizard of Oz," A Personal Letter To The Wicked Witch Of The East
","Dear Wicked Witch Of The East,So sorry you died. It seems like getting out of the way of a house falling out of the sky is not a tall order for someone with your noteworthy powers, but c'est la vie. It was those pesky Munchkins, wasn't it? They distracted you, what with their high-pitched singing and their Lollipop Guild. Who gave those shrimps the right to unionize? It was probably the Wizard. That guy is drunk with power...or perhaps with alcohol.Rumour has it you intended to legacy those sparkling shoes of yours to your sister (along with your china hutch and photo albums), but that was not honoured. The Northern Witch stole your glittering footwear and gave them to---irony alert---the very jerk who crushed you. Perhaps a calculated violent response is in order. The young girl's trio of friends should not pose a credible threat. Their total combined IQ might not break double digits.Oh, right, there's a juicy piece of news! The shoe-stealer has made some friends here in Oz, among them a jelly-legged straw man, a metal axe-man, and the biggest pussy of a lionÂ…perhaps ever. All of them are remarkably inept at their jobs (scare-crowing, wood-cutting, and scare-peopling). Lest I forget, the shoe thief also has a small canine companion. Resourceful little pooch. He's great at busting phonies who hide behind curtains.As for your sis, she's, uh, indisposed. She seems to have disappeared and her employees aren't talking. They're singing and chanting, but not talking. Perhaps she left Oz for somewhere vacationy, like Kansas. And why not? I hear there's no place like it.Much love, UsP.S. Glinda is still a jerk.If you got a kick out of this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the 'Podcasts' section for our 40-minute Wizard Of Oz 'cast...and many others.

Dodgeball," A Funny Bit Of Comic Stupidity
","I have no awful memories of dodgeball and I will have no awful memories of 'Dodgeball'. I had fun playing this simplest of school games and had fun breezing through this goof-fest of a movie. As the cliche goes, it's good for a laugh. Actually, it's good for plenty of laughs and that's far more than I can say for most joke-free comedies. It's five sticks of foolish fun. I don't know how they pulled it off, though, because this ridiculous material has no right to be as enjoyable as it is, especially since you know where it's heading from the opening credits. Cliches or not, the filmmakers make it work.Slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) owns a dive of a gym called Average Joe's. Muscle-twit White Goodman (Ben Stiller) owns the massive Globo Gym and intends to buy up La Fleur's business. To raise the $50,000 needed to pay the mortgage, a handful of members at Average Joe's enter a dodgeball tournament in Vegas. The jealous Goodman gathers super-jocks together to enter the same tourney. The lovely Christine Taylor (Kate Veach) is the third point of a humourous love triangle, who also proves to be a whiz playing the title game. Apart from a few twists and turns, the story follows the well-worn 'Rocky' path. It even takes some gentle jabs at the formula.This flick proves once again that pratfalls are funny. Watching La Fleur's clumsy chums get pegged with red balls during Rip Torn's brutal training sessions, writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber treks to the well...but never goes there once too often. Stiller's insecure character hammers the same note, but he's still pretty funny in a very obnoxious role. Vaughn is about as relaxed as a piece of lunch meat, which goes against his usual high-strung style. The supporting cast members (including Stephen Root, who will always be Bill from 'King Of The Hill' to me) don't leap past the stars, even though they all get to shine with lots of nerdy moments of comic stupidity.What I found surprising is that many of the laughs hit you in the face a beat or two later. I expected that a movie with such obvious intentions would play all its cards right in front of you, but many of the jokes work best as rebounders and asides. Stiller and Vaughn must have called in some favours to get all the guest stars to do a cameo---some of them are great and some are unnecessary. In any case, 'Dodgeball' is a hoot without being a manic 'throw everything at the wall' type comedy. There's nothing wrong with that, unless you hated the game as a kid. Then again, considering this is a 'true underdog story', maybe inept dodgeballers can enjoy it too.",7,0,0,8 July 2004
