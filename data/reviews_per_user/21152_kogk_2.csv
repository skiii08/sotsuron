First Man," Snooze fest
",LONG! BORING! Drawn out. Could of easily made this a 90 minute movie and keep audiences involved.,3,4,6,26 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Wasted 3 hours
","This movie could of easily been 2 hours. Cant believe how close I was to falling asleep during it. Yes are there a few good actions, sure are. But there is too much stalling and 'build up' between. There were already 22 films for build up. Enough with the fore play. It was time for a the pay off and sadly they dropped the ball.",5,8,13,2 May 2019
