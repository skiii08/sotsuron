The Avengers," Avengers assembled
",The pacing of the movie is great. It shows dispute and how the avengers come together as a team. It's does it's job excellently.,10,0,0,28 April 2020
The Incredible Hulk," This movie was a little disappointing
",After watching iron man you're pretty much forced to see this movie but it's honestly a bit of a letdown. It's not awful but doesn't feel like an mcu movie.,6,0,0,27 April 2020
Iron Man 3," Chill comic people
","Ok I don't care that this isn't like the comics because there aren't really any marvel movies exactly like the comics. No one wants to direct a movie that has already been made.
Now that that's out of the way this was a great movie. It showed that without his suits he is still iron man. Tony stark is iron man not his suits. Also this was a great movie in general. I love watching it it Christmas. Best holiday movie ever.",8,1,2,16 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Mediocre marvel movies are still great movies
",This movie was a follow up to iron man. It wasn't the greatest movie ever but it is still a great movie.,8,0,0,27 April 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Not Cap at his best
",Once again like most faze 1 MCU movies this film does its job and shows us another avenger. All around it's not a bad film but the pacing was a little slow. The movie does show us some cool fights by the end but the trip to the end takes longer then expected. The movie does pay off in the end and is definitely worth a watch. Just nothing outstanding.,7,0,0,27 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Oh man they did good
","Marvel thought hey, let's go to space and do awesome stuff out there. And damn they executed it incredibly! This movie is so worth your watch. It's funny, has ties to the larger marvel movies and has great characters and pacing. Such a good movie.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
Thor," This movie was a little out there
",When all these movies were coming out it was a little odd to all of a sudden jump to Thor and what not. It wasn't a bad Movie but the storyline was a little boring.,6,0,0,27 April 2020
Ice Age: Continental Drift," I hate the short thing and peaches
",The whole arc is soooooo cringe worthy. The rest is ok. Should have stopped after the Dino movie.,6,1,2,16 March 2019
Iron Man," Great start to the mcu
",This movie gets you hooked on marvel movies and everything else to come.,10,0,0,27 April 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Just watch a summary video
","This movie is so incredibly awfully boring but was merely a speed bump for the franchise. Like I said, not worth the watch. Marvel tried but failed, just move on to the next movie.",5,0,0,30 April 2020
