","I was lucky enough to have seen this movie as far back as May. It was one of the freakiest movies to date. There was one thing that was wrong.. The version i got did not describe to you what the ending ment. This also might be the version that the showed at all the film shows and the ones that are going around the internet like crazy. I just wanted to say after seeing it in the theater, It Was The Best God Damn Movie I Have Seen In My Life, except for Stand By Me of course!!",10,1,2,23 July 1999
