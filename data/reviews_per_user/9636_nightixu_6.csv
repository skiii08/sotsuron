3:10 to Yuma," One of the best Western flicks!
","This personally is one of my favorite western flicks and one of my favorite movies of all time as well. The movie is basically about Dan Evans played by bale who volunteers to escort the outlaw Ben Wade played by Crowe to the 3.10 train to Yuma. One of the most important factors in a movie to me, are the quality of the stories and the character and it excels in both. Peter Fonda, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts all did very well in their roles adding more depth and quality to the story. What comes to mind when i watched this movie is Crimson Tide, Unforgiven and Point Break. Character-Driven stories with a protagonist and an antagonist with protagonis-tic qualities. It's weird but that's how i see it.This movie is filled with characters you'll love or hate because of the opportunities for them to show it. The dialogues are excellent. What i especially love is the chemistry between the characters Dan Evans and Ben Wade. They seem like complete opposites but there's something similar about them. Most likely the conviction they have and their belief that the way each lead their live is the right way and the two continually argues about the subject throughout the movie due to Wade repeatedly bribing his way out; Dan Evans as the good and responsible family man and Wade as the street smart asshole who gets what he wants. The portrayal and the relationship between the two main characters, Its not the clich√© good vs evil typeThe other supporting cast are great as well. Ben foster does a particularly good job playing the main antagonist, not crowe but Foster. He's a bad ass with style. The action scenes are good old western style with gunfights on horses and in towns.The whole story proceeds with a smooth pace and it always keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Great action must always be preceded by great story and characters and that is why the action scenes are marvellous taking you back to the old western shoot'em ups. I highly recommend this movie. Truly one of the best western flicks with great soundtrack.",9,1,2,10 July 2011
Watchmen," One of the best superhero movies i have ever watched!
","Forget Daredevil. Forget The Hulk. Forget the Fantastic Four. Forget even spiderman. Watchmen has the best plot, excellent action scenes and the aesthetics are very much pleasing to the eyes. I have never read the comic book nor have i ever heard of Watchmen therefore i couldn't have high expectations as most fans of the comic book would have. Alan Moore the creator or watchmen might have been disappointed that his 'baby' had been disfigured and mutated by Hollywood but i believe Zack Snyder and David Hayter the main scriptwriter did a wonderful job of turning the comic book into this great film.First off, the characters. Each one of the watchmen have interesting and their own unique personalities and the movie tells the audiences their background by shifting the focus of a particular scene on their perspective. Rorschach's is through the dialogue in his journal, Jupiter is through the flashbacks she has, Mr Manhattan is through his own internal thoughts and reminiscence. The two characters that didn't really intimately reveal their past was Dan and Adrian. Though we all get to know about each one of them. That's the whole charm of Watchmen as i've heard. The story within the story. Well the movie managed to accomplish that. By shifting the perspectives to each of the watchmen, we feel as if we get to know each one of them and understand their personalities. The fight scenes are spectacular. I love the how Zack directed it. It's not cheesy, its not dull and its not over the top. To give a better example, its not like batman forever nor is it like superman returns or the hulk. It's more like the dark knight only with a Zack Snyder style to it just like in 300. The whole story is great and like i've said its not a regular superhero movie. Most of them don't have special powers so it's a little like the Christopher nolan's batman. The whole world is dark and pre-apocalyptic. It's like the x-men plus spiderman and with the darkness of batman. Thats basically the world of watchmen adding in politics and war. This movie is a must watch because it will stimulate all your senses. It's not a mindless action movie nor is it too dull with a lot of talking. It has a perfect balance of dialogue, story and action. It's also a good way to introduce people to the watchmen comic which i now am interested to read.",9,0,3,16 February 2010
Face_Off," One of the best action films ever!!!
","Basically, this is a Hollywood version of a hong kong action film. John Woo is a great action film director and he made the classic Hard Boiled with Chow Yun Fatt. With this film, there are all the stylized gun fights that characterizes a John Woo film. Its just amazing. Its like John Travolta said, the way John Woo makes his film, is like a dance. Its not a Die Hard nor is it a Matrix. But i feel it has the best of both. The story is pretty far fetched. Sean Archer played by Travolta, is the cop out for revenge against Castor Troy played by Cage who tried to assassinate him but ended up killing his son instead. Troy is captured after an amazing gun battle. They end up swapping faces and lives. Some of the parts are hard to believe but in the end, its a movie and its not meant to be taken so seriously. You can expect at least 40 minutes of just pure action scenes. Explosions, gun battles and the likes. One thing i admire about this film is that the action scenes are raw and hardcore yet at the same time smooth and stylish. They took the best from the east and the west put them together. Its like a predecessor to the matrix but without the bullet time. When you actually see how they shoot their guns, their movements, the jumping out shots, its just amazing. There isn't a minute that bores you. The characters are interesting as well. Castor Troy is a flamboyant and ruthless character. Abit like the joker from batman. He's likable as a villain but detestable as well. Sean Archer you can relate to him. He's lost his son and his relationship with his family is deteriorating but he wants to put an end to all this and you're just rooting for him. Thats the thing about action films. Its not just about the action. You need a good story and good characters. This movie has both and damn good action. That's why i gave it a 9. Just go along for the ride. Pretty ridiculous story but a good one nonetheless.",Null,1,1,11 August 2011
Kick-Ass," Kick-Ass fails at everything but has great actions scenes.
","On first impression, kick ass looks a little bit like a parody of superheroes which i think it ultimately is, albeit a more serious parody. I was really moved by the beginning of the movie where the hero kick-ass, played by Aaron johnson, is upset with the world as they let crime go unpunished even as it happened right in front of them. Being a comic book nerd that he is, he acts on his initiative and orders a wetsuit online for his superhero costume and thus, kick-ass is born. The beginning was definitely kick-ass. But the plot,story and my attention starts to disintegrate after that. I didn't get to like any of the characters that much except for big daddy and hit-girl. They're actually more kick-ass than kick-ass himself. In fact, those 2 are the ONLY THINGS in the movie that makes kick-ass KICK ASS. The story does not have a cohesive flow. More like a jumbled mix. In my opinion, the story would have been nicer if it followed Big daddy and hit-girl and they were the actual main characters. The movie does give you a few laughs here and there but it doesn't fully deserve to be called funny. You just sort of lose focus after awhile because there are too many things happening and it doesn't have that emotional pull. In the end, you feel like the movie barely accomplished anything. Once again, if the story had followed big daddy and hit-girl, it would have meant something. Kick-ass was a sideshow small fry throughout the movie. And you really expected great things from him. And that line he gave before he finished off the main antagonist was so cheesy. It was actually pretty gutsy for a wimpy small fry.Overall, through kick-ass side of the story, you get more hilarious, a bit touching and romance thing. For big daddy and hit-girl, you get sweet loving family, REAL kick ass fight scenes and emotional sad parts. The 2 stories clash which makes it a jumbled mess. Sort of like trying to be serious and funny with romance on the side and betrayal but fails horribly.The fight scenes were really great! I'd say the fight scenes alone was what made up my rating of 5 stars. It was slick, stylish and gratifying. Very violent and graphic as well. Only thing that made the movie worth watching to me. I'm sure the comic book was awesome but the movie sucked.",5,5,14,1 May 2010
The Hurt Locker," Good iraq war action movie with a lot of goofs.
","Most movies about the Iraq war are mostly dramas. The thing about them is that they take themselves too seriously and contain loads of propaganda or ideology in it. So of course there are emotional or melodramatic dialogues between characters and their opinion about how war is wrong or that what they're doing is right. However, most people i'm sure are tired of that bullcrap.This movie may just be the thing you need. Its plot is so thin and simple. It's about the Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team (EOD) in the US army Bravo Team consisting of the three main characters you'll be seeing throughout the whole movie. SFC James, sgt sandborn and sgt Eldridge. It depicts their experiences and the events they faced before their rotation in around 28 days. That's the whole plot but the movie is character driven therefore, what makes this movie a cut above the rest is its characters. Jeremy Renner is fantastic in this movie. I loved his performance in 28 weeks later and i loved it here. He's so charismatic and cool. The interaction between them and the unstable relationship they build as a team is interesting. They don't just hate each other and then love each other. They hate each other and then you're not sure if they still do. The portrayal of the soldier's psyche as he goes on tour in iraq is great. They don't tell you much, rather they let you see for yourself. See that's the thing about this movie and the others, it's more action and talk less but it gets the message across better than those other propaganda movies which are chock full of dramatic dialogues.The goofs are what bothered me throughout the movie; and there are A LOT. It may be nitpicking but if i think they should try to make it as real as possible. To make it believable? For example, the EOD team consisting of just three members. Where are their escorts? ATO's must be like medics because of their specialism in a skill that is highly needed. They're high value targets. Also, why are there civilian and animals near the IED? Where's the cordon? Are the soldiers jacking off? Oh and this ones i just cannot comprehend. The way SFC james just walks to the bomb without carrying his kit, checking for secondary devices and handling the bomb like a three year old handles his toys. Where is the SOP? Come on if its that easy, any grunt can be an ATO. Just snap a wire and its defused. You don't even know if its RCIED or keyless car entry system or if its motion sensitive.The whole plot and events in the movie is very similar to the book by Major Chris Hunter 'Eight lives down'. The movie is good. Gets your blood pumping but makes you feel also for the soldiers and the civilians that suffer. Overall, this movie is a great war movie.",7,0,4,30 January 2010
Click," Another Charming and funny movie by Adam Sandler
","Most of Adam Sandler's movie has its unique and great charm that always seem to pull me in. The movie seem to include all kinds of genres into it. Comedy, Romance, Drama and a little bit of horror. Well the main genre is of course comedy but when it gets to the scenes which has romance or the sad parts, it truly evokes that emotion in me instead of giving an impression of a comedy movie trying to include love and sad scenes. The story revolves around Michael Newman (Sandler) an average family guy and promising architect who struggles to please both his boss and his family with his family usually the one getting disappointed. Having had enough of this, he 'fast-forwards' through life with the universal remote given to him by Morty (Walken). Of course things don't usually go according to plan. The story floats along well with more light-heartedness and comedy earlier on in the film but gets darker and there's even a little twist at the latter part which is quite predictable. Every character plays their part well especially the little adorable girl that play as adam sandler's kid daughter. Her reaction to a particular scene was so funny and cute. Its a feel-good movie that will surely entertain everyone from young to old. The only people that could hate this movie are those that don't understand adam sandler's humor.",9,0,1,4 July 2009
