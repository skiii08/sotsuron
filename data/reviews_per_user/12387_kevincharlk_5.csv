Captain Phillips," Good movie with shaky camera
","I watched alone. But after half way down the movie I got sick due to the way they shoot it. It is really shaky. I understand that it is on sea and things are waving and shaking, but even when they shoot inside a giant vessel, camera still as shaky as on small boat which is not realistic at all. If you have weak motion sickness, please reconsider if you want to watch this film.However, the movie is great in many aspect.",7,1,2,29 October 2018
Bird Box," Great acting but poor story
",The action and filming tactics are awesome. But the story has a lot of areas to improve. It does create the tension atmosphere very well.I got to know that they copy movie from The Happening. I reduced my rating because of this. I dislike this act of copying.,6,0,1,4 January 2019
Man of Steel," Sensational parent relationship with action & scifi packed movie.
","I feel so touched at the beginning when the film tells about the origin of Superman. Especially when his adopted mother and father love him unconditionally so much. Even at time his mother is threaten to death, but yet she chose to protect his adopted son, Superman.However, the pace for Superman to fall in love with the woman is relatively fast. Maybe for the sake of movie, it is shorten?Well for the action part, it is not bad. Story line is decent. But I feel ending can be better. The fact that the final enemy being killed just like that makes me feel the superbeing very fragile, not as superb as he should be. I hope the story ends with telling people an idea how Superman lives after the invasion event.Overall, if you like superhero movie, this is a MUST. Go for it!",8,1,1,4 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Very bad logic
","The acting of Emily Blunt is awesome! But this film has major flaw.The fact they never think ahead what is going to happen and prepare well in advance is absurd. On the other hand, they have the capability to kill the 'creature', but they never even attempt to.All the while, my family was like 'hey anyone in this situation, surely will do something, why all the characters so stupid?'. It is like they deliberately made the characters stupid so that the film can go on.I don't think I will recommend this to my friends.",3,1,2,4 January 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Don't watch this 3 hours movie if you hasn't watch Man of Steel
","I started with confusion about what the heck is going almost for the whole movie. I have to watch Man of Steel fo recap this movie.The story line is good (if you know what is going on). Action parts are awesome.One big thing I dislike is the conflict about Superman and Batman. As for both adults, things can just be solved by talking, yet they bring it to fight. Why they fight? Because hero simply fight. I found it uncessesary. Maybe I'm too logical on this, but we are human watching superbeings, logic is there. I think write can improve on this.",6,0,2,4 January 2019
