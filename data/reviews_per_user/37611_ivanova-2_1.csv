Antz," A movie for adults and children alike
","Animated movies are often considered 'for kids only', with the adults just tagging along.  Not so with ANTZ.  Here is a movie with the adults in mind as well.  Storylines, humor, etc. were multi-level, appealing to both children and adults.  It was ironic the number of children-free adults that were in the theater to see this movie. I went with a friend, her daughter (age 6) and my daughter (age 8).  The girls loved the 'boy meets girl' story and that the bad guys don't win.  My friend and I enjoyed the adult-aimed humor.",10,0,0,4 October 1998
