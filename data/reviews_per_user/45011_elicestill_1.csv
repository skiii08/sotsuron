Captain Phillips," Excellent movie for you and children
","Some children may be too young to realize just what is really going on, but I remember when all of this happened. I remembered how his wife was so brave. I remember when he was back on board a USA ship and how happy and proud America was to have this man back into OUR hands.It was all just a big mess there for awhile and life was very hard knowing that someone else had our man. It was a horrible mistake and I do hope that if this ever happens again, that USA is more prepared than they were this time, but as usual, thanking GOD and country.. he made it back into our hands.. I loved the movie and once again, Tom Hanks, did it one more time.. never seen a movie that he played in that was not good..thank you allowing me to say this..",10,0,3,4 April 2014
