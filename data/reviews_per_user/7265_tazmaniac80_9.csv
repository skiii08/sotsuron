Catch Me If You Can," good light hearted fun
","Don't expect too much from this movie - it doesn't have loads to offer. However it is a perfectly enjoyable film, with great performances from the gorgeous Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks. It might be a little longer than it should be, but it doesn't drag. There are some brilliant supporting acts, particularly from Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. I loved the opening credits and thought the musical score by John Williams was original and snappy. Watch this for some good light hearted fun, but not for special effects or fight scenes.8/10",8,0,1,16 February 2003
Romeo + Juliet," brilliant
","Yes, I am a teenage girl. Yes, i am a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio's. But he and all of the cast give great performances, and make this  a gem of a movie. It is incredibly moving, brings me to tears every time I watch it and always leaves me with a lump in my throat. It deserved to be high up in the Top 250, and I find it hard to critise anything about this film. It is definately worth watching, no matter what gender of age you are.",10,9,15,14 February 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," Great fun
","It's not your stereotypical teen movie, this ones different. The jokes are actually funny, the actors can actually act, and there is a point to the plot. The gorgeous Heath Ledger gives a substantial contribution to the cast, and Julia Stiles  gives a solid performance aswell. Everytime I watch this it leaves me in fits of laughter, and the jokes never wear old. Although the plot is predictable it is still an enjoyable movie. Older viewers might not appreciate the humour, however it would appeal to most ages. 7/10",9,1,1,17 February 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Boring
","I'm afraid to say i think this is the worst film I have ever seen, and I've just watched Peter Pan 2: Return To Neverland. After only a few minutes I had stopped reading the subtitles as I simply felt it was a pointless exercise. The scenes with flying people (which seemed to be the whole movie) were cheesy and unrealistic. The reason I don't like this film isn't that it is foreign and has subtitles (my favourite movie of all time has subtitles 'Run Lola Run') but it was just so boring. Please, if you haven't seen it, whatever you do, DON'T!2/10",2,0,1,15 February 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Another gem from dear Baz
","I love this movie, it is so different from anything else. Although all of the music is borrowed, it has been transformed into the soundtrack for what was one of the best movies of the year. Baz deliveries yet another gem for as to lavish as a cinema audience. The costumes are gorgeous, an array of vibrant colours for our eyes to feast upon. The direction, acting, singing and dancing were excellent. This film made me laugh and cry.Highly recommended.9/10",10,1,2,1 May 2003
Titanic," not that bad
","Ok, I admit, I am a teenage girl and a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio's. But despite him being in this picture, this film really isn't that bad. Maybe it didn't deserve all 11 of it's oscars (it doesn't compare to Ben-Hur) or over 1 billion at the box office. The acting isn't that great as the script is quite poor, but still the film doesn't deserve some of the comments it's received. It's entertaining and moving, and is worth watching if it's on. I think it deserved to get onto the Top 250 on this site, even if it shouldn't have got very high.",8,0,2,14 February 2003
Am√©lie," Wonderful
","I normally steer clear of foreign films with subtitles, but I found this hilarious. It is very funny, with great actors and a good storyline. I didn't really know what this film was about or anything, but I am very glad that i watched it. It is worth watching, ans very entertaining.
9/10.",9,0,2,14 February 2003
The Sixth Sense," Chilling stuff
","Ok, most of you probably know the twist ending, but all the same I won't spoil it for those of you that don't. I usually hate horror movies, as they tend to be gory, cheesy films with actors that can only bat their eyelids and scream. This is totally different. For a start, i didn't find it at all scary. Some parts ore slightly gross, and the whole film is eerie and chilling. It is very well acted, and has the only child actor that can actually act (Haley Joel Osment). Even if you have seen it before, or if you know the ending, it is still worth watching.",9,0,0,14 February 2003
Back to the Future," fun for all of the family
","This is one of those rare films that simply entertains. It doesn't cause the audience to furrow their brows in concentration, but doesn't leave them watching a load of rubbish with no plot. This is quite the opposite. It has a great script, interesting story line, and the cast are great. Micheal J Fox is brilliant as Marty McFly, and Christopher Lloyd is hilarious. All age groups would love this film, and I recommend buying the Back To The Future Trilogy.8/10",9,1,2,15 February 2003
