Ford v Ferrari," masterpiece car raceing movie.
",This movie is so energy- filled action-packed emotionally-thrilled that engages you and begs for your attention in every single scene. Christian Bale gives yet another brilliant per formance and so does Matt Damon and the entire cast. A movie not only for car enthusiasts but for everyone to enjoy.,9,1,2,9 April 2020
The King's Speech," Masterpiece Movie by Director Tom Hooper
","I won't go into detail about THE KING'S SPEECH after so many reviews in the media. I just wanted to say that this is a gem of a film, a MU ST for anyone who enjoys top class British drama at its very best. The acting of the superb cast is as it should be - without fault. Colin Firth gives the performance of a lifetime and is a worthy candidate for the highest acting awards. I was also very impressed by Helena Bonham-Carter, who looks exactly like the Duchess of York, Guy Pearce, an amazing Duke of Windsor and the wonderful Geoffrey Rush, always so good in any part he plays. It is a pleasure to see that the British cinema is still producing films of this quality. The cinema was completely full and the audience was completely silent throughout the film (something that doesn't happen very often!). At the end of the showing the audience warmly applauded this masterpiece.",9,0,0,21 May 2020
Rang De Basanti," Best Cinematography of Country's Freedom
","The movie is a blend of few many good things. The best thing about the movie undoubtedly is the comparison and shift from past to present. For people who thought old values are not for modern days, this sure is an eye o pener. An excellent music background score by A.R.Rahman. the cinematography is so damn realistic. Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to. Siddarth might have done a bit of over-acting. but the sensitive Aamir Khan is at sheer acting epitome. Expecting this to be nominated from India for Oscars. Unlike Dil Chahta Hai it is a more heavy and thought-provoking movie sure to rise Nationalist spirits.",10,0,0,10 April 2020
Oldboy," A South Korean Masterpiece
","Oldboy is one hell of a movie. It is a film that is characterized by surrealism, gritty violence and raw emotion. The theme is about revenge and how it destroys one person. After viewing it, it left me silent for more than five minutes to contemplate on what I have seen. It was simply a master piece. It has proved that Koreans are one of the most creative when it comes to cinema. But mind you, this film is not for everyone. Es pecially for the weak at heart. Aside from revenge, it touches subject on incest as well. Nevertheless, it is a MASTERPIECE. The acting is world-class in this film. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae were simply amazing as Oh Daesu and Lee Woo-jin res pectively. Credit should also be given to Gang Hye-jung as Mido. The characters are given emotional de pth that one could sy mpathize for. They were not simply categorized as either good or evil but they were allowed to feel raw emotion. The direction was also spectacular from Park Chan-wook. And the soundtrack was mesmerizing. This is definitely a must-see es pecially for people who love another kind of entertainment. I could have given this a 11 out of 10 rating if only I am allowed to.",9,0,0,4 May 2020
Interstellar," Best movie I have seen in my life #1 üòç
","This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christo pher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 100 out of 100.",10,0,1,15 March 2020
Incendies," 1+1=1
","Denis Villeneuve has created nothing less than a masterpiece. This film is revealing a great Director, es pecially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions. Despite being ske ptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan, when dealing with the very specific, multidimensional Lebanese drama, the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan's landscape es pecially with the film's photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious. Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen, many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it. This has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars. And it will win.",10,1,2,7 May 2020
The Pianist," An amazing opportunity to saw this movie
","Ok - so some might disagree and suggest Schindler's List is the best WW 2 film but for me it was the Pianist such a raw and painful representation of Nazi brutality and des peration of the people. This film isn't for everyone, but you know that going into it. You won't feel good afterwards, but that's a reminder you're human. Definitely worth a watch.",10,1,1,22 March 2020

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," It's a Wonderful Life üòäüòç
","Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. 0f all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice. How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are mo ments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend fro m childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy. The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests. The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull mo me nt in the film. The cinematography is su perb and cou ples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment. There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.",10,0,0,12 May 2020
Lincoln," Historical Drama √∞≈∏‚Ñ¢‚Äö
","Just read some of the 'bad' reviews & simply just don't get how you can't like this GRE AT MOVIE. Spielberg's 'Lincoln' was AW ESOME. The Director was able to take you 'Back In Time' when things were much simpler & primitive, way back in the 1860's. And Daniel Day Lewis moved me in this film like no other actor has ever done. Mr. Lewis' performance was mesmerizing and s pellbinding. He was 'Abraham Lincoln.' His acting in this movie is definitely 'Best Actor/Academy Award Worthy. 'Lincoln' was not directed or produced with the main intention to deliver an Action 'Civil' War Movie concentrating on horrific action battle scenes. If you want mainly entertaining action scenes then James Bond & 'Skyfall' should be your pick. I'm sure it is also an awesome film. I want to see 'Skyfall' also. But 'Lincoln' was my first pick of the holiday blockbuster season. Stephen Spielberg, designed this Movie to specifically concentrate on 'T he Man' Abraham Lincoln: Our 16th President of the United States. And how Mr. Lincoln helped end the CIVIL WAR and at the same time Abolish Slavery in our United States of America in the last few but Very Important months of this Great Man's Life. Daniel Day-Lewis helped show the truly human sides of Abraham Lincoln. I Admire and Honor Abraham Lincoln even more so after viewing this Film.",8,1,1,26 March 2020

It couldn't get higger! Loosely based on hlockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' hy Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more use ful than understanding it. The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were su perb in their roles. Aamir has outdone himself. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre hut when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a master piece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest f ilm to date.. The film's climax is fantahulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone hy surprise.

Up," My top 10 favourite movie listed movie üòçüòçüòç
","Up is one of the most wonderful animated feature from Pixar, which included all of the emotions of sadness, heartfelt, funny, whimsical and adventurous which can bring you into tears. It begins with a romance as sweet and lovely as any I can recall in feature animation. Two children named Carl and Ellie meet and discover. They share the same dream of someday being explorers and following the entire marriage life, it began with the love from first sight to widowhood and continues with the amazing skyward journey to Paradise Falls. Finally, I love how this film really touching my heart and I cried every time I watch this movie. It's such a very deep emotional film that no one will ever miss. The romantic 15min scene was the best of all.",10,0,0,25 March 2020

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Wow good movie.
","I rarely give 9's on here. Movies I love have an 8, eh movies get a 7 or 6, terrible are 5 and below, but that's just me. I never give 10's because nothing is perfect, but 9's are the special ones. The movies I give a 9 to mean they are one of my favorite movies. This is such a rollercoaster of a movie. Funny, sad and just downright disturbing at times. A Must see classic for everyone.",9,0,0,28 April 2020
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," superb cinematography , superb acting, superb story line
","This movie was well above my expectations. W hen a movie draws you into it so dee ply that you forget the fact that you are reading subtitles, you have found a su perb foreign film. I warn you that this movie does have very realistic battle scenes (More realistic than any ot her war movie out there)so it can be intense. This movie is done in the style of 'Saving Private Ryan', which was a very good movie, but I believe this was one up. One factor that I appreciated was that there haven't been a whole lot of movies about the Korean war, es pecially from a non-American perspective. The cinematography was of the highest quality for a foreign film of its ty pe. Although there was plenty of war time action, this movie was about more than that. Humanity was examined on a level that I have yet to see in any ot her film.",9,1,1,21 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," All time #1 best movie ever
","When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the to p 250 movies of all time, I thought 'Yea, I could understand that'. I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of po pular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the to p. It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a pers pective of what it is to be human and to have ho pe for the future even in the face of insurmount able adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but not hing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the ot hers. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine. And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breat hes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes sy mbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' was t he short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he does n't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct at mos phere and energy that you can't help but get swe pt away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which ot her films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, des pairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel hap py to be alive. An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.",10,0,0,25 March 2020
Am√©lie," Are you a romantic? Do you notice the little things around you in life? This movie will show you that there are more people in the world like you and me. I urge you to see thi
","So today I was depressed. Challenging with my very first real crush on someone. Having all the negative thoughts on my mind thinking about confronting her and telling her my one little secret. I have never really been with a girl in my life. Actually never even really talked to a girl due to my severe anxiety. Anyway, I found this movie in my long list of unwatched movies. And i asked my friend if watching a romance movie would make me feel more de pressed and anxious. He said '100% Defiantly bro'! But I couldn't resist the attraction that this movie had on me and started watching it. I literally THANK GOD that i had the opportunity to watch this film in this turning point of my life. I cried LOU D during the last minutes of this film.I had the feeling like I was watching the story of my own life. I realized that I would nearly loose the soul of my life if I don't take my feelings and my heart serious. So I decided. I decided not to crush myself by paying attention to my negative and obsessive thoughts more than my soul and my heart calling. I wanna tell her tomorrow. Please wish me luck! And remember to listen to your heart!",9,0,0,13 June 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Pretty much outstanding best Trilogy film 3rd part
","I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring. My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum. Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is su perb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are su perb and don't distract too much and the lighting is aut he ntic. The score is pheno me nal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming t he mes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these toget her and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, et herality and complexity. The story is compelling with the mes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in. The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin ca ptures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and V iggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result. All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10",10,1,1,15 March 2020
Braveheart," Mel Gibson's 'Masterpiece' movie
","IMDb good rated movie.
The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally,the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.",9,0,2,25 March 2020
Goodfellas," A Perfect Masterpiece Movie √∞≈∏Àú≈Ω
","This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting, cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfat her films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nit pick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull es pecially) but ever since 'Goodfellas' I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that 'Dances with Wolves' did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved 'Wolves' 'Goodfellas' has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles.",10,0,0,26 April 2020
The Martian," A Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, inge nuity and survival
","Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival. After a massive storm forces his crew to leave the planet, an astronaut, Mark Wat ney (played by Matt Damon), is marooned on Mars, and presumed dead. Figuring that it would be at least four years until someone can rescue him, he sets out, though often ingenious means, to survive.. A very well thought-out and made movie from director Ridley Scott. E ngrossing, engaging plot - the odds are against our hero, and you feel his plight, yet he finds ways to keep going. The resourcefulness stretches beyo nd a single man though, to the NASA, and other, people on the ground trying to get him home. This engenders a great feeling of a community of specialists working together. While I can't validate the science in the movie (I'll leave that to Neil deGrasse Tyson!), the science FEELS - there are no obvious plot holes or inaccuracies. Good performances all round, especially from Matt Damon in the lead role. Only sour note is Sean Bean's character, which came across as cartoonish. A must-see.",9,0,0,18 April 2020
