The Expendables 2," 'By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you man and knife.'
","I loved it. I absolutely loved this movie, which was both funnier and better plotted than the first. The little digs the characters make at each other are hilarious and make the movie for me - where else do you see all the 'old' stars of Hollywood take cracks at each other like that? It breaks the movie up from something serious, sombre and sad, to something that has surprising moments of laugh-out-loud humour and nearly childish delight. Some movies break up the shooting (be warned - the sound of shooting never ends in this movie) with girls and sex, but The Expendables does it with laughs and petty jabs, and it fits perfectly with the older actors.Sylvester Stallone and Statham seem to play the same characters in every single movie they're in, but in this, they fit perfectly. Hell, all the actors are so clich√©d that they're perfect for the roles, and they're also able to do the serious stuff with decency. I am a huge Jet Li fan, and was sad that he was only briefly in it, but I was also actually quite surprised by the appearance of Chuck Norris - I read nothing about the movie before watching it - I didn't want to ruin it.I cannot wait until 3 comes out - I'll be seeing it at the cinema for sure - who could pass up seeing Jackie Chan on the big screen?So, because I watched the entire thing and it passed my expectations magnificently (and I was expecting it to be half decent), had a hearty laugh every half an hour, and because it was better written and seemed to be going somewhere (and even promising a sequel!), I gave it 9 stars. It's not something that will go down in history, but it's going on my 'Personal Favourites' list, that's for sure.",6,1,3,6 January 2013
Dark Shadows," Thoroughly enjoyable.
","Despite the scathing criticism that the movie received, I went ahead and watched it. I'm a lifelong Depp fan, and there's nothing like Burton's amazing style... what's the worst that could happen?I actually thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a little queer, a little weird, a little spooky... and it was funny. It made me laugh, and it made me laugh again - which is common for Burton-Depp movies - they have a tang and feel to them that just works for me. So, I was expecting great things, and they delivered, magnificently. I haven't seen the Soap Opera, nor do I intend to - the movie said it all for me, and more. It was witty and quirky, and made me think about things I had thought about before, but in a different way, from another direction. I didn't find it over-the-top, or corny, though as another reviewer said, in parts, you could almost feel the mechanics behind the movements of some of the actors.Overall, I found it well-written and directed for a movie based on a television show. It gave enough to explain what was happening and why, without leaving the watcher with the urge to watch the program for more information and explanation. I think it was well-casted - the children were cute and believable, and the 70's culture-shock that you got from some characters was exactly what I expected it'd be like. I wasn't disappointed, and though I wouldn't call it Depp or Burton's best work - I can say that I'd watch it again with enthusiasm.",7,3,6,20 October 2012
