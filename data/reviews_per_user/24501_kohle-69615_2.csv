It," Disappointed expectations
",Movie about the fight of a group of teenagers against a scary killer clown.Because of the big success of the film I visited the theater with high expectations but I was disappointed.Biggest problem are the scenes with the horror clown. They are much too long with many effects and lose so their horror. It's more like an endless ride through a tunnel of horror on a funfair - exhausting but not really scary. In scenes of 'normal' conversation to a child without special effects the acting of the clown is excellent. Here the clown is much more threatening.The acting of the teenagers is mediocrely. It's sometimes overacted and sometimes it seems they are standing around and have forgotten their text.Another issue are the parents of the children. There's a fat mom who wants to be kissed by her son and a disgusting father with filthy mind to his daughter. It's difficult to figure out whether a horror clown is more threatening than these parents.There's also sentimental sob-stuff e.g. when a boy revives the girl by a kiss.The camera work is appealing and the mood of the horror environment is good.The message of the movie is that if losers stick together they can win.I think the movie is about 30 minutes too long.,4,2,4,11 October 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Boring movie for do-gooders
","Movie about a woman who wants to find the murderer of her daughter. In order to put pressure on the police she installs three
billboards accusing the police's inactivity.I visited the theatre with high expectations because the film and the actors got many awards. I was quite disappointed.The plot is idiotic: A whodunnit without solution.Things I don't like in the film:
Too many boring dialogs.
The behavior of the actors is hard to understand, e.g. is it really so easy for a policeman to throw a man through the window?
White people are mean and unsympathetic. They get abusive and are swearing. Black people are empathetic and prudent.
There's a white catholic priest. Naturally he is insulted as pederast.
I don't like pop songs in movies. A movie is not a discotheque or radio program or video clip.
I don't like kitschy scenes with litle children and teddy bears.Only point is the good cinematography of the movie.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing is a boring movie for do-gooders.",2,2,6,7 March 2018
