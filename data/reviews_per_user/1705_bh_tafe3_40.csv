Black Swan," Portman shines in the role of a lifetime
","Superb direction from Aronofsky and a brilliant, Oscar winning performance from Portman highlight this dark psychological drama about a gifted ballet dancer trying to find her inner 'Black Swan.' Aronofsky seems to have a real gift in casting and coaxing great performances from his players. Compare this to The Wrestler. He selected Mickey Rourke, a fallen star with a broken body, living on past glories, to play a character that was very similar. In this one he selects a beautiful, gifted actress who had shown brilliance, but never quite fulfilled her promise, to play a similar character. Portman, like Rourke before her, knocked it out of the park, with the journey she takes on screen to this brilliant performance echoing the journey of her character.The good performances in Black Swan don't stop with Portman either. If Portman's performance was the crowning glory of her career, Kunis' effort is her coming out as a formidable talent playing two characters. Winona Ryder, an actress in her 40s who was once an it-girl, gives it her all as a ballerina in an identical situation. Barbara Hershey as, Mommie Dearest, is unsettling, but in no way one note. One minute she is a loving parent, the next a brooding monster. Vincent Cassel, a talented actor and sometime producer, revels in one of his best roles as music instructor Thomas Leroy.Through skilled direction, Aronofsky follows Portman around the entire film, often looking over her shoulder, and superior use of lighting and score create an atmosphere more unsettling than many modern horror films can manage.In the interest of fairness I read some negative reviews for this film, and the main negative seems to be the feeling from people who are involved in or have an appreciation for ballet not believing that Aronofsky has done the profession in general, or Swan Lake specifically, any justice. The criticism being that the director only has a superficial understanding of the subject matter, not a small issue by any measure, but not one I have any knowledge of. So if you are a fan of ballet, you could be in for a disappointment. I don't know much about the ballet, I can't think of any scenario by which I would sit through a two hour (or longer) performance. I appreciate the skill and dedication of the performers, but it's not my idea of entertainment. What I do know something about is actors and performances, and Portman gives one of the best acting performances you will ever see. Like it's subject, Black Swan isn't perfect, but it's spectacular entertainment.",10,1,3,19 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Difficult film to fairly assess
","It's difficult to explain just how amazing it was going to see this in the theatres and seeing the words 'Episode One' scrawl across the screen. Unbelievable feeling. But the true genius of Lucas of course was putting out the updated editions in the theaters just a few months earlier. You'd developed a familiarity with the style the new films would take as well as seeing them at the movies.And so, all that had to happen for you to be blown away on first viewing was to see these great effects, some cool light saber action (the duel at the end with Obiwan and Qui Gonn taking on Darth Maul is easily the best light saber battle seen in the Star Wars universe to that point), Obi-wan, Palpatine and Yoda and you were happy.I mean, sure, that midichlorians stuff was a load of tosh. And a prophecy about bringing balance to the force when it seems that balance wasn;t particularly needed. There wasn't really a clearly defined main character and OMGHF was that Jar Jar Binks annoying. Why is Darth Maul hardly in this? And what was with that kid who played Anakin? And who's idea was it to have him auto pilot his way into being a hero? Why the hell are we watching a(n admittedly gorgeous) teenage queen getting hit on by him? Why is Qui Gonn the most polite, non rule breaking rebel I've ever seen? Actually come to think it: this sucked. George Lucas ruined my childhood, and the childhoods of so many others!! Who does he think he is? Wait. Let's reset. Let's try and stand back from this film and judge it in its own right. Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor actually are a pretty good team in this film. jar Jar is a really annoying character, there's no way of escaping this, and he is in far too many scenes. Ian McDiarmid is wonderful as the dignified and slimy Palpatine and Natalie Portman is good as Queen Amidala as her character actually goes on a journey from a naïve and wide eyed girl weighed down by bureaucracy and a manipulative adviser to becoming stronger, more confident and independent young woman leading her people to victory. Anakin is annoying, like Jar Jar there's no way past it. But there's actually other better stuff happening to focus on just about every scene he's in.The set pieces are still breathtaking. The pod race, the Gungan swamps, the Naboo palace, the droid battle, 2 on 1 light saber duel at the end and we have Obi-wan and Amidala's journeys to focus on as well as an on form Liam Neeson.I can't say this is a bad movie. I mean, I can probably accept that this is a bad Star Wars movie, but as movies go, it's kind of OK.What really made my mind up about whether these prequels had hurt or aided the series was watching this film with my 4 year old nephew. He sat there the whole time, laughed hysterically at Jar Jar Binx, cried when Qui Gonn bought the farm and cheered while little Anakin saved the day. It occurred to me that his reaction was the same as I had watching Han, Luke, Leia and Chewie for the first time.While this unquestionably is the bastard son of the star wars series, it introduced the magic to a new generation and there is enough in it so far as characterisations and stunning visuals to hold it up under the weight of midichlorians, Jedi mysticism Jar Jar Binx and little orphan Anny.",7,0,2,27 February 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Timeless adventure classic
","There are no set qualities for a great film. Some movies like Citizen Kane are towering Cathedrals, crowned with outstanding lead performances, their every shot awash with gravitas and innovation, two hour pieces of high art with relatively simple stories. Other films are great stories, superbly told, like The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart and Slumdog Milllionaire. And then there are films like this one which are a joyous, fun celebration of all the things we love about movies and film making.Every scene of this is fun and enjoyable. A rollicking chase between two rival archaeologists as they travel all over the world (the film using world maps so we can keep track of the action) in search of the mystical 'ark of the covenant.' Throw in some Nazis, snake phobia, cutting edge (for the time) special effects, a damsel in distress and the Saturday matinée feel and you have an adventure film like no other to that point in time.For star Harrison Ford, this film, on the back of his turn as Han Solo in an expanded role in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back confirmed his status as the pre eminent leading man of his time, and from the start, this is his movie. We follow his adventures for an inordinate number of minutes before the director shows us his face, we see him fearlessly tackle big hairy spiders, leaps of doom, deadly arrows and rolling stone balls before the film is 15 minutes old. We also see him lose his first big battle on screen with his rival Belloq. And in those first 15 minutes we learn everything we need to about his character and the film. Indy is fearless, principled, a bit of a screw up and not a particularly good archaeologist. No wonder he has to work as a teacher to pay the bills. From that point on he becomes all things to all people. The film rarely lets up on the action, with chase after chase, and usually ending in Indy being outwitted by his smarter, better resourced rival.Ford is absolutely superb. While I personally believe that the film still would have been a success had Spielberg's original choice for the role, Tom Selleck, been available, it is now impossible to see anyone else in the role. Spielberg has also surrounded Ford with a great supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, John Rhys Davies, Paul Freeman, Karen Allen and Ronald Lacey, as well as a very young Alfred Molina. Allen in particular is great as the love interest/ damsel in distress.The effects, for the time were breathtaking, bringing the settings alive and nearly making us believe that the Nazis faces are melting at the film's end. Some of the blue screen shots leave a little to be desired, but it was still fairly early in the evolution of that film making technology, and so these are forgivable. The set pieces are expertly realized and the fight scenes well choreographed.In the end Raiders is the finest example of the adventure genre, made the more entertaining for the fact that our protagonist is not a particularly successful adventurer. It has enough silly to be fun, without being stupid and remains, more than 30 years on, as one of the most entertaining films not just of its era, but in all of American cinema.",10,5,9,17 August 2014
Citizen Kane," One of the Best movies ever made
","Well, what to say? 22 year old Orson Welles came into Hollywood in the late 30s on a hiding to nothing. He had already had a big influence on live theatre, and made headlines all over the US with his controversial 'War of the Worlds' radio broadcast. He was given a three picture deal by RKO with final cut on all of them. Unprecedented at the time. Surely he couldn't live up to the hype? What Welles produced was a cinematic triumph without equal at the time, that 67 years on still defies description.There is hardly an honest film maker in Hollywood that won't own up to being influenced, to at least some extent by this movie. Everything about this movie, from the premise, to the script, the score, the cinematography and the acting is exceptional.Orson Welles not only does a superb job as director, he also puts in one of the greatest tour de force performances in the history of American cinema as Kane. Growing from an ambitious happy go lucky 20 something to a tyrannical monster, to a bitter, pathetic old shell of a man in less than two hours. Welles inspires rage, hatred and pity out of what could have been a one note character in less skilled hands.The story is simple. A past his prime media tycoon dies muttering the word 'Rosebud' and a journalist, looking for the real scoop on Kane's life, sets out to find exactly what Rosebud is. We hear the heartbreaking story of a young boy sold to the bank by his parents, raised to be a business man, finding success as a media owner and then being destroyed by his inability to love others. The journalist never finds out what Rosebud is, but we do, Kane's sleigh he used to ride when he was a child. It's been argued that the sleigh means nothing, it's been argued that the sleigh means everything. In the end it can mean just about anything you want it to.Also of note here is the performance of Joseph Cotton, who puts in one of the great performances as Jedediah Lelan, who unwittingly becomes the conscience of the story, simply by being himself.The story behind the film's release, brilliantly depicted in the late 90s TV film RKO 281 and the documentary 'The Battle Over Citizen Kane' are almost as interesting as the film itself, and that really is saying something.'It's Terrific' the original 1941 promo posters for Kane rather naively stated. But looking back now, sums it up rather nicely.",10,1,3,6 December 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," The (somewhat) true account of two women rooted in history
","Let's face it. There are two main reasons why people went to see this movie when it came out. Nobody was expecting wonderful British wit (from two Americans and an Australian), people were not expecting to see a thought provoking look at a significant period in British history. Nope. People either wanted to see a pretty looking period piece, or two of the most beautiful women in the world trying desperately to get a man in bed for two hours. Don't get me wrong, I think this movie does provide more than that, but admit it: that's why you came.It's a time of upheaval in England as King Henry VIII gets increasingly stroppy with his french wife's infuriating inability to give birth to a male (on a serious note the queen was pregnant several times with boys, but for various reasons, none survived to reach primary age). It would be catastrophic for England to have a weak female heir, so in comes the sleazy Duke of Norfolk (David Morrisey who would play Gordon Brown later in his career) who colludes with his brother in law Thomas Boleyn, to use his hot daughter Anne (Natalie Portman-solid) to seduce the king, become his mistress, produce a male, and help them climb the social ladder. Unfortunately, the king is more interested in that Other Boleyn Girl, Mary (Scarlet Johannson), who is married to Sherlock Holmes. Long story short, Sherlock dies while working overseas and ends up falling for the King, much to the chagrin of her sister Anne.So Henry knocks up Mary and an unimpressed Anne marries an Earl without the King's consent. Anne tells her brother George, who tells Mary, who has Anne exiled to France so as to not bring trouble down on the family. Mary nearly miscarriages so they call back her sister, who talks herself into the King's bed, forcing him to forsake Mary. Mary has her child, but the King has already turned his back on her, as any red blooded male would when Natalie Portman is the Other Woman. Anne won't sleep with Henry until they are properly married, so Henry establishes the church of England (along with various other significant structural changes) so he can get a divorce and marry Anne. From there we have rape, incest and an execution as Anne proves herself a woMan For All Seasons (and degradations). This is a pretty film to look at and features strong performances from Bana and Portman and Johannson does well enough to be more than a third wheel. If you want to look at this time in history more closely you should probably do some reading (Simon Sohama would be a good start), because what we see here barely scratches the surface. But I'm going to give this movie a pass, not only does it give you what's promised on the label but it does this with good acting, great costume and set design, and a story that genuinely engages. I was outraged, angered, amused and yeah occasionally turned on. C'mon guys, you don't have to be that teenager telling your mother you only picked up that Playboy issue she found in your bedroom to read the articles your whole life. It is OK to find one of the most beautiful women in the world playing a seductress arousing.Ultimately, the Other Boleyn Girl is more than the sum of its parts and does more than is promised on the DVD cover. This is not an accurate look at history, but it is a well made, well acted production with a decent story, which is probably helped by its narrow focus. It's above average, but far from essential. Let's leave it at that.",7,0,0,16 February 2016
Batman Returns," You want to get Nuts? C'mon! Let's get Nuts!!!
","Well, a mutilated circus freak runs for mayor, Bruce Wayne learns that fishy swirl is supposed to be cold, Michelle Pfieffer becomes the leather fetish fantasy of a million school boys and Christopher Walken acts like he has no idea why he's here in this insane Batman sequel that is completely bonkers, but still awesome. After delivering a monstrous hit in 1989, Tim Burton was lured back in 1992, and despite McHappy Meal tie ins and big plans to make lots and lots of toys, he went and made a movie that was about as un-toyetic (a term I heard coined by Joel Schumacher) as you can get. We have a dirty joking sewer dwelling circus freak living with an army of penguins in the remains of Artic World, we have a woman wearing skin tight leather giving herself a bath by licking her suit and putting live canaries in her mouth (no seriously, Michelle Pfieffer actually had a live canary in her mouth during one of the scenes in this movie), we have Christopher Walken throwing secretaries out of the top story of his department store building and then offering to be covered 'up to his eyeballs in raw sewerage.' Then there's Michael Keaton tying bombs to people's chest and then laughing at them before punching them in a hole to explode. While I love this movie, it is not hard to see why the film company was a little annoyed with what they got given by director Burton here.We open 30 years in the past with Pee Wee Herman (Paul Ruebens) and Simone (Diane Salinger) as the Cobblepotts, an upper class Gotham City couple who give birth to a deformed son who, as well as having conjoined fingers resembling flippers, is also able to kill cats and eat them while a toddler. Not wanting the burden of raising a child with a lot of problems, they decide to dump him in a freezing river where he eventually gets discovered and raised by penguins. Fast forwarding to Modern Gotham, the little Cobblepott has grown up to be The Penguin, villainous leader of the Red Triangle Circus gang who start conducting series of raids on Gotham. In the meantime corrupt and opportunistic business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is trying to get council approval to build a new power plant, that will actually act as a capacitor that sucks power and stores it (?)... Anyway, his secretary, Selina Kyle, a shy wallflower who lives in a crappy apartment and has relationship issues, finds out this confusing information and then attempts to black mail Shreck, who throws her out of the top story of his Department Store building, where she is revived by cats and goes insane, becoming Catwoman. After the accident, Selina meets Bruce Wayne and the two embark upon a much weirder, but somehow more engaging romance than Wayne had with Vicki Vale in the first film. Anyway Catwoman and the Penguin eventually work together to take on Batman while Shreck tries to get Penguin elected mayor. Everything goes wrong and the three of them end up trying to kill each other as they all converge upon Arctic world along with Batman for a final showdown which involves rockets strapped to penguins backs, a woman being shot 4 times, a man being electrocuted to the point of becoming a charred corpse, and another one with sewerage (or some other type of unpleasant green goo) oozing out of their mouth before dropping dead. Yeah. Kid's movie folks. Anyway, apart from being way over the top for the intended audience this is a wonderful world that Burton has created and he has populated it with some fascinating characters brought to life by great performances. Michelle Pfieffer is utterly fearless as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman. Hers is a riveting creation, dripping with sexiness and cynicism that we see echoes of in Anne Hathaway's Dark Knight Rises Selina Kyle 20 years later. In the case of De Vito, he is aided by a script that plays to his strengths, giving him all types of crudity and innuendo to spout, but it's worth nothing without the menace he brings with the way he carries himself and his line delivery. Michael Keaton approaches Wayne with the same brooding he did in the original, but once again gives frequent winks to the audience. Christopher Walken isn't really needed here, but he still brings something to the film by acting like you'd expect a normal person to act in these circumstances. He greets most of his scenes with a confused look on his face and a determination to dead pan and take it all in stride. There's so many other things that can be talked about here, I haven't even got into the look of Gotham or the minor players, but this is such a dense vision, so brilliantly realized in such a bonkers way, we'd be here all day. This is nuts. Absolutely nuts, but at the same time it's bloody brilliant. It's a shame Burton's vision alienated studios to the point this was the last time we would see him, or Keaton, but what a fun ride they gave us for two films! Batman Returns may not make a great deal of sense, but it is a rich, brooding, compelling and infinitely watchable film that I appreciate more and more as it ages. Arguably the best in the series and well worth a look more than twenty years on.",9,0,4,23 January 2016
Blade," Well made 90s actioner
","Wesley Snipes has been in his share of instantly forgettable garbage in his career, but in the 90s he was a formidable talent in the action genre. And Blade is one of his signature roles.This sleek, glossy entry into the action genre is credited by some as leading to the reigniting of comic book properties as workable franchises, but to be honest, I was not aware of the Blade comic series going in, and I'm not too sure how many other people were in 1998.In the film's opening scenes, we start in a normal looking nightclub, that turns out to be a vampire rave joint where they have blood in the emergency water sprinklers and feast on humans. In comes our hero of few words, identified by some frightened and overawed vampires as Blade, and he wipes out pretty much every creature in the club with a funky looking sword and some cool martial arts move while muttering tough guy one liners. It's a nice, bloody, clichéd opening to the film, and gives you a real pointer to whether you are going to enjoy the next two hours or not.Blade is the story of a half vampire (Snipes), retaining his humanity through blood transfusions administered by his grizzly mentor Whistler, (Kris Kristofferson in an excellent career reinvigorating performance) who is able to walk around in the day and kick some serious vampire ass. He becomes something of a legendary adversary in vampire circles, and the nutty vampire antagonist Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a rare worthwhile role) decides to invoke an ancient ritual to give him super evil powers to rid the world of the day walker. This is a potentially ludicrous plot that is played straight by Dorff's enjoyably malevolent villain, who is a hard enough man to be a genuine threat without coming across as unstoppable. This is where Blade succeeds where a a lot of films get it wrong. When the villain is too unstoppable, the writers can't work out a way to actually defeat the villain in a satisfactory way and we end up with either a nonsensical rushed resolution or a deus ex machine solution. Not here though. The final showdown is suitably over the top and dramatic, and as an audience we can buy into it.Coming on the back of The Vampire Chronicles and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade was more than a simple cash in. It was an entertaining, lustily violent, well made action film in its own right. This is a high point for Snipes and Dorff, a new type of comic book movie and one of the better actioners of the late 90s.",8,1,2,30 November 2014
Blade II," Critically divisive, but successful sequel
","Blade II is a difficult film to rate. Firstly it comes closer to capturing the look and feel of a comic book than the original, which is a good start. A familiarity with the characters is also helpful.There are more than a few issues with the plot. Whistler is bought back, his death rather unconvincingly retconned and the stakes are upped to try and make everything super dooper Bladey, and there seems to be something missing.Blade gets some Vampire slaying groupies, the bad guys are super scary looking with multiple jaws and the stakes are ludicrously high. I'm being deliberately vague here because a lot of the plot and contrivances are things will either work for you or they won't and you really have to see the film to know which camp you fall in.Snipes and Kristofferson are on top form reprising their roles, but neither major villain in this one stacks up to Dorff in the original. While Blade II certainly isn't a bad film, and has its share of admirers, (for the atmosphere and feel mainly, but many liked the plot, which expands the Blade universe and the vampire mythos) it left many viewers feeling like a lot of elements could have been done better. Specifically the antagonists really could have been built up more and the script could have flowed better.I don't know of anyone who hated this, and a hell of a lot of people went to see it, and quite a few loved it. Average film. Works as a companion piece to the original, but something of a missed opportunity, it left me with the idea that there was a better film waiting to get out.",6,0,2,1 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An unconvincing and at times painful love story drags down an otherwise decent movie
","Well, Obi-wan Jedi mindtricks a drug dealer into reforming, we find out Bobba Fett's father is the prototype for the Imperial Clones, Jar Jar Binks destroys democracy and Anakin and Padme get it on in this good, but somewhat ham fisted, second Star Wars film.Not a lot happens at all in this, but what does happen can be broken up into two categories: Stuff that works pretty well and Anakin and Padme's romance. I really like Hayden Christenson. I think he's a decent actor, rather unfairly blamed in this film for giving the performance his director asked for. And Anakin is painful in this one. from his misplaced arrogance towards Obi-wan to his cringe worthy attempts to get Padme into bed, and Natalie Portman isn't much better. Padme has been established as a strong character, and in this one we need to start believing that she is Leia's mother, but for 75% of this she is flirting with Anakin and then shutting it down, flirting with Anakin and shutting it down. Repeat cycle. It's left to Ewan McGregor, as Obi wan to carry the story, and he does an awesome job. If there's one actor who looks completely at home in the prequel trilogy, it's McGregor. Obi-wan is the one left to discover the clone planet and then track Jango Fett.It's in the last act, with their love established, that Anakin and Padme come to the party and start being interesting. We can finally see some of Leia in Padme as she takes over the situation and runs headlong into battle. Anakin in the meantime has continued his journey towards the dark side by slaughtering a tribe of sand people. And we can see a bit of Luke in Anakin as well. And not just the annoying whining. He's basically being faced with the same choices as Luke in the original trilogy and either making the opposite decisions to Luke (getting involved in a romance, slaughtering a tribe out of vengeance) or making the same bad decisions (running off here with Padme is as bad as Luke running off to Cloud City in Empire), so Lucas isn't doing it well, but he is establishing some sort of parallel path between the parents and their children.Anyway Windu and Yoda get to kick some ass, and Christopher Lee gets to run around as Palpatine's apprentice and act like an Evil Sith, which looks like a lot of fun for him, while Palpatine manipulates Jar Jar into giving him executive powers (Senator Amidala showed very questionable judgment by making Jar Jar her replacement, and here he is, destroying democracy). This is kind of clever as it turns the much maligned Binks into a tragic character, but it isn't that clever.We end with Anakin and Padme having a forbidden marriage and the clones flying off into the stars in early versions of star destroyers. The Republic is taking shape and the Jedis, while knowing there is a fight coming, are oblivious to Palpatine's duplicity.You can see what Lucas was trying to do here, and he's made a good movie, albeit with a painful love story and some disgraceful dialogue. Attack of the clones is not a bad film, just one that could have been far better. At least Lucas now had all the characters where he wanted them for Part 3, which was a film so good, it completely justified the prequel trilogy.",7,12,18,2 March 2015
Gone Baby Gone," Apparently you can't have too much Affleck in a movie
","Directed and co-written by Ben Affleck, starring his brother Casey, it's fair to say that there was a lot of Affleck on show here and the result is one of the best movies of the past decade.The story: A down on his luck, green as grass Private Investigator Patrick and his girlfriend are hired by a Bostonian couple to find their kidnapped niece who has gone missing. Though the police, played by Ed Harris and John Ashton, are initially reluctant to help, they end up working together to solve the case, but there is far more to the kidnapping then it first appears. Not all of it makes sense, but so engaging are the performances and so poignant the issues at stake that it isn't hard to look past them and get dragged into the story.The Performances: Casey Affleck received a lot of completely undue criticism for what is a fine performance which would have earned many other actors an Oscar nod, Michelle Monaghan is quite good as his girlfriend and the conscience of the story, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman as usual are absolutely superb, as is Amy Ryan and there really isn't a weak link on the acting side.Gone Baby Gone is a thought provoking, though in many ways ludicrous story, grounded by gritty performances and skillfully put together by an under rated director. One of the best films I've seen in years and truly a movie to be savored.",9,0,0,31 October 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Predictably uninspiring conclusion
","Well, Neo fights Agent Smith again, and sacrifices his life to save Zion, after his girlfriend is skewered. Zion fights a rather uninspiring battle against the machines and humanity is left in the matrix at the end of another pointless matrix sequel.OK, the Matrix was an interesting idea. Humanity stuck in a dream world where our bodies are used to power machines. But this interesting idea is reduced to philosophical gibberish, and mindless (though admittedly impressive at times) action sequences in the sequels.In the end they used the second film to set up the third film, and then provided nothing in the way of satisfying denouement. This is not a good movie and the Matrix was not a good film series.",3,2,3,27 February 2015
Man of Steel," Hard one to review
","The first Superman film came out in 1978, it starred the late Christopher Reeve and was one of those rare films that had a magical quality from start to finish. It was not a perfect film, but it was a film that aspired to, and largely achieved, what movies are all about. It made you stare at the screen in wonder and awe for two hours.Now, no other Superman film, regardless of how well produced, is ever going to achieve that feeling again. It's been done, and redone so many times since. We've seen better flying effects and we've seen them in both good movies and bad. A guy flying through the air and acting like a quintessential American hero is just not that interesting in 2015. And the more you watch of Superman, the harder it is to believe he is actually under genuine threat from anything. What the 5 preceding films (let's not talk about Supergirl) have established is that there are only three legitimate threats to Superman: Kryptonite, other survivors from Krypton, and his own inner demons. In this film, we see the latter two come out.Man of Steel is not a great film, but it's a film of great actors and good ideas, and the combination just about works, in spite of these ideas not being satisfactorily laid out or properly realized. Henry Cavill stars as Kal-El, son of the ill-fated Jor-El (Russell Crowe), who is sent to earth to be raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent (a wasted Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). Jor-El stays behind on the dying planet of Krypton to fight General Zod, (the villain of 1979s Superman 2 played here by Michael Shannon), who kills Jor-El, right before being captured and sentenced to expulsion to The Phantom Zone, only for Krypton to explode, meaning that they were far better off than their fellow Kryptonians. So we are in familiar ground with a villain we know from the original series and an identical origin story. Unlike the Spiderman reboot, it's a story we haven't seen for a while, so it's actually called for, and also adds the political dimension of isolationism and population control. I'm not talking this up as high art, but I do appreciate the effort to engage the brain.It's seeing Superman raised, and the ridiculous death of Jonathan Kent where this movie falls off a cliff. Less 'With great power comes responsibility' and more 'let me die to cover your own ass.' This is hardly the stuff of either believable storytelling or hero building. There are long periods where Kal-el flies around acting all emo until he finds a Kryptonian scout ship where Jor-El tells him he has been sent to Earth to give hope to humanity. A little different from 'their capacity for good.' Anyway, to make a long story short, Kal-El saves Lois Lane, talks her out of revealing his powers, General Zod arrives with a Krypton posse, wanting to turn the Earth into a new Krypton. Kal-El changes into Superman, and goes off an epic battle with Zod after sending his fellow Kryptonians back to the phantom zone. He is forced to kill Zod and then flies around like an emo again, before taking up a job as a journalist, cunningly disguised as Clark Kent, at the Daily Planet newspaper.So, for the second time in 12 months here we are reviewing a reboot of a major super hero franchise. My general feel is that Man of Steel, in spite of its faults, succeeds where the Spiderman reboot failed. While the Spidey version was largely uncalled for and made mostly weak changes, this one made changes which make for a more interesting character for modern audiences (though the Jonathan Kent death does kill a lot of good will). Let's face it, Superman is an unstoppable, super human alien, so the only way you can get people to buy into him over multiple films is to create some inner conflict and moral ambiguity. While Spiderman's Parker was dead in the water the moment he took not getting a milkshake personally, I'm interested to see where they go next with Kal-El/ Clark Kent/ Superman.Man of Steel is not a perfect film, and actually has quite a few problems with it. But it does lay a foundation and give the later films something interesting to work with.",7,0,2,15 March 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazingly unnecessary
","Apparently the maker of this film's surname is Webb, spiders have webs, so that must qualify him to make a movie about Spiderman.So here's the plot: well actually you should just save yourself some time and watch Sam Raimi's Spiderman instead. It has a far more interesting villain, a cameo from the late Randy Savage, an amusing busker, and follows the comic book far closer than this. Well actually, let's look at one part of the plot in particular. You remember in the original film when Peter gets upset at Uncle Ben because he crossed the line and started talking to him like his father? Well in this one Uncle Ben crosses a line by actually expecting Peter to, you know, kind of be where he said he would be? Well after this spat in the original film he goes to have a wrestling match wins and gets screwed out of the money he was owed by the promoter. The promoter is then robbed, but Peter allows him to escape. The man kills Uncle Ben and Peter hunts him down in a display of out of control vigilante justice. He realizes he has a great responsibility, which also includes his conduct, and proceeds on a mission of sacrifice, losing his friendship with Harry and even giving up MJ. Well in this one, Peter goes to the corner shop where he doesn't have enough money to buy a milkshake. So when someone robs the store he just lets them do it. Let's think about this. This person's crime was not selling him a product he could not afford. Wow, this Peter Parker is pretty petty. Then that person shoots Uncle Ben. Peter starts apprehending villains who look like the assailant (a plot line that goes nowhere). Becoming Spiderman has no great impact on his life and he is even quite happy to put Gwen in danger at the film's end. Could there be a bigger contrast? The original Spiderman was inspired and haunted by the death of his uncle, weighed down by responsibility, forced to go at it alone. Being Spiderman is his calling. In this reboot being Spiderman is a hobby, to sit alongside other hobbies. I'll tell my girlfriend who I am, I'll get innocent people killed and then do nothing to keep them out of danger: your hero Ladies and gentlemen.Apparently Raimi was taking far too long to develop Part 4 so Sony decided to reboot the whole thing, so we get a more boring and slower burning introduction to the character than the original and the dullest villain in any comic book film apart from the Green Lantern. If you made it to the final credits, your patience is to be commended.3 times I have attempted to sit through this, 3 times I became completely bored about an hour in. I have never made it to the finish. Garfield is good as Parker and Emma Stone has nice legs. Nothing else about this patently unnecessary film is worthy of comment.",5,3,6,12 March 2015
Saw III," Dumb, but interesting
","Well, Robert the Bruce is our hero, Donnie Wahlberg escapes...kind of, Amanda goes even more bug eyes crazy and Jigsaw buys the farm in this third Saw movie, that is vast improvement over the second installment and benefits even more from the viewer not thinking too hard about what's happening.We begin with Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), showing considerably more intelligence than Doctor 'I'm-going-to-saw-my-foot-off-with-a-hacksaw' Gordon from the original, breaking his foot in order to get it out of the chain that's holding him. He limps down the hallway and... into oblivion apparently because the film fast forwards six months and not a soul has seen him in that time (this is explained in the next film).Jigsaw has returned and he would appear to have changed his method and is now setting unwinnable traps to torture people to their inevitable demise. For instance, some poor unfortunate has to pull out chains that are attached to his body in order to escape a bomb, but even if he had got the chains loose, the door was welded shut. At the crime scene we get reacquainted with Matthews' former partner Detective Allison Kerry who is inspecting the crime scene with her new partner Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor of Picket Fences 'fame'). We feel kind of sorry for Kerry as mopes around all depressed about Matthews' disappearance. I wonder if the story will give us more insight into this interesting character who's been around since the first film of the series? Of course not! She gets abducted from her house and gets killed by another unwinnable trap, having her rib cage torn off after burning her hand in acid. We find out it's Amanda (Shawnee Smith) who's setting these unwinnable traps and...Good Lord. I'm already three paragraphs in. Better wind this up.OK, a doctor, Lynn Denlon, who has marriage issues revealed in a conversation with a man who 'wants a divorce,' is abducted from the hospital and wakes up with a bomb strapped to a collar on her neck that's going to blow up if Jigsaw dies before another victim finishes their test. The other victim is Jeff, a man who lost his son in a drink driving accident 3 years ago and became bitter and damaged, leading to him neglecting his daughter and all but leaving his wife. Jeff is going to have to learn to forgive as part of his test and at the end he will meet 'the man responsible for the death of his child.' So Jeff has to forgive a silent witness who never came forward at the trial of the drunk driver (try not to think about how stupid that is, unless Jigsaw is either telepathic or God), the judge who let the driver off lightly, and of course the driver himself. His results are mixed to say the least, but he does take the opportunity to forgive the driver. Mission accomplished I guess.In the meantime Amanda is acting more and more crazy as Lynn struggles to keep Jigsaw alive. Then we get two twists. Firstly Lynn is Jeff's wife, the man at the start who 'wanted a divorce' was her lover. Secondly, this is also Amanda's test. He wanted to see if she was willing to let people live, which she isn't as she first refuses to take the collar off Lynn and then shoots her, just as Jeff comes in, who takes out Amanda with one bullet. Then we get another twist as Jeff, remembering that this movie is called saw, slices Jigsaw's throat with a power saw, killing him, but not before he plays one last game from his little tape recorder. Remember how Jigsaw told Jeff he would 'meet the man responsible for the death of his child?' Well he wasn't talking about the drunk driver who ran over his son, he was talking about himself and the fact he had kidnapped Jeff's daughter and was the only person who knew where she was. Good one Jeff. You can forgive the man who killed your son, but you can't stop yourself from slicing the throat of a dying man and now your daughter's going to die. As Jigsaw dies, the collar on Lynn's neck detonates, and Jeff's left to freak out just like Adam and Matthews in the first two films as credits role.Of all the Saw movies, this probably has the victim I sympathize with the most in Jeff (Braveheart's Angus McFayden). Jeff is probably the best realized character in the whole Saw series apart from Jigsaw himself. I also for the first time was able to somewhat buy into Jigsaw's method. Jeff is being taught a positive lesson. For the first time I wonder of maybe Jigsaw is more than a crazy wannabe zen master who gets kicks out of torturing people to death and uses the delusion he's teaching people life lessons to justify it. However, that good will is lost at film's end. The last 5 minutes seriously just kills it. The guy learns nothing. Jigsaw is a very bad teacher with a very ineffective method.Saw 3 is a relatively satisfying film, and, in spite of all the threads left hanging, comes the closest of the sequels to standing up as a film in its own right. This was the last installment still involving the original creative team of Wan and Whannell, and I think they were probably expecting the people they handed the ball off to, to run a lot more creatively with it than they do.",6,0,0,23 January 2016
The Dirty Dozen," 60s action film making in all its glory produces a timeless classic.
","Before I talk about Dirty Dozen, I'll mention that the first time I knew anything about it was when I was 14, during a conversation in the Michael Moore film Canadian Bacon where they ran through the cast: Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, John Cassavettes, Telly Savalas, Jim Brown and (ahem) Trini Lopez. What a blessing to live in a world where you can become aware of great movies by watching other films.Lee Marvin stars as an out of favour Major who gets given the most bat sh-t crazy assignment in the history of war films: take 12 military prisoners looking at either the death penalty or an interminably long jail sentence, train them into a unit and take them on a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Before they get there though, they will need to learn obedience and discipline, navigate their way around a suspicious Colonel and compete in a war games exercise.That this plot works owes much to a great script, ably performed by a superb cast. While Bronson and Marvin are the stars on duty, special mention must be given to John Cassavettes, who is absolutely superb as the abrasive, ill-fated Franko. Of those not already mentioned at the top we also have Robert Ryan, Clint Walker, Donald Sutherland, Richard Jaeckel and Ralph Meeker along for this most fun of rides.The film tells a simple story in a straight line narrative, relying on the action and dialogue for its success. Much of the personality present in the characters come from the actors playing them, with the well paced script moving the story along too quickly for the expositional dialogue we see in many films today. This however does not cheapen either the characters or the story. The actors are too good to allow that. It has its brutal moments, but is pleasingly devoid of blood amidst the violence.There was at one stage rumours of a remake, but why bother? With action, actors and storytelling as good as this, you don't need an update for accessibility to modern audiences.I've said more than once that John Wayne films are a gift. The Dirty Dozen can sit proudly beside any of the Duke's films as one of the premier examples of cast driven action in American cinema.",9,0,4,21 November 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A vast improvement on the original, but can't save the franchise
","You can relax, there's nothing in this one as bad as the 'hero' allowing a store to be robbed because he can't afford a milkshake, but there's nothing in this to completely redeem the mess of a first film either.Andrew Garfield returns as Peter Parker and this time he is acting a little more responsibly as Gwen's late father (Denis Leary) comes to him in a vision to remind him of his promise to 'keep Gwen out of this' and he breaks up with her. Better late than never. Next we see Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborne come back to town to see his terminally ill father Norman (a completely wasted Chris Cooper) and.... oh holy jeepers, I just can't do it! I'm sorry, why am I watching this same story again? Can you guess which villain Hary Osborne turns out to be? Argghhhhh.OK next up on the villain list we have Jamie Foxx, who must have been watching Batman Forever (or maybe one of the four writers who spat this out by committee had) as he plays Edward Nigma, I mean max Dillon. A nerd, but he gets super powers and instead of turning into the Riddler, he turns into Electro, a wasted villain.Let's see what else happens...well, let's face it, you don't care and neither does anyone else on the committee that vomited this out. And just to try and convince you something meaningful has happened in this and that it's actually following the comic, they kill off Gwen at the end. But far from being a moment of genuine emotion, it's just another tacked on, ineffectual contrivance to try and convince you that you are actually invested in this. Far from honouring the comics, this is a moment that simply follows it for convenience. And it ends back at the beginning with Spiderman trying to stop a rampaging Paul Giamatti.The main things to appreciate here are on the technical side. Webb has done a good job of capturing spider sense, and effectively uses more established filming techniques to create a sense of frenetic action. The set pieces are all breathtaking and the big battles deliver on the effects side of things. It's the action sequences that really elevate this above the by the numbers production that it almost is. So I tip my hat to Mark Webb, but unfortunately, to paraphrase the Dark Knight, he's the director this film needs, but not the one it deserves.The other positive are our two leads, Stone is a superior love interest to MJ in the originals and a superior character as well who serves a function beyond being a damsel in distress. Andrew Garfield is great as Parker and arguably delivers the best characterization of Parker seen on the big screen. However, like Timothy Dalton as James Bond, he's the right actor at the wrong time, and not even his performance can elevate the character or the film above the mediocrity he is given to work with.To finish off, the story in this film is a mess. A well made, well acted mess, but ultimately a mess all the same. It's not a bad thing that this one underperformed and Sony have again decided to reboot the franchise. Hopefully a bit more thought can revitalize this series that money grabbing laziness has greatly diminished over the past two films and the director's ego diminished in the third.",6,2,5,14 March 2015
Transformers," My childhood up on screen....sort of
","For me just hearing the words 'Autobot' and 'Decepticon' brings back so many childhood memories. I was a massive fan of the G1 cartoons (never watched any of the spin-offs) and the Marvel comic books from the UK and US. The cartoon appealed to me as a child, while the comics took the mythos deeper in my teenage years with cosmic battles between Gods, a yin/ yang conversation regarding why certain Transformers are inherently good or evil. It was cracking stuff and it was with a lot of excitement that I greeted news of a new big budget movie.Transformers (2007) delivered! OK, so they fiddled with the origin story a little bit, but so do most of the different versions of the show. I thought they got the major characters spot on. Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and Starscream were all the same characters as in the TV show and comics. I really liked the fact that Bumblebee could only communicate through radio signals, and, after the execrable scene introducing the minor autobot characters and Optimus Prime's various sermons, really wish that had been the case for all of the autobots. The decepticons are far more interesting, though we see nowhere near enough of Starscream. Megatron and Soundwave are both effective and the best realised characterisations in the film.The humans in the story all do a good job. Shia Lebeouf had not yet been over exposed, and is actually quite entertaining as Spike. Megan Fox was a smoking hot brunette bombshell, still playing a stereotype (hot girl with a blokey hobby who deep down just wants to fit in), but at least not a damsel in distress as we typically see in these films. Spike's parents are awkward, but funny. John Turtorro's character seems to have accidentally stumbled into this film during a coffee break from a Coen brothers film. He seems like he has something much more interesting to do in an edgier film than this one. But his presence, while out of place, is welcome.My big complaint with this is that the the film, after doing a nice job of setting up for a finale, seems to go in light speed in its last twenty minutes. It's often difficult to tell who's fighting who. There's also a death scene that we are supposed to feel sad about, involving a character who's been in a handful of scenes, and had a maximum of two lines of clichéd stereotyped dialogue. The resolution is neat and sets up well for a sequel. Overall, this was a reasonably faithful big screen portrayal of the characters I loved growing up, if not the story. The arrival sequence, and Armageddon-ish soundtrack are both breathtaking and really hammer home a sense of awe and wonder as the Autobots arrive. The awkward attempts by Prime to communicate with humanity are funny. The human characters, apart from Turtorro (who acts like no human I've ever met) all seem to react to the Transformers and their war in the way a normal human being would react. It is a very different back story and beloved elements like the Autobot and decepticons Volcano and underwater bases are lost. But what's left is a the characters we love fighting out the same war, in a way a new generation will find accessible, and didn't alienate me, well not in this original version anyway. I am more than happy to share Optimus, Megatron and Bumblebee with a new generation of fans.",9,20,29,18 September 2012
Empire Records," Good Performances, Great soundtrack, Thin Plot, Good Movie
","Empire Records is arguably the closest the 90s came to channeling one of those memorable 80s teen ensembles like the Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Occurring almost entirely within the confines of an independent music store and utilizing some then fairly unknown, but quality, young actors like Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger, Ethan Embry, Rory Cochrane, Johnny Whitworth, and Robin Tunney with an excellent older cast Maxwell Caulfield, Anthony Lapaglia and Debi Lazar.Lapaglia stars as Joe Reaves, the manager of Empire Records, an independent music store facing hard times and on the verge of selling out to the Music Town franchise thanks to the evil owner Mitchell Beck (Ben Bode). For many of Reaves teenage staff, Empire Records is their last chance saloon. On the day after Lucas (Cochrane) in a last ditch attempt to save the store, steals all of the money from the store safe and loses it at a casino, Reaves tells his employees about the impending sale. With a past his prime 80s rock star Rex Manning (Caulfield, brilliant) visiting the shop to sign autographs the confused staff work through their various issues and try to come to terms with the coming change.The film has an excellent soundtrack and some great comedy scenes. LaPaglia is excellent and he is ably supported by the minor players. Cochrane's Lucas and Tunney's Debra being the standouts. Though Whitmore and Tyler do their best to drag proceedings down with a fairly unremarkable love story. This was a much loved film among teen audiences when it came out in 1995, and many years on, while dated, still stands up. It goes a little more deeply into some significant issues faced by the characters, without getting bogged down by them, though it does offer some too easy solutions.In the end if you take good performances, a great soundtrack, and an basic plot, you get a good movie.",6,1,3,2 July 2014
The Evil Dead," Great horror film
","It has corny effects...that are awesome! It has hammy performances... that are great! And some of the most atmospheric direction and creative use of limited resources you'll see in any film. On a budget of somewhere between 350 and $400,000, Raimi was able to churn out a film that received praise from Stephen King for being 'terrifying' and went on to gross $2.4 million on its original release. So let's dust off our old VHS, get our box tellies out of the garden shed, dim the lights and take in this horror classic: Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.Our story begins with our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) going with his girlfriend Linda, her sister Cheryl, and another couple Scott and Shelley to stay at a cabin in the woods. These early scenes are a little painful, with Ash failing to gain much interest..or anything.Some typical foreboding things happen on their way to the cabin (a near hit car incident and a semi-collapsing bridge) but they make it the cabin safely. Upon getting there Cheryl's hand is possessed by Satan (or something similar) and she draws a weird picture. Inexplicably finding this normal, she mentions it to no one. Later on at dinner time the attic door in the cabin flings open, Ash and Scott decide to check it out, again because there's nothing abnormal about an attic door flinging itself up for no reason. In the attic they find the Book of the Dead and an old tape player with some incantations on it. Needless to say these incantations release evil and demonic spirits.Cheryl was already demonically possessed earlier and so naturally she is the first to really have horrific things happen to her, like a pretty full on scene where she is violated by a tree. She gets back inside and no one believes her. This is pretty good gradual revelation as the audience and Cheryl know more than the other four characters. Cheryl is understandably hysterical and so Ash tries to drive her back into town, but they realize that the semi collapsed bridge has fully collapsed and they are trapped at the cabin.They arrive back at the cabin and Cheryl turns full zombie. From there they turn one by one until it's just Ash remaining trying to survive the night and survive the zombies.As classical as a horror film plot that is, and I hope from that synopsis of the setup that it comes across just how well this movie builds in the first act, the real star is the awesome shots of the camera zooming through the woods. Now, they couldn't afford dollies on their budget so apparently Raimi tried everything from improvised wooden sliders using trees to getting two guys to run around in the woods holding a camera attached to a wooden rail sleeper. However he did it, Raimi and his virtually novice crew are able to create the sensation of a spirit or force moving through the woods. These shots are unsettling in the first act and downright frightening as the film continues.Another star is the gore effects, even though there are some scenes where you can see blood capsules and melting plastic. In the end, these zombie looking things actually are pretty scary and do work, at least within the world this film happens in.Campbell does grow on you as the film continues and his panicked flailing near the end of the film is excellent. The rest of the cast are inexperienced and do what they're asked by a director who appears to be taking great pleasure in subjecting them to all manner of discomforts and indignities.This film was widely praised when it came out and still highly regarded now. I think I've revealed the most unexpectedly disgusting part, but there's a lot of stuff in here that may offend. With this type of story and budget, you know what to expect, but you can also expect to get a film far better than you typical horror outing. One of the very best the horror genre has to offer.",8,0,1,24 February 2015
Saw II," Plodding, but effective continuation
","Well, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) returns and gets thrown into a pit of syringes, Donnie Wahlberg joins the fray as a corrupt cop, and Lucy Camden (you watched that show, admit it) has become a convicted criminal in this plodding continuation of the Saw franchise.For those who came in late, this movie series is based on a serial killer (and in spite of his protests, yep, he IS a killer) who uses his skills as a civil engineer to try and teach people life lessons by putting them in traps that will kill them if they can't escape in time. We find out in the first film that this serial killer John Kramer, dubbed 'Jigsaw' by the media, is a man dying of cancer. We also see a drug addict named Amanda who is able to solve one of his deadly puzzles. To recap my own misgivings with the film, which I liked, Jigsaw IS a murderer and his traps are inconsistent in intent. In what would become a tradition in Saw films, this one starts with a trap. Some guy has to cut his eye out to retrieve a key that will release him from a deadly mask. He can't do it and dies. Turns out the guy was a police informant working for Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) a New Kid on the Block (oh, you just try not to use that pun) in the Saw series, who receives a phone call to come down to a warehouse where they have found Kramer. in Kramer's lair they don't find his diorama from the original but do notice (I'll go on record right now as saying the cops in the Saw series are, generally speaking, the most inept and unobservant police officers ever put to film) some huge TV screens showing 8 people in a house. Amongst the group are Amanda, (at this stage we are told she is Jigsaw's only Survivor but by the last film I think they've forgotten all about this and plenty of people have survived his traps), and Detective Matthew's son Daniel. In the house is a nerve gas that will kill them all in two hours, with various antidotes hidden around the house. In the meantime Matthews is asked to play a game: talk to Jigsaw for the next two hours and his son will be safe.The film goes back and forth between the house and the mind game between Kramer and Matthews as we learn that everyone in the house, apart from Daniel, is a con who was put away on doctored evidence by Matthews. We get to see these cons get burned alive, bled dry, thrown into syringe pits and run around like maniacs trying to kill each other. With his son in peril, Matthews eventually loses it and starts whaling on Kramer and forces him to take him to the house where all this is happening.Spoilers!: upon reaching the house, Matthews learns that it is the house from the original Saw film, with Adam's dead body still in the basement. He also learns that the footage he was watching, and we were seeing, had all happened earlier and he had been watching a recording. His son was out of the house, locked in a safe that opened once the two hours expired. We also find out Amanda has been working with Jigsaw, and has essentially become his apprentice. At the end she chains up Matthews in the same room the original film started in and says 'Game Over' as she slams the door shut, but doesn't lock it, a fact that would become important in the later films. I must admit this movie got me twice, I wasn't expecting the taped footage, or Amanda being a nutcase, though I probably should have as I'd seen Shawnee Smith in Becker.The kills in this are more elaborate than the previous film, in typical sequel style they've upped the death count and number of lives in peril. As is often the case though this is done to the detriment of character development and story. We never really learn properly what some of these cons are supposed to have done, and with the exception of Daniel and perhaps Amanda, we are given no reason to care if they survive or not. I thought the twists worked better here than the original, in the sense they weren't as dumb. I was unimpressed with the veteran actors in the first film, I thought only Tobin Bell as Jigsaw really did himself much credit here. Donnie isn't a bad actor, and as we've seen in Blue Bloods, his deficiencies are easy to hide in an ensemble, but he's not given much to work with either. Shawnee Smith does alright as Amanda. All the rest I can take or leave.Saw II seems to make more sense than many films in the series, particularly the later ones, but the pacing is slow and the characters not likable. They try and compensate for this by having some creative kills at regular intervals, but it still left me a little cold and a bit bored. Effective in what it set out to do, but the third installment really needed to pick it up. Could they find a good veteran actor, characters the audience could engage with, an effective mix between an elaborate game with grisly traps and true character development; and a genuinely unsettling twist for the third part? You won't believe how close they came...",5,0,2,25 June 2015
From Dusk Till Dawn," Not what many expected
","I remember watching this with a friend who told me after the film, she was loving it until they went to Road House, at which point it turned into the worst movie ever made.Maybe it was my love of horror movies, maybe it was my teenage Salma Hayek lust going into overdrive, who knows? But I absolutely loved it from start to finish. However, my friend, Jenny made a good point about this film: it starts off as one type of movie and then morphs into something completely different. Often with a film you can get a pretty good feel for what you are watching in the first 15-20 minutes and have a reasonably good idea if you are going to enjoy it or not. This is one film where you can love the first 45 minutes and despise the rest of the film, or vice versa.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino star as the Grecko Brothers who, after an amusing opening sequence where they rob a liquor store, are on the run from the police and end up taking a retired Priest Jake Fuller and his two children (one of whom is Juliette Lewis fresh off of Natural Born Killers) hostage as they head to Mexico to meet their friend Carlos (one of many roles in the movie played by Cheech Marin). Upon arrival The Greckos are given quite a show by a stripper (Salma Hayek) who feeds Tarantino some champagne down her leg.That's where it gets pretty different, as they turn out to be in a vampire bar and Clooney spends the rest of the movie fighting creatures of darkness, before an amusing final scene with Cheech.This was my second look at a Robert Rodriguez movie following Desperado, and as well as recurring cast members (Tarantino, Hayek, Marin, Danny Trejo) and setting (Mexico) this one also has a very similar feel.The film delivers something rather different from what you'd expect from the premise and is actually a pretty good kick ass action flick made with typical Rodriguez oddness. The cast are all stellar and it is great watching Clooney and Keitel together.It's no Desperado by any means, but From Dusk Til Dawn is a satisfying action thriller and one of Rodriguez's better films.",7,1,2,19 July 2014
Saw," Let's travel back in time
","It's 2004. We've just seen off three great horror franchises in the space of a few years with Scream wrapping up (until it didn't) and Freddy vs Jason bringing an end to both the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street film series'. Stepping into that vacuum come two Australians: Director James Whan and writer/ actor Leigh Wannell armed with an idea.Two men, Dr Gordon (Cary Elwes), and Adam (Leigh Whannell) awake on opposite sides of a room, chained by the leg to pipes, with a dead body in the middle. Gordon plays a tape saying someone has his family and telling him he has one day to kill Adam and he can leave and his family will be safe.Gordon quickly works out that they are playing a game set by a serial killer given the name Jigsaw by the press, who tries to teach people life lessons by putting them in situation they will more than likely die in. We are asked to buy into the idea that Jigsaw 'never killed anybody.' Well sorry to rain on your parade, but if you recklessly endanger someone's life or show depraved indifference, yep you're a murderer. And the rules are hardly consistent. For instance one woman survives a trap by stabbing a man to death and cutting out one of his organs to retrieve a key. Wonder what his game was supposed to be? 'If you're hearing this it's because a girl's head just exploded when she decided not to stab you to death and mutilate your lifeless body. Now we're going to play a game....' When some traps have multiple people all with an opportunity to survive and others are 'Kill or die' you can make no claims to fairness. Jigsaw being a killer who doesn't kill is an interesting idea, but doesn't quite work, both because the writers are not consistent with what Jigsaw is about and because he is clearly a murderer.Anyway, Danny Glover plays a grizzled cop who believes Goodman is Jigsaw. He lost a partner to this killer and will stop at nothing to find and stop Jigsaw. The script effectively takes us back and forth between the two guys in a room and the crazy cop. This would become the structure of each of the seven Saw films, focusing on one elaborate trap involving multiple people and a police investigation. At least in this one these two plots are connected, which is not the case in some of the later films. In the meantime, Goodman and Adam sit in the cell trying to work out how they both got into this mess and how they are going to get out.We see one of the worst and unconvincing car chase scenes ever put to film, we see holes in the plot the size of Texas, and we see Gordon saw his leg off (maybe that's why it's called Saw?). At the very end we get the 'twist' that Jigsaw is what we thought was a dead body in the middle of the room. The key to the chains holding Adam was in the bathtub he woke up in at the start, and has been lost down the drain. Meaning that his lesson was to not freak out and get up when he wakes up in a bath with a chain on his leg. Game Over, Jigsaw says as he slams the door shut, leaving Adam in there to starve to death. This succeeds in being surprising, but fails in being another 'game' with no point and no way of winning and also in being absolutely ridiculous. Saw is an entertaining little film, that requires the viewer to not ask questions, perpetually suspend their disbelief and just go with it. The veterans give disappointing performances, particularly Elwes, and Whannell is clearly a better writer than actor. The effects are cheap, but only the car chase is laughable. Saw was a unique and original film that grew first into a passable trilogy and then into a seven film orgy of torture porn and stupidity. In many ways, this one deserves to be separated from the rest of the series. Saw, at least, can stand as a decent film on its own based on a unique, if flawed, idea and you don't need the later chapters to appreciate it.",7,0,2,19 March 2015
The Matrix Reloaded," Unnecessary continuation of a film that wasn't quite as good as some thought
","Heavy philosophy mixed with great action sequences turns out to be no equal to old fashioned gun play and boy's-only adventure in this unnecessary and frankly boring continuation of The Matrix story.All of the original cast return so that they can have fun at a huge orgy/ rave party in Zion and then run around the matrix having cool car chases and great fighting action while Neo makes out with an especially gorgeous looking Monica Belucci and then takes on 5 million different versions of Agent Smith before having a really weird conversation with a computer program, who reveals that Neo is the sixth 'one' and that Zion has been destroyed 6 times (if he's the sixth wouldn't that make it 5 times?). And he has god powers to kill sentinels in the real world. By film's end, Agent Smith has escaped into our world using a human (!) and Zion is about to be destroyed.This film was a real event when it came out and did great box office, but the third film didn't do so well, and I'd have to think just how underwhelming this was played a big part. Many people point out that this one and Matrix: Revolutions are basically one movie split in two, so you should watch both before you can fully judge their collective worth, but I just don't accept that argument. The same year this came out, we also had Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill split into two films which were both very different and good movies. In this case we get a lot cool action, a lot of daft philosophy and not really much to like.Post script: to be fair, I rewatched Revolutions. After seeing both films I can state as a matter of observational science, that they both sucked. This never should have been a series.",4,0,2,27 February 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Michael Bay strikes back
","After an original surprisingly lacking Michael Bay's usual crass staples, he produces a sequel brimming with them. This film is the worst excesses of his style, and its biggest strengths rolled into one.The story in the original film was admittedly slight, but in this sequel it is basically non-existent. Megan Fox has lost any vestiges of character and is here simply playing a brunette barbie doll, but she does look good lying across the frame of a motor bike and we salute Michael Bay for bringing this to our attention, though question whether the 10 year old and youngers who make up the primary audience of this film are as enamoured with a denim clad female buttocks as we are. Shia Lebeouf's character is displaying almost no growth at all from the first film and some of the new support Transformers you will want to see atomised, particularly the ones that accompany Spike in the desert. I do like the idea of the fallen, and the new character Jetfire. Jetfire was in the original TV show, toys and comics, though his back story here, and indeed entire character are so different he might as well be a new creation. Starscream is again wasted, though his attempts to suck up to Megatron are funny.The nano-bots are well realised and there are a lot of breath taking action sequences, including the desert eating Devastator, but as in the last twenty minutes of the original it is often hard to tell who is who, and some of the characters are such grotesque stereotypes, that there isn't any tension in seeing them in peril anyway.John Turtorro returns to lend some interest to proceedings. His appearance in the film is like a breath of fresh air. He loses some of his edginess from the original, but is still easily the most interesting human on screen. The ending is a text book anti climax.Michael Bay is very good with set pieces, special effects and action sequences, but vulgar characterisations and story telling devices also litter his films. When he mixes them all together right, as in the Rock, the results are ridiculously entertaining. When he gets it wrong, as he did here, the results while watchable due to the sheer scale, are disappointing.",4,5,14,18 September 2012
The Wolf of Wall Street," Another triumph for DiCaprio and Scorsese
","Leonardo DiCaprio gives arguably the best performance of his career in this Wall Street/ Goodfellas hybrid which looks at the life and exploits of Jordan Belfort, founder of Wall Street chop shop Stratton Oakmont, exploring the depths of his drug induced sexual depravity.DiCaprio narrates the film, which takes reasonable and necessary liberties with Belfort's book of the same name, taking us through his initiation into the world of stock broking through a memorable, insane, conversation with senior broker Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), the 1987 stock market crash and his discovery of penny stocks, which give a far greater return to the broker than 'blue Chip' stocks. He meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill, deliberately painful), and starts his own firm, making a small fortune and drawing the attention of the SEC and FBI, who send Patrick Denman (Kyle Chandler, outstanding) to investigate, It is in this investigation, starting around the same time that Belfort meets his second wife Naomi (Margot Robbie in a breakout role) that the film really hits its straps. The scene with DiCaprio and Chandler on his luxury yacht is one of the great moments in cinema this decade, and the iconic moments flow thick and fast from there. DiCaprio's speeches on the chop shop floor, a darkly funny overdose scene, and deeply satisfying moments of comeuppance (even though Belfort gets off very lightly).Scorsese resists, and in fact openly works against, the temptation to glorify Belfort or make him the hero of the piece, showing the full depths of his depravity and amoral nature and allowing DiCaprio to create a pathetic creature, selfish, greedy and destructive with few redeeming features but managing to be so charismatic you can't turn away. It is DiCaprio's performance that allows Chandler to shine playing Belfort's opposite. Principled, driven, incorruptible and unlike every other character we see, likable. His is a welcome break in the stench given off by every other character we see, and a strong performance in its own right. You want to see him stand up to Belfort, his disgraceful worldview and his cynical and criminal use of people. You want to see him win.This is DiCaprio's film from start to finish, with nary a second he is not on screen and he is riveting. Whether he's doing deals over the phone, sniffing crack off a woman's breasts, or giving inspirational speeches, you won't be able to take your eyes off him. Several scenes involve Belfort addressing the audience the same way we see in Goodfellas and Casino. Belfort lets us in on his extramarital affairs, drug use and illegal business operations, making us co-conspirators, and also making us feel dirty as a result. Through sheer weight of consistent great performances, DiCaprio has risen to a rare level, and must now be considered the greatest actor and star of his generation. And Like de Niro, DiCaprio's collaborations with Scorsese have become event cinema for film fans.Of the minor players, Hill comes off the best. It is impossible not to be offended by his Donnie and filled with murderous rage whenever he comes on screen. A truly odious creation and brilliant performance. Joanna Lumley (Naomi's aunt), Rob Reiner (Belfort's father), and Jon Bernthal (a drug dealing ally) are also outstanding.Warning to those who haven't seen the film, it contains drug use, full frontal nudity, orgies, and drops the f-bomb with equal abandon to Goodfellas. That all this has a context, and helps the director establish the morality of his story won't be enough for some to plow through it. For those who can, this is one of the very best movies of the past 15 years, featuring a great director at the top of his game, and the finest actor of this generation giving arguably his greatest performance.",10,1,5,11 March 2015
Army of Darkness," Over the Top, stupid, and proud of it
","After beginning the Evil Dead series with a straight horror film, and then merging horror and comedy together in Part II. In Army of Darkness, it looks like Raimi's said 'To hell with it' and just made the biggest, dumbest action/ comedy movie the $13 million budget allowed him to make.In some foreign markets this was released with the awesome title 'Captain Supermarket.' That's because in this one Ash (Bruce Campbell) is a supermarket clerk who gets sucked back to medieval England to kick some undead ass. Corny one liners fly thick and fast, Campbell displays physical comedy that will have you in stitches. 'THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!' There are two different endings, both have their strengths and weaknesses.If you were paying attention in Evil Dead 2, you would have noticed a scene where they are looking the Book of the Dead and see an ancient story about a knight in medieval England who stopped the dead. 'Didn't do a good job,' quips Ash. Well the knight is him. And he actually causes the problems with the undead in the first place due to his half baked attitude toward duty. There are shenanigans to be had with fighting bones, Ash getting an evil alter ego, and an all out battle for the human race between medieval knights and undead zombies plays out like a small budget Robin Hood vs the Zombies film.There actually is a nice supporting cast in this too, including Embeth Davidtz. Marcus Gilbert, Ian Ambercrombie and a young Bridget Fonda (hardly in it at all). But this is Campbell's film. He's not quite as unrestrained as in the insane second part, but he certainly does 'Let it Go' in this one too. The scene at the windmill is three stooges stuff, but is great. You'll laugh, you'll roll your eyes at some effects and one liners, but ultimately you'll be really entertained by this over the top action comedy that doesn't take itself very seriously at all.",8,3,4,1 March 2015
Scream 2," Continues the momentum from the original
","Scream 2 came hot on the heels of the original, with Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson signing on again to direct and write and all of the surviving original cast returning. And they are able to churn out a movie almost as good as its predecessor. While lacking the unique feel of the original, this movie picks up the ball and runs with it, crafting an entertaining film from the still fresh approach used in the original.The story here is that Gale Weathers has written a best selling book about the events of the first film, which has itself been turned into a film 'Stab' (starring Tori Spelling in a nice little reference to a throwaway line of dialogue from the original). Sidney is now at College with a new boyfriend (played by Jerry 'Kangaroo Jack' O'Connell) trying to move on with her life, but of course, it all starts to happen again. Two students from Sidney's College are found murdered at the 'Stab' premier. She herself is attacked and she finds herself living once again in a real life horror film where everyone's a suspect.Scream 2 does have some welcome additions to the cast, with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett signing up to be slaughtered, and Timophy Olyphant showing some early promise as Mickey, the freaky Tarantino film student. Liev Schrieber's extended role is another nice addition.The script tends to be more an in joke on the original film rather than the horror genre, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had. The kills are more elaborate than in the original, which has the downside of also making them more absurd. Omar Epps death in particular bends logic.Overall though, while not as good as the original, Scream 2 is still far more entertaining than many movies that came out in the same period and is far from a bad way to spend two hours. Well worth a look.",6,0,1,10 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A great Star Wars film at last
","It's a big ask to sell people on a film series where the entire trajectory is a young man becoming increasingly corrupted and fall from grace, particularly when the fate of many of the characters you're depicting is a well known, and often celebrated fact of cinematic history, but on George Lucas plowed through two uneven prequel films to bring us here, the one where the bad guys win, and win emphatically.The film opens with one of the best sequences in the entire 6 Lucas controlled films as Anakin and Obi-Wan rescue Palpatine from the evil Lord Greivious, a droid with a human heart. Anakin kills Count Dooku straight away and Palpatine sets apart convincing Anakin that Padme is going to die and it's only through learning the dark side of the force that he can save her. In the moment he does turn, it's both understandable and believable, though the speed at which he goes from 'What have I done,' to 'You're my Master' doesn't quite ring true.In the meantime Palpatine goes on manipulating everyone from the Senate to the Jedi in order to establish his Empire. We get the epic Light saber duel we've always wanted to see between Obi-Wan and Anakin at the height of their powers. We also get Yoda taking on Palpatine, which is something of a let down at the end, but Lucas' hands were tied by the fact that Yoda had to survive to be in the Original Trilogy films.the film ends on a real note of hope that had me wanting to run out and watch the Original Trilogy again. As a perfect tie in to the original series this one does fall agonizingly short. You can't quite believe that Obi-wan and Yoda are where they are in the later films for the reasons Episode 3 gives us. And there are a few other points of difference too. Overall though the third film is both a great finale to the prequel trilogy and a decent lead in to the original trilogy.This film really belongs to Christenson and your ability to enjoy it will depend greatly on whether you can sit through two hours of him carrying a film. I think he's terrific in this one having to play a young man with loyalties divided by genuine grievances, under the thrall of a charismatic mad man, needing to keep secrets from the ones he loves. The other key players Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid are both excellent. They are the two actors who seem the most at home in these prequels, not weighed down by dialogue or acting in front of a blue screen. Natalie Portman is finally given something of substance to do, though admittedly not much, she at least gets to say one of the best lines in the whole series 'So, this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause,' and Jar Jar's presence is kept to a minimum.Lucas received much attention for his writing of the disintegration of the Republic, with some saying he was having a veiled swipe at the US President George W Bush's reaction following 9/11. Lucas for his part, countered that he had based the disintegration on events from the lead up to the Vietnam war. I'll leave it to the discerning reader to decide which is more likely.Revenge of the Sith is a winner from start to finish. The only great Star Wars movie made since 1980, and went some way to justifying the whole prequel trilogy. In the end the trilogy gave us Natalie Portman, gave great Australasian actors like Jack Thompson, Temuera Morrison, Joel Edgerton, Jay Laga'aia, and Claudia Karvan (along with many others) an opportunity to star in a big Hollywood blockbuster, and introduced a younger generation to the Star Wars films. Any success the series has going forward will be in some way due to the younger audience being engaged for the first time here. Thank you George Lucas for making this movie. Now it's over to JJ Abrams and frankly, I can't wait to see where he takes Star Wars.",10,1,4,6 March 2015
Scream," A fun movie that effectively parodied the slasher genre
","Following the big flop 'New Nightmare', which was not actually a bad film, Wes Craven came out all guns blazing, armed with a nice script from Kevin Williamson, and made the single biggest movie of his career.The script is a lot of fun with various in jokes, and it doesn't take long for them to start coming. 'The first nightmare on Elm Street was good, the rest sucked,' was an obvious reference to Wes Craven directing the original and not the later ones, Craven later makes a cameo appearance as a janitor named 'Fred' wearing a green and red jumper. Several other classic horror films are also referenced including the Exorcist, Friday the 13th, Halloween 1 and 2, Hellraiser, Prom Night, The Howling and Rosemary's Baby.The plot revolves around Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a young high Schooler who's mother was viciously murdered a year or so earlier. Sidney was convinced her mother's murderer was Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was convicted of the crime and is in now in jail. Tabloid news reporter Gail Weathers however, has her doubts and has printed a series of articles and a tell all novel pleading Weary's innocence. Her theory is given credence as a series of copycat killings, modeled after 80s horror movies, occur. Sidney soon finds herself living in a real life scary movie with no allies and everyone's a suspect.I find it a bit hard to rate Scream as a slasher film, as I don't see it as one. I see it as more of comedy thriller, which was successfully marketed as a horror film. Not that it was hard given the many litres of fake blood used in the story or the rather grisly subject matter.On the acting side, Skeet Ulrich easily steals the movie from under the rest of the cast, while Matthew Lillard and Jamie Keneedy are both delights. David Arquette is equal parts annoying and endearing, and Courtney Cox is convincing as a bitch, but not so much as a reporter. Neve Campbell puts in a strong performance as Sidney, while Rose McGowan is under used, and unlikeable in her few scenes. Drew Barrymore's cameo in the opening ten or so minutes has become an iconic scene in 90s film making, and is some of the best work she has ever done.Craven's affection for the horror genre has been evident in many of his movies and he does a fine job here of both sending up the genre he helped create, and also redefining it for a modern audience. Well done to Craven and his script writer Kevin Williamson for breathing life back into the slasher genre.",9,1,2,6 July 2009
Halloween," A Horror Classic
","A babysitter minding a strange house is suddenly attacked by a monster. It's possibly one of the oldest horror movie clichés there is. The type of legend you can imagine being passed along for centuries in one form or another, and the basis for what could well be the finest slasher movie ever made.John Carpenter's Halloween is a stunning film, one that stands as a genuine masterpiece 30 years on. A claustrophobic setting, a fine script and wonderful direction make this a film which has lost little down the years.From the very first scene it's easy to be sucked in as we see the world through the eyes of the young Micheal Myers as he brutally murders his sister while still a small child. From there he spends the next several years in a mental institute before breaking out and looking for his only living relative, his sister Laurie Strode. Dr Loomis, his psychiatrist at the mental hospital chases after Myers attempting to stop him in his quest.But this is no normal rampage, Halloween allows us to get to know the characters before they are brutally put away by Myers. While in the case of PJ Soles character, an annoying bimbo, this may lead to cheers, on the whole we empathize with those who are murdered.But most importantly we feel what Loomis feels, his desperation and despair so poignantly depicted by brilliant British actor Donald Pleasance. And Jamie Lee Curtis does a nice job of playing a character with a little more depth than your typical damsel in distress.Micheals Myers is a terrifying character, a massive presence, fittingly nick named 'The Shape' by fans. He is genuinely terrifying as he goes on a mindless, joyless mission of destruction. Hell bent on getting his sister. He is more human in this movie than monster and infinitely more terrifying for it.So catch this movie if possible. There are sex scenes and a relatively low death count, so it's not for everyone, but it is a fine example of the slasher genre which holds up as well thirty years on.",9,0,1,5 December 2008
Lucy," Scarlet Johansson goes all Keanu Reeves
","Scarlet Johansson slowly turns into an indestructible force of nature in this stylistic, entertaining if rather implausible Luc Besson helmed actioner that was huge hit in 2014.Johansson stars as the Lucy of the title, a simple, rather crude young lady who falls afoul of her boyfriend Richard, and ends up being used, against her will as a drug mule. But the drugs she is carrying are no ordinary narcotics, they are CPH4, a synthetic based on a substance given to fetuses to help their prenatal development, and unfortunately, the bag tears and all that drug makes its way into her blood stream.To explain what all this means, the film takes us to Professor Samuel Norman, played by Morgan Freeman. But he's taking us down the rabbit hole here rather than Through the Wormhole (a fascinating series hosted by Freeman), and explaining that the average human only uses between 10 and 15% of their brain, but they could get all types of wacky superpowers if they are able to use more, which Lucy presumably can or else would they cross to this guy?Johansson slowly turns into a cross between Keanu Reeves from the Matrix, including his abilities to bend matter, shoot with pin point accuracy, see coding everywhere, and not display a discernible emotion; and Yoda from Revenge of the Sith, complete with wise sayings and the ability to knock a room full of bad guys unconscious with one flick of the hand. Johansson is looking for revenge on Mr Jang, (Chio Min Sik) the man who forced her to carry the drugs, with Drug Enforcement Officer Pierre del Rio (Amr Waked) by her side.Besson has done a good job with the direction, with the film frequently showing cut scenes to appropriate situations with animals in the wild, cave men and transitional apes, which actually do go somewhere in the film's final act. The special effects are adequate and the action sequences, including gun fights, car chases and hand to hand combat, are well put together.Johansson is solid in the lead role and puts across a believable detachment, Freeman is good as usual, while Amr Waked, probably the most important character in the film as he acts as a conduit for the audience, gives a well judged performance, though is let down a little bit by his character being under developed in the script.If you're the type of person who likes plausible science in movies, give this one a miss. However, if you can look past implausible science providing a film makes sense in its own reality, there is a lot to like here. I thoroughly enjoyed this and it is refreshing to see an action film featuring a female lead where her gender is not the focus. A pleasing return to form for Besson.",8,4,10,5 March 2015
Final Destination," Effective and engaging thriller
","Given the self aware nature slasher movies took in the late 90s following Scream, it was a logical progression for a movie to come along where death itself is the slasher. This is the idea driving this effective, well made and well acted, entry to the slasher genre that was a big hit in 2000 and spawned a successful franchise.The once promising Devon Sawa stars as Alex Browning, a high school student who is about to fly to France on a school excursion, but has a premonition in which he sees the plane explode, killing everyone on board. Once on the plane, incidents from the vision start to occur. Alex panics, resulting in him, some classmates and a teacher getting thrown off the plane. The plane ends up exploding just as Alex saw in his vision.Cue a creepy cameo from Tony Todd (better known to horror movie fans as the Candy Man) to explain to Alex that he has cheated death and now death is coming for the survivors. And that's the plot of this one.The film contains a big variety of kills, from elaborately set up accidents to sudden decapitations. One of the more enjoyable things in this movie is working out exactly how the various scenarios are going to converge to achieve death's design. Death is one driven and creative entity.Devon Sawa is great in this film, gradually going further and further off the deep end as he tries to stay a step ahead of death. His performance and the ability of Director James Wong to draw the most out of the premise are the main strengths of the film, while Kerr Smith, Ali Larter and Sean William Scott all do exactly what is asked of them as death's other targets.The idea of Death stalking a group of people who have cheated him of his wages is an interesting one and this film doesn't waste its promise. Best to watch this on its own, and not think about later sequels. A good idea done well.",8,0,1,22 July 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Atmospheric Horror outing
","Possibly the most stunning thing about this movie, looking back, is just how few people thought it would work. Fortunately for New Line Cinemas, they were willing to take the plunge and this film, and its various sequels, put them on the map.Wes Craven reportedly got the idea of this movie after reading about a young man of Asian descent who had recurring nightmares and died mysteriously in his sleep one night. He read another couple of news stories of similar happenings and decided 'That sounds like a great plot for a horror movie.' He was right.Anyway, for the few people out there who don't know the story of Freddy Krueger, he was a child murderer, who was released from prison on a technicality, burned alive in his boiler by angry parents, and then came back to take revenge by killing their children in their dreams.Krueger is effectively bought to life by Robert Englund, in the film Freddy is a menacing creation we don't really see much of and usually in a dark setting. He truly looks, and acts, like a creature of nightmares, and terrified millions of cinema going teenagers back in 1984.The main threat to Freddy is the strong willed Nancy Thompson, the daughter of the local police chief, who has her life turned upside down after Freddy murders her best friend Tina and the police blame Tina's boyfriend Nick.Nancy uncovers the town's dark secret and comes up with a plan to drag Freddy out into the real world for a final confrontation.The supporting cast includes John Saxon (Roper from Enter the Dragon) and Johnny Depp (yes THE Johnny Depp in his first role) as Nancy's boyfriend Glen who dies in particularly memorable fashion.The effects in this are good for the time, most of its shot in the dark anyway so you wouldn't really notice the bad stuff unless you were looking for it. The acting is passable and the story is fun.Has lost a bit though due to all the sequels. Remember in this one no one knew the hokey stuff about Freddy being 'the bastard son of a hundred maniacs' or dream demons, dream warriors, dream masters, or dream children. This was just a nasty guy with a beef who could do cool, deadly stuff to his victims while they slept.Well worth a look, if a bit dated.",7,0,0,29 January 2009
The Matrix," Took risks and proved a game changer
","I was one of the many people who went and saw this at the cinemas when it first came out. Unlike many of those people, I wasn't particularly blown away. While I found the ideas in the story interesting, I didn't find the way they were explored to be especially engaging. I really liked some of the effects, but thought mainly of how much I would like to see them used in a better movie. Then I left the theatre with my two friends, one a homosexual artist, the other a theology student, and they both talked and talked and talked about the impressive visuals, philosophical symbolism and deep ideas present in the film. After around 30 minutes in conversation I was asked for my opinion. Not wanting to lie, I was frank. 'Guys, 90% of that movie was as cliché as hell (may not have been the exact word I used)' Silence is golden.And cliché as hell is exactly what 90% of this film is. The long leather jackets date this instantly. The hero is a Jesus allegory and he is saved by the power of love. A very poorly fleshed out and unconvincing love at that. There are one liners in the middle of gun fights, clichéd fighting scenes, and truly boring colours and characters. This was every action movie you've ever seen, with some nice new tricks.There are plenty of positives too. After watching Hugo Weaving give excellent performances in Aussie dramas like Bodyline and The Interview, it was great to see him given a big role in a Hollywood blockbuster, and nail it. Man being imprisoned by machines is not a new idea, but I thought they did a reasonable mash-up of the various popular apocalyptic futuristic sci-fi stories. The ideas in the film were interesting, I just didn't think they explored them very well. Like I said, I didn't hate it, I was just really surprised by the OMGZ!!!!11!!! reaction it received.My feelings on the movie have mellowed since then, now that I have only seen it once or twice in the last decade, now that every church group doesn't have a weekly bible study looking at the philosophy and spiritual messages in the Matrix, and now that its impact can be fully measured. The Matrix was innovative, but inoffensive, and unquestionably, a game changer. It changed the way action films were made and it changed the way action films were written. Bullet time was a tremendous innovation that every action film used for a long time afterward. A technology that was built on and improved to the point that the effects used here barely look like a big deal. It was possible to make an intelligent action film with interesting ideas and have people pay money to watch it. Not that this one is especially endowed with intelligence. And while I've never heard someone give a testimony in church starting with (I'm imagining this being read with a deep southern accent) 'I was a sinner, until one day a friend invited me to a bible study where they used The Matrix to lead me to Jesus...' the church certainly did get excited that this (admittedly unintentionally)had give them a mainstream evangelism tool, before they worked out in about 2007 that this wasn't all that mainstream any more.I encourage anyone to watch this and also Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, two movies that came out within a couple of years of each other and changed the way action films were made. I really hope younger audiences will be blown away by this and have a great cinematic viewing experience, appreciating just how big an impact this had. But I'm not going to lie, it just didn't do it for me. Feel free to disagree with me.",6,2,4,21 February 2015
Hart's War," Good Old School Film-making
","'When the most likable character in your film is an evil nazi, you've got problems,' one reviewer noted of this film. He was wrong.Honestly some critics have been doing his for so long and so dourly that they find it impossible to appreciate a story for what it is. Hart's War is an engaging story about the battle for a man's soul, and is a story told exceptionally well.Tommy Hart, played believably by Colin Farrell is forced to defend a black man, Lincoln Scott in a court martial after he is accused of killing Vic Bedford (another effortlessly emotive performance from Terrence Howard). Tommy finds himself caught in a chess game between Col McNamara (Bruce Willis) and Werner Visser (a remarkable performance from Marcel Lures) which turns into a battle for Hart's decency and in the end his life.Some scenes fall flat, but it's not hard to look past them and see the bigger picture. As well as being a story about becoming, it is also a story of betrayal, friendship and respect, the type of movie that would have starred John Wayne or Charles Bronson in the McNamara role back in the day.Shunned by critics and audiences upon its original release, but deserves reappraisal and a second look now.",8,30,34,17 December 2008
Jackie Brown," Elmore Leonard meets blaxploitation
","I'll start with a confession. When I first saw this movie I was 16 years old, I had no idea about Foxy Brown and the only film I'd ever seen Pam Grier in was Escape from LA, where she played a trans-gender character. The names on the marquee I was interested in were Quentin Tarantino, Michael Keaton and Samuel L Jackson. That's what brought me here. Elmore Leonard I knew as the writer of Get Shorty, but he was hardly a name I was looking to follow around, unthinkable in hindsight given that he was the author who wrote the Pulpy novels that three of the best flicks of the 90s (this, Get Shorty and Out of Sight) were based on, but I was 16 and there was no smart phones with google apps on them to find this stuff out. We didn't even have DVD special features to learn this kind of stuff kids. Hell, we didn't really have DVDs in any meaningful way, so give me a break to start with, OK? In a lot of ways this is my favourite Tarantino film to watch, not because it's his best, but because it's the one that seems the least like a Tarantino film. The story, not just the characters, are given time and room to flow and there's a certain feel to this film and the performances given by the main cast that is tangibly different to any other work he has done before or since. Jackie Brown seems to be a lot more similar to Get Shorty and Out of Sight stylistically than it does Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. It's fascinating to see a Director like Tarantino adapt someone else's work and make a high quality film.Pam Grier stars as the Jackie Brown of the title (a superb performance that carries the entire film), a flight attendant for a South American airline smuggling money into the country for gun runner Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson). Unfortunately for Jackie, another one of Ordell's smugglers Beaumont Livingstone (Chris Tucker before Rush Hour) gets arrested and rats her out. For his sins, Beaumont is executed by Ordell. Jackie is then arrested at the airport by Ray Nicolette, (Michael Keaton), who I assume is an FBI agent due to a funny cameo Keaton makes as the same character in Out of Sight, and Detective Mark Dugas (Michael Bowen), who want her to wear a wire and help them get Ordell. Aided by bail bondsman Max Sherry (Robert Forster, superb, Oscar nominated) Jackie hatches a plan they might just get her out of this alive while Ordell has some funny scenes with his stoner associate Louis Gara (Robert de Niro in a pitch perfect stoner haze) and equally stoner girlfriend Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda). It all comes together into a satisfying final act with Jackie outsmarting the lot of them.Jackie Brown doesn't try too hard to emulate Tarantino's earlier successes, but he does still play to his strengths, eliciting strong performances from a stellar cast. Grier and Forster were never this good again, while Fonda has rarely been this fun to watch ever. De Niro and Keaton effortlessly capture their roles, while Jackson's nuanced, sometimes menacing, performance is one of the triumphs of the film. He's said since that this was his favourite role in a Tarantino film, and it's easy to see why. Well, there you have it. I've always enjoyed this film for its story, its strong performances and just its whole feel. Its a great companion piece for the equally excellent Out of Sight and another reminder of just how good it was to be a film fan in the mid-late 90s.",8,2,3,27 January 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," Nice Idea that falls off a small ditch rather than a cliff at film's end
","A group of immature young adults acting just like horror film caricatures go off to spend the weekend in a cabin in the woods for some sex and partying, but hit a snag when they unwittingly awake a family of flesh eating zombies, all of this after getting a scary warning from crazy loner at a service station? C'mon, how can any girl really be that tarty? Or any guy really that big a sex mad jerk? Or someone be such an incoherent perpetually stoned misfit? Well in this film, all those questions are answered. This particular cabin in the woods is being manipulated by outside forces. Indeed, the manipulation began before they left home. A usually normal girl having chemicals added to her body to make her horny, etc etc. But to what end game? In the first part of its mission, the film delivers, as we see the skillful people running the cabin coming up with creative ways to get our poor caricatures to follow their script. I must say one character who doesn't work for me is the security guard who is questioning the ethics of what they are doing. There is clearly not a single person involved who thinks what they are doing is ethical, merely an organic necessity. But they've adjusted to this being part of their jobs and so try to have fun doing it.Scenes such as the one where one of the directors laments to another that he 'may never get to see a Mer-man,' and where the entire room starts booing when our normal girl turned sex addict refuses to sleep with her boyfriend because they are outside and 'it's chilly,' are quite funny and echo the feelings of the audience. That's why these scenes work: they are playing the role of you: watching a horror movie and face palming at the victim's stupidity and ignorance, and kind of regretting they didn't get it worse than they did, or that the kill wasn't slightly more creative.Then we get to the final act, and things get a little silly. All of these murders have been sacrifices made to keep an evil demon asleep who will tear the world open if he awakes. Our heroes get to the end and then learn they are in a no win situation, and so sit back and watch it burn. But then we have to see the beast wake up. Can't we just finish with our two heroes there awaiting the end, the ground rumbles, the camera shakes, fade to black... Just seeing that hand seemed to say they didn't understand the horror genre or why we watch these films quite as much as I thought. And the scenes in the bunker don't quite work for me either. They made something good and fun, when it could have been something great.Apart from that, this is a well made, well acted film that is definitely worth a look. Now there is nudity and a mild sex scene,a lot of language and quite a bit of blood. Always mention that as I get a lot of people asking me. Quite good, should have been better.",7,0,1,16 November 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Back to something resembling form.
","The Transformers series recovers slightly after an horrendous second instalment with a decent final act, providing of course that it is the final act.The story (yep, unlike No.2 this one has a story) is that the autobots sent a ship out into the galaxy nearing the end of the Cybertronian War which crash landed on the Earth's moon. The Yanks found out about this, which is why they were so eager to land there in the late sixties, their real mission being to investigate this alien vessel. Turns out have the dormant former autobot leader Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, the voice of Galvatron in the original animated film) on board, and he has a cargo that could hand the Decepticons final victory in the Cybertronian war and grant them dominion throughout the universe.So the stakes are huge, so is the budget. So are the nods to older characters. Uber badass Shockwave finally makes an appearance, the autobots treating him with suitable fear and trembling. The rebel autobot Wreckers make an appearance, though as particularly vulgar characters. The autobots have the odds stacked against them, beaten and exiled, and yet triumph in the end after much sacrifice.I won't say too much about the plot. Though there aren't many surprises, you're better off seeing them in the film than reading them in this review.THis is easily the best characterisation of Optimus Prime, and also Megatron in the film series. Sentinel is an excellent addition, and I must admit to chuckling at the various Spock references throughout the film.So with the human actors. LeBeouf, who I quite liked in the first and found tolerable in the second, is here just annoying. We swap the brunette Barbie Doll Megan Fox, for an actual Barbie Doll in Rosie Huntington Whitely. Though to compensate not being able to see Megan draped over a motor bike in short shorts, we are shown a close up from behind of Rosie walking up a flight of stairs in her underwear. As a matter of fact, that is her introductory scene which tells you all you need to know about her character. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are both welcome additions and their characters both appear to have walked in off the same film John Turtorro's had in the first movie. Patrick Dempsey is perfect in his role as an oily business man conductor of mass enmity.Spike's parents were so funny in the first film, and so vulgar in the second, hear they have improved to being merely banal.Some of the set pieces are astonishing, the highlight being some humans trapped in a sky scraper leaning on another sky scraper, trying desperately to make their way across the fallen building into the still intact one as Shockwave tears the building apart, but the whole battle sequence in Chicago is breathtaking. The ending is suitably dramatic and feels final.What can I say? Loved the transformer characterisations in this one. Had a couple of decent human characters added and actually had a story, even if it was pretty thin. Better than the second, not as good as the first. Loved it!",7,11,15,18 September 2012
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Why do you search for the cup of Christ?
","Steven Spielberg and George Lucas rediscover the magic of the original that was largely missing in the (still excellent) second chapter in this winning final installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy (forget about Kingdom of the Nuked Fridge).Indy is on a mission to rescue his father from the Nazis and stop them from finding the Holy Grail. On the way he'll need to negotiate a sewer full of rats (and petroleum), run away from the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, sleep with an evil (but hot) Nazi, impersonate a ticket inspector on a blimp, and as usual, do pretty much anything apart from archaeology. His main opponent here is Donovan, an evil collector obsessed with the grail legend.Harrison Ford returns to reprise his iconic role, and is joined by Sean Connery (Henry Jones), fresh off an Oscar win for the Untouchables, and former Bond villain Julian Glover (Donavan!), with Denholm Elliott making a welcome return as Marcus Brody after missing Temple of Doom. Alison Doody is also OK as the ill fated Elsa, easily the most interesting character of the female love interests in the three films. Doody wasn't much of an actress, but at least she's Irish.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the only one I saw in the cinemas, and as an 8 year old, I was very excited. It has some great lines ('I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers' 'Do you call this archaeology?' 'Don't call me Junior!' 'Ahhh does anyone here speak English?') some great action set pieces and a fun cracking script that moves the story along at pace. It borrows many elements from the first film, adds some bells and whistles, and produces a fitting final chapter to a rightfully beloved trilogy. Now if only we could wipe the fourth one for existence...",10,2,3,6 March 2015
Evil Dead II," As much a reboot as it is a sequel
","After enjoying a cult success with the original straight horror film The Evil Dead Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell return with a bigger budget and a lot of laughs for this much loved sequel.The film starts by altering the story from the original. Rather than travelling to the cabin with friends, Ash takes his girlfriend to the cabin alone and then has to shoot her and bury her after they read the Book of the Dead. Bruce Campbell is then left to run riot in the cabin with a possessed hand, laughing inanimate objects and more physical comedy. He is eventually joined by Annie, whose father discovered the Book of the Dead, and some yokels who helped her get there.Ash cuts his hand off and replaces it with a chainsaw, people get possessed, including Ash, who is able to shake it off, and then Annie's dead father tells her she can use the Book of the Dead to defeat the zombies. As she dies she is able to suck all the evil into a whirling vortex, and Ash as well. He arrives in medieval England to set up the sequel.This is a pretty good comedy horror, made at a time when most horror films were comedic in tone. Bruce Campbell is terrific, if quite over the top, and everyone does what the director asks them to do. The effects are hokey in parts, but overall are good and a big step up from the original.Evil Dead II is an effective continuation of the original film which notches up both the gore and the fun. An exceptionally entertaining and infinitely watchable sequel that deserves its reputation.",9,1,3,28 February 2015
