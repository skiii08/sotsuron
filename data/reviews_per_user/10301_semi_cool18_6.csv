The Ring," Genuinely creepy
","I liked The Ring a lot because of its genuinely creepy atmosphere. The mood of the movie is dark, gray, and eerie, and that's why it is so appealing. So many horror movies today are so intent on shoving gore and depravity in your face (*cough Saw*) that its refreshing to watch a horror movie that just lets its spooky story creep under your skin. Everything from the water motif to the strange and disturbing videotape is scary and different enough to not feel totally clichéd.That being said, its not free of clichés. There is a little boy who draws a lot of creepy pictures (like, um, every horror movie in recent history). For some reason this movie's clichés didn't bother me as much as usual, though, because unlike other movies, The Ring wasn't built on clichés, it just borrowed them for its story. The excellent score by Hans Zimmer also helps move the film along and add to its dark, heavy mood.A very enjoyable and fresh horror film.",8,0,1,3 November 2005
Silent Hill," Good movie, despite being unfaithful to the games
","From the average movie-going standpoint, I liked Silent Hill. Its acting was good (except perhaps for a couple scenes of Rose, who was otherwise decent), its monsters were demented and scary, and the way it switched between normal and horror world was cool. The storyline was weird, but good, and LOOSELY based off Silent Hill, the original game for Playstation.From the videogamer standpoint, however, its ties with the Silent Hill games was disappointing. There is nothing in common with the movie and game other than the fogginess of the town and the characters' names. Going into detail about the discrepancies would be unnecessary, since almost everything is different. Here's a hint: in the original Playstation game, there was no big emphasis on some fire in the city's history, and there was no church full of religious zealots. And since that is the basis of the movie's plot, that goes to show how little the two titles have in common.Another thing about the video game: I think Silent Hill will never be faithfully made into a movie, because the medium is incompatible (mostly). What makes the Silent Hill games scary are their slow, creeping sense of dread and horror. A game can take you about 15 hours to beat, unlike a movie which is over in 2. Movies just don't have enough time to create the horror that the games do, and because of this, Silent Hill will always be at its best in the video game medium.That said, it was an entertaining horror movie, and managed to stand out from the many in its genre.",6,1,2,27 April 2006
Corpse Bride," Not enough to it
","Corpse Bride is enchanting and interesting, and most of the songs are pretty catchy, but I didn't think there was too much to it. It seemed to be missing something, like there was no real meat to it. Perhaps it was because although the characters were likable, I didn't really care too much about them. And the plot was an interesting premise, but it didn't seem to really take off. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed it, but like Nightmare before Christmas, I just didn't agree with all the hype. I know Burton fans will come out for it just like every other Burton film and praise it never-endingly, but the movie was merely enjoyable; not great.",5,3,8,25 September 2005
Jarhead," Excellent - beautiful and profound
","Only Sam Mendes could capture war in this way. There are some shots in this movie which are absolutely terrific- some are almost so beautiful they are surreal. There is a humanity to this movie, and to all the characters in it. Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, and Jamie Foxx (just to mention the main ones) are all terrific. And just like in American Beauty, Mendes makes great use of the voice-over throughout the movie.It's hard to say exactly what it's about- its certainly funny at many parts, sad and poignant at others, and thought-provoking overall. Either way- don't miss this movie. It's entertaining and powerful, and not just another 'war movie.' I'd say it's a movie about people, and how they change. But that's just one thing I got out of it.",9,2,5,5 November 2005
Saw," Huge disappointment
","I gave Saw 2/10, and those 2 stars were for the one good thing about the movie: the premise. The idea behind the movie is a great one; the idea of a killer who's deranged 'games' teach his victims something about how they are living their life. Also, when his next two victims wake up in a room together, chained to opposite sides, they must follow his clues in order to escape. This intriguing and dreadful (in a good way) premise is a great start for a horror movie. So what went so wrong? The first thing that went was the plausibility. When the two main characters wake up chained up and all the worse for wear in a strange room, remembering nothing of how they got there, do they freak out in any way? Nope. Instead, they react surprisingly calmly and with even some dumb jokey lines. Which leads to the next failure of the movie: the writing, and most importantly, the acting.The 2 characters chained in the room (one is played by Cary Elwes, the other I've never heard of) put on such a spectacular show of terrible acting that it almost seems like a joke. The idea that they're actually trying to act in a serious movie, let alone this horror movie impressed by its own seriousness, is laughable.The final mistake in this movie is one that horror movies so often slip into: a degeneration into an unexciting action-sequence ending. A confusing chase scene near the end is unnecessary and uninteresting, and it's too bad it wasn't replaced with something more unique.Despite its fatal flaws, it has a few memorable moments. A couple of the situations the killer puts his victims into (the snapping helmet, for instance) are bizarre and twisted. Also, the ending does have a decent twist. However, with so much wrong with this movie, these few good points don't do much to salvage the wreckage.",2,0,1,2 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Entertaining
","I'm a big fan of J.K. Rowling's books, and this movie succeeded in capturing the magic of the book, at least at a certain level. I'm not going to lie: I know that none of the movies will be able to truly capture the spirit of the books. Rowling's true world of Hogwarts lies in the realm of literature, and this is a different medium.That being said, it was a good movie. There are a few nitpicks concerning how I would've casted a few characters more to my liking, but I won't get into that, since probably everyone could complain about something. Overall, it was well cast. Harry looks the part, and Richard Harris as Dumbledore is excellent. Also, the world looks pretty much what one would think of when visualizing the book. Hogwarts especially looks great, and is full of mystery and life.The movie of course has to cut out some parts of the book, and I have no complaints concerning that. It sticks to all the main things very well, and the story is compelling and fun. Also, it manages to convey the light-heartedness and comedy that the books are full of. The acting is a little spotty, but then again, we're dealing with young kids here, and I'm sure that will improve as the series goes on.Sorcerer's Stone is full of adventure, comedy, danger, and magic, and is entertaining and fun.",7,0,2,17 November 2005
