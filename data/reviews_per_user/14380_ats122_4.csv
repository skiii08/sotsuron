Requiem for a Dream," A beautiful yet disturbing masterpiece
","I think we're all sick of being told that drugs are bad and you shouldn't do them.  That's why it's my opinion that Requiem for a Dream should be shown to all high-school kids rather than those corny, 80's specials.  This would frighten even the most hardcore herion-addicts, never mind a pimple-covered pubescent.Seriously though, Requiem for a dream is not just another anti-drug movie. If thats all you see then you're missing the big picture.  It illustrates the similarities between heroin addiciton and weight-loss, coke and sexual desire.  That's why the movie is so disturbing, because it shows that these problems are one in the same.  Someone like me would like to think that these junkies are so different than us and that that would never happen to us, but this movie shows how easily I could be just like them.This movie features beautiful directing using split-screen shots, eerie blue lighting, and overall excellent cinematography.  It also has the best original score I've ever seen (or heard?)  Clint Mansell's dramatic and powerful music adds so much more intensity to the screen that by the end of climax the viewer is left breathless.Truly an excellent movie on all accounts and I look forward to seeing more work from this extremely talented director. And a must-see for those planning on being drug-addicts in the near future",10,0,1,17 November 2001
Hereditary," A New Classic Horror
","This was fantastic. I had to keep pausing it to catch my breath. Toni Collette is terrific (as well as the rest of the cast - always love to see Ann Dowd). The tension is increased as the plot twists its broken bottle deeper and deeper into your mind until it's hard to breathe and imposssible to look away. As always it's easy to say that any movie isn't scary - it's the audiences job to be in the right head space in order to put themselves in a state of vulnerability so they can appreciate the terror that the film is supposed to create.Put yourself in the right frame of mind to be scared, grab some popcorn and keep the light on.",10,2,4,24 February 2019
Cast Away," This movie should be 'Cast Away'
","This movie should be cast away because it sucks! I have never seen such a long commercial for Fed ex as this. It's two and a half hours of tripe.  The plane crash scene is well shot and I really liked the part where he's deserted and stuff but the rest is long and excruciatingly boring. Tommy, my son, do something worthwhile like deserting yourself on an island for 4 years if your going to put yourself in another migraine-initiater like this one. Sorry, i didn't mean to be to negative imdb but this movie is kind of crappy.",5,0,2,25 February 2002
Titanic," Forget the Leo factor, this movie just wasn't very good.
","Titanic goes down in history (forgive the wording) as one of the most overrated movies of all time.  The fact that Leo is in it and what effect that has on imdb voter's opinions is neither here nor there, the movie just stunk. The acting is mediocre, the direction second-rate and the special effects? Who cares about special effects these days. Not me for one. Story isn't everything, and I know that. Dialogue, cinematography, lighting, art direction etc. should all be taken into account but when a story is this infantile its easy to overlook these aspects of the picture, and I think that's where Titanic falls short. It's hard to give any movie a fair rating when its given this much hype but all hype aside and all prejudice aside i would honestly give this picture a 4 out of ten. and that's being kind for fear of being labeled as a 'Leo-hater.'",Null,2,4,8 September 2002
