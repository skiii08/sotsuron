Mission: Impossible III," The weak link of the MI series
","A spy story turns into a revenge drama.Drawn out endlessly.All the brilliant action scenes, and all the twists and turns of the plot are over-shadowed by the insipidity of the overall plot of revenge of a super-villain on a dedicated spy who dares to cross him and 'arrest' him.Of all the movies in the series, this third part is the 'weak link'.Maybe if you see the movie as an attempt to highlight how fragile the social life of a spy is ?! And the consequences of keeping his 'social relations', in the shadows and out of bounds, and out of his own life ?!If that is the point, it has not been projected properly to appeal to the audience's sensibilities.",2,0,3,30 December 2014
