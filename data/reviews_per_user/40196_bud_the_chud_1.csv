The Ring," made in america
","well then. i dont know why this flick gets so much love. i saw a preview and i have seen the original. the reamke is very very bad and horribly dumbed down and cliche. the kid is taking straight outta the sixth sense. they interject lots of pointless and stupid stupid humor. everything that made the original work and made it creepy, was handled so poorly in this new one. seriously people, skip this and any other american remake of a good movie. the pattern seems to me that americanized means 'dumber' being an american i think its pretty said. we arent a nation of idiots that need to be lead from plot point to plot point and have everyting explained to us very very slowly? arent we?",1,0,2,15 October 2002
