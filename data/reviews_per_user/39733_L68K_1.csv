Requiem for a Dream," ONE OF MY FAVORITES
","This movie from start to finish intrigued me! the cast is just phenomenal! The gritty way it was shot, ellen burstyn and jennifer connelly's performances. It is a definite must see! SPOILER! If you like movies with nice endings this picture is not for you! Very depressing ending yet absolutely accurate. Also for a laugh count how many time ellen burstyn's character 'SARA' says 'red dress' I personally lost count after a while. Jared leto, who i don't usually care for was really good as well. The only casting i think they messed up on was casting marlon wayons as harry's drug partner. I like marlon but i think he should stick to what he is good at and thats comedy.",10,0,1,23 August 2004
