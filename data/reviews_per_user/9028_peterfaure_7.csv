Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning and thought provoking, but not flawless
","So, I didn't expect much from this sequel when it was announced, but since the original 'Blade Runner' is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made (if not the greatest), I had to see it anyways. As I often do, I didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers before going.So, where do we start... While not perfect, and inferior to the original, this is still a great movie. Visually it's simply stunning and the actors are all excellent. Just as importantly, or maybe even more so, like the original it combines a slow pace and fantastic ambiance to create an introspective mood and invite reflection on some important themes and issues of our time. (although, maybe, lacking a dialogue with the same power as the Roy Batty monologue at the end of the first movie).As some negative reviewers said, it is slow..... but that works well with the story and its intent to create a very clear, pervasive mood rather than to dazzle with dumb car chases, gunfights, or explosions,not to mention pushing the viewer to form his own opinions. The boringpart is subjective: for viewers who like to be challenged intellectually I'd say many action movies are a lot more boring. Nothing wrong with escapist movies, which I also enjoy when I'm in the right mood, but it doesn't change the fact that they're inherently much more predictable, superficial and formulaic. In other words, entertaining but intellectually boring. Regarding Blade Runner 2049, one disappointment, though, to be honest, was the soundtrack: aside from being too loud, it really consists mostly of weird sounds/noises etc. While they do heighten the mood at times, or fit the atmosphere, they are not really not up to the lofty standards of the photography, the action, or the direction.Also, the plot could have been a little tighter, and while the slow pace is what this movie needed, I'm not convinced it really had to be this long (or to touch on so many themes, as it does). Still, it's a fantastic, and unique, viewing experience, and even with its imperfections it does create a believable (if gloomy and depressing) dystopian vision of the future, and touches on themes that could spark endless debate and reflection. And herein lies its beauty: shallow popcorn movies will have faded from everybody's memory in weeks. A movie like Blade Runner 2049 will inspire us and challenge us,whether we agree with some of its vision or not, maybe even whether we love it or hate it, for years to come.",9,338,684,16 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Poorly written garbage
","Well, the movies starts off well with a touching tribute to Stan Lee.....
It's just about all downhill form there. Marvel seems mostly interested in making specific audiences happy these days, and in this movie it's about women of course.
To be fair the whole 'empowering women' theme is not too in your face (although it's a little disturbing that pretty much all the male characters are either villains or idiots, like a completely out of character Nick Fury now turned stooge and comic relief for the powerful amazon from outer space)....
But really it's just a poorly written script (one chase after another with no real character building or sophistication), and a poorly acted movie (especially by Brie Larsen, who walks around with a perennially dazed expression probably meaning that she still doesn't really get what kind of character she's supposed to portray).
In conclusion there really wasn't much in this movie, aside from the usual CGI eye candy, and I wish they had used more from the comic books (which had way better stories than this mess.....).",4,10,17,20 March 2019
Watchmen," A Masterpiece of modern cinematography
","In a nutshell, one of the best movies ever made, if not the best.Based on Alan Moore's awe-inspiring graphic novel of the same title, the movie does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the book, paying attention to the tiniest details and using the book as a storyboard that allows the pages to come alive on the screen and transport, for the duration of the film, to a a darker but fascinating alternate reality while looking at history that never was but, perhaps, could have been.The movie opens up with a mystery, and the tension keeps building as we meet a diverse cast of characters, enjoy spectacularly filmed, breath-taking sequences, and slowly other mysteries and unanswered questions turn the movie into a mesmerizing Chinese puzzle box in which everything, and I mean everything, can assume different shades of meaning that might at first appear isolated but really are always connected to the main themes of the movie, at times in ways we'll only recognize later on as we solve parts of the puzzle. The action sequences are fantastic, original and superbly choreographed, but often take a back seat to the depth of character development (often touching but never clichéd) and grander themes that challenge us to ponder mysteries like; time, the corruption brought on by power (who watches the watchmen?) love and the nature of life itself.A great director, a beautiful soundtrack, inspired performances by all the actors (special kudos to the man under the Rorsharch mask) and creative, stunning cinematography come together to bring to the screen one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking stories ever written.Any film lover will count it among the best movies ever made, if you haven't seen it yet, enjoy it now, movies of this caliber are few and far between.",10,3,7,6 December 2011
Ender's Game," It could have been much better
","First of all let me mention that I read the book, people who haven't might get a different impression.So, having said that, I will give this movie a six only because of the acting and decent visuals. Overall, unfortunately, it falls well short of the high standards set by the book.The pacing is uneven throughout, random snippets from the novel appear without any real context to give them any emotional resonance, and important moments are rushed, or poorly thought out. The direction is pretty much mailed in, a stodgy, discouraged, trite affair despite the overall stylishness of the designs and palettes (the few positives) Honestly, it goes by pretty fast, the visuals are pleasant, the story it's based on is interesting, so not a total waste of time if you just want to chill in a theater for a little while....However, if you are movie buff and expect a little more than average Hollywood fare than don't bother, this movie feels patchy, artificial, staged, it has no flow and no it has no real depth.Kudos to the actors for giving this hodge-podge of themes never fully explored at least a vague semblance of heart, but a pretty mediocre effort all considered, definitely below mediocrity in terms of script and direction.Once again, it could have been so much better.",6,1,4,5 November 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," a visually stunning anthem to pop culture
","There is something to be said for movies with a tight plot, a realistic approach to the material being filmed, and perhaps a clear message..., or for movies that make us think deeply about certain topics or situations... (as long as they don't devolve into drab, monotonous affairs)'Scott Pilgrim vs the World', however, has nothing to do with any of those movies, instead it embraces and combines decades of pop culture with a fresh, insouciant approach that never fails to dazzle and entertain from the first minute to the last.The recipe for this particular movie is pretty simple, one part video game, one part comic book (especially manga), one part adolescent comedy, and one part Honk Kong action movie. Add an array of visually stunning special effects, a generous amount of quirky jokes (that at times lovingly satirize the same pop culture the movie celebrates), time it to a steady beat of very enjoyable rock and pop songs, frame it all with creative, well above average camera work and you'll have a final product that plays like a breezy, silly romp through not only pop culture but also the subconscious of generation X survivors.While other visually stunning movies, for instance Avatar, add a ponderous, clichéd, predictable morale, fortunately nothing of the sort interferes with the sheer, mindless fun of this amazing pop opera.Now, it's true that this movie would probably look like an artifact from some distant alien civilization to people in their fifties or older, but I'm in my early forties myself and I could relate to all its elements, as I grew up enjoying all of them, and watching this film was a fun re-visitation of themes that accompanied my childhood, adolescence and maybe even early adulthood, adding a bittersweet element of nostalgia to the viewing experience. Kids still immersed in present pop culture obviously will not experience that, but I seriously doubt they'll fail to enjoy it, as it brings together so many themes they will be easily able to recognize..'Scott Pilgrim' is not for people who somehow managed to grow up unaffected by pop culture, or high brow connoisseurs that want more than fun from films...... but if the elements of the recipe hold any attraction for you this gem of a movie will surprise you, thrill you and amuse you like few others ever do.",10,4,9,12 January 2011
Annihilation," How to butcher a great novel in less than two hours
","So I will keep this review short.
The movie is overall entertaining, as long as you don't mind a slow pace and prefer suspense over mindless action. It also touches on interesting topics and creates undeniable tension. Overall, more Blade Runner than Star Wars (very different from both in terms of plot though), but I mean it as a compliment.
However, when compared to the novel it was based on (and it's worth noting that the novel was the first in a trilogy rather than the standalone story this movie appears to be), well, it's really just a colossal disappointment.
Some of the elements of the novel are present (the main characters, the shimmer, the lighthouse) but the movie completely changes all of those elements to make them fit a much shorter story that is nothing but a shadow of the novel, considered one of the best SF novels of the last few decades.
I can't go into details without spoiling both the movie and the novel, but let's just say that the movie failed to convey any of the beauty of the novel, cheapened and simplified all the characters and the plot, and really missed on some of the key elements of the novel, elements that made it unique in SF literature.
Comparing this movie to the novel, in fact, is like comparing a light bulb to the sun. 
If you like to read, do yourself a favor and read the novel instead of wasting two hours in a movie theater.",5,6,14,12 March 2018
Donnie Darko," great movie
","Unfortunately kept out of theaters because of 9/11 but later on it has become a cult movie, with good reason.Without giving away much of the story, Donnie Darko is a kid affected by schizophrenia.... but the movie soon turns into a metaphysical thriller where it's hard to distinguish reality from the distorted perception of the protagonist.Donnie Darko often wanders at night, led by hallucinations, and on one of those nights a mysterious man in a black rabbit suit warns him that the world will end in 24 days.... Is the world gonna end? Is he just crazy? Are there other mysterious forces at work? Those are just some of the many interesting questions we seek an answer for, while meditating on our own perception of reality and time.A very original story, great performances, an awesome 80s soundtrack and great direction in this masterpiece of modern cinematography.",10,0,2,21 September 2012
