The Blair Witch Project," If you go out in the woods today, you'll get a BIG SURPRISE...
","'Blair Witch Project' has come under a lot of heavy criticism for its many shortcomings, for its over-hyped/overcooked viral marketing campaign, and for its length (some critics seem to think it would have been much better as a 30 minute short subject). Many of these criticisms have merit. However, once I saw it (on VHS, long after the hype had died down), I enjoyed it quite a bit. The fact that I first saw it on VHS, on my living room television, may have had much to do with my positive reaction to it. Even though it is mostly set in the woods of Maryland, BWP's tiny cast and rough, grainy, under-lit feel lend it a curiously intimate quality, as of a ghost story told around a campfire at night...and I think this quality comes across better in a dark, silent living room than a large movie theater with dozens-to-hundreds of people in the place with you. I also think the grainy, cheap, hand-held feel translates better on the small screen. It's better than it deserves to be...you might think of it as one of those 'accidents' of film making like the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. In fact, I am pretty sure that the editors and the choices they made were what 'saved' this film from obscurity. Many slick film makers have tried to duplicate TCM, including its director, and no one has ever completely succeeded. I think the same is true here...the film makers got lucky and they knew it. Mostly, I think I enjoy BWP because I have a understand the true impact of the phenomenon that rangers and outdoors-men refer to as 'woods shock' - the devastating impact of being REALLY LOST in the woods. Modern urban dwellers can easily underestimate this impact and dismiss it because we've never been truly 'lost' in our lives. But many fit, experienced hikers and campers actually given up, laid down, and died from the stress of being lost in the North American forests and mountain ranges, often less than a day's hike from civilization and with supplies and rations still in their packs. The original meaning of the term 'bewilder' is to take someone out in the woods and get them lost, and leave them there...and it was first coined hundreds of years ago, by people who were much more comfortable in forests than we are now. So I think the basic story idea, of three callow film students going for a 'simple', ordinary overnight trip into the woods and stumbling into disaster makes for compelling viewing if it is handled right...and I feel that BWP use of the plot device of hand-held cameras (documenting their growing unease, bewilderment, and finally hopeless terror), is a brilliant stroke that sidesteps the issues of slick production work , professional sound work, 'good' acting, etc.Yes, there are some contrived elements that don't hold up to serious examination (especially the 'editting' of the film found in the cameras, which is much more 'dramatically apt' than a simple presentation of what happened), but that's true of almost any ghost story or horror story told around a campfire at night ('And there, on the handle...was a HOOK!!!', etc. 'Like, I am sooooo sure...'). But I found the casts' reactions to their growing predicament credible and enjoyed the way the plot kept turning the screws on them tighter and tighter. And while the payoff may have been annoyingly ambiguous, jumbled, and hard to decipher, it was plain that something Very Bad Indeed had happened to the film students. The glimpses provided of the walls of the house where everything comes to an end are the materials for good old fashioned nightmare fuel. What WERE those markings on the walls??? While the followup sequel was an unmitigated cinematic disaster, BWP succeeds as a nasty little ghost story and can be enjoyed on those terms.",7,0,2,7 January 2006
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Shades of Uwe Boll...!!!
","It must be obvious to even fans of the 1st Resident Evil movie (which I actually enjoyed...loved the 'shot gun cocking' ending) that at this point Anderson is just stringing set pieces and cinematic rip-offs together instead of actually writing a screen play or even bothering to construct a story line that makes sense. He's still got too much moxie to be the next Uwe Boll, but he's definitely heading in that direction.I don't ask for a lot in my action horror thrillers, but I ask that the actions the characters take and their decisions make some kind of sense (at least in the context of the screenplay),and RE 4 is even longer on atmosphere and short on sense than the 2nd one.-I still don't understand what Umbrella corporation's business model is supposed to be if there are no governments or corporations left to sell the damned T-virus to or what the point is of ruling the world if they can't go outside.<ul><li>I still don't understand why Alice decides to sacrifice her entire army of superpowered clones in a direct assault on an Umbrella stronghold when it's obvious they would be 100 times more effective as a group running a guerrilla war, rescuing survivors, taking out entire cities worth of unarmed zombies with little difficulty. They could, if fact, save the world and take care of Umbrella almost as an afterthought once they had taken back enough of it. (Hell Umbrella might actually cooperate once they realized they had paying customers again.) </li></ul><ul><li>And I still don't understand why Umbrella let Claire go AFTER they'd captured her and slapped the memory-sapping device on her. I know she's there to lead Alice to the next part of the plot, but a big banner on the beach would have done the same thing. Yeah, I know, it's because they're EVIL, but it makes no sense to have Clare wondering around free to get her memory back once Alice removes the device.</li></ul>There's more, of course, but I won't beat that dead horse. Instead I'll mention that Milla is still hot, and she has a sensitive, expressive countenance that supplies a badly needed human context to all the nihilism and wreckage the movie dishes out...but she still reads her lines and voice overs as if she saw them for the first time on a teleprompter. Some of the supporting cast are somewhat better, but since the characters are all blank ciphers, there isn't much they can do to distinguish themselves in my mind in the limited space they have on screen.Also, I realize the big fight scene with Wesker is meant to be a 'call out' to the fight with Agent Smith in 'The Matrix', but slo-mo bullet-time has been a cliché for years now, and the fight has none of the verve and intensity of the first Matrix - it just comes off as Anderson saying 'Gee, I thought The Matrix was really neat.' Worth seeing once if you are idly curious about what supposedly happens next in the RE saga, plus odd moments of visual interest and energy (Anderson isn't entirely without talent, after all).",5,0,1,16 February 2012
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Both less AND more impressive than my nostalgic childhood memories of it
","I have to admit, next to mythical, archetypal blockbusters like 'Bambi' and 'Snow White', 'Dalmations' comes off as a something of a lightweight. Seeing it for the first time in 30 years, I was startled by how much looser and rougher the animation was than my childhood memories; I was also somewhat disappointed to discover that only 4 or 5 of the legion of Dalmation puppies had any personality or even any speaking parts. And a few of the plot elements seem kind of 'squirelly' to my adult sensibilities - (the young couple can barely make ends meet but they have a live-in cook and maid? Roger makes it big with a song that opens him for the biggest no-contest defamation suit in the history of England?)But I don't really care. The movie won my adult heart all over again with its charm, its sense of intimacy, and a thousand little atmospheric touches, like the 'Twilight Bark' and the 'What's My Crime?' TV show and the way Cruella De Vil slammed her car down the lanes and around corners like a woman possessed. The directors and animators were obviously forced to take shortcuts and economy measures (due in part to the sheer number of puppies on the screen at some points) with both the artistic process and with the plot in order to meet the budgetary guidelines of the 'new era' of animation. Even so, you can tell they labored mightily to create a mood, an atmosphere, of a world seen from a canine point of view, even down to camera angles, sound design and character design. (Cruella, for instance is too physically ugly to actually exist, even as a cartoon character, unless you take Pongo's and Pertita's fear and loathing for her into account.)My conclusion: this may be a smaller, less lush and less epic Disney animation project, but it still reflects the utmost care and dedication of some very talented people, and it still holds up very well indeed to my grown up sensibilities. It was a great pleasure to see it again. 'Bambi' is still my all time reigning champ of animated movies, but 'Dalmations' in this context, could easily be thought of as Mickey Mantle to 'Bambi's' Babe Ruth. It's a classic whose likes we are not likely to see again.",8,6,6,27 October 2006
Underworld," Strong production values short-circuited by a script that gives the viewer no one to care about
","Right out of the gate, I will freely admit that Kate Beckinsale looks absolutely fabulous in this movie, and she almost carries the whole thing by herself. Plus, the art direction and sound design and cinematography are all top notch.However, the problem is the script and the story that the movie tries to tell. The script lacks any warmth or empathy and turns the movie into a cold, sterile exercise in attitude and pyrotechnics.The plot revolves around an ongoing secret race war between vampires and werewolves. But the whole movie seems set in a world where human beings barely exist. After the initial shootout in the train station, you never actually see another 'normal' human being aside from Speedman's character and his doctor friend. And Speedman isn't really 'normal', either - he's the genetic link between vamps and wolves. This gives the movie an airless, detached feel, with nothing to ground it in believability or reality. This was certainly a deliberate choice, but it has the unintended consequence of making the war irrelevant to my human perspective and concerns. Look at the Matrix films for a contrast - sure, there are superhuman fantasy forces on display in 'The Matrix', but you never lose contact or identification with the very human heroes contending with those forces.Similarly, except for the fact that the beautiful and sexy heroine is a vampire, the viewer is given no real reason to care which side should ultimately win the war. The werewolves are brutal, savage, and merciless; the vampires are decadent, self-involved, and fey, with their ranks divided by internal power struggles and treachery. Neither side is at all appealing except for the juvenile desire to identify with the biggest bad-*ss in the schoolyard.The so-called 'Romeo and Juliet' elements to the film which the promoters try to emphasize, and which supposedly drives the moral center of the film is barely there -it's a 'Bad Hemingway' version of a romance. As far as I can see, we are supposed to realize that the vampire 'Death Dealer' loves the human male because she doesn't kill him. There is practically no interaction between the two 'romantic leads' until the very end of the movie. They are a couple because the movie ASSERTS that they are a couple destined to be together, but we never see any compelling reason (or evidence) why this should be the case. And it really grates that the vampires get shredded so easily by the werewolves. I thought the vamps were supposed to be winning this war? What's the point of BEING a vampire if all you can do is survive long drops off a fourth story roof? Again, the movie looks great; if the story driving it had been even half as good, 'Underworld' might have been the big movie of summer 2003.",5,1,3,29 May 2005
Alien: Resurrection," They gave it a good try, but 'Resurrection' just doesn't work
","Part of the problem with Alien: Resurrection may be the sheer amount of time that has passed between the first one and this one, and the fact the Alien 3 was such a depressing downer. 20 years is a long time for a movie franchise, and there was no real reason to make another sequel; that they did it anyway betrays the audience's love and respect for the first two movies. 'Alien: Resurrection' probably looked good on paper: Get a good European director with great credentials (the guy who did 'City Of Lost Children') who might bring a fresh sensibility to the franchise and take it in a new direction; get Sigourney Weaver to reprise her role as Ripley; get some excellent character actors to back her up (Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman and Micheal Wincott are always interesting to watch no matter what they are doing), and give the characters lots of snark and dry gallows humor to keep the viewer happy between action scenes. But somehow the whole came out less than the sum of its parts I've watched this movie on cable a few times in the last few years, trying figure what went wrong. My conclusion: I think what screws things up is the pacing, the inability of the screenplay that to live up to the idea of a centuries long time lapse, and the portrayal of both the evil Corporation and the military as dim-witted, fumble fingered clods. Two whole centuries have supposedly passed since the last 'Alien', but apparently the only advances in technology since that movie have been in cloning. (Compare the differences in military technology and air travel between 1797 and 1997). That's a plain failure of imagination. And the Corporation scientists work for 200 years to be able to recreate Ripley and her alien egg, but once they have the aliens they are able to hold them for less than 24 hours before their security measure fail and the aliens infest the ship. That's a failure of respect for the shadowy figures who've been driving this plot's backstory for 20 years. And meanwhile the military has apparently degenerated from hard-core veteran Colonial Marines to a a bunch of wimps who can't handle a bunch of free lance traders on their home ground - and who cut and run the instant there is a problem on their space station. This is completely unlike Alien 1,2 and 3 where the Corporation goons are ruthless and powerful and oppressive in its power, and the military personnel are hard-nosed and ruthless xeno-killers who are simply outmatched. That's a failure of nerve, to have to portray the bad guys and soldiers as simps and wimps. IMO. these failures drain the movie of most of its potential gravitas. Instead of being horrified and angered by the sheer ruthlessness and sliminess of the 'suits' who throw away the human lives for a buck, or dismayed and frightened by the way tough veterans of dozens of campaigns were summarily dispatched, I was angered and irritated by their stupidity and thoughtlessness. In the movie's favor: the rag-tag crew of the Betty are fun to watch in action, and I think the screenwriter is at his best portraying their interaction with each other and Ripley, both before and after the crisis breaks out. Winona Ryder is (surprisingly) the least interesting actor here (not entirely her fault, given the nature of the character), but it was good to see her on-screen again, even in a place holder role like this one. The other problem is the visuals. The movie looked pretty good, but it just didn't have the punch and grandeur of the previous installments; it's as if the scale was simply too small. (Although Alien was pretty claustrophobic in spots, the 'Nostromo' seemed to go on for miles). Even though I didn't care for Fincher's oppressive visuals on Alien 3, they were at least as striking and memorable as Scott and Cameron's visions in 1 and 2...but visually, A:R is just another science fiction movie. At some point during the making of 'A:R', I am sure that the director and the producer knew that they had lost the chance to make a great movie in the labyrinth of collaboration and production choices that every movie entails. So they went ahead and put out a flawed one and hoped that no one would notice. Well, everyone noticed, and I'm pretty sure that there won't be another 'Alien'. It's probably just as well.",5,0,1,6 May 2007
Troy," Meant to be a blockbuster, but comes across as a TNT miniseries
","This is a very curious case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts. The supporting cast is very strong, the big stars do a creditable job, and there is great photography, wonderful sets and costumes, and soundtrack. but somehow it just doesn't have the impact of a major Hollywood movie. In spite of the big screen 'A' list production values, somehow this version of the Iliad looks as if it should have been done as a 2-5 part miniseries for one of the cable channels.I think part of the problem is the way the whole siege of Troy is chopped down so that somehow the whole thing seems to take maybe a week to 10 days, instead of the years and years of the original story. You get no sense of a lengthy siege, or of repeated skirmishes and ebbs and flows in the morale and effectiveness of the troops on each side. Instead you have the thrust for the capital, a counter attack that pushes the Greeks back, a bit of waiting, a skirmish where Achilles' friend dies, the duel between Achilles and Hector, and the actual incident with the Horse. And that's about it for the 'war'.Another part of the problem is Brad Pitt. The film chooses to play his character Achilles as a sullen, fey (in the 'doomed' sense of the word ) passive-aggressive battle Diva who only fights for people he respects (or likes) or for personal glory. I realize that a lot of the actual Iliad is spent with Achilles sulking in his tent and the Greek commanders trying to get him to come out and fight for them, but Pitt just isn't imposing enough a presence to justify all this fuss in the film. Yes, he's buff, but he isn't dangerous or legendary looking, just kind of weary and sullen and glum. (BTW I'm not a Pitt basher on principle - I thought he was hilarious and believable as the Gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champ in 'Snatch' and as Tyler Durden in 'Fight Club').Similarly, the director and the main actors all seem to choose to play their historical counterparts as limited, self-aware, troubled men who seem overburdened by the demands of their stations and of the war. The one exception is King Agamemmnon, who is a completely despicable one dimensional power monger. Oddly, he is also perhaps the most compelling figure in the movie - perhaps this is because Brian Cox is capable of playing some of the most menacing villains and bad guys in the history of film. (As good as Anthony Hopkins' version of Hannibal Lector was,Cox's was even better and more subtle). So possibly going for the 'human' dimension of the main characters in the Trojan war made the actual epic scale of the conflict shrink somewhat.One high point in the film is the early duel between Paris and Menelaus (Helen's cuckolded husband). Watching Brendon Gleeson play Menelaus as a huge, scary, burly warrior in a towering rage, it's hard to believe that this is the same actor who played the sad-sack hick sheriff in 'Lake Placid', or the amiable father who offers refuge to the lovers in '28 Days Later'. That's amazing range in a heavyset middle aged male actor. And Orlando Bloom keeps his ego out of the picture (this is the guy who played the invincible Elven warrior Legolas in LOTR, remember) and lets reality rule as Menelaus absolutely demolishes the smaller, younger Paris and sends him crawling to his brother for help. That, to me, was cool film making.I enjoyed the film quite a bit, and admired quite a few things about it, but nevertheless felt somewhat let down. But I'd watch it again, and probably enjoy it more, on the small screen.",7,0,2,1 May 2005
The Prestige," A beautiful period piece, nearly ruined by sloppy plotting
","If I were to judge this movie just on the quality of the acting and the beauty of the photography, costumes, set design, and even 90% of the dialog, this would get 9 stars. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to people who go to the movies to see a spectacular looking period piece. Jackman and Bale do superb jobs as the centerpieces of the film's story, the supporting case is dead on (including Michael Caine - which didn't surprise me - and David Bowie - which did).But the ambitious screenplay is so riddled with sloppy plotting and unfair plot devices that it almost sinks the film.I can appreciate the difficulty of what Nolan and Nolan are trying to pull off here, and I am familiar with the work of Christopher Priest (who wrote the novel the screenplay is based on). But, simply put, the screenplay cheats like a bastard. It promises us an amazingly clever game of cat-and-mouse between two gifted and obsessive geniuses. It promises us a dazzling resolution which will astound us with its deviousness and cause us to slap our foreheads in delight, because we 'should have seen it coming'. (Kind of like some of the old 'Columbo' episodes). ***GENERAL SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Instead it presents an out-of-left-field plot development that is completely unjustified by what went before, lies to us about the premises of another plot device that it then uses to drive the entire latter portion of the movie, and presents us with a couple of protagonists who are morally repellent and seemingly dumber than rocks.***DETAILED SPOILERS FOLLOW****I don't want to waste your time (and mine) detailing all the ways the screenplay fouls up, but I will mention a couple.1) If Angier is so devastated by his wife's death in the stage accident early in the movie (as a result of Bordon's 'carelessness' in tying the knots), and has such a need for vengeance, it seems to be that he ought to save at least SOME of his wrath for his friend Cutter, who designed the water tank in the first place. How hard would it have been to make one of the glass sides in the water tank thin enough (say, the one in the back that the audience couldn't see directly) so that it could be broken with one swing of a sledge in an emergency? How hard would it have been to TEST the tank when it was full to see how long it actually took to break it? For that matter, how hard would it have been to train Angier's wife to hold her breath for 3 minutes - a feat any stage magician and illusionist learns very early in his career? Any of these precautions would have saved the women's life when things went wrong, yet Angier blames Borden alone.2) Early on, trying to solve the puzzle of Borden's great trick 'The Transported Man', Angier and Cutter discard the possibility that Borden is using a look-a-like because Angier's new assistant claims that the 'double' also has mutilated fingers, and no double could duplicate Borden's mutilated fingers. That's not valid reasoning. Times back then were tough enough that people routinely mutilated themselves so they could pass as cripples to beg for money, and women prostituted themselves for small change. Plenty of people back then (and even now) would jump at the chance to trade two fingers for a steady income and financial security. OK, I'll buy it if the film insists...these are supposed to be the smartest guys in their field, after all...BUT: What do you know! It turns out that Borden not only uses a look-a-like after all, he has a TWIN who submitted to having his fingers mutilated! I got so angry when I saw this that I nearly walked out of the theater.That's cheating - it's not clever and magician-like at all....it's just the act of an obsessive creep who doesn't have the skill or the wit to live up to the art of deception and misdirection that is supposed to be the stage magician's reason for being. Most of all, it doesn't live up to the premise that drove the latter half of the screenplay - that he's not using a double because a double wouldn't have mutilated fingers.Similarly, Angier spends years and a fortune (where'd the money come from? The movie mostly shows us performances that end in disaster!) trying to solve Borden's 'Transported Man' trick...instead of actually simply trying to come up with a BETTER trick. The guy is supposed to be this 'brilliant' stage magician, and yet all he can do is copy another guy's act?? Does ANYone buy this? I've just scratched the surface here: Problems and psychological inconsistencies and morally repulsive actions riddle the movie from beginning to end...not the least of which ***BIG SPOILER FOLLOWS!**** is when the Nolan brothers choose to pull a freak science fiction plot device out of nowhere in what was an interesting period mystery piece and character study. Wait a minute - the whole premise of the film is the secrecy and mystery of illusion and stagecraft. To pull a trick off with HARD SCIENCE (no matter how impressive) is to basically say, 'Nope, these characters suck, and we aren't smart enough to make our premise work. Sorry, hope you like the new direction!!' If the acting weren't so good, if most of the dialog wasn't so spot on, if the movie didn't look so brilliant, I'd slam 'The Prestige' non stop to everyone I know. And yet I STILL like it enough to rank it as a '7' when the plot barely merits a '4'. As it is, I have to advise the first time viewer to suspend his critical thinking facilities and just drink in the mood.",7,4,8,11 November 2006
Ocean's Twelve," As you might expect, the followup doesn't measure up
","I'll open with what appears to be a cheap shot: Julia Roberts looked completely pale, frazzled, and worn out in this movie. She was looking a bit brittle and haggard in 'Ocean's 11', and the trend is far more advanced here. I could be wrong, but I don't think this was a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmakers, I think she's just looking used-up, and they couldn't disguise it. It's hard to believe how far downhill she's gone (at least in the superficial cosmetic sense) since her 'Pretty Woman' days. Since she's always gotten by on her dewy good looks and coltish ingénue charm, I can only hope for her sake that she's just going through a temporary rough patch. Or that she starts going for dramatic 'character' roles (like Jessica Lange) instead of romantic lead parts. I think putting her in front of the camera looking like this and passing her off as a 'glamour queen' could kill her career. Good luck, Julia, hope things work better for you soon. Take a couple of months and spend a few of your millions at a good health spa/ranch retreat, OK? On to the real comments about the actual movie: To tell the truth, I liked 'Ocean's 11' very much indeed...but I recognized that there was an elusive chemistry at work in the film, an inspired blend of clever plotting, cast chemistry, classy actors, cool jazz music and superb directorial timing and rhythm that might be hard to duplicate. So when I heard that a sequel was in the work, I wasn't sanguine about its chances for being up to the first one. But hey, 'X-Men 2' was also a sequel involving a huge cast, and IT turned out great, so...I have to report that lightning didn't strike twice. 'Ocean's 12', while reasonably watchable, has nowhere near the energy and fun of the original Soderbergh film. The thing about '11', was that it was essentially a fairy tale, a caper film where dashing, likable scoundrels went up against the odds and won the day by being slyer, smarter, and smoother under pressure than anyone could ever imagine...and lived happily ever after. Nearly every scene had our underdogs saying or doing something surprising, something delightful, something funny or hilarious, or being just plain cool.But the sequel takes a chance of going in a more realistic, downbeat direction. It shows our heroes not living so happily after all. It takes forever to get going and get the characters back together. It putzes around for several more scenes with no real forward progress after the basic dilemma has been established. It tests the viewers' patience with one false start after another as the bad guy from the first movie, the police, and a rival thief prove to be ahead of them at every turn. Instead of being delighted and dazzled by how cool they were, I was impatient for these guys to prove again what it was I liked about them the first time...and they just weren't doing it. And when the final plot twist is revealed, it turns out that most of the time our gang had things under control after all, but the viewer wasn't allowed to see the actual execution of the 'real' caper until the very end. In the first movie, Ocean's crew essentially kept pulling new stuff out of a seemingly bottomless bag of tricks...but they did it right in front of the audience. But in this case, the most important 'trick' is simply sloppy writing that cheats the audience. And BTW,it was a serious miscalculation to have Julia-Roberts-as-Tess her impersonate Julia-Roberts-the-celebrity part of a scam - it was a self-indulgent 'in-joke' that didn't work at all.In the message boards, one commenter astutely observed that, the real point of the the 2nd half of the movie was NOT to beat the rival art thief, it was to reunite Zeta-Jones' character with her father; once you realized this, some of the previous scenes made more sense. I'll buy that, but it doesn't change the fact that aside from a lingering shot of a back-pack sitting beside Pitt on a jet, and an inexplicable smirk on Pitt's face as he is led away in hand-cuffs, there is very little to clue the viewer about this development in the plot. The director and the screenwriter just didn't play fair. When you have this many talented actors together, something good is bound to leak through in spite of everything, and that is the case here. Some of the cast byplay is still fun and amusing. Zeta-Jones is a striking screen presence, and no time spent watching her on a movie screen is ever wasted. The rival art thief is the very embodiment of Continental cool and suaveness, and the sequence where he uses Capoeira to 'dance' through a laser maze is the visual highlight of the film (even if it seems like a shameless swipe from 'Entrapment').And while I missed the swinging cool tunes of the first movies sound track, I felt that the more jagged, rough edged techno stuff playing this time around was quite compelling and added quite a bit to the movie.This might be one of those movies that improves with repeated viewings. (like the 1st 'Star Trek' movie,'Kung Pow', and 'Hellraiser IV'). Since I know where the highlights are, I can sit patiently through the dull and irritating spots since I know that a good bit is coming up soon. I hope so,anyway.",5,1,2,24 November 2005
The Polar Express," This film means well, tries hard but misfires due to the extended length
","For the first 10 minutes this film is a delight. The filmmakers and animators must have worked themselves into a frazzle to get this amount of detail and style into the film - the human characters look as if they were both rotoscoped AND computer animated, and all the inanimate or inorganic elements of the film - the landscapes, the houses, the trees, the Polar Express itself - are dazzling. If the movie had been a 22 minute 'short' (a la 'Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown'), it would have been one of the all time classics of Christmas animation. Unfortunately, Zemeckis and company felt they needed to expand 'Polar Express' into a feature length movie, and the source material can't hold up to the extended length.Face it, one of the great strengths of the children's book this movie adapts is the brevity and economy of its literary style - supplemented by evocative fantasy visuals that augment, not replace, the poetic resonance of the carefully chosen words. But here, the writers have to add extra plot elements, characters and dialog to the basic 'text' to extend it to feature length, and they just don't have the ability to triple the content while maintaining the magic of the original source. It's as if the Hallmark Card composers tried to expand on the works of Robert Frost - they can ape the style, but they can't get the resonance or the heart. It's well meant and agreeable, but it somehow misses the point.It's also got Eddie Deezen doing one of the voices, which is always a minus for me. Deezen is still doing voice work after 20+ years in the business, so someone must like him, but all I can say for him is that he must be dependable and reliable...because he turns in his usual sinkhole of nasal suck. Sorry Eddie, I know you need the work, and it's nothing personal, but I hate you as an actor.Tom Hanks, on the other hand, is his usual splendid self, and it's largely due to his efforts that I can enjoy the thinned out content of the various over-extended sequences. He puts so much warmth and dry humor into the various characters he voices that it almost gets this film over...if not for him, I would rate this film much lower.Another problem: after a while, it is apparent that the animators are running out of ideas. For instance, they use a reverse 'zoom' pull back crane shot shot - that pulls back from a crowd to show the spectacle of hundreds of figures from an eagle eye view - way too much. It was sensational when it was used for the first time in 'Gone With The Wind', and it's great here the first time they use it, but after a while, you can tell they're doing it again and again because they don't know what else to do. And there are a lot of musical numbers and dance scenes (a la 'Shrek') that work fine at first, but really don't add anything to the story or the atmosphere. My favorite - the 'Hot Chocolate' scene - is typical; it's light hearted and kind of clever, but Disney and Pixar do this kind of thing much better, and they integrate the musical numbers into the plot better. And I hate to say it, but sometimes the art direction slips a bit and the gloriously life-like faces of the children and the train crew alarmingly devolve into the death-masks of soulless zombies. (This happens all the time in the cut-scenes for video-games). This is the peril of making computer animation as 'realistic' as possible - if every aspect of the production is not dead on, humans will look like the walking dead. This may be inevitable when you're doing a feature length animation , even when you are budgeted for 'state of the art', but it really detracts from the charm and sentimentality the movie is trying to instill.I only rate this as a '6', but it's a STRONG '6', and there is enough to enjoy about this movie (especially the railway travel and boarding sequences of the Express itself) that I will gladly watch it again with any 8 year olds in the TV room who insist on seeing it during Christmas vacation. And there are times when the visuals are gorgeous enough to make an adult 'BELIEVE' again, if only for a second.",6,25,49,27 November 2005
Suicide Squad," Kind of a slog at times, elements of interest.
","First things first: Jared Leto's supposedly controversial performance as the Joker? Not a big fan. To quote a friend, he's basically playing the role as a tweaker with a violent streak. Leto is OK in this, don't get me wrong, but he is not the reason to see the film. Leto is still a pro and a talented guy, so he's not the reason to skip the film, either. Is the movie worth your time? Well, I was a fan of Ostrander's original Suicide Squad run from the 90's, and for the film includes most of what made that series fun, including Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Boomerang and Killer Croc. And the 'new girl' Harley Quinn is pretty much done right also. So if being a fan of those characters is your main motivation to see the film, you'll probably be happy. On the other hand, it's too loud, too long, half the soundtrack choices don't work for me, and this was the wrong 'first mission' for the way the original Squad was conceived. Seriously, it's like watching a grimmer version of the original GhostBusters, crossed with Resident Evil. To me, Suicide Squad was always about politics, covert ops, super-villains perishing anonymously and uselessly in far-away lands, and snarky, cynical humor.Good to watch as a popcorn-munching Summer blockbuster to kill an afternoon.",6,1,4,30 August 2016
Ocean's Thirteen," Nice escapist summer fare - see it for the performances, don't think too hard about the plot
","The third 'Oceans' movie is something of a return to form after the irritating self indulgence and in-jokes of 'Ocean's Twelve'. It still isn't nearly as sharp as 'Ocean's Eleven', but I think there is enough good stuff here that fans of 'Eleven' will like 'Thirteen'. I find that I have to agree with the comments that you have to suspend belief and critical thinking to swallow either the plot or some of the character's reactions to certain plot events.Mostly, I enjoyed it for the way the actors inhabited their roles and for the glittering high polish portrayal of Las Vegas itself. For all his overexposure and tabloid hijinks, Brad Pitt can still make you forget all that when he is on screen; he shows why he is still worth the Big Bucks in this movie. 'Rusty' continues to be the coolest and most likable smug bastard in recent movie memory, with George Clooney's 'Danny Ocean' right behind him. And everyone here has just the right combination of savvy, cool, and likability.***mild spoiler*** I did have some trouble with the Damon/Barkin seduction scenes. Although the 'Sponder' character was delineated as a grade A, pure-dee 'bitch', it was a still bit troubling watching her get sandbagged by 'the Gilroy' gimmick. Yes, nothing actually happened, but really, there isn't that much functional difference using the Gilroy and slipping Rohypnol into her champagne. The movie loses a star for that little gaffe. ***end mild spoiler***The dialog also seems to be a little sharper this time around, and Soderberg made the right choice by returning the setting to Vegas and keeping it there ***mild spoiler*** except for a weird diversion to Mexico for several scenes that really only seemed to be there to give Casey Affleck and Scott Caan something to do. That cost the movie another star***end mild spoiler***I think what really puts the spark back into the story is that the feel is a little warmer this time around - the little kicker in the last 20 seconds of the film especially gave it just the right note. So, yes, I liked it. There's no way the plot could hold up to close examination, but there were so many great lines and character bits and beautiful shots of Vegas and cool musical cues that the movie won me over. I'll probably get all three Oceans' movie when the inevitably trilogy DVD pack comes out in a year or three, just for all the neat little moments scattered like gems throughout. If you like Brad Pitt, George Clooney, caper films, Vegas films, make it a point to seek this one out.",7,1,2,14 July 2007
The Italian Job," Slick, amusing caper film; Gray's best movie featuring Davis' best soundtrack
","My reaction to this remake of 'The Italian Job' is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence, my enjoyment of 'Italian Job' was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. Still, I picked it up used on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (though I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes. What initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple, textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. IJ opens with a sly, witty, pulsing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of ringing, chiming, pulsing soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started doing soundtracks for movies like 'Rumble Fish'. There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here, along with some pop song remakes that range from 'all right' to 'inspired'. For people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight. On to the movie: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he's okay here as the leading man, and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest 'major' actor in the film, but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in a bit part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to mostly be phoning it in (rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film), but he's still a natural even at 1/2 power. My one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character 'Wrench', who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be shoehorned into the movie, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the 'late walk on' nature of the character). If I were a cynical sort,I would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah, never happen...Production values, camera work, stunts, plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly (with the exception of the 'Wrench' character, see above). The dialog has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg proceeds to cold cock Norton with a right cross, and then asks him, 'Were you surprised??' Hmmm, maybe you had to be there...) Of course the movie requires a certain level of 'suspension of disbelief' to work, but if you just relax and go along with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater, or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop, etc), you'll have a fun ride. 'The Italian Job': it's lightweight summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else. It isn't good enough for an '8' but I'd give it a '7.5'.",7,58,87,11 December 2005
Van Helsing," It's not so much that it's a bad movie...there's just too bloody much of it.
","I looked up the entry for 'Too much of a good thing' in Wikipedia, and there was a promotional poster for 'Van Helsing' in the second tag.OK, not really. But after seeing the hammering this movie took from the critics, I had to 'see this marvel with mine own eyes!' (to quote Earthworm Jim) in order to see what could spark such enmity. And after sitting through 2 1/2 hours or more of roller-coaster plotting, thundering sound design, apocalyptic orchestral riffs and zillions of dollars worth of special effects and CGI, I had to say...that it's not so much that the movie is bad, as that exhausts the viewers' patience after an hour or so.The best metaphor I can come up with is to compare the movie to eating 3 boxes of 'Captain Crunch' at one sitting. Now, 'Captain Crunch' was one of my favorite breakfast cereals as a callow youth, and in fact I still like it immensely as an occasional treat. It is the very essence of the 'frosted sugar bomb' that kids love. And 'Van Helsing' is both vivid and crisp and shallow and delicious and cloying the way that a good 99% sugar breakfast food should be. But 'Captain Crunch' gets old fast if you have to eat it past your normal satiation point...and so does 'Van Helsing.' I loved the costumes and the character designs, and I thought the cast did a great job with the overwrought, overheated, overstuffed screenplay and I thought that maybe 70% of the CGI effects were reasonably convincing, and there were some very nice touches here and there that added a lot of punch to the movie (Sommers has been good at this kind of stuff ever since his remake of 'The Mummy')...but after about 90 minutes, I just wanted it to be over, while the movie still had an hour to go.The solution, of course, is to stop the DVD player every 30 minutes or so and get up, walk around, run an errand or two, then get back to the movie after 5-10 minutes and have at it again. THEN 'Van Helsing' becomes something you can enjoy. (This is similar to my experience with the first 'Star Trek' movie and 'Barry Lyndon' and 'Altered States'.) So yes, if you are a big fan of the old Universal monsters and you have some patience and you enjoy an approach that throws EVERYTHING Sommers can think of into the mix with a plot that jumps around like a bag full of angry ferrets, you'll probably get a bang out of 'Van Helsing'. Otherwise, just avoid it...it will probably irritate and exasperate you.",6,0,1,1 February 2006
Ender's Game," Beautiful and well acted, but oddly unengaging
","I'll start out by admitting that I started Card's novel, but gave up after the first 100 pages or so because I just couldn't get into it. Nothing against OSC - I thought his novelization of 'The Abyss' was wonderful - but the ideas and dialog left me cold. Having admitted that, I will also admit to finding my reaction to this movie adaptation puzzling - based on the visuals and Asa Butterfield's amazing acting job as Ender Wiggins, I should have loved it. But my enthusiasm for 'Ender's Game' was not unbounded, and I blame that on the same problems with the plot that I found in the novel, and on the fact that it was obvious that the film makers could only fit in a 'sketch' of the full story into the movie.For instance, I was never convinced that a pastime that was essentially 'Zero Gee Laser Tag' would have all that much to do with massive star fleet battles. Yes, it was fun to watch, and yes, I could see Ender's tactics in the game foreshadowing his tactics in the final invasion - but it seemed like a contrivance. (Ender's interaction with the tablet game as a precursor to the true intent of the Formics was far more convincing). And the whole 'newbie enters the Military academy' trope has been done to death already. And also, the plot twist about the final training exercise - while it did shake things up, it was essentially 'a dirty bit o' cheating' in my opinion, and left me completely unsatisfied. Just as Petra's role in the big battle was completely contrived - it was obvious that a voice command and an automated aiming system could have done her role far better. (Nothing against the actress, who was quite likable and sympathetic). Probably the movie should have been expanded to two parts to let the plot development 'breathe' and expand, but given what it cost to make and the flops of many of its expensive, high-tech contemporaries, I am sure the studio didn't dare. So it is what it is, and my reaction is what it is. Worth watching if you really liked the visuals in bombs like 'Valerian', 'Jupiter Rising', or 'John Carter' enough to overlook the writing problems. Harmless enough even if you didn't.",7,2,4,28 December 2017
Batman Begins," Bob Kane and Frank Miller would be proud
","I don't worry and obsess too much about 'superhero' flicks. I just expect them to suck and take what enjoyment I can from them. So the relatively high quality and watch-ability of 'Spider-Man' and 'X-Men' was a great surprise to me, since I had fully expected them both to be lame, camp, and stupid. But instead, both flicks were well made films with warmth, dignity and humor, as well as being pleasant tributes to the memories of decades of entertaining stories and the comic book creators who made them.'Batman Begins' continues this great tradition. It manages to include almost everything the fans love about the character and his alter ego - the cape, the gadgets, the Bat-Mobile (more of a Bat-Tank, but still), the urban backdrop, the disturbed and disturbing villains. And it does all this while still being a crackerjack movie - the quality of the production, the acting, the soundtrack and the cinematography are Sky high.What's really wonderful about this version of Batman is that there are some major Hollywood actors involved in this, but every one of them treats the material with gravitas and respect. But at the same time, no one chews the scenery or over-does the drama. Neeson and Caine are especially great in this respect. No one can instill dignity and humanity into a potentially silly or goofy scene like Neeson.(Hell, he almost saved 'Episode One' all by himself.) Here, he just punches the humanity and also 'larger than life' quality of the proceedings into the next level. And Micheal Caine is, well, Micheal Caine. He's effortlessly wonderful as Alfred, as good in his way as Micheal Gough was in the previous versions of the franchise.I think it is obvious that while Tim Burton is a wonderful, whacked out visionary (and God Bless him for it), Nolan is in fact a better director for this more naturalistic material.I was very pleased to learn that Christian Bale would be the new 'Batman' - after watching him in 'American Psycho' and in 'Equilibrium', I was pretty sure that he would have just the right qualities for the part - he's built like a brick, and he's got the 1000-yard stare and the 'lights are on, but nobody's home' qualities that the character demands. And man, he is good in this. Micheal Keaton is a wonderful actor, but Bale seems to have been BORN to play Batman.I can't give this a perfect '10', because it's a superhero flick, for crying out loud. I save '10' for stuff like 'Bambi' and 'Deliverance'. But this is really, really, really good.",8,8,12,18 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Four words to convince you to see it: 'Streisand does screwball comedy'
","I am of mixed minds when it comes to Barbra Streisand (see my long,involved screed about 'The Mirror Has Two Faces'), but I will readily admit two things in her favor: the woman can sing the *ss off of a Broadway show tune, and the woman can play screwball comedy to perfection. That's why I like 'Meet The Fockers' so much. Yes, the film is actually fairly sweet and sympathetic within its 'comedic farce' settings. Yes, Robert DeNiro is compelling yet funny as an ex-CIA man who is wrapped a little too tight. Yes, there are plenty of gross-out jokes, and plenty of silly word plays and puns on the Focker family name. Yes, Dustin Hoffman is great in a very broadly played role (watching his character practice Capoeira is a hoot). But the real pleasure here is watching Streisand do what she does best on screen: real screwball comedy. Not romantic comedy ('Mirror Has Two Faces', which was for fans only), not romantic drama ('A Star Is Born'), not all those other genres she tackled because she wanted to be Taken Seriously...but simple, funny comedy in which she puts aside her need to be regarded as A Great Beauty (30 Years Younger Than Her Real Age) and simply plays a somewhat dippy, marvelously warm and funny older mother. She is every bit of Hoffman's and DeNiro's match, and she almost totally overwhelms poor Stiller and the other female leads. She's great. She's funny. She's adorable. She's doing what she does best. The movie is worth seeing just to see her (and Hoffman) in action. If you are any kind of fan of her early, funny movies ('What's Up Doc?', 'Funny Girl'), you should check out 'Meet The Fockers'. You will find much to enjoy, along with a pretty fair family comedy.",7,2,4,12 November 2005
Ghost Rider," A bit lightweight for a film about 'Hell's Bounty Hunter'...but enjoyable
","I saw 'Ghost Rider' for $1.50 in a 2nd run movie theater matinée on a weekend afternoon, and found it a pleasant escape and diversion. Your mileage may vary.My feelings about 'Ghost Rider' may be somewhat influenced by the fact that I remember the original comic from the 70's. It featured a cool character design, a moving (if vaguely ridiculous) origin story...and a monthly series that ranged somewhere between awful and mediocre. (Nothing against the series writers and artists who had to work against that era's soul killing production deadlines and editorial constraints). Later revivals of the title and the character improved greatly in production quality and the ambition of the stories, but GR was always really nothing more than a 3rd tier character who only real asset was his striking design. (Seriously - a guy with a flaming skull, leather jacket and chains and a motorcycle made of fire - you can't get much cooler than that.) So I feel that, unlike 'Catwoman', 'FF', or 'Daredevil', the movie adaptation of 'Ghost Rider' was actually better in its conception and execution than the character enjoyed in the comics. It makes good use about what's most interesting and exciting about the character and tosses aside most of the dross that accumulated over 3 decades of well intentioned efforts to fill up pages and make money off the concept. The result is 90+ minutes of lightweight summer entertainment that works as long as you aren't feeling too harsh or critical. (Obviously, some of the reviewers here WERE feeling harsh and critical). No, it's not a great movie. Nicolas Cage is pretty much operating on autopilot here and there are plot holes and inconsistencies you could drive a flaming motorcycle through. But the movie is fairly funny where it means to be funny - the audience I saw it with laughed at the one-liners and so did I. Best of all, the special effects are appropriate to the storyline; they are exciting and dynamic and provide most of the entertainment value. Especially good (and the real reason to see the movie) is the live depiction of GR himself, which is 100% more convincing and better integrated into the film than was the depiction of the Hulk several years back. For me, watching GR ride a flaming motorcycle down the side of a skyscraper was just plain fun. I also thought that some of the supporting actors added a lot to the watch-ability of the film with spot on performances that suited the material perfectly. Especially good was the agent/friend 'Mack'; this actor was so good and so natural most people won't realize how good he really was. Also great was the actor who played Roxanne's driver; he handled several of the movie's lighter moments in a deft, pleasant way that significantly enhanced the scenes in which he appeared. Both these actors will probably go far in the next decade. Plus: Sam Elliot played Sam Elliot, as always, but I haven't ever tired of his macho cowboy schtick, and I probably won't.For uncritical superhero devotees, people looking for brainless diversion and fans of Cage and /or Eva Mendes. (I personally can't see a reason for all the fuss about this actress, but she isn't bad at all.)",7,1,2,5 May 2007
Grindhouse," The movie I *really* want to see is 'Machete'
","'Grindhouse' loses a little momentum in the 2nd half, but it's still a wonderful conceptual package. Rodriguez and Tarentino must have slaved away like mad bastards for months on end to get all the little details right, and the results show - this obviously a labor of love and a paean to the idea that the movies belong to the people, and the movies should make people happy. Yes, there is room (and a definite need) for 'art' in cinema...but stuff like this is equally valuable in its way.*spoilers follow*It seems to me that 'Planet Terror' is a stronger entry than 'Death Proof' because it just jumps right in and does the zombie thing and builds to a climax in a straightforward fashion. 'Death Proof' has real structure and momentum problems. It noodles around for a long time, has a horrific crash that kills all the sympathetic characters that we spent so much time with in the first half and then essentially starts all over again with a 2nd group of characters for what is almost an entirely different movie. It seems to me to be an awkward choice to spend so much time with the putative 'star' of the segment (Rosario Dawson) only to kill her off abruptly. Having her live through the experience and then hunt down Stuntman Mike with the new group in the latter part of the film would have been much more in keeping with 'grind-house' conventions. The other problem with 'Death Proof' is that the characters deflate the primal grind-house experience by by explicitly discussing films like 'Vanishing Point' and 'Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry' and how much they liked them. It seems to me that true 'grind-house' characters would no more be aware of the movies the directors wanted to emulate than fish would be aware of the water they swim in. (No one in 'Planet Terror' ever mentioned George Romero). The screenplay came off as an adaptation of a novel George Pelcanos, Jr. never got around to writing instead of a real exploitation flick done with modern production values and real acting. I love Pelecanos, and would love to see someone adapt 'King Suckerman' or 'Shoedog' to film....but that's not what this project was supposedly about. And while 'Planet Terror' is very much of a piece, 'Death Proof' seems to try to do too many things in the course of its story. It joins 'swinging chicks' and 'Hal Needham' films at the hip with a 'serial killer' film and then turns into 'Faster Pussy Cat! Kill! Kill!' at the end. That's not to say that there wasn't some great dialog and some wonderful performances...it just wasn't as much fun.*end of spoilers* The 'fake trailers' segments were a wonderful touch. I swear that watching Danny Trejo as 'Machete' for two minutes in the opening trailer was worth the cost of admission. Trejo is perhaps the scariest looking actor currently working. Watching him jump a motorcycle off a ramp while firing a handlebar mounted mini gun was both the silliest and most awesome thing I expect to see on screen this year. If Rodriguez actually makes 'Machete', I will be first in line to see it on opening night.",8,0,2,28 April 2007
Where Eagles Dare," The archetypal 'Mission Impossible' movie
","This adaptation of Alistair MacClean's action/adventure/spy movie is very nearly perfect. Amazing photography and scenery; a thundering brass laden sound-track; great casting and acting (even in the minor roles); great pacing; blistering action scenes; and a convoluted (but involving) plot...these all combine to make a very looong movie (it actually has an 'intermission', even in the VHS version) both exhausting and exhilarating.Yes, there are a bunch of 'oh suuurrre' moments scattered together throughout the movie. In fact, the whole last third of the screenplay where Burton and Eastwood shoot their way past half of the German army is just one such moment after another. Yes, some of the filmic conventions of the 60's jar a little bit on modern sensibilities (like the cars and trucks that instantly burst into flames as they tumble down hillsides and the fact that Burton 'speaks' perfect German in his plummy English accent). I don't care. The suspense builds and builds and builds until you think you are going to faint, and then all Hell breaks loose in a most cathartic manner, and the whole thing is concluded and wrapped up in a bow for the viewer in the final scene that is still, to me, one of the most satisfying final 'twists' I have seen in 30 years. (The actor who plays the traitorous 'Colonel Turner', absolutely rocks in the final scene. I hope the guy who played him made a million dollars and is living the good life somewhere warm!) I pulled this down (in VHS form) from my shelf on an obscure urge last night to see if it was a good as I remember, and boy, it sure was. The only close competition 'Where Eagles Dare' might have in this genre in 'The Guns Of Navarone', but as much as I admire Gregory Peck, this one is even better.",9,6,8,5 November 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Any serious fan of film should see Reservoir Dogs at least once
","Pro: First use of Tarentino's trademark non-linear narrative, which works so seamlessly you aren't even aware of how well he handled it until the story is over.Pro: Terse, snappy, epigrammatic dialog, seemingly more written for a stage play than a movie, filled with hard-boiled cynicism and gallows humor, but still utterly revealing of character and motivation. David Mamet only wishes he could integrate speeches this snappy into his movie screenplays.Pro: Picture perfect performances by Keitel, Buscemi and Tierney;an intermittently great job by Roth; an utterly weird but memorable performance by Madsen, who managed to deliver some utterly over-the-top lines in a believable affectless manner. (The one exception: the keynote line, 'Are you gonna bark, little dog, or are you gonna bite?' This is perhaps the most famous line in the movie, but really, it's also the worst line in the movie. Steve McQueen couldn't have made that line work, and Madsen can't make it work either.) Pro: Atmospheric and evocative soundtrack, especially the opening Ventures-like rockabilly song from the famous opening 'walking scene'. I don't even like most of these songs from the 70's (or 70's pop music in general), but they all work here.Con: It drags in a few spots, notably the scene with Penn, Madsen and Tierney as they welcome Madsen's character back from prison, and the heist planning scene with all the back-and-forth about assigned aliases. And as much as I admire what they were trying to do with Roth's extended 'anecdote', the story just didn't ring true. Roth reads it well, but the sequence simply goes on too long with too little grit or impact or telling detail. Since the whole point of the anecdote is to deliver the 'telling detail' so it rings true, the whole thing collapses on itself. It's so obviously a 'movie thing', when the same effect could have been achieved with a shorter, punchier aside from the character about how he smacked some cop around and made him cry, etc.Con: Chris Penn's performance is the weakest in the film, partially because the character he plays is something of an idiot and a thick- mouthed goomba. Penn is still a pro level actor, but he just isn't as sharp as the rest of the cast. And this was just about the point in his career when he started expanding like a balloon; it's hard to look at him now when you remember the wiry, vital,young Chris Penn and also know how how he ended up. (Rest In Peace, Chris). Con: Similarly, Tarantino insists on doing cameos to no good purpose in his own films, but he's not charismatic enough to merit the screen time - he's just odd and goofy looking, and he always comes across as an irritating geek. This may well be on purpose, and may be a self-deprecating in-joke on his part, but I can think of a dozen character actors who would have done his role much better - including the older, weathered-looking actor who played 'Mr. Blue', who had twice Tarentino's class as a screen actor, and should have been given twice as much to do. Con: And lets face it, the whole film is an exercise in hard-boiled outlaw machismo, and Steve McQueen (and Glen Ford and James Cagney and Jack Palance) did it better and did it first...which would have been readily apparent except for the clever story structure and the layered flashbacks.But still, I liked it a lot, and I feel it holds up well more than 10 years after its release. The film itself isn't all that much, but it was the right film for the time, and it made a lot of noise, and Tarantino has spring-boarded to other slicker projects that are a lot of good, irresponsible fun. This is definitely a must for the student and fan of Western pop culture. I would actually rate this something like a '7.49', but the rating system doesn't do half stars.",7,0,1,2 September 2006
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Kudos for the controversy of its themes, but Salo can't live up to its promises
","The friend who showed me this film wanted to share it because he thought it was 'the most disgusting' film he'd ever seen. He was anxious to see what someone else thought about it, given its reputation (or infamy). Well, I agree that it is disgusting and disturbing, but I mostly feel that 'Salo' is a well-meant waste of film.Just to be clear, I don't condemn or censure anyone for wanting to make more of this film than what it is. Everyone hopes that almost any 'arthouse' film they view will be a Life Changing Experience, or at least something enlivening and special. And 'Salo' certainly pushes all the right buttons.Other reviewers have gone on at length about the film's themes and plot; I appreciate the way they took the trouble to clarify issues, plot devices and characters that I missed or misunderstood in my one recent viewing of 'Salo'. For instance, I didn't quite process the fact that the four young men who were initially grabbed by the older thugs were later part of the oppressors, or that there were four younger prostitutes accompanying the four Madams - there were so many people milling around in various states of undress,and so many grainy, static long distance shots of bodies that it was hard to keep things straight. I certainly missed the aural cues regarding the ongoing Allied bombing raids that drove the action further and further into the depths of the villa. (This may have been due to the limitations of the laser disk format the movie was in). And since everything was in subtitles, I sometimes lost track of who was saying what and which character was the Duke, which the President, etc.I strongly agree that while 'Salo' may resemble a snuff film or a bad porno film in spots, it is not in fact, pornographic. The potentially sensationalistic violations, perversions,tortures and murders in the film are shot in static, grainy, 'cinema verite' documentary style with almost completely flattened affect - there are very few 'shocking' full screen close ups, no huge orchestral blasts on the soundtrack (only piano dirges), no lingering sensual shots of the violated bodies and orifices. In fact, the final round of tortures and murders are viewed from far away, through binoculars and a window, in complete silence.So it really seems to me that the director was relying on the sheer disturbing power of De Sade's ideas, plus the audiences' easy reflexive loathing of Fascism and things like pederasty and rape, to make the movie succeed - the sequences he shot were meant to simply serve as vehicles to invoking those emotions and reactions to VERY BAD THINGS that we already knew were bad. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the director's rage and disgust with humanity was obvious, and comes through loud and clear with every new scene. So in the end, in any discussion of the film's worth , the question should not be, 'Does 'Salo' successfully invoke the audiences' contempt and disgust for easy targets like De Sade and Fascism and the corrupt aristocracy of decadent cultures?' but rather, 'Does 'Salo' do anything worthwhile with the contempt and disgust it invokes?' I think it does not. Any decent noir film also carries the theme that 'People Are No Damned Good', and does it much better. 'Salo's' particular gimmick is that it invokes 'the Child Card' - because the victims are adolescents, somehow the moral outrage this engenders is supposed to ennoble the viewer. And easy reflexive outrage and disgust is the cheapest and most manipulative storytelling gimmick of all. (I will admit that the most disturbing part of the movie derives from the seeming apathy and even collaboration of many of the young victims. But even this is just the Stockholm Syndrome writ large). There are some reviewers who claim that part of the power of 'Salo' is that it indicts the audience for acting as voyeurs and participants of the proceedings, or sneers at the viewer for cowardice if he chooses to stop watching.This, to me, is simply a story teller's version of the old rhetorical trick of 'Seizing the Moral High Ground'. Because Pasolini is making a movie about something IMPORTANT, he wants you to think that the movie itself becomes the arbiter of the worth of your reaction to it. That is not the case, I assure you, any more than watching any of the Star Wars movies makes you a Jedi or a Sith Lord.A much more honest reaction to this gimmick is: 'Hey, YOU made the film, buddy, not me. It's YOUR obsessions up there on the screen, not mine. You spent hundreds/thousands of hours and thousands of dollars and the collaborative efforts of hundreds of people to put your vision on film. I'm just watching this thing to see what you have to say, and how well you say it. That doesn't make you my moral arbiter or superior, just a great project manager. So how good a story teller are you REALLY??' The answer, for Pasolini and 'Salo', is 'a lot shallower and less profound than the movie pretends'. So MY reaction to 'Salo' is,essentially, 'Meh!' It may be somewhat less emotionally manipulative than a Spielberg movie, but it is not nearly as complex or subtle or honest as many of its European film counterparts, even ones warning of the dangers of Fascism. It may be worth watching once, to see what the fuss is about, but it is not worth seeking out or going to any effort to acquire. You would be much better off to read someone like Hannah Arendt, or Susan Sontag, or Isiah Berlin if you want insights into the uglier sides of human nature, AND you don't have to watch people eat simulated human turds. No real purpose was ever served by watching people eat simulated human turds.",4,7,15,16 June 2005
The Departed," Simply the most gripping movie I've seen this year
","Not everything about 'The Departed' is perfect, but I don't care. I was absolutely knocked out by this movie. I'll put it this way: I have never been a real fan of Damon, DiCaprio or Mark Wahlberg, thinking that they were all somewhat-to-highly overrated. But not anymore. Given a real story, and real direction, they all jump off the screen in the best performances I've ever seen from any of them. (Wahlerg's part is relatively small but he is 100% better than anything else I've seen him in). I'm even ready to forgive Alec Baldwin for becoming a bloated self-parody; he's taken what he's become and used it to great effect here, and I can hardly wait to see what he does next.The darkness, the violence, the bad language and the bleak cynicism of the screenplay may make 'The Departed' a tough view for the average 'soccer mom' and Oprah follower; but anyone who appreciates complexity, ambiguity and genuine moral anguish in their movies will find this movie well worth their time.In addition to all this, Jack Nicholson seems to have physically transformed into actor Rip Torn for this role, which is great...because the only actor I would have preferred to Jack in this role would have BEEN Rip Torn.I never saw the original Hong Kong movie this is based on, so I can't say how it compares, but it doesn't matter. Scorcese has proved, once again, that he is still one of the greatest directors of our time.",9,2,4,18 November 2006
The Terminal," Wonderful character study and exercise in fantasy, undermined by a boneheaded plot device.
","**Minor Spoiler Below***I swear, if Spielberg wasn't Spielberg, and if people didn't walk in already set to praise this movie to the skies because it WAS by Stephen 'E.T./Jaws' Spielberg, people would roundly hate this movie and it would mark the end of his career as an important director. I have a hard time expressing just how much this movie irritated me on a story and plotting level. I kept telling myself, 'Relax, for God's sake. It's a FANTASY and a PARABLE about patience, waiting, and home, and also (again) about America and about one little man's attempt to persevere against the odds in the face of an uncaring bureaucracy.'I also kept telling myself,'Look, a lot of this movie is just an excuse to play out the half-baked notions any long distance traveler gets...what would it be like to actually stay in a huge place that is intended as nothing more than a waiting zone, that attempts to provide the comforts of home while at the same time being more sterile and impersonal than any home could ever be? How would you cope? How would you pass the time? What minor comforts and pleasures would you manage to finagle from a place of tiles, fast food, newsstands, vending machines, indoor/outdoor carpeting, vinyl seats and indifferent strangers? What would it be like to live like a mouse in the walls here? What hidden sanctuaries and hideyholes would you find as you explored?' And I kept reminding myself, 'Look, Tom Hanks is great in this. He's as appealing as usual in an ego-less noble 'Everyman' role. There's not a false note in his entire performance (although it's an easy role to play.) And Jones is fine, and hits just the right notes. And the supporting character actors are, well, whimsical and charming and wistful etc., just like they always are in a Spielberg fantasy setting. Hell, even Stanley Tucci, who I LOVE as a character actor is great, even if he plays an officious creep.'Nothing worked. I don't care if its a fantasy - there is NO WAY that even an officious bureaucrat would leave someone to starve (in a very public way) in the middle of a major metropolitan airport. Even if he was the most officious, rigid prick in the Western Hemisphere, one call to the N.Y.Times, the Wall Street Journal, '60 Minutes', etc from one of the many 'little people' that Hanks made friends with would bring such a sh*tstorm of public indignation down on Tucci that his career would be toast in 1 hour. And Tucci would know this. So he could put in 5 minutes of work and solve the problem 'under the table'. One call to the State Department asking to grant him asylum at the Embassy of a neutral nation...one temporary visa to a nearby airport hotel under house arrest,with an Air Marshall to keep an eye on him...one appeal to the Red Cross or the ACLU...ANYONE...could have resolved the problem and kept Hanks' character safe and comfortable (and out of the public eye) until they knew what to do with him. So the fact that not one of the 'little' folks that supposedly came to know and love Hanks ever made that one phone call to help him...that Tucci, whose very job depended on keeping things clean, safe, and orderly in his airport, couldn't make a judgment call based on decades of experience to assist an obviously harmless and inoffensive man...that kept grinding into my thinking like a stone in my shoe, and kept me from enjoying all the cutesy charming sentimentality that Spielberg was slathering on by the barge-load. Otherwise, it had some nice moments. I especially liked the dining scene between Hanks and Jones on the balcony pavilion overlooking the concourse. And I appreciated that Zeta-Jones eventually chose to resume her life with her former beau, which rang true to the choice a women in her position would almost certainly make for her own emtional survival. Otherwise, though...Spielberg,you SUCK.",6,2,5,23 October 2005
300," I liked the part where that one guy killed that other guy...
","As is true with all his recent output Miller's original graphic novel '300' was simultaneously impressive and awful. No matter what you may think of Miller (and his collaborator Lynn Varley), you have to admit that '300' was an amazing piece of design work. And the story line was so basic and simple, and yet compelling, that I could over look the sheer ugliness of the book and the clunking dialog and paper thin characters and just lose myself in the mayhem and madness contained between the covers. The movie pretty much follows suit. There are at least 1300 comments here about '300' and I doubt I can say anything better or more insightful than what is already here. So I'll just mention that I really liked the part where that one guy killed that other guy. And also the part where that one guy killed that other guy. But my favorite part was where that one guy killed that other guy and that bunch of guys killed those other guys. And also where they shoved the elephants backwards over the cliffs. 8 out of 10 for the sheer brilliance of the visuals and the sheer conviction with which they tell the story. Recommended for anyone who wants to see a movie where one bunch of guys kill another bunch of guys.",8,5,9,15 April 2007
Fantastic Four," Solid, well made superhero adventure,but lacks the 'epic' quality of X-Men or 'Spider-Man'
","To put things in perspective, imagine how you (as a fan of superhero themed movies) would have felt if there had been no 'Spider-Man 1 and 2' or 'X-Men 1 and 2', and this movie had come out in the long hiatus following the disastrous, embarrassing bombs that were 'Batman and Robin' and 'Superman IV: The Quest For Peace'. I am sure that you would have been delighted beyond all reckoning with the quality of the story, acting, and SFX in 'Fantastic Four'. Seriously, this is a well made movie with excellent acting, a decent story line, and reasonably satisfying sets, costumes and effects. I've followed the comic since its heyday with Lee and Kirby, and even picked up the two 'Ultimate Fantastic Four' collections (featuring modern day revamps of the characters free of 35+ years of Marvel continuity demands), and I felt that the movie did a respectable job of conveying the characters & family dynamics that are the heart of the FF storyline. So yes, it's a fine movie, and if X-Men and Spidey hadn't set the bar so high, this movie would have set the high water mark for all superhero efforts to follow. It certainly beats the kitty-litter out of 'Catwoman' and 'Daredevil'. (Although I liked 'Daredevil' just fine -say 6.5 out of 10.)How and where the does movie miss the leap to greatness? I think some of the problem lies in the size of the cast of characters and the scale of the story about them. 'Spidey' is essentially a tight little story about the hero's coming of age, involving a young man, the love of his life, and the supervillian that represents his mirror image. X-Men is about alienation and bigotry, and features half-a-dozen good mutants and half-a-dozen bad ones locked in an ideological struggle for the future of mankind, involving sprawling superhero firefights. But 'FF' is locked somewhere in between - it's about family and about four people and their nemesis (Doctor Doom). But they don't really have a REASON to be at odds other than the fact that Doom blames the 'FF' for his problems and wants revenge. Family dramas can be compelling and thrilling, but they are hardly ever grand scale epics, and they also tend to miss the intimacy of a character study of a single hero. The other problem is that someone already made a 'Fantastic Four' movie about the power of family, and it was called 'The Incredibles'. Pixar set the bar for that kind of story so high that a live action version of the same story inevitably has a kind of 'me too' quality that keeps it from classic status.As for the 'live' actors: I see a lot of grief being tossed Ioan Gruffudd's way for his relatively subdued performance as 'Mister Fantastic', but I would like to point out that this was a DELIBERATE CHOICE of the actor and the director, kept in sync with the idea of an introspective egghead scientist. If you pay attention, Gruffudd is actually an incredibly handsome man who dials his (undoubtedly enormous) ego down to allow the other male actors room to breath and shine on their own merits. I also have to say that the young actor who plays the hothead Human Torch is incredibly appealing on camera ad adds a lot to any scene he is in. The guy from 'The Shield' also does a good, solid job, especially acting under pounds and pounds of prosthetics and costume Since I am a straight male, it almost goes without saying that Jessica Alba seriously carbonates my hormones, but the makeup folks does appear to have overdone things a little bit with the skin bronzer. Whatever. So: a good enjoyable movie, which will go right on my shelf next to 'The Incredibles' when the DVD price drops under $15. But I will still watch 'The Incredibles' and 'X-Men' a lot more often.",6,0,1,8 October 2005
Sin City," Brilliantly designed, graphically superb,completely stupid
","The strength of 'Sin City' is also its biggest weakness as a film, and that is the fact that the Sin City graphic novels are horrible.Rodriguez and Miller pulled no punches here - every cuss word, every act of horrific violence, every sexual perversion and fetish, every hardboiled plot device that Miller put in the three 'Sin City' graphic novels that form the backbone of the movie - it's all here, undisguised and uncompromising. In fact, that's the most impressive aspect of the film - I wasn't sure anyone could manage to bring 'Marv' to life, or to duplicate the chiaroscuro silhouettes of many of the panels, or the hyper-violent choreography of the fights, or sound design that duplicated the onomatopoeia of the the comic form...much less make it convincing...but they do. The mind boggles at the creativity and inventiveness that must have gone into the design aspects of the film.So: Plus several stars for the startlingly faithful and evocative away Rodriguez (and Miller) brought the look and feel of Miller's 'Sin City' to the big screen. As an exercise in style, this baby is easily a '10'.Maybe even an '11'. On the other hand, subtract several stars for the fact that Miller has been writing like a complete spaz-bag since 'Robocop 2' (the movie) and 'Give Me Liberty' (the graphic novel). In fact, he has gone so far over the edge that I don't think he will ever manage to write a good story - or a line of dialog that doesn't clink like a lead washer on the sidewalk - again. For that matter, he seems to have stopped actually drawing as well, since the human figures in his latest books are just jumbled blobs of shape, color and texture. (Sin City #7, 'To Hell And Back' is his worst yet in that regard, and '300' is nearly unreadable.) And yes, I recognize these are deliberate choices Miller is making - I just think they are terrible choices. (Note that I'm not saying Miller himself is actually a bad person - he's just turning into a bad writer and artist). Seriously, the 'Sin City' stories read like endless variations and ripoffs of Dashiell Hammett's 'The Glass Key' and 'Red Harvest', only aimed at sexually frustrated 12 year olds obsessed with leather and death metal....but with less charm and wit. OK, I'll admit that 'Marv' gets off a few really good one-liners in the first one. But otherwise it's like chugging Worchestershire sauce - what is fine in small quantities will make you gag served as an unaccompanied main course. There are some talented and charismatic actors and actresses in here, and they all chew the scenery something fierce. I don't blame them - that's what is called for here, and everyone is appropriate to their role. Of the 'name' actors, Benecio Del Toro is the hardest for me to watch, since I like the guy a lot and he's so broadly overacting that it's hard to believe this is the same amazing actor from 'Way Of The Gun' and 'Traffic'. I am a big Fan of Clive Owen as well, but found him hard to take in his role as 'Dwight' here. That's not really his fault...it's because I hated 'The Big Fat Kill' story the most of the three graphic novels adapted here. ('A Dame To Kill For' is at least funny in spots, and 'That Yellow Bastard' is so revolting as to be actually fascinating. 'The Big Fat Kill' is so stupid as to make no sense whatsoever.)In summary: amazing looking movie, with a horrible, horrible script, but delivered with a lot of energy and conviction. The look and the conviction carry the day for me, but I can't rate it higher than a '7' because Miller needs to spend some time outside in the fresh air with a puppy and a kitten before he writes another graphic novel or screenplay. See it if you like Miller and you thought Robocop 2 was the ultimate movie. Or if you are (to quote Mike Nelson) a drunk, narcoleptic 8 year old. Or if you thought the trouble with Mickey Spillane's 'Mike Hammer' books was that he just didn't go far enough.",7,4,6,20 August 2006
