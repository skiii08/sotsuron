Requiem for a Dream," depressing.
","The movie definitely addresses an important issue, however, as a movie, it's too depressing.The story is very simple and quite predictable. The effects of the camera 'running' in front of Marlon Wayans' character, and the constant ticking and clicking to describe the hallucinations, are quite cool, but that doesn't make this film worth the time.I'm not going to be doing drugs after watching this film, but I'm not going to be watching films like this anymore either.",7,0,0,23 August 2001
