The Incredible Hulk," Watchable !
","My main problem whit this movie is that in a short time (in my personal opinion} two of them where released.Excellent crew mainly i mean Tim Roth and Edward Norton and also William Hurt,i was kind of let down by the fact that does stars that are more into drama/thriller based movies are in a comic-movie now.To be honest this version i mean 2008 is far better one for me then Ang Lee's one.Far more thrills and more action.I watched Marvel comic/movies this one is pretty decent.Me grading this movie 5 is simply because i feel that actors that i mentioned earlier are not for this type of movie.Last but not least i think that every comic-freak will enjoy this movie far more then me and they should.Regards:Ognjen Kisic",5,0,1,22 June 2011
