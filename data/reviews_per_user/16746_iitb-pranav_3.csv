Iron Man 3," Great technology imagination, awesome special effects and cool acting
","Human beings have always tried to see beyond the future. We extend our imagination beyond our limits. And when any movie offers a visual treat showing some of the best science fiction stuff, we just love to enjoy watching it. Isn't it? Iron Man 3 offers just the same. After Avengers thrilled our eyes, Iron Man 3 gives us a fabulous treat by taking the Iron man technology to the next level. Frankly, Iron man 2 didn't offer much of the variety in terms of entertainment. It felt like just continuation of Iron Man 1. But Iron Man 3 takes the suit to the next level and gives a completely different entertainment factor. Movie starts with glimpses of Stark's past that would establish its connection with the main story. Main story starts with the terror threats and series of bomb explosions executed by a terrorist named 'Mandarin'. Story also introduces in parallel a scientist working on human DNA upgrading. Tony is developing new versions of his Iron Man suit. Soon circumstances project Stark as a rival of Mandarin. Movie offers many unexpected turn of events and some eye-catching visual effects as it progresses. Some of the scenes like demolition of Stark's home, Stark rescuing people from plane crash and fight of Iron men army are unforgettable. RDJ is awesome as usual. It feels like he is not acting but he is Iron man himself. Among others, Sir Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic appearance. Though the role is short, it offers lots of shades in his characters. In all I would say, this is a must watch movie for fabulous special effects, awesomely eccentric RDJ, good story and a nice climax. Don't miss this one.",8,15,23,16 May 2013
Life of Pi," Eye-catching emotional journey!!
","Lot of movies have come on cast-aways or survival in difficult conditions. But Life of Pi definitely stands out differently than all of them. It not only gives an outstanding treat to your eyes but also some very touchy moments to your heart. Story starts in a bit off-beat and unanticipated way. Though initial part shown out of India creates some background for the main story, it becomes a bit lengthy after some time. That is exactly when director turns the plot skillfully to take the audience on an unimaginable journey. Ang Lee has done an excellent job in directing and story telling. He has brought out the best in all the actors as well as animals. Different eye-catching scenery has been mixed with the story beautifully. Some of the emotional interactions between Pi and the tiger are completely heart touching and unforgettable. All the actors, editors and supporting staff have done an excellent job creating this venture. Definitely 127 minutes worth spent...!!",9,2,5,30 November 2012
The Proposal," Interesting plot but common end
","The proposal is a light, romantic comedy with very interesting start but quite common climax. Story starts with corporate environment where you start expecting typical boss-subordinate story. With an interesting twist to the plot at the beginning where Margaret faces a threat of deportation, main plot starts. It creates great curiosity as to what would happen next. Further story follows through mix of some innovative parts and some anticipated parts. This movie is a nice and relaxing family drama that you can enjoy for two hours. On acting front, all the main characters do justice to their role. But none of them does a memorable job. Movie has some surprising, feel good type of twists that gives a nice feeling while enjoying the movie. Climax of the movie is very typical and it gives you a feeling of 'you know it already,. This is the part where movie doesn't stand up to your expectation and doesn't leave a permanent mark on your mind",7,0,1,11 May 2013
