Casablanca," Casablanca
","This film has elements of any great film, romance, action and suspense. The cast is just wonderful and they fit so well together. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick so well changing from the reserved night club owner into a man in love and willing to risk everything. Peter Lorre who is a fabulous character actor plays Ugarte so well, his character is endearing in a way but a the same time you are always worried what his next move will be in fear that it will endanger the characters. The slow build up of the suspense between the German soldiers and the patrons of the night club makes this movie one that you can't take your eyes off of. From the beginning scene in which Ugarte tells Rick that he has the transit papers I was on the edge of my seat. The scene in which Rick allows the French to sing their national anthem while the German soldiers are singing theirs is one of absolute triumph. The lighting throughout the film mimicked the feelings of the characters. During the scene in which there is tenderness between Rick and Illsa the lighting is soft and seems to frame their faces but in the scenes with suspense the lighting is much darker. It is no wonder that this film has gone down in history it is remarkable.",8,1,2,12 May 2010
Lifeboat," Lifeboat
","This film is interesting in many respects, the greatest of these is the setting of the film. The entire 97 minute film is shot on a small lifeboat. There are no shots of the characters in their former lives, the stories they tell are the only look back into their past. Saying this, each actor did a great job bringing their respective characters come to life, each one was vibrant and very much alive. The diversity of the cast added to the tension, which is felt quite strongly throughout the entire film. Other than the work of the actors, Hitchcock's use of the camera and special effects worked very well for them film as well. The constant rocking of the boat narrow shots never let the audience forget that the characters were stuck on that boat. At times shots faded into one another giving the impression that the days were dragging on and on. The combination of the directing and the acting made this film a very interesting psychological thriller.",6,4,5,27 April 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," the grapes of wrath
","As someone who has read John Steinbeck's novel this film is somewhat of a letdown. The book was so beautifully written that I expected the film to be equally as beautiful however, I was wrong. Although it did not compare to the book it was still a well made film. I find it difficult to match actors with the characters in the book however, Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, the hot head. Fonda did a great job of portraying his character as the common man and his performance allowed me to understand the way many individuals were feeling during that period of history. While the movie did leave out many important scenes that were included in the book the scenes included showed the struggles of the Americans that experienced the Dust Bowl. The scene where the Joad family is kicked off their land was quite emotional and a good depiction of the past. The setting of the film was very accurate to the book and the way the scenes were The shot of the family traveling to California were very well done. Using what seems to be a process shot of the landscape giving the impression that the vehicle is in motion. The shots of the landscape itself were breathtaking. While the film did portray every part of the film, it was still a moving piece of cinema.",4,2,6,12 May 2010
Fargo," Fargo
","I have only seen one other Coen Brothers film but after seeing it I am definitely intrigued and am going to see many more. The combination of comedy and crime was just perfect in this film, the directors balanced the comedy, violence and suspense very well. The movie was not predictable so while I had some idea of what might be coming up next, I was completely sure and it kept me entertained for the duration of the film. The acting done by the whole cast was great each character was extraordinarily normal. The each had their own oddities but also seemed like people that you might run into in your own town. This aided in the comedy relief which was necessary at certain point especially during the wood chipper scene. while it was quite alarming there was one moment that changed the whole scene. Frances McDormand's character is yelling to the man stuffing the body into the wood chipper and when he does look up she point to her hat with expression of shock that the man could be so dumb as to continue after he had noticed her. The camera work also captured my attention. The shots that panned across the desolate landscapes really gave me the feeling of being there. The sudden zooming on character's faces during pivotal scenes sucked me right into the movie and allowed to me to feel what they were feeling. I did not expect too much from this film at first but it really surprised me, I thought it was very well done.",7,0,0,11 May 2010
The Graduate," The graduate
","The Graduate did a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the 1960's from the point of view of the older and younger generations. This is shown perfectly at the start of the film which is the 'Welcome Home' for Ben, thrown by his parents. The use of the camera during that scene puts the audience in Ben's shoes and it feels as if you are at the party with him. While Ben is greeting his guests the camera whirls around to each one and remains on Ben's face as he tries his hardest to seem interested and excited. Dustin Hoffman does a fantastic job of being the nervous, unsure young man. His obvious tentativeness with Mrs. Robinson is endearing. Anne Bancroft is just amazing as well, she has a way of owning every scene that she is in and the combination of her strength on screen and Hoffman's naivety really makes the film.Masny interesting shots are used in the films as well. The setup of the camera inside the scuba mask when Ben is showing off the scuba gear for his guests is fantastic. The match cut shots which were used mostly during the affair between Ben and Mrs. Robinson portrayed Ben's double life and how inane his life seemed to be without her. One of the best scenes in the entire film is the last shot when Ben and Elaine are sitting on the bus. At firs the two are laughing and seem happy with their decision but as they sit there both of them seem to realize the repercussions. It brilliantly demonstrates the state of minds of much of world at that in time in history. Overall the film was just fantastic.",8,1,1,27 April 2010
Psycho," Psycho
","Psycho was the first of its kind in many respects, most notably would be the violence and sexuality that was shown in the film. The film opens with a shot of two lovers threw a hotel window then goes on show Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, changing in her hotel room and of course, the infinite shower scene which combines nudity with violence. Such violence had never been shown before in fact caused a great deal of terror within audiences and although film has certainly progressed in terms of the allowance of sexuality and violence this film is yet to seem outdated. In fact, any of the scenes the involve Norman Bates still terrify me. Hitchcock allows the interactions between Marion Crane and Norman Bates to unfold slowly and switches the camera's point of view back and forth between Norman's when he is observing Marion and the omniscient allowing the audience to watch Marion go about her business in the motel room this adds to the suspense during the entire beginning of the film. Anthony Perkins is outstanding in his role as Norman Bates and his mother of course. He plays his role so well that the audience fears and feels for him. He allows the audience to see the struggle between his wants and the control his mother still has over him. There is nothing bad I can say about this film it is fabulous in every aspect.",9,0,1,10 May 2010
