Resident Evil: Afterlife," Do not see..... If not in 3-D!
","Resident Evil Afterlife is an OK action flick. However those expecting something ground-breaking will be disappointed as it really isn't anything beyond your typical action movie. The effects are good, and in 3-D I'd bet they are even better. However, as I did not see the movie in 3-D, I cannot comment and therein lies my biggest argument with this movie. Its obvious to me that this entire movies appeal comes from the fact that its in 3-D and as a result, things like a solid storyline and good old original action sequences are seemingly sacrificed to put greater emphasis on the 3-D aspect. Because I only saw this movie in 2-D, its obvious I am missing out and that's disappointing. I feel like this whole '3-D' craze that's suddenly hit the film industry has led many movie creators to neglect the things that count in a film like a good storyline, and are instead more concerned with making sure the film has good 3-D effects. Resident Evil Afterlife is a prime example of this.The bottom line here is only see this movie in 3-D. Without the 3-D effect, you will be too drawn to how unoriginal and bland this film is. Don't expect an engaging storyline which draws you in either, instead just sit back in awe at the amazing 3-D effects. After all, that is apparently all they were concerned with when making this film.",4,0,1,12 October 2010
