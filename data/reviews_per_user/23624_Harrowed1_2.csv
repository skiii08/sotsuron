The Blair Witch Project," Worked for me...
","Now I've been debating this film with my friends for hours on end, so the general reaction here did not surprise me. I loved it. Some of my friends loved it. Most of them didn't care or hated it. And I understand why. *spoilers ahead*
Having been a major horror fan for more than 15 years, I expected very little positive as almost no movie has ever scared me even a little. I saw it at a theatre during the day (a very bleak winter day) and there were like five others in the salon. No one on my row or on the rows near me, i.e. I was alone in the dark...I loved the tense building for the horror, was more than a little creeped out by the tent scene and Josh's screaming. Not to mention when they find his teeth. I have almost never felt terror like when they  run in Parr's house and Mike stands in the corner...On my way home, the 'bugs' started to hit me. You dont run in panic through the woods with a camera in front of your eye etc, but I still had trouble sleeping at night the following week.I'm very glad it worked for me, but I do understand those who think it is rubbish. Everything depends on your mood, the surroundings etc when you see it. Watch it alone at night with headphones and you might get lucky, dont watch it during a boring Sunday afternoon...",Null,0,2,30 September 2002
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not all it could be.
","Well, I've seen worse, thats for sure. Beautiful sets, clothes and effects, but not really a horror movie. To say that the original story is 'scary' is perhaps a bit much but as one of the founders of modern horror, it's worth reading.The actors are good if not sterling in this movie, though there are several memorable scenes. It playes more like an erotic Victorian dream than any other Dracula I've seen. Not a bad 2 hours entertainment, but I'll give it no more than 6 out of ten, as I am a fan of the genre.",Null,0,1,30 September 2002
