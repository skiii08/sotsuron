Walk the Line," Walk the Line is the Best Picture of 2005
",This movie is wonderfully written and Directed. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are captivating and spellbound with each of their performances. I went to the theater 11 times to see this film. For both of them to actually do their own vocals and play instruments says a lot about them as actors. They both deserve the Oscar. I didn't know who Johhny Cash or June Carter-Cash was until I saw this movie. The film is layered and rich and even funny in places. Joaquin and Reese truly captured the heart and spirit of their characters. You leave the movie feeling good because one life touched another in such a way that it changed musical history. Should be best picture of the year!,10,2,4,17 February 2006
