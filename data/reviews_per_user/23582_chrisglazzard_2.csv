Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Was it always this bad
",I remember this being a cheesy & not the best film but it was enjoyable & that was 10/15 years ago maybe but I've just tried watching it again & i couldn't do it. I enjoy a bad film but this isn't meant to be bad it's meant to be star wars what happened I don't remember it being so bad like jar jar & the gungan are the worst characters I've ever seen on a tv screen & even Ewan McGregor can't even act in this film,6,0,0,14 June 2020
Resident Evil: Extinction," The best of the bunch
","Out of all 6 films this is easily the best one, It's got a good setting, Good cast with adding Ali larter as Claire & keeping oded fehr as Carlos.It has so much unnecessary violence it's fantastic, They don't make films like this any more.My only issue with this one is I feel they didn't do wesker justice & I don't feel they ever do in any of the films tbf",9,1,1,24 June 2020
