The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Great romantic/coming of age in the early 90s
","I may be biased as a Smiths fan, but this film definitely lived up to the John Hughes films of the 80s. A love story, if you will, to the era before we really lost it as a society. Finding the Smiths on a mixtape is a lost adolescent milestone for the marginalized. I am not an Emma Watson fan, but she nails the alt girl of the 90s. I love that Ann Veal (haha) was in it. I love that they talk about the old record store in Pittsburg, EIDE's. I took many many many roadtrips from Canton, OH there as a teenager (and then a Primanti Bros visit). Cinamatically, it reminds me of great films like 'Rules of Engagement' or 'American Beauty'. Definitely glad I finally gave it a watch.",8,0,2,30 January 2013
The Lives of Others," Humanity behind the iron curtain.
","I grew up hearing about the horrors of living in an Eastern Block country. The blandness of life, the constant looking over one's shoulder. The Trabant! I was always fascinated by the irony that Soviet Russia reacted to the fall of the 3rd Reich with a socialist mask upon their fascist faces. This movie was a wonderfully intimate look at the grim reality of the Iron Curtain, and the humanity that simmered under the surface eventually leading to the wall collapse. Reagan didn't bring the wall down, the people did.... and Roger Waters. ha-ha This was a compelling movie. I can see why Depp and Jolie fell in love with the director. I can only hope his next film is better than The Tourist.",8,5,6,26 May 2011
