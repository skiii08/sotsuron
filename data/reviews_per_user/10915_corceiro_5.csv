Ford v Ferrari," Great if you are a petrol head.
","Efficient and well made... and that's it. A simple and straight story with another 'American Hero' (maybe a couple of heros) and a lot of simplistic and a bit silly stereotypes. A bit childishly from my point of view, but ok if you are looking for a simple and easy to understand pic.",5,3,5,12 February 2020
Full Metal Jacket," I'm a huge Kubrick fan and this is not my favorite one
","'Full Metal Jacket' will always be judged by the shadow of previous Kubrick's movies. And that's why I think it could be much better. I watched it ten or more times and I always ask myself why Stanley Kubrick chosen this script. You can't forget that his previous movie was 'The Shining' back in 1980 and he was desperate for a good story (not a statement about Vietnam war) and this option came as a surprise for everyone in the industry. The movie is build around characters and there wasn't much space for the attention for that little tiny microscopic detail, so important to Kubrick's work, that's why I consider it an atypical movie in his directing career. That care for the visual detail would return with his final and baroque movie.",7,1,2,26 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A clever comedy.
","To fully understand the humor of this movie, it is absolutely necessary to know the pop culture of the era portrayed. It seems to me that many of the negative opinions read here originate from young people who do not know who Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate or even Steve McQueen was. There are a number of historical incongruities in the film, but they are not particularly important. In short, it's a clever comedy that will touch those who love Hollywood's golden age film culture.",8,2,4,29 December 2019
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Another pathetic movie.
","After years and years of special effects, we believed that this kind of tedious and commonplace exhibition no longer had space but after all we were mistaken.
I confess that it was with great effort that I kept awake until the end, dragging myself from fight to fight, from explosion to explosion. Even a beautiful model appears, always in high heels and impeccable hairstyle, despite all the destruction, demolitions of buildings and objects that explode around her.",2,1,2,30 August 2019
Goodfellas," What can I say? Watched it more than fifty times.
","One of my 'all time' favorite movies. Martin Scorsese did not win the Oscar for Best Director in 1991, the Academy preferred Kevin Costner for the kitsch 'Dances with Wolves'! 'Goodfellas' is one of those amazing art pieces where everything is perfect. Joe Pesci's character is iconic, the soundtrack is unexpected and effective, the way the story is told through the eyes of the camera is amazing (replicating the dominant spirit of the scene or each part of the narrative's main character).If you have not seen this movie, do it immediately. It's one of those movie masterpieces that deserve to stand next to 'Citizen Kane', 'Броненосец Потёмкин' ('Battleship Potemkin') or 'Ladri di biciclette' ('Bicycle Thieves'). For me it is one of the most well-told stories of the seventh art history, its apparent simplicity was born from the mind of his director.",10,0,0,26 May 2015
