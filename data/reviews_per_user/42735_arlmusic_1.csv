Hereditary," Oscar worthy performance by Toni Collette
","Refreshing to see a movie labeled a horror that didn't have a bunch of stupid teenagers doing stupid things and getting knocked off one by one in a plotless pointless storyline. This story is character driven and is somewhat quite harrowing in places. Toni Collette's performance is superb as her character spirals out of control, keeping audiences guessing if it's a mental breakdown or a supernatural entity causing her demented state and hallucinations. The pace is a bit slow to begin with but it works, as it builds up the tension gradually. Although movies like this are usually overlooked by the Oscars, it would be nice to see it in the running for a few categories.",8,1,2,24 August 2018
