Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A wasted opportunity
","I was very fortunate to be on set for the making of this movie. (I'm an extra and was a Naboo pilot). I heard that something like 300 hours of film was shot for this movie and it shows. If a film is storyboarded correctly, you'll end up with a movie that at least has a chance of direction and good pacing which this obviously did not.Star Wars original movies were a phenomenon because there was nothing quite comparable. The characters were very likable and there was a sense of magic where the force was concerned. This has been killed by TPM. We learn that the force is in fact something that is easily identifiable in the blood-stream. Killing the mystery. The characters seems to have slightly less depth than the original movies. However, this criticism may be harsh, because we are comparing all three previous movies to one.As a movie on it's own it's great for kids, but it really is quite a departure from the previous adventures. Star Wars has become a victim of it's own merchandising success. Hence, the hated Jar Jar, the extreme plethora of aliens, resembling a bad episode of The Muppet Show, and the downgrading of the enemy to a set of robots which can be killed by switching off the power!Everything is too clean and vast, which Star Wars freaks will tell is because it is supposed to be set during a wealthy era in the fictional Galaxy. But we have lost other characters as well. The Millennium Falcon was a character in itself being so temperamental, but instead we have sterile ships, buildings and cities. So much character has been lost.George Lucas is a great producer, but I'm not so sure about his  directing ability, which is why Empire Strikes Back is such a superior effort. I do fear for his next two efforts. I hope he proves me wrong. I will be the first one to say that the movies are great if they deserve it but let's just wait and see.As a film on it's own which the score system is for, I'd have to give it a seven. Mainly for the the special effects and really it is a decent film, after all. The pod-race and the Jedi battle saves the movie. But without the special effects this would be a poor film indeed. (Shows what money can do eh? Both ruin (Jar-Jar) and enhance a movie).",Null,0,1,18 January 2002
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Looks good, sounds good, but lacking depth
","This film is technically superb. The visuals are stunning. OK, 3D HFR is a but of a gamble, but at least the option of 2d with or without HFR is there as well. The film is long, but there is enough going on to keep the film entertaining enough.But what lets this film down? One is characterisation. Given the film length, it shouldn't really have suffered from that. There are many characters, true, but Bilbo's character should have had more focus, but when he did, he didn't seem to be all that believable to me. The transition from being adamant about not going on the journey to joining it was not played out very well. Then his willingness to risk his life for the ponies from being eaten by the trolls didn't seem that well done either. These things we must just accept. This is what seemed to let the film down. The lack of the emotional journey. In Fellowship of the Ring, you seem to understand the subtle changes, and relationships displayed there. That is what makes the film stronger than this one.Another failing for me was the amount of over exaggerated action sequences. Classic films tend to have a few real cliffhangers. This is after you are made to really care for the characters involved. The amount of contrived tension squeezed out of every scene was a bit embarrassing. Especially the last sequence in the trees. Some of the action scenes such as the fight scene against the goblins was like a cross between Super Mario World and Sonic the Hedgehog. Also, too many one in a million chance things happening one after another. It does take away from the reality (I know it is fantasy), but it makes it a bit like a Disney cartoon.One of the best things about the film was the Riddles in the Dark sequence, which was very close to the book, and therefore very suspenseful. Other good things included the atmosphere and the scenery.",Null,1,9,24 December 2012
Mission: Impossible II," Very poor excuse of a movie
","What the hell were the fighting scenes all about in this movie? I like the Matrix, but correct me if I'm wrong but this movie is not set in the Matrix. The fighting scenes are laughable. No gritty drama anymore. It's evident in all the movies in Hollywood now, Bollywood fight scenes where one guy flies around kicking everyone's butts with dumb moves. But apart from that the dialogue was poor, the plot paper-thin, no strong characterization. This is definitely a film which has relied on style over content. Pity there's not much style. 2 out of 10, and I'm being generous.",Null,0,1,30 May 2003
Love Actually," (Slightly) Romantic (Mediocre) Comedy
","This film is just about a bunch of bite-sized chunks of lust. Hardly love, actually. Performances are good given what a poor script and paper thin characters they had to work with (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman especially). The story of the prime minister was just embarrassing. I suppose this is definitely going to be seen as the best British movie in years. What a shame that this overrated movie will be remembered in this way. I got no feeling of real love between most of the characters. This is a feel-good movie with a top cast list just to get a guaranteed profit. This movie felt very cynical to me. Cliched and full of the obvious. It seems love is all around. All around Richard Curtis' bank balance.",Null,3,7,25 November 2003
