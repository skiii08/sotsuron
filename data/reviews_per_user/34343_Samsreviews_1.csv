First Man," Surprisingly Boring Biopic
","I was pretty excited to watch First Man after seeing the high critic reviews, higher than Interstellar even, probably my favorite space related movie.Unfortunately, I felt let down by the end of it. I understand wanting to translate the real feeling of ascending into air and being in space, but there were one too many extended zooms of random nuts and bolts on the aircraft, and way too many shaky camera scenes. Scenes with his wife or almost any of the NASA men as far as dialogue left me bored, seemed pointless, and thrown in randomly between his flights as drivers of plot. Still, many of the space scenes were visually amazing.The movie could easily have been 40 minutes shorter, maybe I would have felt my time was better spent then.",5,2,3,27 January 2019
