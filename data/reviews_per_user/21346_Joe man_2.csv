The Blair Witch Project," One of the most haunting and chilling horror movies of our time.
","Before I went to see this movie I had half my friends tell me it was horrible and half tell me it was great.  It's just one of those movies that your either going to hate or like a great deal. I happened to like this film a great deal.  It was filmed only 15 minutes from where I live and I have heard the story many times.  The writers of the movie went to Wheaton high school which is also a short distance from my home.  So you can imagine why I liked this movie.  It is not just that, the Blair Witch Project takes a whole new perspective on horror films.  It is more realistic and lacks the fake blood and guts of todays horror movies.  This horror flick is related closer to The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby then anything else. It is the kind of horror movie that makes you think (could this be true).  There were really three kids who went deep into the unknown forest to do a project on the Blair Witch.  All three of them never returned, but their film was found.  How much of it is real are not is for you to decide.",8,1,1,8 September 1999
Braveheart," Braveheart in my view, is one of the greatest most breathtaking films of all time.
","From beginning to end this movie will put you on the edge of your seat for nearly 3 1/2 hours.  This film has all the  elements to make a great movie. It has romance, tragedy, action, war, revenge, betrayal, and at times comedy.  The acting was amazing, especially by Mel Gibson.  It was by far his best movie.  Although it won an academy for best picture I felt Mel should have at least been nominated for best actor.  I don't want to spoil the movie for you but I thought I would give you a brief summary on why I think this is the greatest movie I have ever laid eyes on. You may not agree with me there, but see this movie and I guarantee you will be satisfied.",10,2,3,7 September 1999
