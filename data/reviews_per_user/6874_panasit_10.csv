Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than the Original in every way
","'That woman deserves her revenge. And we all deserves to die. But then again, so does she.'There is nothing more satisfying than feeling so much hatred for a character, and believing that there is nothing in this world that can make you feel sorry for him, only to have the director/writer change your mind at the very end. We don't know much about Bill from the first Kill Bill. All we know is that he is evil to the eyes of the world and to the eyes of his own Master. He wronged our heroine, and we wanted to see him die. He must not suffer to faith of a normal death too. We want to see him die by the hand of gorgeous and extremely talented Uma Thurman. And then... suddenly... we don't want to. Because Bill never deserve to die. The Bride does.This is classic he said she said story. I felt like when I was listening to my friend talking about how bad some guy treated her, only to find out later that the truth is often different. I know Tarentino has always been capable of deep and symbolic storyline. But I never thought he would put those type of stories into Kill Bill. Considering all the other over-the-top subplot. The main plot is consist of simple domestic misunderstanding and over-reaction that put the bloodbath into motion. What a great writing. And that is all Kill Bill Vol. 2 is. Great story. Volume one was all about action without a doubt. The fight scenes in part 2 doesn't top the first one (though there are several good ones still). There are a lot more talk, and even though problem are still being solve by force, there are much more understanding of the situation and critical thinking. More than a pointless (but cool) conversation that just simply link one scene to another.Big Spoiler (because I want to discuss the ending)The Bride deserve to die. But the fact that the baby was his, Bill changed his mind about killing her. And this whole thing happened because Bill allow it to happen out of guilt. If he had kill her, this whole thing would have been over with long ago. Bill did nothing wrong. Even the Bride knew she was wrong because she said at the end (though she was talking about something else, we all knew what she meant) that she is a bad person. Again, to invent a morally satisfying conclusion for a story of revenge is something that is so hard and, if pulled of successfully, is something that is very ingenious. Earlier this year Tarentino sponsored the release of Hero, another movie that is revenge driven, but something that happened stop our heroes in their track. I saw that movie before Volume 2 was release and I thought to myself that if Tarentino like Hero, then there's no way Kill Bill would end with just simply Bill dying and Bride walk into the sunset.This movie also raise a question as to why the Bride chose her daughter over Bill. They were both killers. She was just as dangerous to her baby as Bill would have been. They were living together as husband and wife. And he never harmed her. Why did she think she have the right to run away with his child? Because it is inside her? In our society, when men do not pay child support and/or simply abandon the child, we frown upon their act. Because the mother is the one stuck with the baby while the father can just run off. But in reverse situation, the mother cannot decide she's just going to push the father out of the picture.And at the dinner table in the final battle scene, The Bride knew that she was wrong. And she killed all those people not because they are evil, but because they punished her. They punished her for her sin that she did not want to acknowledge. And she felt good. At that point, Bill and Bride cannot live as husband and wife. One of them has to die. Bill chose for her to live on. At the very end Bill said 'No you are not, You are a wonderful person.' Not because she did the right thing. But because he loves her. And the Bride said Thank You for giving her a second chance.I gave Kill Bill vol. 1 10/10 because I thought it was a celebration of movie by experimenting different type of styles (from cartoon to black and white) with no care for realism. Combine with one cool scene after another, that movie was an instant classic. But I regret giving it that perfect score, not because it wasn't as good as I thought it was. It's just that volume 2 is so much better and I want to give it a higher score than the first one. I'm not one of those people who gives 11, so I guess I'll just have to settle for 10/10. But this movie reached the level of quality far beyond my expectation. Even if you hate the first one. You gotta see this movie.Panasit",10,0,1,18 December 2004
Elf," Gremlins is a more cheerful Christmas movie than this downer.
","'Christmas is a time to be extra jerk' is pretty much an attitude of every villains in every Christmas movie (even Die Hard 2). But the villain whose heart will eventually change by either ghosts, or Christmas-related miracle in Elf is not really someone you sympathize with. And that person is the Elf's father, which the audience will most likely hate him more than they like Elf.'Will you tuck me in Dad?' 'No, I will not tuck you in.'To be fair, Elf is a grown man, and it will be creepy to tuck him in. But my point is not whether or not the father should tuck his grown son in. The point is, what kind of writer/director would want to put that scene into their movie? What kind of reaction should we have? Why is it funny? Is it funny because Elf is being stupid? Is it funny because the father is feeling awkward? Is it funny because of their tone of voice? Or is this the climax scene? I can never tell.But I am getting ahead of myself. The movie started out extremely cute. Elf and his adopted father are both characters that we can all love even before they say a word. And we continue to throughout the movie. That is the problem because, guess what? People don't want to see bad things happen to the characters they love. And the whole Elf being in New York and get tease and push around by people, though he didn't feel bad by it (because of his innocence, which makes us love him even more), frustrated me even more. There are also scene like when Elf want to give raccoon a hug but instead the raccoon bites him. That's not funny. That's awful. The fake looking talking Penguin at the North Pole shows that the director and the production team didn't plan on making this movie a classic (and by all mean, it isn't) which is sad because with some more thought into it, this movie could have been so much better. May be even a good movie. Considering how well this movie made in the box office.Everything about it is a downer. The snowball fight was mean and unrealistic. The kid in this movie is a very bad actor (which is strange for this kind of movie). Santa Clause talked like he's reading Declaration of Independent. The view of New York is not at all beautiful. And the love interest character has absolutely no dimension. The way she change her emotion from bitter goth to Legally Blonde in a split second is beyond the definition of the word believable.I thought this was going to be a very funny movie for a whole family since its DVD release was hyped up so much (and consider the fact that it did very well in the box office). But it turn out to be too dumb for adult, too dark and harsh for kids, and too uncomfortable to watch for anyone in between. Cute idea. Sloppy (cross that, very bad) execution.Panasit",3,5,15,18 December 2004
Lost in Translation," The best movie to ever capture loneliness and everything that comes with it.
","I used to remember sitting in the car with my dad as a kid, and just look out the window into the skyline of Bangkok, not caring what is where and how do we get to where we want to be. And I used to remember, how even inside a big, crowded, and energetic place, I still manage to feel lonely.Lost in Translation reminded me of those moments. First of all, this movie is visually stunning. Sofia de Coppola let Lost in Translation do to Japan what Bridget Jones did to London and Runaway Jury did to New Orleans. It's just so beautiful. However, as much as we try to fall in love with Japan. It's the enemy. The Darth Vader if you will. And therefore, as the audience, we are always on guard.Lost in Translation is not a love story. It is not a comedy (it's as funny as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon). It's not even a story about life. It's just fragment of life that, at first glance, will seem almost meaningless. But it's not. This movie is probably the best depiction of loneliness I have ever seen on screen. And if you ever experienced it before, loneliness is never meaningless. It's as much a part of life as water is to your body.The relationship between the Scarlet Johansson and Bill Murray character is not a good one, and it's not supposed to be. Here we have two characters that are facing with the same problem (loneliness). The main girl doesn't respect Japanese culture enough to be interested in it. The main guy forgot his son's birthday ( a sitcom gimmick. How can a parents forget his child's birthday. I don't think it's possible). And we want them to come together because we feel that they can heal one another. Though that thought doesn't make any sense. How can a person that can't even solve his/her problem going to help another person facing same problem? And they didn't.What I love the most is that, knowing the basic plot, this movie still surprise me. When the two people meet, they didn't suddenly become the light that shine into each other's world. You don't see Bill Murray try to leave his wife, or Scarlet try to leave her husband. The two met at the bar. She didn't come to him because he's good looking, or that he's funny. And he didn't stare at her because she's a hot young thing. It's because they sense loneliness within one another. And so they move closer to each other, not for comfort, but to figure out how worse this damn loneliness thing can get. If the main girl can't make life interesting with her husband and friend, will she have a good time with Bill Murray? No. But she like spending time with him more; because at the end of the day, after the karaoke, he's still lonely. Like her.It's like when you find out you get a C on the test. You are mad at your C. So you seek your classmate, looking for somebody else who also got a C. And you talk to that person. Will having sex with that person change your grade? No. (or at least I hope not) Do you still have to deal with that C tomorrow? Yes. But it's kind of nice to know that there's another person going through the same thing with you. And in a lonely place, it's good to know you are not the only one feeling lonely.This is not an enjoyable movie, so many of you who think of movies as 'entertainment' may get turn off by it (and there's nothing wrong with that). But this movie is art. As the matter of fact, it's one of the greatest depressing movie without Nazi I have ever seen. And it couldn't have been made any more perfect than it all ready is. (well, I did complain to my friend about how I wished there's an extended version out there that has extra scenes of them together to make the last scene more believable. But then I realize that if they spend more time together, the idea of loneliness may get tone down)Also, Roger Ebert mentioned that a lot of his viewers mailed him and told him that they hated Lost in Translation after watching it on DVD. Ebert came to a conclusion that on a small screen, the intimidating power of large and busy foreign world that would have enhanced the loneliness feeling may have gotten tone down on the small screen. I knew this prior to watching it, so I tried to sit as close to my 20 inches flat screen as I could. I'm still trying to find a way to watch it again on something bigger myself.Anyway, great movie. 10/10",10,68,128,2 January 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," A great romance movie, but the very best of the romantic comedy genre.
","There is something enjoyable but tiresome about watching a bunch of 30 something depress woman trying to find a man before their biological clock expired (though none of them seem to want any kids... so what's the rush). At first glance, Bridget Jones follow the formula of Ally McBeal and Sex and the City. These women want to be in a deep and committed relationship, though they do not to be 'trapped' in a committed relationship (because... woman rights. Haven't you heard?). Calling it a hard task is an understatement.So, I was expecting something I have seen before in TV shows/sitcom that is now being put in movie form. I rented the DVD along with a bunch others, and on the day I have to return them, I force myself to watch it in a 'now or never let just get it over with' situation. I worked late the night before, came home at 12 and sleep at 3 in the morning. I woke up at 8 to use the bathroom and I realized that I want to return the DVDs early, so I have start watching it with my eyes half open. 10 minutes in and I couldn't stop smiling. This movie is just so cheerful and funny. This is what movie is supposed to be, entertainment. And it is extremely entertaining. Now, I own it on DVD and saw it twice.Romantic Comedy genre is weak in my opinion. I think the best romance in film bury within other type of genre that is not comedy. Movie like You Got Mail, Truth About Cats and Dogs, Addicted to Love, etc. They all are just something to watch when you are bored, and has no classic feeling to it; even a gigantic Oscar hit like As Good As It Gets, which I loved. Best romance I see comes from Drama like Casablanca, Adventure like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Epic like Far and Away, or *sigh, Titanic. Now, after watching all those, I can safely say that Bridget Jones beat them all (well, except Casablanca for the obvious reason, it being the best movie of all time and all). Here's Why:So many people have all ready mention how flawless Renee's (girl from Texas) British accent is, so I'm not going to bother, and go right to the meat. Bridget Jones is a lot like Ally McBeal in term of character design. She wear short skirts, flirt with men at her work place, and have eating disorder. Ally McBeal, however, failed where she tried too little, just whining and sleeping with strangers until none of us has the energy to cheer for her (and she didn't find true love in the end). Jone is much more mature like characters from Sex and the City. The only thing that she didn't have are money, which in my opinion, let us relate to her better.I take love very seriously, and most of my friends, myself included, are all being sadistically torture by it. What I love about Bridget Jones is that even though we realize she is desperate and obviously have low self-esteem, she still won't settle for less. Usually a girl who is overweight (or at least think she is overweight.. I think she looks cute and sexy in the movie with her weight gain, a dude's opinion) and doesn't have a steady boyfriend until they turn thirty (where the movie began) are those who might willing to settle for a lesser man. But when one of the men in the movie become rude to her or disrespectful to her, she knows what to do. She never go cry to anyone with her relationship problem. She worked at it on her own, may be asking advice from friends on what to say here and there, but never whine about it. There's no 'why don't you just...', she did everything a smart and intelligent woman would do. Not bad for a girl who thinks El Nino is a latin band. Is there a latin band called El Nino?I was reading some of the review by men about how Bridget Jones' Dairy ruin a generation of young girls by saying that it's okay to be fat, sloppy, clumsy, idiot, and still think there is a chance of finding a good man. First of all, that male person is probably a closet case because straight men like women with curve. Second, those kind of people and their way of thinking is why this movie is so important. No matter how hard we try, none of us can be perfect. Life is a battle. You fight for money, you fight for survival. Fighting to look good and pro-create is just one of the things some people don't really need. The reason we want to find our significant other is to ease the heaviness of the fighting. To make coming home from work late at night only to get up early the next day to pay for the house you barely spend any time in, more bearable. We understand that about Bridget, and relate to her. And when a man comes in to tell her he likes her Just The Way She Is, call it unrealistic, call it cheer dumb luck or whatever. But if that scene is too impossible to happen and too much to ask for from the real world, then more of this kind of movie need to exist. A lot more.There are some things about the movie that I don't like, but to be fair, taking them away would make it a whole lot less cute. For one thing, Bridget couldn't find any messages on her answering machine. Awww.. she's lonely. But wait, didn't she have 3 friends who always supported her? Plus, again, she looks gorgeous. It's hard to feel sorry for you when 2 men were willing to fight for you. But those are minor setback to a overall story that is simply perfect.If anything, this is truly a movie every young girl (and guy too) must watch. Unless.. you know, you are too young for all the swearing. Speaking of which, this movie, unfortunately, is another classic that got slap with R rating for absolutely no good reason like Almost Famous. I can blame it on the Rating board, but why would the movie put those kind of language or drug content (Almost Famous, there's no drug in Bridget Jones) on there when it doesn't even have anything to do with the story and may even help them reach much larger group of audience?Oh Well. 10/10",Null,0,1,21 November 2004
Lilo & Stitch," funny cartoon about serious real life situation
","Okay, this movie has child-care service, broken home, parents death, problem child, fugitive on the loose... and it's a cartoon comedy made by Disney. I know that Disney is capable of being violent. After watching Mufasa died, ocean of corpses in Mulan, and Clayton from Tarzan got lynched, Disney no longer have to prove itself. But it's not that Lilo and Stitch is violent. It just deals with too serious subject matter to be a cartoon show. This is the kind of movie parents and adult would enjoy. But other than few physical humor, I do not see how kids can appreciate this movie. The movie may depress them even more. I felt very depress with the story. Dont' get me wrong, it's a well crafted, complicated domestic drama. But usually when i pick up Disney like The Emperor's New Groove or Little Mermaid, I want to relax and enjoy myself. With Lilo and Stitch... I just feel depress. It used to be that Disney film let us see through the eyes of kids looking up at the adult world. Now it's reverse. Even though there are children in the movie, Nani(the older sister) seems to be the central character and the one that the viewer can relate to the most, not Lilo (the problem child) and Stitch. So if you are a kid... you can't relate to anybody in the movie (well, if you are wild, may be Stitch). As serious as it is, you got to hand it to Disney though. When it meant to be funny, it is EXTREMELY funny. I give this movie 10/10.",10,1,1,18 December 2002
Alien vs. Predator," Alien vs. Predator vs. Hard to please fans = a few fun monster movie that actually worth your money.
","What should Alien Vs. Predator movie have? Alien Vs. Predator fight scenes? Got it. All the Alien mythology (little alien burst out of the body, queen, eggs, acid blood, etc.?) All there. Predator's mythology (heat-seeking guns, honorable battle, very big knives, cool armor, invisibility, ugly face, etc.)? All there. Those mythology crossing over? (Predators scan to see Alien in the eggs, Predator use Alien skin to mark their bodies, etc.) Tons. So what more can you ask for? Well, there are a couple of things.I read all the reviews, that's why I try to put in my reviews something most people haven't yet said. First, I'm going to do something very odd by comparing it to the first Kill Bill. Sure, this movie is in the different league considering its genre and director. And you can tell that Tarentino put a lot more thought into Kill Bill than Anderson did into this movie (which is sad since the budget for this movie is obviously a lot more). BUT, the premise are the same. Simple Plot, and the movie carry on using its cleverness to please the audience and make them feel they get their money worth. Every phrase that critics used to praise Kill Bill volume 1 can be use to praise this movie. It packed a lot of cool scenes together. The story in between those cool scenes are a bit tight, but I personally don't think Ridley Scott or James Cameron could have done any better (or at least too much better).Only two things hurt this movie (yes, only two). The dialogues that are filled with one liners and added-in attitude by actors who seem to think their characters should have; and the set that has a design quality of a cheap amusement park ride (which is the only thing Cameron or Scott could have fixed) The most important thing about any movie is the plot, and despite the fact that the secondary story is just a time wasting link between one cool scene to the next, the overall plot is actually quite impressive and original for this kind of movie. (if you think it's not, just think: there are much worse way for Aliens and Predator to get together) And the special effect is top notch. Better than any other Alien or Predator movie out there for the obvious reason (which most people will agree but will never mentioned because they want to hate the movie). There is absolutely no 'that is so fake' moment. And that is something. When they got a plot and special effects down, if you are not out to hate the movie, you will at least have a good time.Taking an overview look, I personally think this movie hurt neither series (actually it kinda helped Predator. the first one was a classic, but if it were to be release today it would be call even stupider than this movie, and the second one was just plain bad). A lot of people are mad that Predators seem weak compare to the Aliens. Well, Aliens spawned 4 movies and Predator only spawned 2 for a reason. Aliens eat, breed, and kill like animals, while Predator have a lot of characteristic that resembles human. Plus, these are young and inexperienced Predators (who still kicks major butt though).Lastly, Paul WS Anderson. I hate Mortal Kombat and Event, but I think Resident Evil was very fun (jump-kicking the zombie dog scene aside). I think he's a good writer, but seriously need to stop directing. Watching this movie I can feel that he love both series and have a lot of fun making it. If only he had taken time to polish it. Alien Vs. Predator video game was released ages ago. This movie was in no rush to get release. If they thought about it a little more, edited some of the scenes, rewrote some of the dialogue... well, it will be ten times better, but that still won't please the fans who would just rather have Ridley Scott or James Cameron instead. And may be that's why the poor guy didn't bother.That's a damn shame. Because as unpolished as it is, I enjoyed it and it was worth the time and money to see it in theater. And I will buy the DVD. Just imagine how good it could be if it was polished. 8/10.",Null,0,1,25 October 2004
Batman Begins," Batman, the movie, finally.
","I know about Batman Begins for quite sometime, ever since it was known as 'Batman Year One', a name that irritated me to no end.I thought the retelling of Batman's first year reached its peak in Batman Mask of the Phantasm (which stands beside Begins as the best of the Batman movies). It explained how he got the idea for the costume. How did he find the Bat Cave? What drove him to lead that life, etc.This movie, a ridiculously great movie, added with the history of the Bat-mobile and even how he paid for it all without letting anybody else get suspicious.It also helped that we get to see his parent's murder being played out, along with some extra storyline that punched like the whole Spider Man 'I could have stopped him' scene. And Batman's father finally becomes a character with as much depth as Mufasa of the Lion King. (and his death would make you angry just as much).You'd think that since this is the retelling of Batman's origin, you might get to see Batman as a kid whining and crying over his parents' death all over again (like all the other incarnations). Sort of. But instead of sadness and even anger, this movie is all about fear. And you have to look at the story at a whole different level to understand that THAT was the emotion Batman had. In other incarnations, Batman was such a mysterious and 'cool' figure. He puts the fear into the criminals, not the other way around. So that whole thing was very interesting to me.I just want to add something about the signature bad guy of the movie. For a long time I didn't know if there were going to be any signature bad guys. Then I saw the first trailer. It had Batman being trained in some foreign country on top of snow mountain. 'Great, it's going to be that kind of movie.'The truth was: by that time, I was just bored with Batman. I love Spider Man's mythology more than Batman's (still do) . The new version of the animated series almost turn me off from Batman completely (his disregard for Batgirl's safety and tough love for the new Robin made me want to pull my hair out and scream at the TV). And that series: Batman Beyond, though good (70% of the time), show me more of that Universe than I ever wanted to see.Then suddenly I saw a headline on the internet: 'First picture ever of Batman Begins' villain Scarecrow.My body started shaking. I was like...WHOA! Even though it was the story about Batman's first year, they are using a fresh villain? I was looking forward to see the live action version of the Scarecrow. What they will do to the character can't be as bad as what they did to Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy right?And so I saw the movie. This Scarecrow is even cooler than the one in the cartoon. And that is when I realized: When I saw Batman Forever, I wasn't seeing 'the Riddler' on screen. I was seeing Jim Carrey's *take* on the Riddler. Mr. Freeze is the same thing. I didn't see Mr. Freeze. What I saw was: Hey, wouldn't it be silly and fun if Arnold Swarznegger was Mr. Freeze? No such thing happens here. This is definitely Scarecrow and he blended in with the Batman's dark universe quite nicely.But there are some problems. For a signature villain, he had way too little screen time. He had about as much screen time as Boba Fett in the entire Star Wars saga.The main villain here, Ra's Al Gough, is no stranger to the Batman's Universe, but is one of those characters I do not expect to see in movie form (the same way I do not expect the Rhino to be the bad guy in Spider Manm 3). Well, they did made some changes to his character and left out half of the storyline concerning him, but he fits with the storyline of this movie, so I guess that was all right. I wasn't too gung-ho about Ra's Al Gough being truth to the comic as I was with Scarecrow since the classic-ness of the two characters are way at the different level.Anyway, this is not just another artistic interpretation of the Batman legend featuring character Batman (like all the past movies). This is a long overdue movie about Batman.",10,0,2,20 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I walked out of the theater disappointed and angry.
","I have never seen a movie this disappointing since The Lost World: Jurassic Park. I have defended the first Lord of the Rings against Harry Potter's fan, against people who don't believe in To Be Continued in movies, or people who just hate the fact that the first movie starts out with blank black screen for almost one full minute. I love the first movie to death.Don't think that I expected too much out of the Two Towers. I expected so little and they gave me even less. The fact that the movie is long is never a problem with me. However, why is the Two Towers long? Can it be that the director keep focusing on mountain range, and sky? Why? We know that mountain and sky existed, we saw them before. If it's a little, may be I can understand. But it's sad when I feel that I can show all the story element in one hour when the movie took three without a reason to.One of the thing I hate the most about the movie contain a tiny little spoiler that won't ruin any big surprise. The King lost his son and said that a parent should never have to bury his child. How cute. Yet at the battle, they have children fighting the war against Saruman's army. How does that make sense? Little boys (as young as 10 from the look of it) can fight war better than Grown Woman who hid cowardly in the cave? That's  insulting to both the male and female gender. It's a very sensitive subject, so why tackle it when the book didn't have anything about that on it.
The movie turn from something that is deep and look like a classic in the making (the Fellow Ship of the Rings) to something that is boring, long, and senseless. Oh, and the Gollum. The so-called most realistic CG animated character ever. I think he was pretty cool at first. But there is one scene where he was talking to his other self. Instead of showing the two version of him, they keep switching the camera and only have one Gollum on screen at the time. What was that about? I thought this thing was make by computers, why not just make two of them or have it talk to its reflection or something? I feel that I am very fair for giving this movie a low score.",1,0,5,12 January 2003
Vanilla Sky," I had a dream about Vanilla Sky. And you were there. And you were there....
","I love it when commercials and trailers revealed nothing. I knew absolutely nothing of the plot and was excited to be fill in from the ground floor. I was ready for some mind-twisting have-to-watch-it-twice-to-get-it kind of movie; and it started out that way. However, by the middle of the movie, the plot was quickly reduced to being a high-class cliché. The production team dressed this movie up with symbolism, metaphoric dialogues, and situations far less complex than it appears. But then again, the point in the movie is to never underestimate the little things, especially the little decisions we made everyday. At some level I think Mission Impossible is even deeper and less predictable. But if you are one of those people who want to see this kind of movie to boost your brain's ego, Vanilla Sky still has enough meat in it to satisfy, especially those interested in cameos and pop culture references.Cameron Crowe's dialogues are as great as always. The beautiful Manhattan background helps the story by being a fantastic larger-than-life place that can only exist inside a dream, yet exists for real. And the acting is top notch (it better be, considering all the stars). So when every other thing goes right, it all boils down to the plot itself. Part of the problem with the story is that dream is a cheap plot device for a psychological drama. It's too easy (and dare i even say cheesy) to put character in a situation and then tells the audience near or at the end 'it's only a dream.' That's too Wizard of Oz (which that movie could barely get away with). Sure, the plot expanded a lot more than that with questions like: why the character chose to dream, how he discovered the dream, and why things went wrong etc. But even the dressing of the surprises are all clichés (curse you evil corporation. curse you evil doctors and lawyers trying to play god. etc.) And that is quite disappointing. (this is not a spoiler by the way, because it was obvious that his reality is quite unstable from the beginning. The true question is what is the reasoning for the dreams, where it started, and where it ended, which I did not reveal... and wasn't that great).Now I heard that this is a remake. I don't need to compare it with the original because... I don't care. But despite what I stated above, this movie is still enjoyable; not because of its story, but because of how it was delivered (once again, Cameron Crowe, New York, etc.). If you were afraid to pick up this movie because you think it might be too heavy, you are mistaken. The movie is as simple as Truman Show and Matrix. And if you are one of those mainstream viewers who don't like/get this kind of movie, think of this as a transition movie. It's not too complicated to be annoying, but complex enough to help you feel a little bit smart for understanding it, and why you will never watch it for a second time. 7.5/10",Null,0,1,6 November 2004
Munich," With such horrifying subject matter as real event terrorism, most people might overlook how beautiful and stylish this movie is.
","I didn't even want to see the movie. It was, believe me, my last choice for a movie to see. The premise certainly wasn't appealing. And I am so much looking forward to seeing Hoodwinked. So... wasn't my choice. BUT... oh man, was I surprised.I walked in expected to be preached at about revenge and the seriousness of Middle East conflict, and how it will all be so corny and predictable (why not? Catch Me if You Can was). Oh, how I was so wrong.One big thing, it's exciting and cool. I know terrorism is a grim subject matter and war is not funny, the Munich thing was based on true story and it was horrible. But darn it, I can't describe it in any other way. This movie is so cool. Go blame Steven Spielberg for making it with such style (he didn't do it in any of his last movies, I don't know why he starts now). It's even more artsy than Crouching Tiger. Each killing of the terrorists were as delicate and well crafted as the ones in Godfather's final scene. Add that to various beautiful European cities in the background, it was just pure pleasure to all of my senses.It's funny how a movie like Crash, which was advertised to be a complex movie with many plots, turns out to be very simple and easy to understand (and it was very good in its own right). Where a movie like Munich, that make you think the plot is so simple, a group of people was asked to kill all the terrorists that was responsible for the Munich massacre, turns out to be so much deeper than... any movie I have ever seen.I might sound exaggerated. But I have seen a lot of movie that is trying to do many things in the short amount of time it was given, thus making it feel incomplete or rushed, even after 3 hours (Pirates of Caribbean, King Kong, Capote). Munich didn't hold back. It has tons of story to tell and it will tell it. It went from one scene to another with care. Unlike in King Kong and Capote, if a guy is going to enter a building, you will see him walk into it. Not seeing him sitting in one building in one shot, then immediately the next shot he's doing something else in a park. This movie is so confident with its timing, it went on and on without a hint of hurry. .Think about this. There are 12 terrorists that the main characters have to kill and only 3 hours to do it (this is a long movie). Walking in, you are probably thinking that at most they will kill 8 or 9. Or they may kill large number of them in sort of a quick montage with orchestral music playing... Nope. Every terrorist killed has a plot line that comes with it. It's like a bunch of short movie. And it just keep going and going and each one is better than the next. Then we have CIA, French intelligence, Russian mafia, and Israel's own people getting involved, but it doesn't feel out of place or pretentious because each time a new plot was introduced, it was done with care. And the characters think about the situation, talk among themselves about it, then react to it. This movie takes its time to tell us its story, and in return, we take our time to think and understand it fully, even during our first viewing Like most kids growing up in the 80's and early 90's, I'm a Steven Spielberg fan. But most of his skill shines by making a movie great with his directing despite its weak or simplistic writing (Raider of the Lost Ark, Hook (actually it's still not good), Jurassic Park, Jaws, ...even up until recently, War of the World, Saving Private Ryan, and Catch Me If You Can). I think this movie, along with The Last Crusade and Schindler's List, Spielberg's skill finally get matched up with a highly skilled writer, and that results in a great movie that will be remember for a very long time.Munich is so delicate and have so much class, it inspired me to do more with my own art. Crash and Brokeback may be 2005 front runner, but if it is not the best (I'm cheering for both Crash and this one), it is ONE of the best movie of the year. I think, with Godfather and Casablanca and Amadeus in mind, Munich is one of the greatest movie I have ever seen.",10,1,2,12 February 2006
