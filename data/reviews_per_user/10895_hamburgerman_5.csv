The Blair Witch Project," go see it!
","i highly recommend this movie.  go see it, and bring a friend, preferably one that doesn't know anything about it.it's a horror film, but not one you will be screaming at, nothing jumps through the window, no shock cuts.  it provides several natural, real laughs during the set-up and slowly sucks you into the horror.  two scenes in particular, when the tent is 'attacked' and our 3 filmmakers run out looking for whatever it was, and the final house footage.  unbelievably effective!two suggestions to the real filmmakers would be:1- the final shot, allow the film in the camera to run out naturally, 2- 3- 5- 10- minutes, whatever was left in the camera.  do not cut out of it.2- remove all closing credits.  keep the mystery alive.  with such a killer p.r. campaign, the general movie-going public will buy into the hype, the dead filmmakers, because this movie is so well done.  the closing credits kind of ruined the illusion for me.  just a thought.but GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",9,1,1,24 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mr. Lucas, can I have my money back, please?
","I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't go in with high expectations.  But it was B-A-D.  Bad dialogue, bad acting, no plot. Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were wasted in this film, nothing the least bit interesting to say or do.  We've seen better light sabre fights in the other movies, and although Darth Maul's double-sabre was cool, it wasn't enough.  Jake Lloyd's sweet Anakin gave me cavities.  Jar Jar Binks was nothing but annoying.  I am a big Star Wars fan, but I know a bad movie when I see one.About the dialogue - there were so many lines that were out of context. Why on Earth did the two-headed sportscaster have to say something stupid like 'No matter what universe you are from, that's gotta hurt.'  And If Anakin Skywalker said 'Yipee' one more time I think I would have vomitted.Sure the effects and scenery are beautiful, I'll give them that.  But part of what made Star Wars great is you knew the sets were actually built, either life size or miniatures.The original Star Wars is simply a story of good versus evil, literally black and white, Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Hero and Villain.  In the Phantom Menace, sure we had good vs. evil, but Darth Sidiuos and Darth Maul were nowhere near the evil presence of Darth Vader.  I didn't care about them.Good thing we weren't introduced to Star Wars in episode order.  The franchise may have died right here.Thank you Mr. Lucas for giving us Star Wars (Episodes IV & V).  If we are ever to see Episodes II & III, please oh please let somebody else write it!",1,0,1,19 May 1999
The Longest Yard," The Longest Turd
","I typically like Adam Sandler's movies. This one was a turd, though. I didn't believe any of the relationships. I did not believe his character bonded or felt for these criminal misfits in the least. All the talk about bonding... I didn't see it.Very few laughs. And is Chris Rock's act getting tired? Old, played out racial references... Nothing new, nothing funny. Rock did have the funniest line in the movie, though: 'I'll teach you how to football, just don't eat me.' I must admit I've never seen the original Longest Yard, but it must have been better than this!2 out of 10.",2,1,4,8 June 2005
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," funniest set-up i've ever seenn
","I saw SP:BLU Thursday night, and for the first 20 minutes or so, I don't think I've ever laughed harder.  It did slow down a bit, but was still very entertaining.  The profanities come a mile a minute once introduced, but you get used to it.  I guess in that sense the dirty words actually got old.The musical numbers were brilliant (except for maybe 2, which were still pretty good.)  Even though some critics may consider their work stupid and useless (I don't), Matt Stone and Trey Parker and certainly not stupid people.I recommend this movie, especially if you are easily offended!",8,0,0,3 July 1999
X-Men," this movie didn't suck
","i was pleasantly surprised by X-Men.  I enjoyed it.  You do need to know a little of their history before going in, because they don't take much time explaining or developing each character.  i think everyone did a pretty good job, but halle berry was a little weak (she didn't have much to work with, though.)  Hugh Jackman as wolverine was excellent.",8,0,0,31 July 2000
