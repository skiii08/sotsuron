Miracle," Great movie...
","As a someone who was aware of the story and as a sports fan from outside the US, this movie was something I had to see, and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. Kurt Russell's as Herb Brooks I would put up there with Morgan Freeman's performance as Nelson Mandela in Invictus, possibly Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch but that's for others to judge. He captured the essence of the man, his mannerisms his words, everything. The hockey scene's were in a word, perfect thanks to the use of actual hockey players whose audition process was probably more vigorous than the selection process for the real US team, (30 picked from 4000 as opposed to 26 picked from 90), the score adds to the tension and the atmosphere, particularly in the last period after Mike Eruzione puts the US in front in the climactic game against the Soviets. One scene which I found emotional was, surprise surprise, the Herbies after the 3-3 tie with Norway, it has been pointed out that two of the players who did the drill in the movie, Jim Craig and Buzz Schneider didn't do it in real life as Craig didn't play and Schneider was ejected from the game and Mike Eruzione didn't get the drills ended by stating that he played for the USA, however I feel the point is overstated as this is only a minor detail and Gavin O'Connor probably didn't want there to be any resentment between the cast and to show that the team had reached a turning point at that stage so these two indiscretions I can forgive. What I can't however was the way two of the Soviet goals were depicted, the first and third goals were shown being scored as a result of foul play in the build up, a deliberate unpunished slash on Buzz Schneider and Jim Craig being knocked unconscious from a cheap shot leaving the net empty when in reality the goals in question were clean, a simple stick check and a one on one counter attack during a Soviet power play, so why portray one of the greatest teams ever to grace the sport in this negative light? Another gripe I had with the movie was the skimming over the games against the Czechoslovakia and Finland which were also must win games, particularly Finland when the team were in danger of losing, as they were behind 2-1 going into the third period and throwing away what they had earned against the Soviets, Herb Brooks said to the team before the third period, 'If you lose this game you'll take it to your (BLEEP) grave.' I feel was a bit of a mistake not showing that, all be it a bit toned down language wise. However historical discretion's and omissions aside this movie is still compelling, the hockey is great, the cast is genuine, the music only adds to it, having Al Michaels and Ken Dryden reenact their commentary was inspired and as I said before Kurt Russell is phenomenal, even if your not an ice hockey fan I'd still recommend you watch it and I find it makes you believe in yourself that if you want something enough and your willing really work for it, then nothing is impossible or 'Do you believe in miracles YES!!'.",8,1,1,20 April 2015
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Brilliantly funny
","There is never a dull moment in LOB and some of the dialogue and jokes are now legendary such is the genius of Monty Python, lines such as 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy' and 'What have the Romans ever done for us' immediately come to mind. Graham Chapman is in top form as the beleaguered would be rebel Brian, and later on as Biggus Dickus. John Cleese is unforgettable too as both PFJ (or was it JPF?) leader Reg and the Roman centurion and the Jewish official at the stoning. Michael Palin's lampooning of the controversial figure of Pontius Pilate was simply hilarious and in fact not too inaccurate, take away the speech impediment and you have a ruthless governor, which most historians agree that's what the real Pilate was. Eric Idle, in my opinion was probably the funniest of all, 'Oh shut up big nose' 'I want you all to call me Loreta' 'He's deee he's deee he's deeaffff and mamama mad sir' had me in tears, also Terry Jones as Brian's overbearing mother was simply outstanding Terry Gilliam's role was one of the smaller ones as he doesn't appear as much but he also does well in the roles he plays. so all in all the acting was perfect for this type of movie. Now onto the elephant in the room, does this movie lampoon Christ or insult religion, well no it doesn't as Kenneth Colley plays the small role of Jesus Christ straight and respectfully so it doesn't mock him and Brian isn't a metaphor or representation of him as its established early on that they're two different people. If anything it lampoons the time period that the movie was set and the one historical figure who is directly lampooned was Pontius Pilate. The movie ends on an upbeat note which is appropriate for a comedy like this, all in all you have funny jokes, witty and memorable dialogue and an ending which will leave you feeling glad you watched it. 10/10",10,3,7,10 September 2015
Kickboxer," A rare type of movie....
","Quite a lot of martial arts movies I've watched in the past have all committed the same offence, no plot, or a plot that could only be described as absurd and unrealistic. Kickboxer however is different, its story-line is plausible and makes sense, yes it maybe a little textbook but it makes for a good story. JCVD as Kurt Sloane, the little brother out for revenge plays the part really well, and you can see his character and training develop as the movie goes on. The antagonist, Tong Po is also done really well by Michel Qissi, who instead of being just an opponent for the main character, displays some genuine villainous traits so you have a real reason for not liking him. As a follower of Muay Thai, I found the fighting scenes to be somewhat unrealistic and OTT, like the Rocky movies, likewise the severity of the injuries the characters seemed to recover amazingly quickly from, also the movies depiction of Thailand itself wasn't something I agreed with but its a movie, not a travel documentary. All in all I'd say this movie is worth owning and worth a watch if you like both martial arts and coming of age movies.",7,1,1,8 July 2017
12 Angry Men," A must see for any movie fan
","This is a classic, the only way to describe it. From the start you get a sense of claustrophobia that the jury would be feeling from sitting in the cramped jury room, and the tension gradually increases as the evidence of the trial is revealed, arguments are put across and the characters allow their own personal views, and in some cases prejudices, cloud their judgement. The acting is what makes this movie such a great one, Henry Fonda as the lone dissenter is magnificent, as are the rest of the jurors, particularly Lee J Cobb as the infamous volatile emotionally unstable juror number 3 and E.G Marshall as the cool and rational juror number 4 who judges on facts. The ending is wrapped in tension as the jury nears its unanimous verdict, and one feels a sense of relief when they reach it. All in all this is a must see for movie lovers, and the fact that its stood the test of time is an indication of how great it really is.",10,1,2,29 April 2016
Creed," I was wrong about this, which is good
","When I first heard about this film, I thought, 'Why can't they leave the Rocky franchise alone?' My expectations of Creed were low, I believed it wouldn't be any good and would be a bad tribute to Rocky. However all that changed when I actually watched it, the story was captivating, Sylvester Stallone was back to his best as the character we've all come to love all be it in a supporting role, Michael B Jordan was outstanding as Adonis Creed who feels he has to follow in his late father's footsteps in the sport of boxing. A real surprise were the boxers who were in the movie, particularly Andre Ward and Tony Bellew and how well they did in their roles considering they're not actors, they both give terrifying performances, but they're not necessarily villains just because they're opponents for the protagonist. The boxing scenes did the Rocky franchise proud and were authentic thanks to the use of the HBO announcers, particularly the final bout which starts off as the mis-match it was on paper but almost ends in an upset and at the end, which was realistic, there was not a dry eye in the house. All in all Creed is a movie worthy of being in the Rocky franchise and is a great movie in its own right.",9,3,4,30 September 2017
The Terminator," Definitive action movie of the decade
","Very rarely do you ever see an actor who fits a role so perfectly, it becomes almost impossible to imagine anyone else playing it, a few well known examples would be Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks and Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, well I would put Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator right up there, he just fits the role perfectly. His very presence, his movements and his deadpan emotionless mannerisms were in a word, perfect for the character. When he appears you just know somethings going to happen, the depiction of the Terminator's sheer relentlessness and ruthlessness in the pursuit of his mission are borderline frightening. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor turns in a brilliant performance as an ordinary person trying to get by, whose life has suddenly been turned upside down by being thrown into what can only be described as a nightmare situation, likewise Michael Biehn as the war weary soldier still bearing the scars of a troubled if not traumatic past so much so he barely knows what happiness is. The action scenes are probably some of the best I've seen, particularly the final confrontation when you think, 'what more do they have to do to beat this thing?!'. Some of the lines of the dialogue and one line in particular, have since become legend and the most well known in cinematic history. The story is compelling and even thought provoking as to where humanity could end up in the future, even the soundtrack adds to the ominous tension which you feel while watching, especially the title track which like Arnie has become so synonymous with The Terminator that most people would be able to identify immediate which movie its in. This movie will go down as an all time classic definitive action movie, and its a must see for all action movie lovers. I'll finish by describing the ending, the movie's ending is spot on as there isn't the happy ending that most action movies tend to have which can feel like an anti-climax. Oh no this movie ends on an ominous note as Sarah Connor knows the future is far from bright paving the way for the Terminator's return, or as the man himself said, 'I'll be back.'",10,4,5,1 August 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Must own for war movie fans
","This movie could be classified as two short movies with reoccurring characters, but this is not detrimental to the movie as it shows the stages that the soldiers go through from raw recruits, to new arrivals to battle hardened veterans. The first part of this movie thanks to R Lee Ermey's, whose performance was phenomenal, real life experience as a drill sergeant made it really authentic and believable as the recruits went through their basic training, the fact that Kubrick let Ermey improvise his lines is an indication of how strong his performance was. The rest of the cast didn't need to act as if they were terrified of him as the genuinely were. In the second half, the movie focuses on Matthew Modine's Private Joker's time in Vietnam who observes the dehumanising effect of the war on both himself and fellow recruits, amid the carnage and bloodshed, when he sees first hand the war for the hell it really is. Now in comparing it with Platoon, as I've said in my review of that movie, you can't really compare it with this as they depict two very different aspects of the war. That movie depicts the war in jungle, whereas this movie, especially part two portray the urban warfare of the Tet Offensive, particularly the bitter bloody street fighting in Hue, which the Americans had to deal with the enemies underhanded tactics such as snipers and booby traps, and as a result has been described by some historians as the Stalingrad of the Vietnam war. In summary this movie is an authentic depiction of what raw recruits went through in the Vietnam war, and how they had to adapt to the hellish conditions which they fought, a must own for all war movie lovers.",9,0,1,28 January 2017
Southpaw," Tried and tested formula works again.....
","People have slated this movie because the basic storyline has been done before, boxer is on top, loses everything and hits rock bottom, reinvents himself and gets back on top. Yes the storyline may have been done a few times before, but there's a reason for that and its simple, it makes for a good story and it works, and Southpaw does it very well. Jake Gyllenhaal is nothing short of a revelation as Billy Hope who goes through every human emotion possible as his ideal life is shattered and he has to pick up the pieces. Although her role was very brief Rachel McAdams likewise turned in a brilliant performance as Maureen and as is Oona Laurence as daughter Leila whose world is turned upside down by event not of her own making. Forrest Whittaker as trainer father figure and mentor Tick Wills was superb, and 50 Cents as your stereotypical boxing promoter did the job solidly enough. Miguel Gomez as the antagonist likewise turns in a surprisingly good performance as someone who wants what the protagonist has. The boxing scenes were really well done and were authentic thanks to the use of the HBO announcers and Jimmy Lennon Jr. To summarise Southpaw does have a plot which has been done before but it does it very well and thanks to the acting, the movie is worth watching and owning.",9,1,1,30 September 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Excellent sequel
","I may be one of those rare people who believe that the movie didn't suffer because Arnold's character had gone from villain to hero, in fact the change is explained when John Connor encounters the Terminator for the first time, and the explanation provided is actually plausible as machines and computers can be reprogrammed and it isn't actually the same Terminator as before. Robert Patrick does a surprisingly good performance as the T-1000 and is just as merciless and frightening and more resourceful as his counterpart in the previous movie, and at times displays a sadistic side. Sarah Connor undergoes somewhat of a transformation from damsel in distress to a formidable warrior whose not afraid to get stuck in, and Linda Hamilton makes the transition look easy. The part of John Connor is depicted by Edward Furlong who goes from problem child to troubled child in a relatively short time. The other characters, although minor support the main cast well enough, particularly Earl Boen as Dr Silberman. The action and fight sequences are some of the best and more memorable ones of the 90's, and the ending is actually very moving and ends on a cautiously optimistic note. In some cases you get a sequel which doesn't spoil your experience of its predecessor, and this is one of those, a must have for action movie and sci-fi lovers.",9,0,0,30 August 2015
Twilight," Boring and more wooden than the Amazon.
","For a movie about vampires, werewolves and romance, this movie is really bland, with a capital B. So many scenes could only be described as a waste of time, with nothing happening, and I mean nothing, just close up shots of Edward, Bella, Jacob or some other minor character whose name, surprise surprise I've forgotten, put it another way this movie has more stares than the Empire State Building. The plot was just, well I can't describe it, simply because at times there isn't one, teenage girl moves to town, falls in love with other moody teenager who warns her off to save her from him, turns out moody teenager is a killer vampire, all be it the most unconvincing I've ever seen, girl doesn't care and goes after him, even after he stalks her, controls her and even threatens to kill her (face palm). In fact the relationship, and I use that term loosely, could be described as Edward being controlling and manipulative the early warning signs of domestic abuse. Anyway moving on, the acting was wooden, unemotional and dull, the dialogue was awkward and misplaced and the imagery was laughable, and what was with the glow in the first place, I don't know. Some other people found it unintentionally funny but I didn't, the two hours I spent watching it I'll never get back. Unless your fan of the book then avoid this like the plague. I wasted two hours watching this crap, don't waste your time like I did.",1,3,5,1 July 2017
I Am Legend," Worth watching but the novel is still superior
","This was not a bad movie and it is fascinating enough to grab my attention to the end, Will Smith plays the isolated Robert Neville very well, we get the sense of desperation, despondency and at times despair from someone in a very dire position and also the sense of the monster when Neville becomes little better than the creatures he his in conflict with. The scene with Sam the dog is very touching and again, we get the feeling of despair and sorrow from Neville. The infected are nothing short of frightening and unpredictable, they become strong and fast, but I felt they had more in common with the zombie's from the computer game Resident Evil as they become more animalistic and the infected lose their minds and their humanity which takes away what made them interesting in the original story. The story is fascinating enough but a little too simplistic and the ending is very moving but a bit too predictable and not as compelling as the one in the novel. Overall this movie is definitely worth a watch and it has a lot to offer as a movie, but the book still made for a more compelling and interesting story.",7,1,1,25 July 2015
Avatar," Visually stunning but unoriginal story-line.....
","SPOILER ALERT! The story line of this movie is basically this, soldier goes to infiltrate a native people/tribe to spy on them by unscrupulous commanders/employer, soldier comes to sympathize with the tribal people and changes sides to fight his own people, sound familiar? Then think of The Last Samurai/The Mission etc in outer space and you get the idea of the direction of the story, not to say the movie doesn't do it well, but its been done so many times before. The cast as a whole are solid but a little too predictable, you can tell which character will fill which role just by looking at them, you know right away Sam Worthington will be the hero, Stephen Lang the villain etc. Away from the repetitive plot and predictable characters, the visual effects of the movie are some of the best I've ever seen, Pandora is stunning, poisonous atmosphere aside, the wildlife is actually believable as are the Na'vi as an intelligent life form from another world. If you like great special effects and stunning visual imagery, this movie is for you, but don't expect an original plot with any surprises.",7,0,0,23 July 2017
Chariots of Fire," Great movie, however......
","I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, the stories of the two athletes Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddel are captivating, both having to make extreme sacrifices often at their own personal expense. The tension in the build up to the final races could be felt while watching it, particularly the 100 meters when the finalists are getting ready in the changing room. Although it was a real shame to see another Cambridge athlete Douglas Lowe who won gold in the 800 meters refused to be involved in the film. Also as a sports fan, I was disappointed that the main star of the 1924 Olympics was not even mentioned, the Phantom Finn Paavo Nurmi, who astonishingly won the 1500 and the 5000 meters within one hour of each other, setting Olympic records in both events, and Ville Ritola who also did a double of his own the steeplechase and the 10,000 meters while finishing second behind Nurmi in the 5000 meters. Bit of a mistake excluding the Flying Finns but as this movie was about British athletes, maybe that's why we only saw glimpses of them dominating their events during Eric Liddel's monologue when we see the Cambridge athletes struggling to compete. Anyway exclusions aside this movie is well worth a watch, its inspirational and it shows if your willing to work for something you can achieve anything if you set your mind to it.",8,1,1,20 June 2015
The Hurricane," Well why let the truth get in the way of a good story?
","People have asked why didn't Denzel get the Oscar for this performance? Well first off it wasn't because the acting was bad by any means, he gives a very strong performance, which is why he was nominated to begin with. So why the Oscar went somewhere else was because of the distortion of the events this movie was based on. Lets start with the main man himself, the movie depicts Ruben Carter as a noble person who was the victim of racism and injustice, were as the real Carter was an unstable violent character with an extensive criminal record. Now the events the movie got wrong, Carter did not stab a child molester as a juvenile, it was assault and robbery. Carter was dishonourably discharged from the army and declared unfit for service, he was not the highly decorated solider depicted here. Carter was not robbed of the middleweight crown, Joey Giardello won the fight fairly, even Carter himself admitted this. Carter's boxing career was in decline at the time of his arrest, he was not about to challenge for the title. The main detective was not the foul mouthed racist who was obsessed with getting Carter, in reality he never met Carter before the murders, he rarely swore and was a sensitive individual due to a facial wound received during WW2, he couldn't have been present at the Federal Court hearing, he died years before. The Canadians did not find new evidence, neither did anyone else and nobody tampered with their car. Carter WAS tried by an all white jury in his first trial, but the second jury had two black members. I could go on and on about what the movie got wrong but there isn't enough space, this movie butchers so many facts and ruins the reputations of people, some of whom are not around to defend themselves. As I said before it's not a bad movie to be sure, however this is not a true telling of the story, by all means watch it but don't accept of what you see as fact.",5,11,16,19 June 2015
Pulp Fiction," A cinematic masterpiece
","When you think of crime classics my generation would think of this movie, and its easy to see why. The three stories which make up the movie's composition although different are all very compelling and keep the viewer gripped to the very end. Tarantino discovered an acting gem in John Travolta whose acting career at that point was in limbo and thanks to his brilliant performance in the role of Vincent Vega has enjoyed a resurgence, in fact this movie has the rarity of having all the cast turning in memorable performances, particularly Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson were all unforgettable and some of the most memorable dialogue of the decade, especially the bible quotation from Jules. This movie has been described as graphically violent and while violence is present, most of the violence actually occurs off-screen and its not as graphic as other movies of a similar genre, but what is depicted in the movie is the consequences of living the kind of lifestyle that the main characters choose to live, which in some cases prove to be dire, so I don't think the movie in any way glamorizes the criminal lifestyle. What do I think is in the brief case well that debate will rage on and on so I'm not going to say. To summarize, the acting is great, the dialogue is some of the most memorable in recent history, the pacing is spot on, the action and violence is not as graphic or as over the top as some would think. All in all this movie is unforgettable and a must own for all movie fans.",10,1,2,16 September 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Different but still good
","When comparing this adaptation to Stoker's novel, it is more faithful than others but the story has an added element to it, that of romance and love over time. This element along with the back story at the beginning and the explanation as to why Dracula is the way he is, makes him a more complex character, you think of him more as a tragic hero, and as such puts him in a more sympathetic light than his pure evil counterpart in the book. Gary Oldman as the title character is brilliant as he displays the Count's many different faces, from the tragic hero, to the monster to the charming seductive younger version, so much so you almost pity him when he meets his demise at the end. The rest of the cast, with one exception are all very good as well, Anthony Hopkins as the legendry hunter Van Helsing in particular is excellent. The only downside was Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, his performance, accent included was very unconvincing and wooden. Winona Ryder in her duel role as Mina/Elisabeta is another one who stands out, her performance was really convincing as someone who was at first terrified, then falls for the Count. The movie portrays both 1897 London and Transylvania perfectly, it is also well paced, you feel gripped by it and the chase at the end is very exciting and makes for a good ending.The actual story, like the title character is more complex with added elements that make it fascinating and the changes don't adversely affect it. If your a fan of the original novel, then this is an adaptation you'll really appreciate and enjoy, just be prepared for a different and more complex but not a weaker story.",8,1,3,11 May 2018
The Lion King," Brilliant, no other words needed.....
","The Lion King is not just my favourite animated movie, its one of my favourite movies in its own right. The animation was amazing, and captured the essences of the Savannah brilliantly. The story and plot was one which people of all ages, not just children, could follow and understand, an impressive achievement for an animated movie, one scene in particular wouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, no matter what age the viewer may be, such was its emotional power. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen, particularly James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons, and of course Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who at times were flat out hilarious as Timon and Pumba. The music and songs didn't disrupt the scenes they were in, if anything they added to it, particularly the opening song The Circle Of Life which was the best opening to an animated movie I've seen so far. Some have criticized the portrayal of certain animals like the hyena's and the movie doesn't depict life on the plains accurately, well the correct response to that is, its only a story and it isn't meant to as its not a nature documentary. This is a timeless classic which will never age, the fact that it took twenty years for another animated movie to overtake it as the highest-grossing animated movie is a testament to just how brilliant this movie is. A classic which all the family will enjoy.",10,11,14,22 July 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Proof that box office takings aren't everything.
","When I heard that this movie bombed at the box office during its theatrical run, I was very surprised as this is simply an all time classic. Rarely is narration in a movie been done as well as this, Morgan Freeman simply becomes Ellis Redding whose depiction of a hardened con who has accepted that he may never get out and goes through his parole hearings not caring about the outcome. Tim Robbins becomes Andy Dufresne and his portrayal of a man who is really out of his depth and his element, and finding adjusting to life on the inside difficult, almost impossible. The changing relationship between the two characters from initial hostility to deep almost brother like friendship is captivating. Clancy Brown's depiction of the tyrannical Captain Baron Hadley is amazing and likewise Bob Gunton as the hypocritical bible bashing, Warden Norton. The other characters like wise are also well done, especially Brooks and sadistic inmate Boggs. The depiction is what you'd expect from a prison movie and while depicting a life of boring monotony and routine show occasionally punctuated by brief moments of excitement is still fascinating thanks to the soundtrack and of course Morgan Freeman's narration, and I don't want to spoil the ending but it climaxes perfectly with not a dry eye in sight, thanks to the pacing, and the dialogue can't be faulted. Now in regard to the differences from the book, these are for the most part minor and if anything enhance the story rather than hinder it, a rarity. In summary this is a must watch for all movie lovers.",10,0,2,30 July 2015
Platoon," Brutal but honest.....
","Of all the war movies I've seen, this is probably one of the most honest and non-romantic depictions of the 20th centuries longest war I've seen. Its a hard movie to watch but its meant to be as it shows the war for the hell it really was, its authenticity cannot be praised enough thanks to Oliver Stone's personal experiences that he went through when serving in the war. The actors put themselves through a tough boot-camp in order for an accurate portrayal and it showed, they didn't have to act exhausted and weary as they genuinely were. Charlie Sheen's depiction as the naive bright eyed college kid who joined up for romantic reasons, but quickly learns the harsh realities of the war is one of the more memorable. likewise Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe as two battle hardened but morally very different veterans are also very memorable. The fighting and battle scenes again are unforgettable and accurate and the show just what the American solders were up against and how slippery and how hard the NVA and the VC could be to pin down. One aspect of the movie which I found refreshing was it didn't attempt to picture the Americans as angels, it showed that they could be no better or sometimes worse than the enemy they were fighting. Now in comparison with Full Metal Jacket, this movie is no better or worse, as it depicts a different aspect of the war than this movie, this movie depicts the type of fighting the soldiers had to do before the Tet Offensive, jungle warfare, where-as Full Metal Jacket depicted urban warfare in the Tet Offensive. So if you want an non-sugar coated, accurate and authentic portrayal of the Vietnam war, then this movie is for you.",9,8,10,29 April 2016
Casino," A classic
","Many have said that this was Goodfellas on a grander scale, and in many ways they're correct, but this isn't detrimental to the movie. The story is a fascinating look at how one of the most iconic cities came to be and how the influence and money of the Mafia built the world famous Las Vegas strip, how the Mafia's empire in Vegas came to be and in the end how (and in some cases literally) it came crashing down. The use of narration is well done and the acting is simply brilliant, Robert De Niro is in top form as the flamboyant bookmaker turned casino manager Sam 'Ace' Rothstein whose tyrannical no nonsense management style would contribute to his downfall. Joe Pesci picks up from where he left off in Goodfellas playing psychotic enforcer Nicky Santorio brilliantly whose violent temper ends up bringing trouble to just about everyone he comes into contact with. L.Q. Jones turns in an underrated performance as the deceptive commissioner Pat Webb, whose easy going good ole boy exterior disguises his real power and influence. Likewise James Woods portrayal of the sleazy pimp Lester Diamond while brief was well done. Onto Frank Vincent and I couldn't help but think he got some satisfaction over getting his own back on Joe Pesci when near the end he does to him what Pesci did to his character in Goodfellas, I think its safe to say he enjoyed that. But the star of the show is Sharon Stone who turns in an outstanding performance as the prostitute turned hustler Ginger McKenna whose devotion to her former pimp boyfriend, her drinking and drug addictions and her reckless behaviour would end up leading to her ultimate demise, Stone put herself through the grinder for the movie, losing so much weight the production team were actually worried about her, changing her hair styles and the emotional outbursts which were done brilliantly, and Stone's performance as a result was Oscar worthy. The portrayal of the mob bosses was also very well done, particularly Pasquale Cajano as Remo Gaggi, who gave a convincing performance as a ruthless mob boss. The rest of the supporting cast were all solid, Kevin Pollak, Alan King, Don Rickles and Billy Allison all turned in fine performances. The movie has got some criticism for its level of violence and profanity but this is the world of organised crime which wasn't exactly known for its eloquence and for its gentleness when it came to 'taking care' of things, so a subtler approach wouldn't have been an accurate depiction of the people and the events the movie is based on. So for those fans of gangster movies and even for history lovers like me this movie is a must see.",10,2,4,27 November 2015
Heat," Epic thriller that packs a punch.
","Finally we got to see two of the greatest actors of our generation together, and it didn't disappoint. De Niro and Pacino play similar characters on opposite sides of the law, who won't hesitate to kill the other should the opportunity arise. The scene in the coffee shop was perfect, a face off between the two stars which worked as they were sworn enemies. The plot, although simple, was thought provoking and managed to avoid most of the clichÃ©s associated with this film genre. De Niro and Pacino, although they don't share much screen time, are on top form and deliver brilliant performances. Likewise the rest of the cast are excellent. The shootouts and chases were some of the best I've seen in movies and looked genuinely authentic. This movie is a brilliant crime thriller and a must own, it doesn't disappoint, watch and enjoy one of the most iconic face offs in cinema history.",9,1,2,27 August 2017
300," Surprisingly good
","When I first heard of this movie and it was based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller, I was half expecting another Braveheart, and in regard to the basic storyline and battle scenes that's what I got, a king fighting for his people's freedom against a greedy tyrant and memorable battle scenes, and the demonizing of the invaders, in this case the Persians. The Spartan society was on the whole rather harsh and cruel, unsurprising considering its warrior status designed to weed out the weak, and a lot of aspects of this were omitted. However Frank Miller and Zack Synder have said this movie never meant to be historically correct, it was essentially a propaganda story being told by a survivor from Thermopylae to rally the Greek army before going into battle. But this movie wasn't as inaccurate as I thought it would be, it contained actual quotes from accounts taken at the time, some battle scene's were authentically accurate and the depiction of the back story of Leonidas was on the most part correct with the exception of the final rite of passage. So to summarize this movie was entertaining and inspirational.",8,1,3,10 July 2015
Braveheart," Historically inaccurate but its not a documentary
","As a history lover I found elements of the plot simply absurd. As said before it couldn't have been more inaccurate if Wallace had ordered in the heavy artillery or sent in the air strikes. Historically it was a nonsense and probably one of the most inaccurate movies I've ever seen. The story seems to be hand picked from various periods of history and mixed together to make what can only be described as a curious hybrid time piece. That said however this is a movie whose main aim was to entertain the viewing audience, not an educational documentary, and it succeeded in its aim. The acting was good, the battle scenes were brutal, memorable and exciting, the antagonist was conniving ruthless and cunning, all must have qualities for any villain, and the protagonist was brave, noble and charismatic, the plot itself wasn't overly complex and captivating enough to see the movie through to the end, it spawned a number of memorable quotes and the ending was very moving. So by all means watch this movie as it is entertaining, but don't take it as an accurate portrayal of the actual historical figures and events its based on.",6,2,5,21 June 2015
Goodfellas," See it to believe it
","As far back as I can remember, this has been one of my favourite movies. This is a brutally honest and authentic depiction of the Mafia in New York and how they got their fingers in every pie available. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Henry Hill, who we see go from impressionable child to career criminal and finally a beleaguered nervous wreck. Ray Liotta turns in his best performance in the role, Joe Pesci likewise as Tommy DeVito is brilliant in his genuinely terrifying performance of the unstable and merciless mobster. Robert De Niro, although not as psychotic is just as ruthless and frightening in his part as Jimmy Conway, the mob enforcer who could easily be shaking your hand one minute, then shooting you in the head the next, as shown when he has most of the crew who helped in the Lufthansa heist murdered without so much a second thought. The rest of the cast are also brilliant particularly Lorraine Bracco as the impressionable wife of the mobster who finds herself at first attracted by the life and then terrified of it, and Paul Sorvino as the ultimate Mob boss who can bring people into line with just a look. Special mention for Frank Vincent, who, although not in the movie for very long turns in a memorable performance as Billy Batts whose arrogance would end up costing him dear. Goodfellas shows every aspect of the life of a mobster, including its dark and ugly side which shows how high the price can be for the perceived glamorous lifestyle, so I don't agree with the train of thought that it glamorizes organised crime, and its depiction of the lifestyle is feels very real and authentic. This movie is a definitive movie of the ages and one of the best ever made.",10,0,0,27 August 2017
