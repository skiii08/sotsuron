Iron Man 3," Not worth watching
","The trailers make this movie look great, the fact of the matter is the only good part of the movie are in the trailers. I wish i could un watch this movie and go back to how ironman was left in ironman 2. RDJ acting was still up to standard. The SFX were pretty decent. The story line was on par with a Disney cartoon. I see a lot of people talking about the comic books, but i have never read a comic book in my life, and based on that my review is based on the movie and the movie alone. The bad guys were pretty cool, apart from the lack of story line and back story. The many flaws in the story line, the fact that tony was able to fix a problem, that had been worked on for 13 years by a think tank, in a few minutes. ohh so many flaws.I have given this a 2 out of 10 only because the few action scenes in the movie are really good, and almost bring it up to ironman standard.",2,3,8,4 May 2013
