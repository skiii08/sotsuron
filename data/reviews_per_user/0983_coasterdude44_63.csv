Ford v Ferrari," All gassed up and ready to burn
","Great movie with a top notch performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, a fun ride with some very well shot an directed race sequences. It follows the true story of the Ford company expanding themselves financially and Bale's character training to win the 1966 Le Man's cup. It does run for quite a while. 2 and a half hours but it rarely drags and is entertaining and heartfelt the whole way through. Also a pretty funny movie to with a bit of comedy sprinked here and there but definitely has it's serious moments too.The movie is definitely a period piece and the movie nails it for the time period it is set in. It's some really well though out production design and visual choices for the atmosphere of this movie. Some very nice car models are put to good use in the movie which are very appealing to the eye. Overall a very well made movie about the competition between two monumental car companies and the tale of a man with his passion for racing",7,0,1,23 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Breathtaking, Beautiful, Desolate
","Dennis Veuville has nailed it with a long awaited sequel to the Sci-Fi classic Blade Runner. With unique and top class production design and a great performance from Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, 2049 paints a picture of a beautiful but desolate future where replicants live alongside humans with tension between the two. Joe played by Ryan Gosling is a replicant trying to find a place in the society he lives in with secrets to uncover about his past.The whole atmosphere this movie creates is bleak, pristine and stunning with production design so detailed and meticulously crafted with so much thought and planning going into the style and identity of the world of this movie. It has to be the best worldbuilding of 2017 in a movie that's for sure, and the musical score hits all the right emotional tones that the world of the movie conveys, bleak, cold, unforgiving. 2049 is a work of art in the Sci-Fi genre and is a new milestone in what can be done with it. The best sequel in a very long time",8,1,10,9 February 2020
Blade Runner 2049," The best sequel of the decade, pulls you into the world of Sci-fi like few films do
","When it comes to sci-fi filmmaking, there are few films that are able to achieve the sense of detail and pure worldbuilding and atmosphere than Blade Runner 2049. The sense of craft and detail that was put into this film is purley mesmerising and I find more ways to look at it the more times I watch it.Ryan Gosling plays a spectacular performance a Joe, a replicant trying to find the purpose of his existence as he spends his time walking through crowds, flying around in his space car, and going through countless psychological tests to prove that he is not insane. The production design in 2049 is visually stunning and beautifuly crafted creating an immersive world full of tone and atmosphere.The movie is stunningly and sharply shot with many awe inspiring sequences in a world that feels alive and breathing. Harrison Ford also plays a great performance in it given the short time he is on screen.Overall it is a great and masterfully directed sequel to a unique and iconic sci-fi franchise filled with delicately crafted atmosphere and wonder. It's actually very relaxing to watch and puts you into that mood every time",8,0,10,15 December 2019
First Man," The Place Between Wonder and Fear
","First Man is an excellent example of how cinematography and camerawork used the right way can put you straight into the mind of another person to where you can completely understand and feel exactly what type of emotion the character is feeling and what is going through their head at any moment without saying a single word, at least that's what I took away from this film and the Apollo mission sequences. At first, I thought Ryan Gosling at firs was a strange casting choice by the film to play Neil Armstrong, but he was great in the movie and I don't really think any current actor on 2018 could have done any better acting wise in the role than what he did. During the NASA and spaceflight segments, there was just something about him that was able to convey so much emotion from just his eyes and body language that could tell that he was scared, tense yet excited and able to withstand any sense of danger or problem that was thrown at him in a deadly scenario which I don't think I've seen before. There was a very ruthless nature to his character with this blend of wonder and fear which is what drives him. I don't really know that much about Neil Armstrong and what he was like as a person, but Gosling's performance during the docking and moon landing sequence really did give me a deeper insight into just what he must have been feeling and experiencing and that. I thought he could have done better in the non-NASA segments dialogue wise, but I can't really think of how or what he could have done to pull that off, there were no huge problems with his performance or part in the film, so I really can't complain.
I really did like the feeling of claustrophobia in how the mission sequences were shot that really does give you a very first-person experience of what it was like to be piloting in those capsules and the sound design really did enhance that experience. Just the way the film is directed really likes to put you in that emotional place between wonder and fear, followed by the feeling awe and achievement which is really it's biggest strength and does it very well which is the most important thing I took away from it. The soundtrack was also great and fit the atmosphere of the film very well. First Man isn't perfect, but it is breathtaking for what it is and is one of the best, if not the best I've seen this year. Damien Chazelle once again did a fantastic job directing wise and I hope it wins some Oscars.",8,1,4,14 October 2018
Alien 3," Not as bad as many say it is. Very entertaining but not enough aliens
",Sigourney Weaver was great in the movie and was definitely the highlight of the film. The setting was unique and the whole religious cult that was going on with the inmates was interesting. Not as tense as the previous two with almost zero action unlike the previous Aliens. Worth watching once if you're viewing the Alien franchise movie by movie,6,1,2,5 March 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Amazing! Technically not a horror movie. But it's the scariest I've seen in a while
","This movie is so much smarter and more complex than your average run of the mill horror movie crap that comes out recently. This film does away with all the disgustingly cheap jumpscares and gives you something much more that many people can relate to. The unnerving emotions of uncertainty, doubt, intimidation, claustrophobia and powerlessness. They are all in this movie and all come from the paranoia that starts to grow between Michelle and Howard, and that you don't know whether Howard is insane or what he claims is actually true. Either way you are scared of this guy because you know he's just not well and is probably a murdering psychopath with severe control issues.Less is more is the philosophy that drives this movie and I won't dare spoil what happens in this movie since i knew nothing about it going in. Please see this movie, it's awesome. It was a total surprise and is one of the most heart pounding thrillers in a while. This is a scary movie done right",9,0,3,2 May 2016
It," A scary follow up to the origional adaptation, a quality horror film
","Definitley don't watch this one if you have a fear of clowns. Pennywise is back in this chilling remake of the classic Stephen King adaptation, located in the town of Derry, the menace known as Pennywise the clown is terrorising victims preying on their fears. When these attacks become more and more common. A group of teenage recluses decide to find out the source of the evil clown and face every one of their fears to defeat the clownThe film did great on many aspects, it's a very well paced and intracatley shot movie with genuine scares and moment of horror. Pennywise is mysterious and fearful which is fitting to the movie very well. He is entertaining aswell as very creepy looking thanks to his design and makeup. The child and teenage actors are all great and are believable and play their roles very well.I'm not really a big fan of horror, but I'll see one every now and then but this movie did impress me with it's scares and character development. Kudos to the DOP for making this movie shine and look suspenseful, which the movie is abuntant with. I do like it more than the original IT and do think it's a huge step forward in rebooting the franchise, but I'm only going to see this one, this is my limit when it comes to horror. I'm too scared to see the sequel",7,0,1,11 December 2019
A Star Is Born," Everyone Matters
","From watching this film it has become very obvious to me what it was trying trying to say, no one is any more special than anyone else and that we are all born with the ability to achieve whatever we want, whenever we wan't and there is nothing getting in the way from whatever you want to achieve except for your own excuses and insecurities. 'I can't perform, my nose is too big!'It's always been that way and it always continue to be that way where the only thing that's stopping you from achieving your own dreams, goals, ambitions, fame, fortune or whatever it is has always been yourself, and if your wan't to get out there no matter who you are, you have to look past your own faults and do the work. This is what I thought the message of the film was. Fame the way society sees it is an illusion and is only earned by the people who equally put the same amount of passion and work in . Becoming a celebrity is nothing more than a test of passion and the will to achieve. The film also had a lot to say about how the world really works and how people's problems are unavoidable and come from everywhere, but how it favours the people who still go ahead anyway. You CAN do it is the movie in four words. Can natural born talent be lost, who knows? maybe it can. But the film is also trying to say that it's still better to get out there and give it a shot that give up and stay feeling like nobody, you have nothing to lose.
The film itself at a lot of times almost felt like it was trying to emotionally parody itself, there were some dramatic scenes with Ally that you almost couldn't take seriously. In a way it almost felt like an emotional joke, but it was a good joke because it completely supported the message of the film and what it was trying to say. Just see it, it's a very rare kind of film that speaks the truth of how the world works and how people see fame which I think Bohemian Rhapsody is going to share a lot of the same themes in one way or another. Just see it, there won't be another film like this for a very long time",8,3,7,31 October 2018
Iron Man 2," A step down from the last Iron Man movie, but still entertaining installment in the MCU franchise
","An entertaining sequel and a competent continuation in the Marvel franchise, the film is focussed more on Tony Stark's personal life and his contribution to to his company of Stark Industries. The cgi special effects have improved from the first film quite a bit and the characters are just as entertaining as ever. The film does lull a bit in some parts and is a bit unevenly paced, however the action scenes do make up for some of the parts that drag on a bit longer than others.It is my least favourite film in the trilogy but it still makes up for some of it's flaws, it could have been handled much worse as the realm of sequels is always rocky to tread on in a lot of ways. But if you're a fan of Marvel this movie wont disappoint you and I do recommend it",7,1,1,11 December 2019
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A remarkable acheivment in the fantasy genre and a great film adaptation of the C.S Lewis Novel
",This film has always been a favourite of mine and is a magical experience for anyone who experiences it. It fantasy escapism at its finest and will stay with you long after the movie is over. The child actors are all great and and play their characters very well. The cgi effects were great for the time and the music is enchanting.Overall a very finely crafted fantasy adventure film for the whole family. Memorable characters and great direction. See it if you haven't seen it already,7,0,0,18 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," Still Swinging after all these years
","Spider-Man 2 is still my favourite film of the original Sam Raimi trilogy for a number of reasons. It really does feel like it's faithful to the comics and really does feel like a comic-book put to film. The story is well paced and never feels bland, dull or feels like it drags in any scenes. It is a very fast moving film that introduces a number of important characters very well with style and class. It is also a very crisp looking film which is very smartly shot and written with character that do feel three dimensional. Otto Octavious in this film is an electrifying villan and still the best out of the original trilogy aswell as the newer MCU films aswell, who is only topped by Octavius in the PS4 Spider-Man game when it comes to character.Overall the character development and story in the film is very depthed with entertaining action sequences. The Hero speech from Aunt May is still heartfelt after all these years. It does feel corny in some part of the movie but that's all part of the movie's charm. It's still an awesome ride after over a decade",7,0,0,20 November 2019
Chicken Run," The best Arrdman Animation feature
","Another childhood favourite of mine, with brilliant stop motion animation and a great atmospheric soundtrack tells the emotional story of chickens trying to escape their farm from Mr and Mrs Tweedy's oppressive rule over the farm. Mel Gibson as Rocky was a memorable character in the movie as well as all the others. The chicken pie machine sequence is still a marvel of stop motion animation and the whole movie is beautiful looking with such detailed and thoughtfully crafted sets and backdrops, as well as some very good voice acting for most of the chicken characters and some great humorOverall my favourite full length feature from Aardman and is one that you should definitely consider watching if you haven't already",10,0,0,7 December 2019
Home Alone," Always hilarious every time. A christmas film that will never age or lose it's magic touch
","Mackauly Culkin played the perfect role of Kevin McCallister in this genre defining Christmas comedy. It is full of the iconic gags and heartfelt story that everyone has grown to love over the years. Every Christmas it is tradition that I'll sit down and watch Home Alone and laugh every time. Kevin was comedic genius in the movie with Joe Peschi and the other actor I can't remember as Harry and Marv, the wet bandits.The McCallister house is an iconic location when it comes to Christmas movies with memorable and quirky characters such as Buzz, Kevin's brother as well as Kevin's parents which Kevin hates for some reason.When Kevin is left alone at home though, he has the house to himself and hilarious folly ensues. Kevin acting is great as the movie goes on. And the movie has a very heartwarming ending",8,2,3,19 December 2019
Aquaman," Defintley the best standalone DC movie by far
","I was surprised just how entertaining and enjoyable this film was. It was awkward at times but there was some great humor and Jason Momoa played a satisfying role as Aquaman and was a great fit for the character. The story felt large in scale, the production design was unique and interesting and the visual effects were stunning. The chemistry between Arthur and Mera was great too with some great moments of humor.It was a overall a very well directed and fun Boxing Day blockbuster and probably DC's best standalone film which brought an interesting origin story and broughtas much justice as they could to a DC character that hardly anyone can actually take seriously at this point. The movie itself was silly, but it the story was interesting enough with a great cast supporting the characters and was overall a very fun movie with some incredible sequences of action.",7,1,1,29 December 2018
Aquaman," Best DC movie to date, full of fun, adventure and underwater wonder
","Jason Moama smashes it as Aquaman, aswell as Nicole Kidman who plays Aquaman's mother, Willem Dafoe also plays a good role aswell. Filled with unique and interesting production design, James Wan directs a great end of year blockbuster that finally gives some dignity to the often laughed at DC character for being a pushover and lame, not in this movie. This movie made Aquaman cool again and is a huge box office success. Awesome",7,1,4,30 December 2019
Alien," Classic Sci-Fi horror film which set the tone for future films to come
","In a world where previous sci-fi horror films were usually B-Movie films like the blob and Them, aswell as Hitchcock films like The Birds, Rear Window and of course Psycho, the horror genre never really tried to be overly complex or masterful like the way this film tried to be. Ridley Scott was able to create a Science Fiction world feel complex and believable as well as tangible. The Nostromo Ship has a very decayed and accomidated feel to it which makes it feel like you're with the characters in the setting as the tension and horror begins to rise and unfold.The practical effects used for the Xenomorph and the Facehuggers were very complex and detailed for the time and the chestburster scene is a classic scene in horror that has been imitated in future film's from it's impact on the audience. Sigourney Weaver played such an incredible female protagonist as we feel her dread as the movie progresses. The final half an hour of the film is pure Sci-Fi Horror mastery with sustained tension and adrenalin throughout. The film is directed to feel cramped and claustrophobic with the focus on the alien's whereabouts as it's always shrouded in darkness until the very end, showing as little visual contact of the creature throughout the film until the finale where the monster is shown in all it's glory. The imagery of the Xenomorph itself is iconic in movie monster history being a very creative and intimidating design which had so much thought and planning into it's design and studying how it thinks which important just how to scare and satisfy the audience watching the revolutionary new take on horror. It's a directing style that was unique to the time adding more nuance and subtleness to the genre. The film is perfectly paced from start to finish yet never drags or feels boring in any of it's scenes. John Hurt also plays a great performance of the victim of the facehugger as thee whole imagery of it is incredibly creepy which was never done before at that time. It's overall a chilling, atmospheric and adrenalin pumping movie which has incredible rewatch value that actually gets better the more times you watch it",8,0,1,2 January 2020
Elf," Fun, Clean but hilarious christmas movie anyone can enjoy
","This movie was a big part of my childhood and was something I would always sit down and watch countless times through all times of the year. It was one of those movies that really captured the Christmas spirit. Will Ferrel's humor isn't for everyone so some people won't appreciate the film as much as others, it is a family movie so don't expact anything too audacious, but the jokes and gags are defenitley satisfying and funnyI do think that this is a slightly underrated Christmas film which is overlooked but I do think it can be compared to films like Home Alone and The Santa Clause when it comes to it's levels of comedy. It's also a very nice looking film that makes good use with many of New York City's locations. It's a fine Christmas movie with cute and funny moments. Again some people will find Will Ferrel's humor in this film to be cringeworthy, but again it fits the movie and the character of Buddy the Elf, so if you enjoy this type of humor, you should love this film. It's always a fun time to watch during Christmas to put you in the mood for the holiday season",7,1,1,3 December 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best of the Captain America MCU Trilogy, A thrilling action blockbuster
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's one of the finest superhero movies ever made, it really made me feel satisfied and really blew me away on just how sharply shot the action was in this movie. It's at this point in time where the action directing in the MCU franchise really started to rise up dramatically and the action scenes in this movie are shot with clarity and prescision. The Winter Soldier is a great villan and really was the best villan in the MCU at that point. His design is slick and very modern looking and looks intimidating aswell which is exactly what you want from a superhero villan.Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers is also great in the movie as his character has grown stronger and is now living comfortably in 2010s America. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is back aswell and is awesome as always. The story has upped it's game and has become more emotional with some truly heart wrenching scenes aswell as some really good tension aswell when the characters clash against one anotherOverall a crisp, thrilling and just plain fun MCU movie with the best shot action at the time for a Marvel movie. It was my favourite Action movie of 2014 and my personal favourite in the Captain America MCU trilogy",8,2,3,11 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An incredible end to the Skywalker saga, Lived up to my expectations
","The Rise of Skywalker blew me away, with an incredibly imaginative and emotional story, Rey has finished her path to becoming a Jedi Master. With appearances from Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, it has it all with the characters playing their roles very well.The story feels complete and large in scale with lush and detailed cinematography and direction. Finn also shares a good amount of screen time in the movie and does great aswell. The lightsaber battles have been mastered in their craft and kinetic nature as the sequeces are dazzling and amazing. In the end it is a movie all about hope and redemption and was an amazing cinematic achievement and left me satisfied as a Star Wars fan as I left the theater. It is going to take a few more viewings for me to judge just where the movie falls in my personal favourite list of Star Wars films, but for me for the time being this was a more than satisfying end to the Skywalker saga",8,1,6,26 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great Success!
","The film about legendary singer and performer Freddie Mercury and his band Queen is here, which follows his life personal transformation alongside Queen from its origins in the early 70s with the formation of the band and its identity and all the events that led up to their Live Aid performance in 1985 at the peak of his musical career. The film shows the origin of Freddie Mercury as an artist and his inspiration and creation for arguably his greatest hit Bohemian Rhapsody and his drive and passion to try to innovate and create something people have never heard before, as well as the pushback he received from so many critics and record dealers, which showed the true nature of Queen of always doing it their way and knowing what the audience wants, and giving it to them.The film in a lot of ways does feel like A Star Is Born with the simple origins of a worldwide celebrity with Freddie and his fearlessness to achieve and experiment. How the inspiration behind some of their greatest songs started as small ideas that anyone could have of come up with at the time like the idea of audience interaction and foot stamping which became the riff of We Will Rock You which again innovated the band and rose it higher, in a way making it a pioneer of audience interaction when Queen performed live. Any band at the time could have done what Queen did, the only difference is that only Freddie and the band were passionate and daring enough to do it. It also showed how Queen was family to him and Freddie never had the idea of being a solo performer, it was him and the band which were unbreakable.
His sexuality is also clearly portrayed in the film as well as the relationship he had with Jim Beach and later became his partner, how critics slammed Queen's innovation and people started to leech of Mercury's fame and eventually the events that lead to his diagnosis of AIDS, and instead of letting it destroy himself and Queen, transformed himself into a beacon of hope worldwide with his legendary Live Aid performance as well as the legacy he left behind for AIDS research.I was sceptical at first when I saw this was being made. I have been a fan of Queen's music for a long time but I never really knew that much about the personal life of Freddie Mercury as well as the other members of the band apart from his music and sexuality. Just from the trailers it had a feeling of being rushed with a cheesy tone, not being completely faithful. After seeing it though I really do think it did everything it possibly could have done to stay true to long-time fans of Queen as well as educating people like me who still don't know that much about him as a person as well as successfully conveying and emotionally engaging biopic with near perfect casting. The film also has great cinematography, direction and is shot beautifully, as well as incredible music. It will arguably become the greatest biography film of the decade alongside The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything and is in my top 5 for the year. Definitely see it. Great success. Queen will live on forever!",9,2,4,8 November 2018
Baby Driver," One of 2017's coolest movies
","Incredible direction, action sequences, editing and music. This movie is a thrill ride from start to finish. Edgar Wright once again directs a compelling and entertaining kinetic action film with smart writing, memorable characters and a powerful story with a great soundtrack. To me it just gets better and better with each watch which really does show the power of sharp editing and incredible camera work, visual style and direction",8,1,3,19 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," An entertaing breath of fresh air from beginning to end
","This was an amazing thrilling adventure and definitely the best Spider-Man movie up there with Spider-Man 2 and Homecoming. The movie just seemed to do everything right for me and I can't think of any flaws or really anything I have wrong with it, it's practically a flawless Spider-Man movie and the best comic book film of the year alongside Infinity War and also the best animated movie of the year and one of the best of the decade.All the characters were very refreshing and a much needed change from previous comic book films and the humour and storytelling in it was just so fresh and entertaining. It was fun, creative, original and also very funny. I thought it was groundbreaking and is my favourite film of the year",10,7,13,24 December 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Still one of the greatest Action movies ever created, an incredible atmosphere and tone that few films have recaptured
","Terminator 2 is still a masterpiece after all these years and my personal favourite from James Cameron which is in my opinion his greatest work. The film is so incredibly directed with such style and thrilling action sequences, incredible acting and character development, plus the smart and revolutionary use of CGI that started a new revolution in filmmaking technology.With such an incredible and smartly written story that feels epic and massive in scale, it's all the characters that truly make this movie shine. All the human characters bleed with emotion and have completely understandable motivation behind their viewpoints. The greatest thing about this movie however to me is the musical score by Brad Fidel. It creates such a lucid atmosphere to this movie as it adds so many emotional layers so so many scenes which adds even more to the stakes and struggles of the characters. It's such a unique sound which often at times makes the movie feel dreamy and surreal which does reflect the tone of the movie, probably most of all Sarah Connor who in the movie is often completely overrun by pure emotion and crazed hatred over rationality most of the time which is why she's borderline psychotic in the first half of the film anyway.The film's core message is about humanity over technology which is a powerful message for sure and what technology could do one day, but most of all it's just an immensely satisfying action film with cutting edge effects and incredible atmosphere and incredible and unique identity which is why so many movie fans keep on coming back to this movie in particular, it's a classic and there are very few things about it that you can fault. So many future films built upon the structure and foundation this movie put in place and it's a masterful and resonant action film that ages better and better as time goes on",9,2,2,18 November 2019
Spider-Man," Still classic cinema fun after all these years
","I do have a lot of things to say about this movie. For one thing it was the first M rated movie I was fully exposed to, yes that's right Australian. So of course I fell in love with this movie at first watch. It does tell a fairly serious and somber tale of our main character Peter Parker. Who after being bitten by the radioactive spider is transformed into the titular Spider-Man, who is played brilliantly by Tobey MaguireThe whole transformation and the eventual buildup to him designing the suit and training his powers are all exciting and fun to watch, the organic web may bother some but I had no problem with it personallyWillem Dafoe plays an electrifying villain who is incredibly fun to watch as he constantly talks against himself and gets crazier and funnier throughout the filmAll the characters are memorable and tell an exciting story, the movie has aged very well for me and is still fresh and exciting after all these years. Also the score is still exciting and gives me chills.Kirsten Dunst is also a stunner and plays such a likeable character and the kiss scene is still magical after all these years. It's an iconic scene that never loses its impactThe finale against Peter and Norman is electrifying and tense and very well shot really closing the film with an epic and emotional conclusionIt still tells the tragic origin story of Peter as Spider-Man 2 will have a more upbeat and comedic vibe as we see Spider-Man sling into action once again",7,0,0,9 December 2019
Dunkirk," A new take on the terror of war
","Dunkirk is not like any other war movie I've ever seen and is another step up for Christopher Nolan and his directing style. It's a realistic documented account into the nature of a battle at sea and has minimal dialogue, instead just showing the emotion and raw manic of the situation that these men were in. The cinematography is sharp and crystal clear in what it's trying to communicate and the musical score is powerful and intense.Dunkirk is very good at building anxiety and tension throughout with it's pacing and weaving of story element between three main characters at points in the story. It's a modern new take on the WWII genre and is another stunning piece of work from Nolan",8,0,0,6 February 2020
The Lego Movie," Great fun and expertly crafted movie that entertains from beginning to end, and best of all it understands the mind of a child
","A brilliant ride from beginning to end with so many creative characters and an interesting story to tell, starring Chris Pratt as Emmet, he discovers he is 'The Special' and that it's up to him to take on Lord Business played by Will Ferrel. He meets a cast of crazy interesting characters such as Wildstyle as well as Batman who really does make the movie even cooler than it needs to be. The animation is crazy detailed and really made to look like stop motion with moving lego pieces which is all extremely vibrant, lively and expressive.The song 'Everyting is Awesome' is catchy and will stay stuck in your head for days after viewing. The humor is great and all the character are very smartly and sharply written and loaded with spark and personality. The whole movie is filled with personality and will leave you feeling satisfied and inspired from such a breath of fresh air in animation that will have you feeling awesome and making you want to play with your childhood legos all over again",8,0,0,7 December 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Anthoer Brilliant MCU movie from Marvel as the character's deepen even more and the universe expands
","Civil War is my second favourite Captain America movie in the MCU behind The Winter Soldier and is a more than entertaining action film to boot with some very crisply shot action sequences as the action filmmaking in this legendary film series just keeps on getting better and better and more sharply shot with every installment that comes out in this franchise. The Avengers are split down the middle when they realise every single time they save the world from total cataclysm and disaster, a few people die in the process, when Tony decides he need government control over the Avenger's Initative, Steve disagrees and says that they should still be free to do whatever they please, causing a tense rift dividing the Avengers into two conveniently divided faction set against one another (how convenient)Despite it's serious and political undertones which obviously was reflecting the Trump vs Hillary election of 2016 and the pure craziness and hilarity that unfolded leading up to the historic and fateful triumph of Trump over the US once again dividing American society even more than it needed to be where everyone is forced to 'pick a side' and fight against the opposing force. The film is still also very funny and hasn't lost it's recognisable humor that MCU fans love. Full of banter between the characters and quips and jokes dropped at a steady pace. You will be laughing aswell as getting deeper invested into the story and the darker tones the film dives into toward the end revealing more about the characters pasts and backstoriesThe CGI and special effects are once again spot on in the film, especially with Iron Man's suit which look better than it ever has before. The introduction of Tom Holland as Spider-Man was also nailed perfectly and the scenes he appeared in were all excellent and entertaining, setting the tone for the future MCU Spider-Man films to come.This was a very satisfying MCU film with great direction and sharply crafted action scenes and a deep and complex story. I did enjoy The Winter Soldier more however than this one though it is a satisfying third installment of the Captain America trilogy",7,1,3,6 December 2019
Spirited Away," First time viewer, loved every minute of it
","I'm not really one when it comes to Japanese animated movies but I saw this movie laying around in my local library and decided to give it a watch. I have watched My Neighbour Totoro many years ago but don't remember much about it. After watching it however I can understand why it's deserving of all the praise, it's an utterly beautiful movie.When it comes t the fluidity of the animation in Studio Ghibli movies, the animation does have a low frame rate and times look a little stutter, it might bother some people but not to me. The quality of the drawing and animation itself make up for it for just how detailed it is and the amount of craft and intricacy Miyazaki put into this world. I saw the making documentary of it aswell and just how much work was put into it aswell as the race against the deadline at the end of the production period.From what I saw, the studio and staff itself looked very friendly and creative. Easygoing but also focussed and determined when it came to finishing one of Miyazaki's projects. The man himself also looks very laid back and creative with a great personality unlike many directors today that can be very cocky and unlikeable when it comes to managing peopleOverall I had a very good time watching Spirited Away and I'll definitely watch it again and again in the future",8,0,0,9 March 2020
Inside Out," Inside Out, best Pixar movie of the 2010s
","I feel a lot of people misunderstood this movie when it first came out. Sure it's dark and moody and you witness the crumbling of an 11 year old girls personality quirks and interests, but the thing is that this movie does make sense when it comes to the emotions of a girl who had her life suddenly turned upside down and how she would have to deal with it. I do like the way this movie ends and the message it gives to whoever watches it, you're not alone. Is it completely scientifically accurate to how a preteen girl or boy thinks? no, but it is the most entertaining and interesting movie about how the mind and emotion works that I have seen in recent memory, are there other kids movies like this? maybe I've forgottenAll jokes aside I think this movie is going to be studied and talked about more and more as time goes on. Well done Pixar",8,1,1,16 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Practically Perfect
","This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with 'Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home' coming out later this yearOverall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get",10,3,5,7 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," It has all come down to this
","Avengers: Endgame was a masterpiece of epic proportions. With all the iconic characters coming together for one final last time to face the mighty and evil Thanos. Every characted is tested equally in endgame with a mighty dose of colour and CGI Special Effects with such crisply shot action scenes and an incredible soundtrack to boot, it will blow your mind and is a must see for any Marvel fan.With a hefty three hour run time the time will fly very quick for you with such an exciting story with incredible emotional and narrative heft, it's an incredible achievement from Marvel and will have you guessing just how the story will continue in the future",10,0,6,11 December 2019
District 9," Electrifying, Powerful and Original
","This will always be one of my favourite Science Fiction movies of all time, With such and incredible concept and brilliant story, this movie will have you hooked from start to finish. Starting out shot like a documentary, we follow the character of Wikus who is a groundkeeper of the Slums of District 9. Tension builds when he is exposed to an alien chemical which begins to slowly alter his DNA and transform him into an alien. Things get really scary really quickly for Wikus as he is captured by the MNU and is begun to be experimented upon, he escapes and returns to District 9 in hiding from the MNU. He begins to fit in with the alien creatures and feel for and understand them in ways he didn't before.This is an incredibly tense and realistically shot movie with some very harrowing sequences as well as some slick alien weapons that Wikus gets to try out in the end of the movie. The score is great aswell which really makes you feel the state of the ordeal that Wikus goes through in the film. It's just an incredible piece of Science Fiction and is one of the best of the noughties",10,2,2,21 November 2019
Toy Story 4," A great sequel that didn't need to exist but happy it does anyway
","I have always been a fan of the Toy Story films and have loved every film that has come out of the franchise as well as in general being a huge Pixar fan loving almost every movie that the studio has created. Now being 9 years since Toy Story 3 came out, the fourth and probably from many of the films choices the final film in the franchise is here.I was at first concerned when I first heard this movie was being made since it first seemed that it was going to mess with the emotional finality that the third film established. But after watching Toy Story 4, it comes as a very welcome extension aswell as new end to the franchise.Everything about this movie was fanstastic, from the incredibly detailed and beautiful looking animation aswell as the stunning locations and characters old and new. Forky was an excellent addition to the main cast of characters. I was scared he was going to be an annoying side character, but he ended up being quite a depth and layered character and was very enjoyable in the film.The reintroduction of Bo Peep was also great and also came a nice surprise that her character came with a much needed facelift, being much more outgoing, adventurous and independent for plot reasons I won't go into in this review. Her animation was also very beautiful looking aswell, since she is made of china. The movie's villain was also surprisingly depthed, and very refreshing in the way the character was executed.
Overall, I had a very fun time with Toy Story 4. It is probably the most mature of all four of the films with its main messages even though the film isn't as emotionally thematic as the previous film, but is still very heartwarming, enjoyable and beautiful looking film. If you're a Toy Story fan or just overall a Pixar fan in general, definitely see it. You will not be disappointed",8,1,4,2 July 2019
Batman Begins," Best Batman Origin story
","This is my favourite batman origin story out of them all. Christopher Nolan did fantastic work in reviving the Batman franchise after a long hiatus from the last dreaded Batman movie, Joel Sheumacher's Batman and Robin. Nolan was able to create such a depthed and detailed story about the psychology of Bruce Wayne and revived the character into a new modern world of realism which reflected the mid 2000s very well at the time.The worst thing about this movie however is how the action is shot, lots of hard and fast shots with the camera shaking around can hurt your eyes and must've given many Batman moviegoers a headache watching these closely shot combat scenes. However the new Bat-Eqipment and Bat-Gadgets that are used in the movie are interesting and entertaining to watch being used such as batarangs, bat grappling hooks, a high pitched audio device which summons bats to fill the area which disorientates thugs, and of course The Tumbler Batmobile. It's my second favourite Batmobile model behind Tim Burton's 1989 vehicle, what makes this vehicle truly shine however is the incredibly shot and exhilarating chase sequence which has the Tumbler drifting around streets aswell as totaling rooftops.The casting for the actors was also great with many memorable characters introduced in this movie which we will grow fond of in the upcoming movies, Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox stand out in particual, as well as the incredible Christian Bale at Bruce Wayne as well as Liam Neeson as Ras al Ghool.We watch his psychological struggles, his dark past, his mental journey of beginning to fight injustice, physical training and eventual transformation into The Batman. The film is a deep character study into the character aswell as an entertaining Comic Book action film with some glaring camerawork flaws. Overall this film is the best telling of the Batman origin story and we don't need any more. it's one of the best DC movies behind The Dark Knight and is a must watch for any superhero fan. An emotional and sincere origin telling bleeding with Batman atmosphere with a tone of gritty realism",8,0,0,4 December 2019
Batman Begins," Overall a great Batman origin story which couldnt have been a better reboot to the franchise
","Almost 15 years later this film still shines. Often overshadowed by The Dark Knight, a lot of people forget just still how brilliant this first film still is. It's not perfect and it's action probably could have been shot better, but The Dark Knight learned from that mistakes and fixed that.Anyway, this film was still a huge achievement from Christopher Nolan and brought Batman from the brink of death from the aftermath of Batman & Robin which nearly killed the franchise. Nolan truly had to go though a lot just to make this film a reality, Disguising the script as something other than Batman calling it 'The Intimidation Game' keeping the whole Batman premise under wraps until the script was greenlit by Warner Bros.Christian Bale truly was perfect for the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman and pulled off the psychology of the character so well. Almost every actor fits the role very well with an almost perfect casting choice. Apart from the visually rough looking hand to hand combat sequences, the film and overall action is directed very well and is a great looking movie, which showed as a sign of things to come in the two later installments.The film has shown it's age over time but it towers still as one of the best superhero origin movies ever created providing a detailed character study of the psychology behind Bruce Wayne and Batman that no previous installment touched upon in such detail and depth in which it spend almost the first half of the movie doing so.Overall even though it's a bit clunky and rough around the edges in some scenes, it's an excellent character study of one of the all time greatest superheros and is a masterfully executed reboot which saved a film franchise that was on the brink of collapse, providing such a deep and new perspective and more realistic take of the iconic character",8,0,0,11 May 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A strong and hard hitting sequel that we will remember for the rest of our lives
","Dreamworks once again knocks it out of the park with a sequel that's emotionally resonant, visually dazzling and a hefty story to tell. The how to train your dragon seiries is unique in the Dreamworks franchise since it deviates from Dreamworks traditional formula of slams at Disney tropes and pop culture refrences along with off colour humor. The writing and character development is still as strong as it's ever been with Dreamworks constantly upping their game in the animation department with every movie that comes out. The visuals are sharp and detailed with sharp stylish direction aswell as an emotional score. The editing and pacing of HTTYD2 is also on point with a constantly entertaining and flowing story with some incredible sequences of action.The characters are now older and a bit more mature with Hiccup reaching adulthood with his bond with Toothless becoming now unbreakable as they fly with such style and grace. The flight sequences are just as amazing as they were in the first movie with some incredible animation with some real talent behind it's style and designThe villan is also scary and intimidating which is great to see, most Dreamworks villans in the past have been good but the one in this movie is actually ruthless and monsterous to a point where it will scare kids and feels like a threat.The lore of the world of dragons deepens as more is discovered about the source of the dragons and the home they live in aswell as more being learned about Hiccup's familyThe movie is an incredible achievement from DreamWorks that continues the story of dragons into darker territory with once again the imagination and talent behind the animation team at DreamWorks shining through once again pushing the bar higher on what can be done with animation",9,0,0,17 December 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Another crisp, smart, exciting film from Brad Bird and the best film in the franchise
","Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol is my personal favourite film in the M:I franchise. With Brad Bird's signature directing style, he takes the film series into new territory with Tom Cruise pushing himself further than he ever has before. With all new practical stunts such as Tom Cruise climbing Burj Kalihfa. A smartly written and engaging story with heaps of new gadgets and locations, the humor is back aswell with that iconic banter between all of the characters.It is the best action film of 2011 and just has a fast moving and engaging plot with few scenes that drag or leave you feeling bored. There is never a dull moment in this film as Tom Cruise's presence in this movie is always exciting. It's overall a crisply shot and directed action movie that will entertain you every time you watch it",7,0,1,5 December 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," The MCU Transforms
","The Avengers, no matter which way you look at it is an incredible achievement. The 6th official entry in the MCU which was a multi million cinematic experiment 4 years and 5 previous Marvel films in the making for its eventual leadup of its iconic superhero characters became a critical and commercial success which pioneered the superhero crossover film, revived the superhero genre and rewrote pop culture in a way that is still being felt today even after its release nearly 7 years ago now. The overall genre and emotional tone of The Avengers along with every other modern Marvel movie with its near perfect blend between drama and serious storylines but with light hearted comedy and great action sequences. It's been able to get everyone together, not just the comic fans due to Marvel's now infamous MCU formula with its massively wide spreading and universal appeal to anyone who has any interest in Marvel superheros and being entertained by a light-hearted action comedy blockbuster which has proven time and time again to be right with every Marvel film since with the Marvel Cinematic Universe now becoming the highest grossing film franchise in history with over 1 billion dollars.Now with Infinity War out, the third and possibly final Avengers film. The formula is now starting to become tested. No Marvel film before Infinity War has really tried to be dark, but the MCU is changing and now after seeing the film and where it went emotionally and storywise and have no idea where it's going to go after the way it ended, which is good. Marvel has listened to fans complaints of how previous villains were not serious or intimidating enough and how no main characters have ever actually been killed off with the feeling that they might not ever come back, this movie changes all that.Infinity War is not predictable. It's surprising and entertaining in the first half, then it hurts you and leaves you cold. Thanos was an incredible and brutal in this film as was the type of villain that Marvel Studios really needed at this point and I think they did an incredible job with the character aswell as all the choices he made and all the things he did in this movie, he was a better villain than by any right he needed to be. His CGI was great as well.It's a lot harder to talk about this film in a review than you think, and what it means for the future of Marvel Studios apart from saying it's my favourite Comic Book film of the decade so far since The Winter Soilder and complete new milestone for Marvel. Not just for Marvel, but for Comic Book Films as a whole. The MCU will grow in new ways unlike ever seen before because of this movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing how Captain Marvel is going to do that. I have no idea what's going to happen next, I don't read the comics",9,1,4,12 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another great film by Tarantino, Love letter to Hollywood
","Tarantino's latest film is here and it's probably his greatest yet. Both the acting by Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were fantastic and are some of the actor's best roles. The whole world that was created for late 60s Hollywood was all fantastic, the storyline was engaging and every character was interesting and entertaining. It's definitely some of Tarantino's best work and is my second favorite behind Pulp Fiction",9,10,20,17 August 2019
Django Unchained," Tarintino at his finest, brilliant filmmaking
","Incredible directing, casting and writing. This film nailed every aspect of the era of black slavery it was supposed to convey, the character of Django himself was a very layered and incredible character to root for and get behind as he strikes revenge against the plantation that enslaved his people. The casting was top notch with Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L Jackson brilliantly playing their roles with long scenes of dialogue once again from Tarintino, and finley crafted tension leading up to some extremely cathardic and electrifying action and shootout scenes. The whole atmosphere of the movie is spot on aswell with a very fitting and memorable soundtrack with incredible cinematography and camerawork. Finley crafted and brilliantly executed blacksploitation film",9,1,4,7 December 2019
1917," A visually breathtaking yet terrifying account of war. Beautifully directed by Sam Mendes
","What a war movie to start the new decade with. With raw and visceral directing capturing the heartbreaking reality of WWI, the film follows the character of Will Schnoner who travels across with his brother to the other side of the battlefield to end the conflict. It is some of Mende's best work and is my second favourite of his now behind Skyfall. It is also in my opinion the best film on Britan vs Germany in WWI and is my personal favourite war film since Saving Private Ryan.It's gripping, emotional, human and real which conveys a lot about the British Battalion with the minimal but careful use of dialogue between each of the characters. Colin Firth and Bennedict Cumberbatch were very enjoyable with the screen time they were in and the musical score was also very powerful",8,3,5,8 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Great star wars movie but has room for improvement
","Beautiful filmmaking, Luke Skywalker is found again by Rey and new secrets are revealed about his past training with Ben Solo and his transformation to the dark side, Yoda makes a return and Rey faces Kylo in an extremely well choreographed fight sequence, Princess Leia is great in the film and Rey continues her journey to become the next Jedi warrior.The film does slow down at some points, especially the casino planet scenes, the plot structure is mostly fine and the script is definitely written fine enough and the movie still gives you that magic Star Wars feeling. The movie however doesn't even begin to stand up to the originals though and it feels that just some important elements are missing. But it's a more than worthy follow up to TFA and is still a fine sequel and is a satisfying Star Wars film",7,1,12,23 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Another great entry from Marvel, a next step
","This movie was breathtaking, with stunning visual effects and great characters with a smart, witty and funny script aswell as a kickass soundtrack. The choice of Chris Pratt as Star-Lord was great and he did awesome in the film. Groot was hilarious and so was Rocket and Gamora. Drax is my least favourite of the four but he is still entertaining and gets some great laughs throughout the film.The movie is very well directed by James Gunn with a very unique and fresh looking colour pallete. The set design as well as the look of all the weapons and spaceships are unique too which all to look very appealing even if the CGI does look a little fake in some of the scenes. The villan could have been stronger too with a deeper backstory, but Thanos in Infinity War made up to that with Marvel villans getting better as the films go along.This was a massive blockbuster hit when it came out with loads of hype surrounding it, now since the hype is still strong for this movie series since the third one is yet to come out. This is still my favourite of the two that has currently been released, not knocking the second one though, which visually is vastly superior, but in terms of writing, character and humor, this one takes the cake. It has excellent rewatch value aswell which entertains every time with the jokes just as funny as they were when you watched it the first time. So much imagination was put into the locations of this movie and it has it's own unique identity and feel. It's a huge departure from the Avenger's movies for sure, but this is not the Avengers. This is something very different entirley",7,0,0,4 December 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Incredible modern Kung-Fu Classic from Quentin Tarantino
","Everything about this film is great. The action and sound design is top notch, aswell as the casting which puts female empowerment to the forefront with it's choice of actors from Uma Thurman to Lucy Liu. The story is entertaining with and incredible animated sequence aswell. Overall it's just an incredible revenge story where Tarantino continues to improve his form of filmmaking with masterfully directed action and visual storytelling.Even more than 15 years after it's release it still shines as one of Quentin's best, being the first part of an incredible double feature. Everything from the casting, dialogue, sound, music and visuals is all stellar. It's just an excellent modern Kung-Fu classic. Se it if you haven't seen it already",8,2,5,13 May 2019
Avatar," A CGI escapist masterpeice
","It's been ten years now since Avatar was released, with revolutionary computer effects at the time with an incredible story to tell, it really is the reason why we go to the movies in the first place. Sam Worthington stars as our main protagonist as he ventures to the far off planet of pandora. The movie has stunning cgi special effects with some revolutionary mo-cap technology at the time which were Cameron's imagination is truly let loose as he crafts a beautiful and awe inspiring planet full of stunning and wondorous effects to tickle your eyeballs.The movie was a major trendsetter for the 3D movie trend that would follow well into the 2010s decade with this and How To Train Your Dragon being the first two movies to bring the modern cinematic craze back into the movie theater. It really is James Cameron's most imaginative movie and it has aged very well after all these years and is still a wonder to gawk at after all these years",8,0,0,11 December 2019
Toy Story 2," The sequel to the revolutionary first movie which is even better than the first
","This movie was a fantastic improvement over the first film, reintroducing all of the beloved and smartly written characters. The animation has improved since the first with more detailed lighting and shading with more detailed textures in the virtual sets that the toys are in. Randy Newman also makes a return with more iconic songs that touch the heart and stir all the right emotionsThe movie is also very funny with plenty of great jokes and gags that will have people of all ages laughing. The story is still great and is still entertaining to watch after all these years, the toy cleaning scene still triggers my ASMR, and overall the movie has a very pleasant atmosphere that warms the soul every time you see it. It's sprinkled with smart Pixar humor in the era where they were just starting to break out of the shell of just an animation working for Disney to the monolithic animation company they are today still creating masterful movies.To me TS2 is still the best Toy Story film in the quadrilogy now and my personal favourite of the pre - 2000 Pixar films. WALL-E, Up and The Incredibles is my favourite 2000s era Pixar movies but that's a story for another dayIt's still warmly funny and entertaining movie to watch after all these years and funnily enough hasn't aged at all. The funny thing about Pixar animation is that it doesn't seem to age all that much while many more forms of animation age far more quickly like the early Dreamworks CGI movies and most notably, late 90s early 3D video games like Super Mario 64 or Ocarina of Time. The magic of those games and movies are still there, were just exposed to more advanced technology.Toy Story 2 still holds up after all these years and is still something that kids today will love",10,1,1,5 December 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Wonderful start to an iconic film seires
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very well done adaptation of the book and is a magical start to the story of Harry and Hogwarts that will span over 10 years and 8 films. The movie introduced a number of new child actors which would go on to become famous and beloved worldwide as they grew into adulthood.Chris Columbus's style of direction captured the magic and wonder of the wizarding world that J.K. Rowling created and the innocence and likeability of our main characters. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were all perfectly casted for their roles. Their acting was pretty shaky in the first film but all did a great job for their first performances as they would vastly improve and mature as the films went on.It's a hefty introduction to the world of Harry Potter with also a memorable score that captures the atmosphere of J.K. Rowlings world very well. The film does a good job with taking all the most important plot elements from the original book and creating a very interesting and wondorous movie with so many memorable scenes. It's not the greatest Harry Potter movie, but it's a magical introduction to the world and is one that you'll find yourself watching every now and then and still being entertained and feeling that signature magical atmosphere that Harry Potter captures so well",7,0,0,2 December 2019
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Great second Harry Potter movie that begins the transition into the darker storylines in this more suspenseful and action orientated mystery
","This movie had a very different tone to the sorcerer's stone, It felt more on edge with a bit of anxiety thrown into the mix. I do remember being scared by this film as a small child and being repulsed by Ron's slug vomiting scene to which I would grab the remote and turn the TV off as fast as possible. Later I would grow to appreciate this film more as the film went places the the previous didn't.It's directing style is similar to the first, though the atmosphere has changed with our characters now one year older aswell as introducing some new locations in the wizarding world. The film has more intense sequences than the last with a wizarding duel and an expanding lore of the history of Hogwarts and some of the dark secrets it contains.Overall a great continuation in the Harry Potter storyline and gets you ready for the radical change of tone the future films will showcase",7,0,0,3 December 2019
Love Actually," Heartwarming Christmas Tale with so many great performances in this intertwining story about Christmas love
","I would always watch this movie every Christmas time to be reminded that love is always all around and connects us all, It's a cracker of a comedy and always gets you in the Christmas spirit every time you watch it. With so many characters in one movie it's hard to follow at times but it's a feel good movie no matter which way you look at it.The comedy is great aswell with a special appearance from Rowan Aktinson who sprinkles his british comedic talent throughout the movie. The soundtrack is also great and very memorable with 'Love is all around' being an instant classic for me and always puts you in the mood for Christmas. The script is very well written and some very sharp and talented directing. The whole concept of it is very original and something that more Christmas movies should do. I always watch the movie every Christmas to remind me that love really is all around us",7,1,2,14 December 2019
Joker," Best performance of 2019, Jaoquin Pheonix delivers an incredible performance
","The film is unique and interesting in so many different ways, It tells the story of a man who hasn't achieved anything in his life and is dealing with some incredibly horrible mental health and emotional issues, trying to escape his sorrow and achieve true happiness by making a statement about his life and showing the world his sense of humor and trying to make comedy about his life. It's an incredible performance from Jaoquin Pheonix portraying a man trying to find the comedy in the circumstances he lives in. Incredible acting, worldbuilding, cinematography and directing. Must see movie",8,0,2,20 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Live. Watch. Repeat
","The best action movie of 2014 for sure. Edge of Tomorrow is a slick, witty and original take on the Action genre with an incredible script to boot and some very smartly shot action sequences aswell as a great performance by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. The film follows an incredible character arc from Tom Cruise with a creative concept for an alien enemy. The whole concept of being able to die over and over again and get better every time is an original concept and is put to great use in the film, it's is very satisfying to watch Cruise's coward character continue to improve throughout the length of the film aswell as Emily Blunt's character aswell.It's very well directed with some electrifying sequences of action with some pretty impressive and well designed weapons. It's just a great action film and an instant classic in my opinion. It gets better with each viewing",8,0,0,21 November 2019
Back to the Future Part II," Awesome sequel to one of the best movies ever made
","This was a fun sequel, the story continues when Marty and Doc take the DeLorean into the future to 2015 Hill Valley. The whole design of the future hill valley is really telling of the late 80s view of the future aswell as Robert Zemekis's view that the future would be obsessed with 80s memorabilia. Things take a turn for the worse when 2015 Biff finds the sports almanac that Marty bought and uses the time machine to send the almanac to his younger self, causing him to become a millionare celebrity, ruining Hill Valley and destroying Marty's family. It's up to Marty to go back to 1955 without running into himself during the events of the first movie to restore the original timeline.This film is very entertaining and smartly written. It has the same type of humor from the first film aswell as repeating some of the gags aswell. It's not as iconic as the first, though it does continue the story and is an exciting adventure with plenty of interesting scenes and production design aswell as once again a great performance from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd",7,2,2,2 December 2019
Iron Man," The brillian first film in the MCU franchise setting the foundations for the iconic MCU style
","I'll never forget the first time I watched this movie, With revolutionary digital effects and an awesome and exciting story. It follows the story of Tony Stark who is captured in the middle east and is forced to make weapons for their military. He then builds the first iron man suit to fight against the terrorists and escape from the cave he was captured in.The story progresses when he builds his next suits and upgrades his technology as he creates the first flying suit. Things start to get more tense however when our villan played by Jeff Bridges makes his own suit to fight against Iron Man. Iron Man's life and parter are endangered and he must rise up to face and battle his nemesis in an electrifying robot battleThis movie set the tone for the future MCU movies to come and set the foundation of the plot and characters that would eventually lead up to The Avengers in all it's awesomeness. It never gets boring and is a more than worthy beginning to the Monumental movie franchise that will be known as the MCU",8,1,1,11 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Waititi does it again with flying colours doing what he does best, turning tragedy into comedy
","Taika Waititi is one of my favourite directors for a number of reasons. He is the master in taking tragedy and terrible events and turning them into comedy so brilliantly and so well. Hunt for the Wilderpeople was previously my favourite movie from him, as he takes tragedy from his characters and just pisses all over them with such style and grace that their mysterious pasts don't even matter anymore and creates some of the most refreshing and original comedy ever seen in movie history.With Jojo Rabbit, Waititi has finally mastered his craft in taking the tragic tale of WW2 and Hitler and turning it into some of the best pisstake comedy I have seen in years. Waititi does an outstanding job at portraying the funny side of Hitler aswell as directing a movie so crisp and detailed with such likeable and sharply written characters that are memorable as well as relateableThe whole message of the movie in my opinion is just the sheer pointless nature of war and the absurdity of conflicting views based on difference of nationalism and religious beliefs. The character of Jojo was perfectly casted in my opinion aswell as the rest of the cast. Scarlett Johansen plays an incredible role as Jojo's Mom who has a lot to say of what it was like to be a woman in those times. The movie is a prime example of how evil spreads from mind to mind through spreading fear over people of difference of nationality and religion once again revealing the absurdity of it all and creating some of the most unique humor in such a long timeOnce again huge kudos to the production design and direction of the movie which captures the time period aswell as the atmosphere as as the people of WW2 Germany perfectly. I'm going to spoil a scene in this movie but there is a very emotional moment in it where the movie is shot in a way where it looks like the surrounding houses are looking down on Jojo and judging him. I thought that scene was brilliantly done. Waititi has become a master at portraying the inner emotions of each main character and how they see and react to the world around them, finally taking away the mystery of each character and providing a crystal clear lens into the nature of each character. The supporting cast is great too with a very funny supporting performance from Stephen Merchant as one of the Nazi supporters.Overall I had a great time with Jojo Rabbit and has my vote and support for winning Oscar for best casting, direction and screenplay. I will complain of this masterpiece doesn't win a single Oscar because it deserves it.",9,0,0,20 February 2020
Midway," Awesome WWII dogfight film with some great acting and thrilling areial sequences
","I wen't into this movie not expecting much. I saw no previous trailers and went into the movie completely blind. I was surprised with just how original and entertaining it actually was. The cast was memorable with many great characters and writing. The dogfight squences are very fun to watch and are very entertaining. It is silly at times but I liked it more for it, It's not Dunkirk but it shouldn't be compared to it anyway, I found Midway to be more entertaining than Dunkirk in a lot of ways.Overall I found this movie to be very enjoyable and was the first film I saw in the new Australian chain of 4dx cinemas with motion seats. If you do live close to a theater that has motion seating, give Midway a try because I had so much fun with it",7,0,0,5 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Ghost of a Movie. Nothing more than a sociopathic superficial cash grab
","This film really is nothing more than an Advertisement. I'll admit the first time I saw it at the movies I thought it was pretty good, and i watched it another two times with friends and family over the course of a month before it finally left theatres. But after seeing it again, I realised something is off, something is not right about this movie. It's completely hollow with nothing beyond its visualsThe movie is well shot, I'll say that. It has great looking effects, but it's only there to hide the fact that once you look past all the superficial razzle dazzle to hide the mess underneath. The movie is nothing more than a shadow of the previous movies. Everything about it feels rushed. The characters are so aloof and seem almost brain dead. The dialogue is so shallow and paper thin, it's like the writers just gave up. The characters hardly develop or learn anything and Rey's transition to a Jedi is so fast and forced, you can see how how obvious that the writers were too lazy to even bother to give give her a proper arc and story and make her feel like an actual human we can care about. Because that would be too long and boring, wouldn't it... God forbid challenge people's short attention spans... Who even needs real developed characters... Nobody cares about that anymore... Just give them the razzle dazzle crap or whatever???It really is sad just how empty this movie is. The third time I watched it, it actually physically left a bad taste in my mouth, thank god for popcorn...",7,25,33,15 April 2016
Deadpool," Excellent, More please
","Great movie full of great action, witty dialogue and crude humor, It's a brilliant origin story with great CGI, soundtrack and direction and editing. It's a faithful adaptation of the infamous character and will entertain and is full of personality. Ryan Reynolds is great as Deadpool and was the right casting choice to play the character",7,0,2,24 November 2019
Click," Adam Sandler's most emotional movie
","I'll always remember this movie. This was a real shock to my senses when I saw Click for the first time. What i thought was just another Adam Sandler comedy film, I realised that this film wasn't going to be like his previous films, with that classic comedy that Adam Sandler fans love, this movie starts like most Sandler films start. Michael is a family man who feels like he's never there for them, he is a workaholic who becomes to caught up his job to realise that his family needs his support when it's needed most, he can't work the technology in his house, he hates his mother in law with a passion, and worst of all his kids think he's a bit of a pushover.Things change when he meets a mysterious man played by Christopher Walken who gives Michael a universal remote which should be able to solve all his problems in his life. Things start out funny at first with gag after gag showing his folly as he is given control over the things that bother him the most. The film is very inventive with how the comedy is played in every situation where Michael's desicions become worse and worse. The comedy begins to die down however halfway through the movie when he realises his choices with the remote has caused his life to become so bad that the film now becomes a tragedy. His life now becomes a sad tale of regret, failing health and his life falling apart around him as he desperatley tries to undo all the mistakes he has made.It becomes so sad at the end of the movie where Michael is lying in a hospital bed with music and cinematography choices and music so depressing that it makes you wish that you will never become like this character. I always cry at the end of this movie of just how much of a tragedy it really is about Michael's horrible life choices. But of course he is given a second chance in the end to live his life the way he wanted.It really is a great acting acheivement for Adam Sandler and all the actors involved who put on good performances, the kids did a great job too. It was refreshing to see Adam Sandler put on a very different performance in this blend of comedy and tragedy and is always entertaining to watch. I highly reccomend it",7,0,0,13 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the origional trilogy, A genre defining film that will never age
","The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best sci-fi movies ever created and is perfect in it's worldbuilding and storytelling. It has such a majestic looking movie with plenty of excitement and heart, all of the characters are believable with human motivation and the movie has incredible pacing giving you time to really soak in the locations of the movie.The introduction of Yoda is also a classic scene with plenty of charm, the whole Jedi training scene is also a classic scene as well that also teaches the magical ways of the force. The film is also mature in how it teaches the darkness inside Luke that needs to be defeated before he can defeat Vader. The whole sequence of Luke vs Vader is awe inspiring and a finely crafted and shot scene with one of the biggest plot twists in history. It's overall a timeless and classic film that will never age",10,0,0,28 November 2019
Happy Feet," Suprisingly deep and emotional tale about a penguin who dared to be different
","A childhood favourite of mine, Happy Feet is by far the best animated film ever to come out of Australia. The animation itself has aged incredibly well after all these years as it tells an emotional tale of Mumble the penguin who just couldn't fit in with the rest of the crowd. George Miller has proven that he can direct a fine animated film with a gripping and emotional story. Animal Logic are very particular with their animation making sure that all the colours, details, motion and textures are as crisp as possible.The writing is also sharp and very funny with some very good voice talent including a cameo from Steve Irwin. The film turns from a musical, to an adventure film and then gets surprisingly dark towards the end with an ending that is equally emotional as it is uplifting. It's a masterpiece of Australian 3D animation and Animal Logic should definitely start brainstorming ideas for the 3rd film to close the trilogy",7,0,0,6 February 2020
Her," Beautiful, Soulful movie with an incredible performance from Jachoin Pheonix and Scarlett Johansen
","An incredible and heartfelt love ode where our main character who writes love letters as a job installs an AI operating system that has consciousness and can think and feel for itself, he develops a relationship with the AI and the movie gets better and better from there. Scarlet Johanssen plays the performance of the AI character beautifully and Pheonix is also brilliant in it aswell. The movie has a very nice and interesting view of the future with very clean looking architecture and some beautiful cinematography and direction. For anyone looking for a deep, beautiful and different love story with some very well realised elements of sci-fi thrown in aswell should love this movie as I loved it aswell",8,0,1,1 January 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Move aside hollywood, this is how the AUSSIES make their action films!
","Mad Max: Fury Road is directed by George Miller and is the forth and hopefully not last in the legendary Mad Max franchise. The action in this movie was ABSOLUTLEY INCREDIBLLLLLEEEEEEE! and everything I was so desperate to see again in the Action film genre. The movie is shot PERFECTLY. Seriously, every single shot of this film has it's own place and purpose of pushing the action forward and the cinematography blended with the stunts and practical effects, explosions and destruction is electrifying to watch and is pure cinematic magic to behold in all it's pure kinetic and masculine glory. The sandstorm sequence was so incredibly well crafted and shot my jaw dropped the first time I saw it in theatres. It's still one of the most awe inspiring action sequences ever shot on cameras and put together in the editing room.The film reeks with Australian wit and attitude and bleeds with human emotion as we relate to the struggle of Furiosa and her ruthless drive to save her people from the evil Immortan Joe's control. Many crazy and memorable character follow like the over confident, fanatical but easily influenced Nux, The Five Wives, Rictus, The Organic Farmer and of course, Max. Who is so mad that he barley even speaks, but he gets better throughout the film as his ability becomes better and better. Tom Hardy has incredible prescence in the movie with the mouth brace now becoming an iconic image in cinema history.Fury Road truly raises the bar in what it means to make your movie as awesome as humanly possible. The action sequences are large in scale with so many different types of post-apocalyptic vehicles to play with, the rythym of the action is also pitch perfect and operatic in it's excecution. The explosions in this movie are joyous to watch and bring out that childlike instinct in you who just loves the beauty of watching things blow up that made you a fan of action in the first place. The whole choreography of the destruction in the movie is all directed with such complicated precision and structure, like the structure of a song or a sequence in a fireworks show. It's all pre planned with such brilliant motion and timing, again your jaw drops with just the style of how it all unfolds before your eyes.Fury Road is perfect in it's style and execution and gives the action fanatic exactly what the want to see. A non stop action thrill ride aswell as an emotional story to boot with a vivid and detailed world and backdrop. The music is great too and again adds so much adrenaline to the whole experience. A vivid and practical action masterpiece that will go down in film and pop-culture history as an Australian classic showing George Miller's practical handcrafted techniques over CGI and conventional modern Hollwood action filmmaking style that slowly become the norm. We honestly need more movies like this again and I hope future blockbuster hear Miller's plea to reinvent the trendOverall, pure razor edged Action masterpiece with Australian magic sprinkled into it's DNA with a compelling post-apocalyptic story and action squences which are ruthless in their delivery and will captivate and electrify the audience in it's style and scale with an outstanding female co protagonist Charlize Theron makes the movie. She was a pure badass aswell as being very emotionally depthed. I hope there is a next installment in the works, It will probably be more story orientated over Max's character and his relationship with the Australian wasteland around him and the characters that live in it over the action sequences, because I have no idea how the action showcased in this movie could be topped",10,1,3,5 December 2019
The Martian," One of the 2010s smartest movies, Ridley Scott hasn't lost his spark
","Scott knocks it out of the park with a film adaptation of the 2011 novel of the same name written by Andy Weir. The film follows the struggle of Mark Wattney left for dead on the surface of Mars after a severe dust storm causes his research team to make an emergency evacuation after the storm lays waste to their research facility. Wattney survives, but now with no connection to Earth, he must rebuild on his own for his own survival and find a way to connect back to home.Matt Damon plays a very excellent character of Mark Wattney who is surprisingly optimistic and full of charm and humor even though he is aware of the fact that all the odds are against him when it comes to his survival, but through his own wits and scientific knowledge, he will overcome the spectacular odds through the power of science and botanyMatt Damon constantly drops line after line of charisma, witty dialoge and an infectiously likeable personality that you will root for him throughout the entire run time of the movie as he solves problem after problem, always maintaining his humor and optimism throughoutThe special effects in this movie are a sight to behold aswell with some incredible outdoor scenes of Mars which is replicated beautifully with some outstanding CGI. It really captures the emptiness of the planet which further adds to his pure isolation.It's a more than great adaptation of the novel and is full of scientific brilliance aswell as a great performance from Matt Damon aswell as Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor. It's a great sci-fi experience. It will not dissapoint",8,1,2,5 December 2019
