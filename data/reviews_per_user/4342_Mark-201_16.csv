Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Its Star Wars
","Overall Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is 2 hrs and 10 min, and it feels every bit of that.  It tends to lag along.  Also disappointing is that Lucas sacrificed a lot of story telling and drama for visual effects.  Granted that is big in Star Wars, but Episode 1 lacks the emotional intensity of the old trilogy.  However, it is unfair to rate this film until it is possible to view it with Episode 2 and 3 as a whole.  Phantom Menace held up reasonably well while suffering under its burden of being Episode 1.For the most part, the characters were good.  Jar Jar Binks is quite possibly the worst character created in the history of film. Palpatine is well developed, with adequate hints at his becoming the emperor.  Also well developed is the notion that Palpatine is Darth Sidious. Liam Neeson is average as Qui-Gon Jin, the Jedi master and focal hero of Episode 1.  Obi-Wan Kenobi shines the most, and Darth Maul is possibly the best character despite his limited use.  The light sabre duel at the end is intense and quite possibly the best action sequence in film to date.Overall, Episode 1 is more Star Trek than Star Wars, and it is evident in the first half hour.  Also it was a bit too kid oriented and overly long. But in the end, it is truly Star Wars.  I can't wait for Episode 2.",7,0,0,30 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Very good
","This is an entertaining film.  It is a fun experience to watch.  The acting is good, especially by Geoffrey Rush.  The story is well written.",9,0,0,2 January 1999
Fargo," A little kidnapping goes horribly wrong in the friendly Midwest.
","Fargo is easily one of the ten best films of all time.  The acting is great, especially by Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and William H Macy. Watching the events of a seemingly small time kidnapping turn into a multiple murder is an enjoyable experience in this film.  You almost feel sorry for Buscemi, who just wanted his $40,000 but ends up killing all these people.  It is also funny to watch him be so out of place among the hospitable Midwesterners.  The whole film is a fun experience.",10,0,0,31 December 1998
Edward Scissorhands," superb
","Probably Tim Burton's best film.  The scenery and music are great, and the acting is wonderful, especially by Johnny Depp as the frightened title character.  An excellent case study in how people react to someone who is unlike them.  Plus, lavish color in a Burton movie is hard to ignore.",10,0,0,1 February 1999
American History X," One truly vivid, powerful film
","This is quite possibly the most vivid film I have ever seen.  It fears nothing, not holding back for the sake of the status quo in what films are allowed to show.  And the message it sends is an important one: that hate is a terrible thing to have.The acting is stellar, in particularly by Edward Norton, whom i believe was oscar-deserving in this and is one of the best actors around.  He really plays two roles in this, and does both fantasticly.  His diction is strong, and his expressions are as well.  The look he gives his brother after murdering 2 men is the most chilling look I have seen in film.  Norton is absolutely fantastic.  Also brilliant is Avery Brooks, whose voice is tremendous.The directing and structure of this film is great.  The Black and white and the water serve as important symbols.  The story is well told and done in an original way.  It has very few flaws, in particular the overdone prison rape scene, although really graphic in this film.  Also the ending is disturbingly unresolved, although that could also work to its advantage. Overall, the film is superbly done in every way.  I highly recommend it.",10,0,0,15 June 1999
Saving Private Ryan," 8 soldiers journey to find a private whose family has been decimated by the war.
",Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time.  The first half hour is the most powerful 30 minutes in film history. The questions raised in the film are sure to trigger discussions on the value of human life.  The performances are fantastic.  This film is as close to perfection as one can get.,10,0,0,1 January 1999
Good Will Hunting," Troubled Genius
",Good Will Hunting is a brilliant film.  It is very well made and written. The performances are great.  The story is wonderful.  Two powerful scenes stand out.  Chucky telling Will he is crazy for squandering his gift and Will and Sean embracing toward the end.  GWH is a terrific film.,10,0,2,3 January 1999
Life Is Beautiful," One of the best
","I will certainly be pulling for this one at the Oscars.  Beningi's brilliant film is a excellent blend of comedy and tragedy.  His performance is tremendous.  The story, though comical at many times, is very tragic.  One of the greatest Holocaust films of all time, and one of the greatest films period.",10,1,2,15 February 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Robbery gone wrong
","Excellent story of a botched jewel heist told in typical Tarantino time structure.  Great acting like most of his films, but this one is much better made.",9,0,1,2 January 1999
Titanic," Romeo and Juliet at sea
",The direction of James Cameron is great and the human stories are powerful. But the romance of Jack and Rose is too played and unoriginal.  The acting by the two leads is also uninspired.  But the movie is still good and far better than most disaster movies.,7,1,3,2 January 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of the greatest ever
","This is as good as it gets in filmmaking.  Forman's film is absolutely brilliant.  The acting is great, particularly by the star, Jack Nicholson, who is at his finest.  The scene where he imagines a baseball game is memorable.  The end scene, where Chief runs off, is also great.  Truly a masterpiece.",10,1,4,24 January 1999
Halloween," The greatest slasher flick of all time
","The original (i don't count psycho as a slasher movie) slasher movie and still the only one worth watching.  The blood is minimal, but the suspense is spectacular.",10,0,1,2 January 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," The greatest film of all time
",The Silence of the Lambs is the pinnacle of greatness in film.  It features not only the best male performance ever but also the best female performance ever.  Oscars were never more deserved than the two Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster received for this film.  Jonathon Demme's superb direction only make the excellent story even better.  Even the suspense is wonderful. Easily my favorite film of all time.,10,1,1,1 January 1999
The Matrix," Are my friends and I the only ones who hate this?
","I will say that the matrix had a good idea and for a brief 20 minutes in the middle, it was intriguing.  But the cheesy special effects and melodrama were too much for me.  Most of the movie was laughable.While the religious symbolism was there, the direction was poor.  The camera shots were bizarre, too much was left unexplained.  All in all a very poorly executed idea.",1,21,49,14 April 1999
The Thin Red Line," average war film
","The Thin Red Line, Terrance Malick's first film in over 20 years, is not nearly as good as Saving Private Ryan. The story of The Thin Red Line is confusing.  Malick is overly symbolic.  Some shots, like that of a bird dying, are vivid, but others are pointless.  Too many symbols defeats the purpose of symbolism.  The narration is also confusing, as sometimes it is hard to tell who is talking.  Most performances are great.  Sean Penn is excellent.  I wish the story revolved around him more.  He offers an honest performance and the story behind his character is the most interesting of the many stories.  Nick Nolte has his moments, but he is for the most part overly melodramatic.  John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are great in their roles, as are many of the lesser name actors who have good sized parts, such as Private Witt. The film drags along, unlike Private Ryan, this film felt longer than it was.  The symbolism surrounding the tribe in the beginning is too vague. The battles scenes are well done though and I can appreciate the shots of Malick.  He would be well advised to become a director for hire.  He is a fine director, but his writing leaves a lot to be desired.  Give us more of Sean Penn.",7,0,0,18 January 1999
The Godfather," One great film
","One moment stands out above all in THE GODFATHER (no not the horse's head). It is the slow zoom on Al Pacino when he is revealing his plan to kill Solazzo and the corrupt cop.  This is great characterization.  It shows Michael Corleone's development from a seemingly weak boy urging to forget his roots to a man ready to take the family helm. The Godfather is possibly the most brilliant film ever put on tape. Oscar winner Marlon Brando is great, but it is Pacino who steals the show in this one.  James Caan and Robert Duvall also offer up superb performances.  There are many other famous scenes in this one, including the infamous 'baptism' scene. The Godfather is filmmaking at its finest.",10,0,1,5 January 1999
