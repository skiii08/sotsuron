It," Painfully boring
","Oh my god I was so bored, I would've walked out if I was alone. I think the biggest problem was that I just did not care about the characters at all. It makes me appreciate feeling so bad for the main character in Mother! Movies that make you feel bad are good in that way. I just could not bring myself to care about the characters. Their slow-scene dialogue was cringeworthy, often didn't sound natural. The scares were decent. I certainly appreciate the movie not being made up of 100% jumpscares, but again, just decent, and the impact was lessened by the strange artistic choice of pacing - cut from dark creepy scare to bright sunny calm scene. The combination of all of this left me very restless in my seat. Like The Witch, it feels a lot longer than it is. Towards what i thought was the end of the runtime I said 'I'm surprised they're not gonna wrap this up' but I was surprised to see it was only 90 minutes in. I suppose it's a dense movie, they pack a lot in - not that that's a bad thing, but the content doesn't inspire any emotions other than restlessness, impatience. If you feel you must experience it, go alone so you have the option of walking out.",2,9,17,16 September 2017
