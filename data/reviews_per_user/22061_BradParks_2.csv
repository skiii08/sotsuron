Minority Report," One, Two, Snooze-aroo
","Hey;If you want to see another action flick just like a Mission Impossible with a fair # of holes in the logic, then check this flick out. Good action sequences, but just a little too predictable for my tastes, despite the fact that I love Phillip K Dick stories, and was hoping to see this adapted well to the screen.",6,0,0,26 January 2003
300," 300 - Epic Gestures in every single frame
","This movie is not a history lesson....It's a movie realized in it's purest form - Suspend your disbelief, and you'll see a story told so truly.... through visuals, actor performance and so beyond anything that exists outside of the journey of pure imagination...It is by far the best movie to come out of Hollywood in years that truly represents the work on which it was based - A graphic novel - by Frank Miller, a modern day Dashiell Hammett....Epic in every gesture in every scene, this movie was by far my favorite movie of the last year...Incredible!",10,4,7,26 July 2007
