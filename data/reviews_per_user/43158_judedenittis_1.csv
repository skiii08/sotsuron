It," Great
","The movie was not your typical 'crap your self horror movie' that keeps you awake at night although it was a great movie in general. Skarsg√•rd was amazing as 'Pennywise' and the the rest of the acting was pretty good as well. The actual movie had a well written script and great actors/actresses. One problem with the movie, way too much unnecessary swearing from the kids. Overall great movie 10/10",10,1,1,10 April 2019
