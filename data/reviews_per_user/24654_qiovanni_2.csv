Black Swan," Out of the ordinary
","I'm not the typical cinema expert but I've watched a few and if you love cinema, theatre, the entertaining industry in general, you must see this movie. All sorts of human expressions actually, where talent, technique and the fear of doing wrong battle with the immortal spirit at the same time building it and serving it, at any cost.The peculiarity of this movie is that it is about itself. yes. how? well in the end I could feel that not Nina but Natalie Portman herself was the 'swan queen'. At first I didn't rate this movie 10/10 only because there are some flaws in the direction and generally because of the technical 'confection' of the film, which is not 'perfect'; the style is eclectic with scenes that resemble a horror or erotic movie. Although if you watch the movie you'll understand why this movie is 'out of the ordinary' and how it can be 'a movie about itself', why 'perfection' isn't always 'perfect'... therefore to be coherent with my review, I'll rate it a 10/10.Portman's performance is the incarnation of all that.",10,1,3,12 May 2013
I Am Legend," I only want to say...
","this film is largely underrated!! great drama, acting, action, FX and everything technically but most of all the message it delivers is extremely deep. It explores the full band of human feelings and fears, racism, consumerism, and GOD.how can some people say it's empty or has poor screenplay, I wonder if they have just been hearing the movie rather than 'listening'... some of the negative reviews compare this movie with the book and previous cinematic renderings of the novel well I figure that this is something new and different! I haven't read the book, I watched one of the old film versions and it was quite superficial compared to this. I read other viewers find flaws in the plot like 'he had no need in hunting a deer' oh come on! how do you know? by chance has it happened to you to be the last man standing in a deserted city haunted by men-eating zombies? I hear even one ironically refers to the English grammar in the title.. he is not a legend, he is Legend OK? he's trying to save humanity, although he definitely failed with you... To all the haters of this great movie, like they say in Naples: 'Eat an emotion!'",10,0,1,27 October 2011
