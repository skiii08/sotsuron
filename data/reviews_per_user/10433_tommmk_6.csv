Black Swan," Going down in the third round
","WOW that ending is one for the books and that is why Natalie Portman won the Oscar for best actress. Darren Aronofsky consistently makes great films, but shows a real talent for the campy and the melodramatic, so I think Black Swan is one of his best, one that places it in the esteemed company of arty potboilers like Repulsion or Carrie or The Red Shoes. Also of note are performances by Barbara Hershey and Vincent Cassel, and top-notch screen writing, cinematography, editing, sound and music, art, sets, makeup and costumes. If I had to find a complaint about this movie, one of 2010's best, it would be to raise a pinky in protest over the apparent lack of a single gay male character anywhere, for although we are everywhere, including the world of ballet, we are just not in this particular hallucinatory psychodrama.",10,1,3,30 May 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Not As Bad As Expected, But Still...
","So they've 'updated' Sherlock Holmes by turning him into a Victorian version of 'James Bond'? I guess that's one way to avoid paying royalties to Ian Fleming's heirs, or Arthur Conan Doyle's for that matter, whose copyrights mostly expired in 2000. Before you can say 'cheap ripoff,' however, I will admit that this sequel accomplished the rare feat of surpassing the first, although given the caliber of Ritchie's earlier film, that couldn't have been difficult to accomplish. Nevertheless, I don't enjoy watching Robert Downey Jr fight in those wretched 'Iron Man' and 'Avengers' movies and I don't relish watching him fight in this movie either, so turning Sherlock Holmes into an 'action hero' is a major turnoff for me. (I much prefer the updated BBC TV series starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a socially inept, sexually ambiguous Holmes.) Admittedly I am not a fan of Downey and his trademark deadpan one-liners, although they weren't as bad as usual this time around. I'd much rather watch handsome Jude Law, and it is an injustice that as Watson he has to play second fiddle to Downey. But I gave this film a not-dishonorable '7' because Downey and Law get to dance together, and share a few other vaguely, enjoyably homoerotic moments, otherwise I would have ranked the film lower.",7,2,2,10 April 2013
Behind The Candelabra," Bravely Honest Performances
","From the opening blast of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love' to the closing riffs on 'The Impossible Dream,' you know you are in for a real treat, especially thanks to excellent performances all around. Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are revelations here--these two performances, I think, rank among their very best, not only for being pitch-perfect, and often quite funny, but for being brave, honest, no-holds-barred, and most of all, faithful--personality flaws and all--to their characters, which stay with you long after the final curtain drops. Both actors deserve Emmy Awards for these performances. Sensitive direction raises the story from the merely sordid and tawdry to the realm of tragedy. Bravo to all involved.",9,1,3,15 June 2013
Rosemary's Baby," One of the Best Movies Ever
","It should come as no surprise that 'Rosemary's Baby' ranks in the top 250 on IMDb; I, however, would rank it even higher than the general public does. It's the kind of film you can watch occasionally over the years and enjoy each and every time, i.e., a classic. Technically the film is brilliant, with superb cinematography, editing, music, acting, art design, and masterful direction. Polanski captures the timeless essence of New York, at least as I remember it, even though the setting is unmistakably the 1960s, and the milieu is literally diabolical. Depending on how you look at it, you can enjoy the film as a supernatural thriller or as a psychological thriller and study in paranoia. I especially love the dream sequences, which have a surreal beauty and nightmarish logic of their own.",10,6,9,5 January 2013
300," Male Beauty Never Before So Lovingly Presented
","I had to write in response to all the straight fanboys are who raving about 300. Like them, I love this film too, but I love it without having to resort to denying its breathtaking homoeroticism or mocking Xerxes for his supposed effeminacy. (Xerxes is not just androgynous, he is commanding and imposing; he is a match and worthy adversary for Leonidas; their scene together, when Xerxes nearly swoons with desire and then walks up behind Leonidas to put his big paws on Leonidas' shoulders, is stunning.) I love this film for the way the camera caresses the bodies of the Spartan warriors; for its resplendent and transcendent acting, direction, cinematography, screenplay, sound, music, art direction, and special effects; for the tender way it presents Leonidas' profile before he is cut down. This is the best and most handsome film since Brokeback Mountain. Astounding. Never before has male beauty been so lovingly presented on the screen.",10,3,7,19 March 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Talk about iconic - this is Hollywood at its penultimate!
","First, acknowledge the importance of WIZARD OF OZ from any point of view, especially in terms of film history, artistic achievement, complete and utter fantasy, cultural icon. The only thing we can hope for is that one day sometime soon someone will aim to achieve a film like this one. While it is true that the oft repeated theme 'There's No Place Like Home,' is a wishful proclamation both simplistic and conventional, everyone can take pleasure instead in its myriad of sublime details, foremost Judy Garland's performance, indeed, the entire cast's, as well as the unforgettable story, songs, cinematography, sets, costumes, lighting, sound, etc. Hollywood craft at its best.",10,3,4,9 September 2006
