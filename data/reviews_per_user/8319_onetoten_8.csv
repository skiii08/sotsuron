The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Disappointing Entry
",Before watching this I viewed Catching Fire again in order to compare it to Pt.1. Pt.1 stalled in many scenes while Catching Fire progressed smoothly. Pt. failed to capitalize on character development and what was that cat doing in the film? I groaned at that moment the girl was looking for that cat. Why were we supposed to care about the leading and supporting characters? Johanna Mason has more charisma than anyone else except Haymitch. Both characters deserve better. The others looked like they were walking through their lines. They acted like they didn't care and who could blame them? The humour and snappy dialogue was gone. Who the heck was I supposed to root for? With apathy like that no wonder why 'Haymitch' was desperate for a drink? Prove me wrong in Pt.2 or this series has already run out of steam.,2,5,6,17 March 2015
Oblivion," Better the more you view It
","The 1st time I watched this movie it was confusing. This is a story with complex elements. The second time, the plot was easier to understand but I wasn't sold. The third time cinched the deal and the core of it was Vika, the trusting partner who was the easiest to manipulate. Andrea Riseborough deserves credit for giving the story its most tragic feature. Vika is dramatic irony on steroids. Who hasn't been betrayed in this world? Who hasn't been betrayed on a level that you can't imagine? That's Vika. If she only knew. I wish there had been more of her but it's supposed to be the star who fills the seats in the theatre. The movie is visually stunning with realistic landscapes. 'You wouldn't believe what's down there,' Jack 52 tells Vika. For some of the reviewers who didn't like this film at first glance, you might not believe what you find if you give this movie another chance. I'm glad that I did.",8,1,1,31 January 2014
Knowing," Great serious sci-fi!
","I enjoy serious sci-fi films that 'work.' I'm no Nic Cage fan but this narrative was less about Cage than it was about our mortality. It was well-written but distracting at first. I don't watch movies until they come on cable. If a film is good I'll watch it twice. I watched this 4 times so far. The soundtrack reminded me of the music in 'I, Robot.' Indeed, the director used the same composer & this time the music was better. Best sci-fi of 2009.The special effects were all fantastic. It's hard to surprise me with a film because they're usually over hyped. Watching trailers can spoil a film too. The weakest part & performance in the film is that of Rose Byrne, the mother. Nevertheless, I'm interested in buying the DVD when Christmas sales are on.",9,0,2,3 December 2009
The Game," Is it real?? More than you know!
","I had no idea how good this movie was going to be when I first watched it on cable years ago. During my 1st viewing I had a hard time wondering if where the plot was going.This was a new type of story for me so it's safe to call it original in a field of films that just keep writing out the same plots over and over again. The writing was mature & serious too. Yes, a film without children, thank goodness.I watched it for a 2nd & 3rd time. It was hard to find in the DVD stores but I found a copy. I was hoping for a sequel but it never happened. Good writing like there is in, 'The Game,' is hard to find.I've seen some of David Fincher's (director, 'The Game) films - his latest being 'Benjamin Button.' 'The Game' is one of his best efforts.If you like originality and getting psyched out this movie has it all. You may want to watch it again and again. Definitely for the DVD library.",8,1,1,3 December 2009
Prisoners," Won't Cure Insomnia
","This film was on cable one night. It lost steam quickly as the story became bogged down with pointless silly situations. The plot meandered so much that I had to read the synopsis as the story progressed. If you have a PVR and your recorded it, feel free to stop it and check other movies on cable. That's what I did. However, I did finish watching it. If this movie had been quiet throughout, it would have helped insomniacs to finally get a good night's sleep. Watching paint dry is a better alternative. One of the ironies of this film has to do with one of its producers - Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg was one of the leads in Peter Jackson's, 'The Lovely Bones.' Prisoners is a poor ripoff of that movie. The Lovely Bones was a superior film in every respect. Prisoners isn't a film that's worth watching more than once. The Lovely Bones is.",1,10,21,8 June 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," Reluctant Debutante vs. Reluctant Debutante
","This came on cable and I heard that this movie had controversy. What controversy? She's not sure and he's got rules that he's reluctant to break. He's a messed up rich dude & what dysfunctional billionaire doesn't have rules, eh? She's confused by the rules & why he has them in the first place. Billionaires make more sense when they buy politicians.There's a saying that money can't buy love and this film proves it. With all of that money, why can't anyone afford to give the girl a decent haircut? It's hard to find her face underneath that mop. This only adds the lack of chemistry between the two leads.Can't buy the rules. Can't buy the love story. Can't buy the movie.",2,0,1,12 December 2015
Life," You'll get All Choked Up
","This left one character speechless, so let's begin. It's OK to explore beyond the boundaries of imagination but this movie goes for fool's gold. It's a cheap imitation of every space flick imaginable. There isn't one character to care about - not even the lead actor who isn't human. The concept itself should have red flags all over it. No one believes this stuff anymore. No explanation is even attempted. The script is a clich√© from the get go. Joking about 'custody rights' - really? This is not a film that's so bad it's good. Nowhere near.Is there anything good about it? Please, find one thing that's good. Ah!!! Yes! There are no teens on board.",1,2,4,12 November 2017
The Martian," Unbelievable, Literally Unbelievable
","With all the fanfare and box office success, this feature falls flat on its face. The writing is on par with straight-to-video features. Two of the actors in this film starred in another much better sci-fi movie. In the other film, these two actors had a better script, well-timed suspense, believability and a compelling story to tell. Is it possible that the people who worked on this film were surprised that it was a hit? Probably. If you haven't seen this movie yet, have low expectations - really low.The best possible outcome from this film is that there will not be a sequel.",1,4,8,4 June 2016
