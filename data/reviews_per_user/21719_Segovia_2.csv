The Blair Witch Project," This is a real scary movie!
","I saw the movie and I really liked. This picture doesn't need anything but three students to make us 'jump from the chair', specially in last part of the movie. It isn't the best horror film I've ever seen but it is one of the most originals. Definitively this movie leaves us a question:'What would we do in the same circumstances?'. Personally, I would get back to my home and try to not get mad!!!.There are some details that reveal the real context (or environment) of the film, I mean, the real facts behind the film.",8,0,2,21 October 1999
Amadeus," It is great!
","I have seen this movie 6 or 7 times. I really liked it. Although there is some facts that they didn't happen in real life and Mozart wasn't too 'crazy', I think the picture shows the genius behind 'the vulgar man' as he called himself. That scenes when he writes his music are simply magnificent. The music inside his mind and he just writes it. Then how he is describing his own music. By the other side, there is no shown any pupil working with him. I know that wasn't the purpose of the director (Milos Forman), but it would be interesting at least if one of his pupils had appeared. That who finished the Requiem. But anyway, this picture is one of the best biographical pictures I have ever seen. Not for the facts but for how it is showing a 'GENIUS AT WORK'",9,2,4,24 August 1999
