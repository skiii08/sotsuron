Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice easy start of the saga
",I watched all star wars movies recently and i started wit episodes from 1-6. I loved this movie because when i was younger we played a game Star Wars Episode 1 Racer it was awesome game so i really enjoyed the movie more because of that.I felt movie was nice light easy start to the star wars saga about a kind slave boy and he going on the path of a jedi knight. From there it went more serious boy grows ups and problems twists and more complex story begins. So my opinion is the firs movie does its job nice it is not boring it was nice easy introduction into the great saga. I watched all 6 movies in 2 days and i loved the saga except the Return of the Jedi i was kinda bored at this one.,8,5,7,17 December 2015
The Hangover Part III," Entertaining at the end
","Short and simple this movie is boring i laughed 3 times in this movie and that was small laugh. Except the last minute is great all other 99 minutes kinda sucked. Don't go into cinema watch it at home. I hope it helps if you don't believe me go and see it but you were warned. Because i don't have anything good to say about this movie and i must write more text i will say this movie is good if you are drunk.As with its predecessors, Part III is built around hugely improbable events which trail along in the wake of the path through life taken by the hugely unbelievable child/man Alan (Zack Galifianiakis), and this is both the the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the series. In the first film, the character was funny and what happened was funny. In Part II, less so. Part III is actually quite dark and, while there are some laughs, mostly this could have been filmed as a straight crime drama.",3,2,4,9 June 2013
