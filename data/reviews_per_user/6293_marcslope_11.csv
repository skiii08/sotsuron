The King's Speech," Bravo, Mr. Firth
","Loved it, yet it made me sad. It's a close-up portrait of a royal who isn't really cut out for the job, yet recognizes his responsibility and painstakingly overcomes a dreadful childhood, horrible debilitation, and impossible family (a family with which we can identify, despite their blue blood) to ascend to his duties. Firth, never overacting, takes us deep into the king-to-be's pain, sense of hopelessness, and frustration, and also emphasizes his essential decency; loved the scenes with the young Elizabeth and Margaret, showing what a superb father and loving husband he was. Shot in 'Masterpiece Theatre' style, it's very civilized and proper, and perhaps overworks the humanizing angle; whether Bertie will give a proper speech or not is weighted to be more important than the fact that England is entering a devastating war on his command. But what saddened me was, it's such an old-fashioned movie--no crashes, no overt special effects, no sex, no violence. And all those things may have their place in movies, but I think the industry has become overdependent on them, at the expense of offering human stories. This is a human story, presented gently, straightforwardly, and literately, and good as it is and as much as the audience with me enjoyed it, I don't think we'll be getting many more movies like it.

Billy Elliot," Sweet and Sour
","I avoided this movie for months because of its high potential for hokey triumph-of-the-human-spirit emotional uplift. And yes, it does get rather squishy in the last half-hour, and it tests credibility in spots. It's hard to believe, for instance, that Billy, stealing a few furtive hours of dance practice under his father's steely watch, would master not only ballet but also tap, jazz, and traditional Irish dance. But you expect such liberties from this genre. The surprise is how bleak most of the movie is: It's set in a horrible corner of Thatcher's England, where workers are one step above starving and the weather is always awful and the architecture is ugly and moldering. No wonder everybody in the movie is cross with everybody else. There's much more ill will and bickering than there are Kodak moments. The result is a dish of an unexpected variety of flavors, and a satisfyingly cranky indictment of Thatcherism.
Bell and Walters deserve their good reviews, but the real breakout performance is Gary Lewis'. He conveys more with his eyes than most actors do with their entire bodies.",Null,0,1,13 March 2001
The Devil Wears Prada," A Ross Hunter movie for the 21st Century
","Did the makers of this candy-coated confection actually think they were saying something wicked or insightful about the fashion industry? If so, they've been watching too many old movies, for the movie's digs are toothless and its morality is straight-down-the-middle-America. It's like a Ross Hunter or Doris Day sex comedy from the early 1960s, or 'That Girl,' with the honest young thing conquering New York and staking out a fabulous wardrobe without ever falling for the lies and false values of the high-fashion milieu (though the movie certainly ogles that world enough). Yes, we love Meryl Streep's way with a line -- as an Anna Wintour-like gorgon, sort of an update of Kay Thompson's turn in 'Funny Face,' she purrs her insults with brilliant underplaying, like a latter-day George Sanders. And we love Stanley Tucci, as a flamboyant, frustrating, but invariably right veteran of Seventh Avenue (we've all worked with somebody like this). We don't even mind Anne Hathaway, though we've seen this character before in literally hundreds of movies. But the utter predictability is a big letdown, as is an otherwise colorless supporting cast saying witless things on Manhattan and Paris streets. And the movie feels ambivalent about the industry: It ridicules the high-pressure environment yet also kind of admires it. Meryl has a big scene tearing down Anne Hathaway's fashion sensibility that the movie actually seems to side with. I find it infuriating that anybody would care this much about the nonsense of what next season's big fashion will be, but if they're going to put this world on screen, they should have its denizens say and do more interesting things. As it is, the only real suspense is what outfit Anne Hathaway will show up in in the next scene.",3,3,8,10 July 2006
Dreamgirls," Saw it on Broadway. Liked this better
","The Broadway 'Dreamgirls' quickly became a legend because of 1) Michael Bennett's awesome staging, 2) Jennifer Holliday's high-voltage turn as Effie, and 3) a (somewhat unwarranted) rave Frank Rich review in the Times. It can't honestly be said that the writing was first-rate, either the score (an uneasy fusion of Motown and showtune, with heavyhanded near-rhymes) or the book (melodramatic and not always absolutely logical). Well, Bill Condon's film version doesn't repair any of these flaws, but it's sensational entertainment. What a production design! A dazzling display of location and soundstage settings, with costumes so precise and smartly satirical that you always know exactly what year you're in. A couple of transitions from dialog to song and back are a little uncomfortable (this is generally the hardest thing to get right in adapting a stage musical to the screen), but most are fine, and a couple of segues -- like the one of Eddie Murphy's James Early teaching the Dreamettes a song to their actual onstage performance -- are seamlessly brilliant. As one who normally loathes Murphy, I thought him both touching and dynamic as this James Brown-like icon. And everything you've heard about Jennifer Hudson is true. It's a starmaking performance, rather like Streisand's debut in 'Funny Girl' in intensity and virtuosity; she also acts, and her facial expressions and body language are as persuasive as her vocal prowess. Plus, she's an attractive full-figured gal, which makes her romance with Curtis (a too-understated Jamie Foxx) more convincing than it was on stage. Anika Noni Rose is a charming Lorrell, and Beyonce Knowles does Diana Ross to perfection. But the real star of the picture, if you ask me, Hudson aside, is Bill Condon. He knows how to rethink stage properties in cinematic turns and pump up the excitement to almost live-Broadway fever pitch. You could rightly accuse 'Dreamgirls' of glossing over some of the finer points of social history it covers, and maybe even triteness, but it's one of the two or three best times I've had at the movies this year.",9,3,7,29 December 2006
American History X," God bless Edward Norton...
","...and God grant him a less grandstanding, more subtle director than Tony Kaye, who has piled cliché on top of cliché in this diatribe against neo-Nazism and poured on the anti-racist moralizing as if he had invented the concept. You want faux-home movies of kids at the shore to symbolize lost innocence? You got it. Slow-motion violence? Check. Black-and-white flashbacks to contrast against the blood-spattered color of the present-day sequences? Why not. Pseudo-religious, semi-liturgical musical scoring to mythologize and elegize the predictable dramatics? It's dripping with it. The kind of rote plotting that demands one character will have to be sacrificed for the sins of another? That's here, too. The storytelling is resolutely episodic, a series of (predictable) set pieces: the basketball court confrontation, the convenience-store riot (which is admittedly frightening stuff), the prison gang-rape, the neo-Nazi rally. It's all prosaically told, but Norton does create a complex portrait out of little, carefully conveying Derek's anger, conflicting familial feelings, fierce protectiveness, and growing consciousness. Some very good veteran actors help out -- Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach -- and Avery Brooks somehow manages to turn his angelic-teacher turn into more than a device. God knows a subject this timely and vital deserves more nuance and analysis, but the brute force of Norton's acting and the excellent support from little-brother Furlong (though Kaye, predictably again, lingers too long and in too-relentless closeup on all that anguished doe-eyed adolescence) ultimately win out over ham-fisted direction and unimaginative screen writing.",5,2,8,28 July 2003
Gone with the Wind," A Rolls-Royce for Middlebrows
","Not a great movie, in the strictest sense -- it doesn't tell us anything we don't know, it doesn't offer a new viewpoint on an old subject, and it hews rather too closely to conventional Hollywood narrative techniques. Further, the faithful-old-servant stuff is pretty hard to take in this day and age. But certainly it's a great testament to the studio system and its ability to conjure lost worlds with dazzling images. You'll never see Technicolor this rich again, a production this lavish, such recklessly extravagant casting (even the minor roles, like Isabell Jewell's Emmy Slattery or Laura Hope Crews' Aunt Pittypat, are perfection). And yes, Scarlett and Rhett may be the stuff of women's novels, but as played by Gable and Leigh, they're strikingly adult, and flesh-and-blood--they convey much with looks and gestures that the Hays Office couldn't have been happy about. The fastest-moving four-hour movie ever made, and, as it has been described elsewhere, 'the movie-est of all movies.'",Null,0,0,29 December 2000
Blue Crush," Surf and Surface
","The ocean is deeper than the plotting in this MTV-style paean to surfing (and going for your dream, bucking the odds, yadda yadda), but as empty summer movies go, it has a pleasing working-class grit and credibility. Our plucky heroine comes from a believably broken home and has a credibly taxing bratty little sister, not to mention a sullen best friend/trainer who feels betrayed when our surfer girl forsakes hanging ten for hanging with a hunky NFL quarterback (OK, it's not THAT believable). The story is an agreeable time-passer that doesn't take up too much space between the spectacular surfing sequences, and the happy ending isn't so happy that credibility wipes out, a la 'Rocky.' There's some annoying comic 'relief,' and the movie isn't exactly psychologically complex, but if all you want is to extend your summer for a couple of hours while looking at pretty people and pretty Hawaiian beaches, you could do a lot worse.",Null,0,0,24 September 2002
To Kill a Mockingbird," Sorry, folks...
","(Possible spoilers) Surely Harper Lee's morality tale was an impressive filming of an essential novel in 1962, but from the vantage point of four decades-plus it's an old-smoothie job -- respectful, careful, and entirely too pleased with itself. It's in black and white, and so are its issues -- you know from the first shot of the Ewells, from costuming, lighting, and angle, that they're white trash; you know from the first ennobling look at Tom Robinson that he's an innocent victim. You never have to think -- the movie tells you what you're supposed to think and feel at every juncture.Peck's Finch is a plaster saint; I suspect that the praise heaped on him, and the Oscar, has more to do with the quiet heroism of the character (who wouldn't want a father, a lawyer -- heck, a President -- like Atticus Finch?) than any great acting on his part. The storytelling strains credibility at some crucial junctures: Surely the redneck lynching crowd wouldn't be dispersed that readily by The Simple Wholesome Innocence of a Child, and does Atticus have to be, on top of everything else, a crackerjack rifleman? There's Elmer Bernstein's treacly scoring to underline the already over emphatic pontificating, and the photography, handsome as it is, pretties up a small Southern town in the Depression perhaps more than necessary. On the plus side, yes, it's an unusually up-close and incisive look at the growing pains of early childhood, and Mary Badham's Scout hits remarkably few false notes. Pauline Kael once dismissed it, scornfully, as 'a movie the industry can be proud of,' and I know what she meant -- its prime function seems to be to allow non-bigots to congratulate themselves on their open minds. The fact that its viewpoint is right, proper, and laudable doesn't make the movie any less smug.",Null,8,20,14 September 2004
Amélie," Little Miss Fixit
","A cheery and pretty valentine to life, to be sure, with an appealing Audrey Hepburnlike gamine at its chewy-nougat center. But I'm surprised at how people are calling it fresh, different, etc. The Little-Miss-Fixit protagonist goes back at least to Mary Pickford or Janet Gaynor, and her way of meddling anonymously to the betterment of other peoples' lives is a direct steal from 1960's 'Bells are Ringing,' which itself was not exactly revolutionary. All the director has done is apply a slick veneer of TV-commercial techniques to a very old story, emphasizing trendy camerawork and fancy cutting. There are giggles throughout, and you'd have to be an awful curmudgeon not to like it, but less sugar might have actually made it tastier. Also, in its completely extraneous dirty jokes (the humping-in-the-loo sequence, the porn-shop scenes), it shows an all-too-willingness to stoop to cheap laughs.",6,0,1,27 February 2002
Thirteen Days," When statesmen were statesmen
","Considering that the Cuban missile crisis has already been pretty picked over dramatically (there was also a good early TV-movie, 'The Missiles of October'), and that the movie is mostly talking heads, this docudrama manages to whip up quite a lot of nail-biting tension in its two and a half hours. Its prime pleasure is seeing '60s icons humanized: JFK, RFK, Adlai Stevenson, and even Dean Rusk are presented as smart, responsible, thoughtful men who must agonize over the veracity of the information they're being confronted with and struggling to come up with a suitable response. (Today's neocon bunch undoubtedly would have escalated to full war in a heartbeat, and we probably wouldn't be here.) They lose their tempers, they despair, they disagree, but they're genuine statesmen, and colossuses compared to what politicians have become. As are the media: Walter Cronkite, in actual footage, shows a class and dignity unknown on today's airwaves or Web pages. Costner has been criticized for his faux-Boston accent, but I found it true enough, and anyway, many of his best moments are silent: He does a lot of acting with his eyes. It actually helps that Bruce Greenwood doesn't look much like JFK: It helps viewers concentrate on the man rather than the icon. I suppose the dramatization is a bit sanctimonious: The script is unambiguously on the side of religion and 'traditional family values,' and Roger Donaldson keeps inserting footage of nuclear explosions, as if we couldn't remember what all the fuss is about. But it's a handsome and stirring account of crafty, wise political diplomacy, the likes of which we may not again see in our lifetimes.",7,0,0,22 August 2006
A Walk to Remember," You're sure this isn't a remake of a Pat Boone movie?
","Amiable diversion for the first half-hour or so, with the rotten high school kids being nasty to one another. And it's all disarmingly tame, like one of those '50s teen B-movies where the juvenile-delinquent boy is reformed by the gawky girl. There's the high school play, the first kiss, the lunchroom hierarchy; all that's missing is the soda shop. (Don't these kids have cell phones? Don't they spend endless hours instant-messaging one another?) Then it goes all Hallmark and soft-focus, heavy-handedly folds in religion, and springs its unsurprising surprise about its heroine (and Mandy Moore, especially in the early scenes, is quirky and interesting and probably too good for this material). Finally it staggers to a gooey conclusion, by which time virtually every character has forgiven every other character for everything. You don't have to be too much of a cynic to question that. Maybe some very impressionable teenage girls will respond to this Nutrasweet dish; I'm not so sure about the rest of us. It's like Ned Flanders' kids' idea of a date movie.",3,0,2,19 February 2002
