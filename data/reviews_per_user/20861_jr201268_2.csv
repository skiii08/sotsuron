Skyfall," Daniel Craig is Bond
","Love Daniel Craig's Bond. He is the best there has been. Mind you I love Connery, but love Dalton even better, so of course I dig the hard, tough killer that Craig displays here. Skyfall is thin on story but the parts work. Bond is damaged. M is damaged. The villain is damaged. MI6 is damaged, there is a theme here. But what is best about Skyfall is how small and intimate the film really is even dow to the villain's goal. His motivation sucks but once again if you toss logic out the window and enjoy the pieces of Skyfall you will enjoy the film. I was very let down by Quantum after Casino Royal knocked it out of the park, but this is a return to form a complex character in a simple story with lots of action, the pieces work.",7,0,2,17 June 2014
World War Z," Better the second time around
","I watched this on Netflix the other day and liked it a lot better than I did the first time, when I say it in theaters. I think I was expecting a stronger plot and more story which the film lacks, but then again Marc Forest directed the film and he was the director who dropped the ball on Quantum OF Solace. As I watched WWZ for a second time I realized I had to let go and just go for the ride this film is 2 hours of zombie porn. I watched the unrated cut which has a lot more blood and guts than the theatrical version I saw. That's all this film is, set piece after set piece of zombie mayhem and destruction. If you think of it as a 2 hour version of the introduction of a zombie video game and turn your brain off to logic, story and character development - buckle up and have some bloody fun.",6,0,0,17 June 2014
