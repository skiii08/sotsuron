The Legend of Bagger Vance," Wonderful sentimental cinema
","Maybe I am missing something having read the reviews and seen the overall score for this film, before I decided to add my comments, but I thought the film was excellent.  I am not a golfer, nor particular about this group of actors or Robert Redford as a director.  I loved this film.  I think there is a placed, much missed today, for a film that gives you a chance to see beauty in human endeavor.  A film that shows connectivity with others in spirit. There is definitaly  a place for feel good films that isn't necessarily reality based.  The only think lacking to me was more individual character development.  The acting was superb and I loved the fact that is was more understated , it made the film less melodramatic. Do you what a great story, feel good, love cinematography, and shed a couple of feel good tears, then watch this film. 9 out of 10",9,0,1,17 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Are we becoming too jaded
","Certainly, one can pick any movie apart and it does serve a purpose, if it helps to produce a better future entry.The critics I feel find this a ripe fruit to pluck.  What better claim to fame than to pick apart great efforts.  For my investment I found great pleasure and a return to the excitement I felt when I saw the first Star Wars projects.  I hope that we don't become too jaded or perhaps too used to great movie making that we pass off the fun and pleasure that can be received by allowing yourself to escape awhile into a land of possiblities and adventure that is not offen served up to most of us.  I say very well done, George. I hope that the negative criticisms only help to make your next effort better and you stay true to the force within you.",10,0,0,4 June 2002
Dark City," Landmark film
","I believe that this is a landmark film.  It combines many forms of film making and cinematography with new graphic imagery.  This film combines film noir, sharp angle techniques and minor key musicality to produce an eerie, desperate, otherworld feel that makes you anticipate and think about paradigm shifts long after the ending (beginning).  People will look back at this film as pivotal. Think 'Matrix'!",10,0,2,7 February 2000
