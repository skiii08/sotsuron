Hereditary," What the hell was that?!
","I spent the whole movie waiting for some kind of climax, hoping that all these ridiculously long drawn out scenes of zero plot development would lead to something. Then, just when you feel as though you're getting somewhere, it all comes to an abrupt halt with one of the most actual laugh-out-loud endings I've ever witnessed in a so called 'horror' (we physically burst into laughter when she dropped the 'you're a king of hell' line). Great movie if you're a fan of snail paced plots, 10 minute long scenes of two people walking down a hallway whilst one cries 'please' over and over and over, and ending that leave you sitting in your seat, laughing in utter disbelief that someone thought that was a decent way to end a $10m production.",1,163,335,30 June 2018
