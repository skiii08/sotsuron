Saturday Night Fever," the film that changed the world!
","The film that came and took the world by storm! With it's power and fashion and it's new styled music, it got the world hooked and absolutly earned millions from it. The bee gees new and different songs helped this movie to be the top of the lot, it also helped them to reach their peak in the music industry. Alot of style and new music came from this movie, many films in the future is well where to be based on this movie. Also John Travolta earned instant fame from this, he then lead on to his role in Grease which took him to his peak. This is a great fun filled movie for that 70's generation and any disco stud and fan, i suggest that you try this movie today and see for yourself the movie that made disco 'disco!'",10,0,1,19 November 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," A very good sequel
","Although the matrix reloaded has great action, great graphics ,a fairly good story outline and brilliant cinematography it lacks the major reason for the popularity of the first one. The reason the first one was so popular was because of the weirdum and the fact that it made you think about life, this sequel holds none of this 'weirdum' and therefore brings it down alot. The action is great, it holds most of the action bits for a good time of that being fairly long. Also the sex scene and big club thing made no point and made the film more uncivilized and showed that the human race survivors are idiots (wouldn't they all run off and get ready for the war?) The graphics are like triple as good as the first one, (that involves those slow moving camera shots). The car chase also is a great and proberly one of the best we will ever see in Movie history for a long time to come, however in my point of view the final climax car chase in Mad Max 2:The Road Warrior is the best car chase ever made. Overall this film is a very good sequel, almost better than the original but because of its lack of meaning and power an focusing on action i say that it's worth watching and 8 1/2 outa 10, 'The Matrix' being 9 outa 10.",8,0,0,1 June 2003
Psycho," better in black and white
","the movie i watched at the begging of july 2001, a little late but hey! i thought it was quite good beening in black and white, i watch the psycho 98 (remake) straight after it and for some reason i thought it was worse than the original one. No i do not say it is the scariest movie infact there has been no movie that has every scared me, they just tell either good or bad stories.AKS",9,1,4,7 July 2001
