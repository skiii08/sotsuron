Moneyball," Brad Pitt does baseball, Jonah Hill does maths & Moneyball does depth.
","Moneyball is about baseball and mathematics.I don't understand baseball; it seems to me to be a more complicated version of rounders but with a bigger bat, more rules and a globally renowned tournament called the World Series in which only America may enter.As for maths, well, Mr. Barnicot will tell you it and I were never great friends.The film is based on actual events, although I have no idea how much has been fictionalised.But none of this matters because, beyond all of the above, Moneyball is a film about vision, about passion, about making a stand, about losing and having another go with whatever limited resources are at your disposal. It's about relationships and being bloody-minded even when the vast majority thinks you're delusional and inept but having the confidence to know, not merely believe, that you are right.The film works because of the heavyweights putting their best work into it. Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian have written a script that can be understood by even those who have never seen a baseball diamond. It's a screenplay that is brought to life with sincere and beautifully restrained performances by its stars, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, and supporting cast, notably Phillip Seymour Hoffman. In other hands, each of these characters may have been played more emphatically and with greater decibels but the performers never veer towards pantomime. Hill is particularly engaging with his restrained portrayal of a young man with an unproven theory in an environment where he is almost universally resented.Director Bennett Miller has delivered a film that may well slip under the radar due to sheer number of high-profile films on release at this time of year, but even if you wait for it on DVD, this is a film you shouldn't write off simply because of a lack of knowledge of sport.Let me start again. Moneyball is about a baseball team with no money to buy players, mutinous staff and a General Manager who brings in a kid with a degree from Yale and a notion that nobody but the GM wants to hear. Forget the baseball. Go with it and be inspired by a man with determination and a great understanding of that old fashioned ideal: Loyalty.Another film review from The Squiss.

The Avengers," At last we have a Hulk that convinces.
","I dragged my heels when it came to Avengers Assemble. Did I really want to see yet another comic book adaptation that will be rehashed in ten years for viewers with goldfish memories (The Amazing Spider-man being a case in point)? Apparently I did.I've never been a great reader of graphic novels though I dipped into the odd Batman and Flash Gordon book while still building camps in hedges but in recent years my forays into pictorial literature have been less frequent and more specific; the favoured and most notable examples being Joe Sacco's Palestine and, a particular high point for me, J. M. DeMatteis' The Compleat Moonshadow.But I digress.Avengers Assemble concerned me; with so many disappointing and, occasionally, disastrous adaptations out there (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, both of the Hulk adaptations to dateÂ…) what hope was there for a film that threw together a smorgasbord of superheroes all vying for top billing, one of which hasn't been tested on the public with a big screen outing of her own? With so many egos and so little time it would be a task and a half for the scriptwriter, Joss Whedon, to adequately divvy out the lines.I needn't have concerned myself with such trivialities. Whedon, who also directs, does an admirable job of bouncing the dialogue between characters without swaying too heavily in one direction. There isn't a clear star in this grand ensemble piece although that success leads to a new issue in that none are able to engage us with a fully fleshed-out story of their own. It doesn't matter with the likes of Robert Downey Jnr's Iron Man, who has had two hugely successful outings, but is frustrating in the case of Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow.There's no need to go into detail on the plot; it's a superhero flick so naturally something or someone (Loki, Thor's adopted brother in this instance), threatens the existence of mankind and the superheroes fly into action to save the day. It's formulaic but a lot of fun, if not particularly original or inspiring. It's difficult to surprise cinema-goers nowadays and plots are recycled, embellished and reimagined more often than conceived, but that needn't be a major issue in a genre film on this scale when the viewer isn't demanding any more than to be entertained.The cast is superb and, in the case of the principals, either recognizable as stars in their own right or courtesy of the roles they are reprising here. Mostly they do as you'd expect and deserve neither great plaudits nor condemnation; it's not that kind of film. However, beyond the obvious star-billed cast, there are some who delight absolutely. Tom Hiddleston (Wallander, The Deep Blue Sea), as Loki, is effortlessly compelling and avoids melodrama in his wickedness that so many villains lean towards, while Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Town) is an actor who's been around for a few years and co-starred in a number of excellent, if not huge, films. As Clint Barton he again lends solid support and proves to be a most watchable and compelling actor. It's just a pity that he's given little opportunity to develop his alter ego, Hawkeye, and one can only hope the inevitable sequel will rectify that.The unexpected quality comes in the form of the Hulk. With two major Hollywood adaptations to date, the kindest comment one can make is that their stars, Eric Bana and Edward Norton, were both put to shame by the dated Bill Bixby performance. In Avengers Assemble, though, Mark Ruffalo truly shines as the tortured, reluctant recruit, Bruce Banner. The CG big green lump is created more convincingly, though still not flawlessly, here than in previous attempts but it's as Banner that Ruffalo proves himself. For once we have a portrayal of Banner that lays his soul bare for us all to see the demons running around inside it. And, at last, I'm actually looking forward to the solo outing they must surely give Ruffalo's Hulk. Let's just hope it's third time lucky.Another film review from The Squiss.

Million Dollar Arm," Adequate, against all odds, feel-good baseball flick for a rainy Sunday afternoon.
","After a hitherto very successful TV career, Million Dollar Arm was presumably supposed to do for John Hamm what Batman and Robin was supposed to achieve for a post-er George Clooney. It won't. It's certainly a far, far better film (though that in itself is neither hard nor a great selling point) but Hamm lacks the charm, charisma and versatility of Clooney (who overcame almost the biggest clunk of 1997) and Million Dollar Arm is neither good enough to be universally celebrated, nor bad enough to be derided. What Million Dollar Arm is, is a pleasant, feel good(ish), based-on-truth yarn in which Hamm plays an updated, slightly softer Don Draper.In 2008, with a sports agency floundering against the tide of bigger competitors, JB Bernstein (John Hamm) is inspired by the emerging crop of TV reality shows and hits upon the idea of creating his own in order to save his business and make his mark; essentially becoming the Simon Cowell of baseball. He quickly realises the major flaw in his plan: baseball is pretty much covered in the USA and the big boys have snapped up anyone with any talent long ago.What JB requires is an untapped market that doesn't know it needs baseball in its life. Enter India, the home of all things cricket. After an arduous search, JB selects two aspiring cricketers, Rinku Singh (Suraj Shama) and Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal), and whisks them back to America where he must work to transfer their skills to baseball, make their dreams come true and, in the process, find his own humanity.There is nothing in Million Dollar Arm that we haven't seen countless times before, but because it carries before it a banner proclaiming 'This really happened' we forgive director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) for its predictability. It isn't necessary to know or love baseball to enjoy Million Dollar Arm any more than you needed to be a quizmaster to enjoy Slumdog Millionaire, but it in this case it probably helps. That said, Gillespie has carefully crafted a film to appeal to the Sunday afternoon feet up masses. It requires little thought, only moderate emotional investment and you know from the outset, though you may try to fool yourself to heighten the excitement, that all will work out well. Why else would Disney stump up the cash? Disney doesn't do failure! There is much to enjoy but little to inspire or satisfy. The performances are adequate but predictably overshadowed by Alan Arkin's familiar irascible old-timer cameo. The romance is plinky plonk and the against all odds, triumph in the face of adversity plot engages but doesn't tug at the heartstrings like, say, The Blind Side.There is nothing here to dislike vehemently, but perhaps that would make Million Dollar Arm a more memorable film. There just isn't anything on display to be really passionate about, good or bad. Save it for a rainy Sunday when the belly is too full for a hike across the moors.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,2,4,30 September 2014
Men in Black 3," Ideal for those with low expectations
","It had to be done. There was an empty evening, a slot to fill in the blog and the potential of a fun, innovative film.The short version is that Men in Black III is better than the second outing but doesn't hit the originality or the highs of the first. The biggest issue is there just isn't anything terribly new on offer. There are no great surprises, no universes hiding in a locker, no shock revelations of politicians or celebrities hailing from worlds on the other side of our imaginations. Yes, there are hints and mentions but they feel like ticks on a checklist. So much of Men in Black III does.Will Smith is on good form, maintains his perpetually young appearance, gives the cheeky chappy performance we've come to expect and (mostly) accept and carries the film without inspiring us; Tommy Lee Jones is predictably miserable/stoical/deadpan â€“ delete as you see fit; Barry Sonnenfield returns to direct using the same map and instructions; Danny Elfman revisits the series with his third score in typical, entertaining but, in this instance, not overly inspiring fashion.The surprises come, firstly and in a minor way, from Emma Thompson, who fills the gap left by Rip Torn's absent Zed as Agent O. She plays a familiar mummsy-with-a-slight-edge role but with the expected level of humour and sincerity we've come to expect. She's not going to increase her Oscar haul (two and counting) with this but it's a performance of the expected quality. The surprise is simply that she's in Men in Black III at all.More surprising is Josh Brolin's uncannily accurate portrayal of the younger Agent K. His voice, mannerisms and miserable/stoical/deadpan â€“ delete as you see fit â€“ performance is remarkably close to that of Tommy Lee Jones. It's not easy playing a younger version of a familiar character; just ask Ewan McGregor, although Brolin has the advantage of playing a part that is nowhere near as beloved and iconic as Obi-Wan Kenobi.I'm far less happy with Jermaine Clement's (he of The Flight of the Conchords fame) waltz through the film as Boris The Animal. It's not so much a case of scenery-chewing as Brian Blessed on crack and chomping everything in sight. For a while it's entertaining and one is left to marvel at how he manages to say anything at all with those teeth filling two thirds of his mouth, but it very quickly becomes tedious as he attempts to roar in a slightly different way.It's entertaining, it'll thrill the children with low expectations and the drunks with depleted brain cells but, actually, I think I'll give Wild, Wild West another shot before I sit through Men in Black III again. At least it boasts the former Mrs Thompson, Kenneth Branagh.Another film review from The Squiss. For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",4,6,11,17 June 2012
The Monuments Men," Fine opportunity, great source material & an excellent cast completely wasted.
","Written, directed and starring Hollywood darling, George Clooney; a cast to die for with five Oscars between them; a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction plot of audacious international thieveryÂ… What could possibly go wrong with The Monuments Men? How long do you have? No, that's not fair. The Monuments Men isn't a stinker by any means. It is just a dull, confused, protracted almost film. It is almost exciting, almost clever, almost funÂ… Based on the true story of a task force of just seven museum curators, directors and art historians, dubbed The Monuments Men, Clooney's fifth film in the director's chair stumbles through Hitler's mission to steal Europe's greatest artworks for his planned FÃ¼hrermuseum (Leader's Museum) and the Allied mission to steal them back and return them to their rightful homes. Battling squaddies and generals with no love for, or understanding of, art as well as the armies of the Third Reich, it was a dangerous and largely doomed mission to retrieve unimaginable art collections and prevent their certain destruction should Hitler fail to conquer the world.The source material is fantastic. What a remarkable operation! The Monuments Men should be a war romp in the vein of Kelly's Heroes or Where Eagles Dare but Clooney seems unsure whether it should be a Boy's Own adventure, a comedy knockabout or a history lesson with sensitive and sincere bon mots to make the audience reflect admiringly. It fails on every count and winds up as a WWII Ocean's Seven with a severe identity crisis.The stars that fill this two-hour somnambulistic mess coast along in the company of good friends, the knowledge of a good pay cheque and a free trip around Europe. It shows. There is no passion, urgency or fervor, just a clumsy jumble of ideas with no real conviction and little direction.It is very hard to connect the director of The Monuments Men with the man who helmed Good Night, and Good Luck and The Ides of March. And while it should be fun watching Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, Jean Dujardin and Bob Balaban play at overweight, inept soldiers in the company of Cate Blanchett, it is just tedious.The Monuments Men is filled with opportunities for excitement and adventure but instead of a film we can lose ourselves in and a motley crew of characters we can root for, we are left disappointed and with the feeling that Clooney really should have done better.More upsettingly, a generation who have never heard of the real Monuments Men and the amazing mission they risked their lives for will brush it off as a bland fiction and forget it on the drive home.What a waste of a fine opportunity, a great plot and an excellent cast.",Null,0,0,18 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Stunning, taut, nail-biting. First serious Oscar contender this year?
","Films are frequently, cruelly judged by their final twenty minutes. Movies live and die by the impact the final scenes have upon their audiences, regardless of the immense power or utter guff that went before. By those rules, Captain Phillips clears ten stars effortlessly. The audible expressions of emotion last night were testament to that. However, unlike many 'feel-good' films that merely satisfy at the end after hollow beginnings, the film that just might win Tom Hanks his third Oscar surfs a wave of near perfection from first light to setting sun.Yes, Captain Phillips is that good! Based on actual events, though how accurate is open to much speculation and a substantial lawsuit, Captain Phillips depicts the hijacking of the American container ship Maersk Alabama in 2009 by pirates off the coast of Somalia. When two boats are spotted heading at speed directly at his vessel, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) attempts a futile defence with fire hoses before instructing his crew to hide in the ship's bowels while he negotiates with the Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi).What follows is a battle of wills against circumstances with Phillips desperately trying to save his ship and the lives of his crew and himself, while Muse argues and threatens for a multi-million ransom, knowing that failure means imprisonment in the USA or death at the hands of his bosses.The trailer suggests an action-packed join-the-dots drama where good must surely triumph over evil and where right and wrong are clear-cut, but with Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatum, Green Zone) at the helm, there is nothing predictable or cheesy about Captain Phillips. The opening scenes with Phillips and his wife, Andrea (Catherine Keener) simply establish the man and his character while eschewing obvious references and strands to be alluded to and tied up at the conclusion. But beyond the initial five minutes, the tension rises, agitation sets in and terror scrapes at the nerves.There are many clichÃ©s that could be used (nail-biting, edge of the seatÂ…) to describe Captain Phillips. It is a film of true horror where we watch with fingernails digging into our palms and buttocks clenched tightly. A small part of the mind thinks 'Thank God it isn't me,' while the bigger part is too caught up in the events to give a damn about anything else. Greengrass has excelled himself (again!) with the nerve-jangling events that are far too realistic to be comfortable viewing.This is no gung-ho, 'America, f*** yeah!', Act of Valor propaganda bilge. Captain Phillips is raw, real and difficult viewing at times. We are so used to the SAS, Navy SEALs or Marines bursting onto the scene in a barrage of gunfire and explosions to save the day that the quiet, arrival of the SEALs is unnerving. There's no panoply, just a cold, quiet, calculated arrival. They do the job and depart so silently and matter-of-factly that they could be plumbers gathering their tools after mending the sink. It is chilling to see such a perfunctory display in the midst of harrowing circumstances.Captain Phillips is Hanks' film through and through. He dominates with a presence that commands our attention and shakes us into a numb silence. The odd Larry Crowne aside, Hanks is a solid actor worthy of (most of) his plaudits, but his performance as the titular character has greater intensity and completeness than we've seen from him since The Road to Perdition, or perhaps even Saving Private Ryan. Phillips' terror at the hands of his abductors and the dread of probable murder are palpable enough in Hanks' performance, but the emotional maelstrom he suffers in the final act is too convincing, too real to suppress the throat lump and dampened eyes.But Hanks is so convincing in part because he has fine performances to play against, not least of all former taxi driver Abdi in his acting debut. The lines may be lost sometimes, the delivery occasionally stilted, but we never once forget that he is the man holding the gun. We know his Muse is in the wrong; piracy is a crime. Period. But he conveys Muse's own rising panic that this job might just go south and, if it does, that the repercussions will be far more serious than his village simply going hungry.Henry Jackman's (Man on a Ledge) score intensifies the tautness crafted by Billy Ray's screenplay and honed by Greengrass' superb direction. It never overpowers us but adds depth to the visuals and heightens the emotional state.Captain Phillips works as a companion piece to the little-seen Danish film, Kapringen (A Hijacking) earlier this year. But where as Captain Phillips takes us deep into the frantic mechanics of the hostage situation from the crew's point of view, Kapringen is a slower, quieter film that covers many, many weeks from the 'safe' perspective of the shipping company and negotiators. It, too, is intense and puts the viewer on edge but in a quieter, moodier way than Captain Phillips. Regard it as preparation before the main event.There is a slight possibility that Oscar may nod at Kapringen, and a nomination might be just, but it's far less of a risk to predict that Hanks will earn yet another nomination. If the Academy does see fit to award him his third Best Actor Oscar, to match Daniel Day-Lewis, rest assured, he will deserve it for substantially more than the final twenty minutes.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",10,8,16,17 October 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An imperfect but touching, thought-provoking film about discovery, sexuality, friendship and betrayal.
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a strange little film that will likely divide audiences before they even reach the cinema. Writer/director Stephen Chbosky has a ready-made audience from his source novel and has credibility as the creator of TV series Jericho, but as a director he has just one previous big screen outing: 1995's little seen The Four Corners of Nowhere. In front of the camera there is little in the way of star power though both male leads have some impressive films on their CVs: Logan Lerman has ably supported bigger names in the likes of 3:10 to Yuma and starred in Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief while Ezra Miller positively chilled the world as the titular sociopath in We Need to Talk About Kevin.So it falls to the biggest name amongst the principal stars, Emma Watson, to woo the audiences. And therein lies the division. Watson has physically appeared on the big screen in nine films prior to this, eight of which were as Hermione Granger. If you've never watched a Harry Potter film, your only cinematic reference to date is a brief appearance in the fine My Week With Marilyn. If you're one of the countless millions who have watched the wizard series you'll either recall her acting ability evolved from 'not terribly good' to 'passable' or you're still under fourteen years of age.The first thirty minutes of The Perks of Being a Wallflower verge on arduous, largely due to Watson, playing Sam, the older woman to Lerman's Charlie. She tries so damn hard to act, to be noticed, to be American, to earn our respect but succeeds only in looking like a child who has raided her mum's wardrobe but is ten years too young to carry it off and ten years too old to still look cute. For thirty minutes I watched a film that barely warranted two stars and I groaned inwardly at the thought I chose this over Anna Karenina.Then something happened. Or rather, nothing in particular happened but Watson relaxed into Sam, The Perks of Being a Wallflower found its feet and I realized I was watching an imperfect but touching, thought-provoking film about discovery, sexuality, friendship and betrayal. And, shockingly, that Emma Watson has the makings of being a reasonably good actress. Once she relaxes, her performance is tender and Sam's desperation is palpable.Charlie is an introverted freshman with little self-confidence who writes letters to his only friend: a friend who committed suicide. Faced with the challenge of college, Charlie begins his first day with desperate hope for change and concludes it counting down the days until graduation. Life sucks, the bullies spot him a mile away and his only escape is through the books his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), inspires him with until he is adopted by a group of misfits in their final year headed by Sam and her stepbrother, Patrick (Miller).Miller stands out with a performance that is a world apart from Kevin. As Patrick he is a maelstrom of emotions in a fragile body that wears gregariousness like armour. He is judgmental, forgiving, joyful, depressed, delightful and as annoying as hell. Patrick is damaged goods. And that's why he and Sam are more than stepsiblings. And that's why Charlie fits right in. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a film for all of us who felt like we were on the outside trying desperately to make someone notice we were hammering on the door to be let in. It's also a film for all of those who were enjoying the party and decided to ignore the banging.The trailer implies a sweet, humorous college flick but it doesn't portray the various shades of darkness within the characters. Everyone has a side they turn away from the crowd and Chbosky, after a faltering start, rotates every character so the dark side faces the camera, if only fleetingly. He writes and directs like a chess player (no, not a grandmaster, but that may come) lulling us into a false sense of security with something sweet or cheerfully twee and then he kicks us hard, square in the balls and we gasp at this new revelation.For some viewers there are great twists and turns, but most will watch as the characters slowly unfurl and reveal more of what is hidden deep inside and not see each new disclosure as a shock but as another jigsaw piece to reveal the full picture.There were no tears, no huge lumps in my throat and too much damage was done in the first 30 minutes to elevate The Perks of Being a Wallflower above six stars but it is a good film, particularly after the event as the story remains very much in mind.I had intended to make it the first in a double bill with Sinister but such was the effect on me that I opted not to pollute my state of mind with something harsh and lacking in sensitivity, instead preferring a slow drive through dark country lanes home to a warm cottage to where I could let the story filter through in its own time.Another film review from The Squiss.Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",6,3,5,11 October 2012
The Equalizer," One-man army, Denzel Washington, kills, maims & blows stuff up without qualm.
","This is NOT The Equalizer. Or rather, this is not the 1980s series staring the sorely missed Edward Woodward as Robert McCall, a mysterious, retired intelligence officer putting good back into the world and helping innocent, helpless members of the public.Antoine Fuqua's take on The Equalizer is little more than a substandard sequel to Tony Scott's Man on Fire with a one-man army exacting violent, bloody revenge and to hell with justice.Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a quiet, ordinary insomniac who spends his days working studiously at Home Mart helping his colleagues and generally being the all-round good guy. By night he is the quiet man in the corner of a cafÃ©, eating pie, working his way through the 100 books everyone must read and interacting with the limited clientÃ¨le â€“ just from a safe distance.Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), is one of those fellow customers; a hooker controlled by violent Russian gangsters. When McCall watches her abused once too often by her pimps, he decides he must help no matter what the cost in blood and bullets.Once upon a time, The Equalizer had some vague semblance of reality, or at least possibility. This is just a solo, unbeatable army on an excessive rampage with no compunction and no consequences whatsoever. There is no hint of cops or government agencies intervening in his reign of terror and no consideration for the time and planning it would take for McCall to lay such deadly booby traps and organize his DIY store war.Essentially, The Equalizer is just one man shooting, killing, fighting and blowing sh*t up. McCall doesn't hide in the shadows, as the previous incarnation did, he lets it all hang out with the arrogance of a gangster and, plot spoiler alert, remains perfectly anonymous despite leaving rubble, corpses and explosions in his wake.Forget reality, forget plot, forget any hope of reason or logic. Just put on your hardhat, buckle up, hide behind a riot shield and get on with the business of being thoroughly entertained.Astoundingly, The Equalizer is rated just 15 meaning that parents can sneak older children/recent teenagers into this. How is that possible with the head smashing, gut spilling and excessive violence? Compare the content of this to that of Gone Girl, which garnered an 18 rating with little violence and just a quick bout of the C-word, and it's madness. What else does a film like The Equalizer have to do to warrant an 18 certificate? Don't let lack of subtlety put you off. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and watching Denzel Washington play Denzel Washington being hard yet again. It's a formula that requires no thought and entertains easily enough. The violence, bloodshed and wanton brutality don't make this a bad film, just don't tell me it's The Equalizer.Edward Woodward is turning in his grave.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,8,16,24 October 2014
The Expendables 2," NO! Don't do it. Go and wash your mouth out.
","It's been a poor cinema month for me. Not that everything I've seen has been bad, more that I've seen very few films this August. And it pains me that one of those was The Expendables 2.Oh, man. It's bad. Really bad. Not bad in an Extremely Close and Incredibly Loud kind of way, just in a Space Cowboys bunch-of-old-farts-acting-badly kind of way. If you enjoyed First Blood, don't bother. It's not that good. If you thought Act of Valor was wonderful, then go and see The Expendables 2. You'll deserve everything you get. So let's start with the good points (this is going to be quick):1. Chuck Norris, despite being born in 1940 and the oldest on screen, looks younger and in considerably better shape than Schwarzenegger and Stallone. 2. Bruce Willis almost escapes with his dignity intact. 3. It eventually ends (after a long, painful 103 minutes).And the pick of the bad points?Oh, there are too many to mention. It's a black hole, into which reason, quality, acting ability, enjoyment, logic, and self-respect are sucked, never to return.Mostly the actors, and once again this term must be used loosely, are unable to move and speak simultaneously and the vast majority of lines are caped at five words. I'm guessing brains are fried and most of those on the screen need idiot boards as well as reading glasses. It's hammed up pretty much all the time.There isn't a single performance worthy of mention other than to say that Willis isn't as dreadful as the others. Usually in a macho gun-fest like this, one can rely on the 'intelligent girl' guest actor to provide something resembling a performance but in this instance Nan Yu falls some distance short of Jason Statham, the untrained, mono-expressive former cab driver.Every possible 'in-joke' and reference to each star's signature roles is explored, repeated, repeated, repeated and nailed to the set for all to see, just in case they missed it the first few times. Exactly how many times can Arnie be back in one film? Yippee ki yay motherÂ…For the first few scenes, any of the audience that isn't dribbling and looking for their other brain cell smiles and hopes that the appalling lack of cohesion and intelligible dialogue is the sly wink and a nudge from director Simon West before he takes the job seriously. It isn't, he doesn't and it doesn't look as though he's capable of doing so. The Expendables 2 is a very, very long and steep decline from the glory days of his first two outings, Con Air and The General's Daughter. What West has given the world in The Expendables 2 is a series of explosions, grunts, expletives and camera moves dressed up as scenes that frequently don't flow or link in any traditional way. It just doesn't make sense. At times, the vocal expression is at odds with the words spoken and completely off-kilter despite following on from another line by the same actor! Did they have month-long breaks between set-ups? Did somebody forget to employ continuity?I'm in danger of ranting and it really isn't worth the effort but I do have one question: What the hell is Chuck Morris doing arriving on screen to Clint Eastwood's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly theme??? It couldn't be any more sacrilegious to dress a statue of Mother Theresa in a basque and suspenders. Well, maybe a little, but you get my drift.If you see this, it serves you right. Needless to say, it wasn't my choice to see The Expendables 2, and now I need to clean my brain with a good book.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",2,22,35,25 August 2012
Skyfall," Craig is raw, harsh, brutal and hurting.
","The rumours built anticipation, the trailer thrilled, the theme song disappointed. The expectation is that Skyfall will be the highest grossing Bond film of all time and Daniel Craig may be the first Bond to garner an Oscar nomination. But could the film possibly stand up to the hype? I grew up in the Roger Moore years and thought he was the bee's knees. As a more discerning cineaste I respected the killer in Timothy Dalton's eyes, though he suffered for the weak films he was dropped into. After the cheesy romantic Brosnan period, Bond was reborn and I cheered very loudly, much to the chagrin of the next door neighbours, when I read that Daniel Craig was to utter those immortal five words.Craig is raw, harsh, brutal and hurting. Know this: James Bond is a killer. It's what he does. Craig's 007 will slot a bullet between your eyes for Queen and country and, outwardly, he won't waste a nanosecond considering the emotional consequences. Because that is his job. No, you wouldn't mess with him and, yes, he is the best 007 yet.But despite the proclamations, Skyfall is not the best Bond film; that accolade, for me, belongs to Casino Royale. Director Sam Mendes hasn't broken Bond, not by a long way, but he has dented it and if they don't repair those dings pretty sharpish, they will rust and cause irreparable damage. Mendes must take the responsibility as he is the top dog on set but the damage has been caused by screenwriter Messrs. Purvis, Wade and Logan. Mendes stated he wanted to inject humour into Bond and from the first twenty minutes or so it was written beautifully. The smiles came from crisp, disposable comments that flowed in conversations, but as Skyfall unfolds scenes are ended with self-conscious, cheesy quips and exchanges and almost blatant winks at the camera. We haven't stepped back to the Moore years but we have certainly suffered a horrible slip to the edge of the Brosnan era Bond.Barbara Broccoli, if you're reading this, please, for the love of all things Bond, stop now, retrace your steps and take Bond back where he belongs; to the dark, reality of espionage and terror that excites us but makes us wee our pants just a little bit in fear. That is who Bond should be.But Skyfall is an extremely good film. Its 143-minute running time sprints past with enough variation in the pace for us to catch our breath and keep up without allowing the heart rate to settle into a relaxed rhythm. Craig is on blistering form, momentary scripted bombs aside, and not once do we believe he is anything but serious or anything less than capable, even when the story suggests otherwise.Skyfall rattles along from the fresh MGM opening sting to the final crescendos, both visually and aurally, as the last of the credits fade. Mendes et al are clearly aware this is Bond's 50th anniversary and there are numerous references to bygone Bonds though, mercifully, no painful cameos from the men who played him. Most are subtle enough to be enjoyable but one jars; it cuts against the naturalistic grain of the film and all but contradicts an exchange between Bond and the excellent new Q (Ben Wishaw):Bond: A gun and a radio? Q: What? You were expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that any more.But in the final act we are thrown a series of references and sequences from that bygone era. What was Mendes playing at?The cast is impeccable. Javier Bardem as Silva is not just a 'bad guy' but a genuine, hope you never meet him anywhere, villain. He is beautifully restrained when first we meet him and our chuckles emerge when the character plays with us, not when we laugh at the funny man. And as he slowly unhinges himself from reality we understand the palpable fear that SÃ©vÃ©rine (BÃ©rÃ©nice Marlohe) fails to disguise in her shaking hand.As ever, the relationship with Craig's Bond and Judi Dench's M is absolutely compelling. The two actors have a rare chemistry that doesn't require a sex scene to make it noticeable. At times she is mother to his petulant teenager but there is a mutual respect, an admiration that veers towards a familial love. And, in M's case, a genuine fear of what she has created.Naomie Harris is a joy to watch. Though she's produced some startlingly good work (28 Days Later, White Teeth) only in Skyfall has she finally stepped into limelight. Perhaps, if we are very fortunate, she will break the 'Bond girl' curse and have a career that continues to ascend rather than evaporate post-event. Next year's Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is a very hopeful start. Equally, both Wishaw and Ralph Fiennes, as government man Gareth Mallory, stand tall as characters that command our attention with solid, determined performances. Wishaw's Q is quirkily engaging but there is clearly far more to him than the cuddly, buffoonery of Desmond Llewelyn and, hopefully, he'll have a more positive impact than the pantomime fool played by John Cleese. Fiennes, meanwhile, sets Mallory up as a hateful man within the fold but his evolution through Skyfall is gently handled to great effect.Skyfall is a very definite statement of intent. Some of that intent concerns me but mostly it is the reason I'll return for a second viewing this week. No, Skyfall is not the best Bond film ever. But it is remarkably good, it will leave you reeling and it is imperative you don't ask and don't let anyone tell you anything about it. See it now and then keep your mouth firmly closed.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",8,2,8,28 October 2012
Iron Man 3," Biff, bash, bang & plenty more. And what a villain in The Mandarin!
","I'm tempted to say Iron Man 3 is the best of the franchise so far in this strand of the Marvel universe. While the 2008 original was thrilling and introduced the world to the mega-rich playboy Tony Stark and his creation perfectly, 2010's sequel floundered at times. With Shane Black taking over the helm from Jon Favreau, Iron Man is back with a punch and it's an absolute blast.When Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) personal life is severely threatened and his home obliterated by a terrorist, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), it becomes personal. Iron Man 3 is not so much about saving America from another larger-than-life villain but about personal revenge. Stark finds himself out of his depth and needing to rely on instincts and the core of his knowledge rather than the excessively equipped laboratories and workshops. As he battles villainy that runs deep, the stress on his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his own panic attacks, Stark must face the truth of the real question that plagues him: Does the man maketh the suit or the suit maketh the man? Iron Man 3 opens with a fun pre-history of Stark where we see what an arrogant fool he was. It serves as an easy introduction to principal guest characters Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) as well as a giving a wink to the fanboys and a nod to the previous two films. It sets the film up nicely as a romp with plenty of gadgets, effects, explosions and a broad smile. More than anything, Iron Man 3 is fun and, at times, very funny.Black, directing only his second feature (after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), has co-written the screenplay with Drew Pearce and his own taste for fun and excess is stamped all the way through it. We see far more of what makes Stark tick; his foibles are laid out for us to mull over and, rather than making him seem weak, he becomes more approachable, more tangible, to us. Downey Jr. is on familiar ground but stretches more to give a fuller performance. There are no surprises but he is satisfyingly suave and cheekily engaging.Black gives Paltrow more to play with in this third installment. Whereas she was previously consigned to forgettable girl on the arm, her Pepper has a more integral role in the film and, even more, a substantial effect on Stark's life and decisions. Here we see that she genuinely matters to him. She is fun, she cares and she isn't going to stand for any more of his bad behavior.Hall, as old flame scientist Maya, is just there. She appears in Iron Man 3 and is effective but, a day later, her presence is barely memorable and she fades behind even the vocal performance of Paul Bettany as Jarvis, the computer with more human qualities and attitude than, well, Maya.Pearce almost reprises his role as Peter Weyland (from Prometheus) but with perhaps a little more tongue in his cheek and a step towards Bond villain status. We have too little of him to really enjoy but his moments on the screen are enjoyable as he evolves from geek to super-brained scientist with a political agenda. Pearce moves easily from star to supporting actor and rarely phones in his performances as certain other stars seem to on 'easy mortgage payment' movies. He adds a welcome edge to a film that would otherwise be all about explosions and digital effects but never slows down the pace.Iron Man 3, however, belongs to one man, and he doesn't wear a metal suit. When we first meet Kinsley's Mandarin it looks as though we're in for a king-sized dollop of ham, as the trailer testifies, that should have been consigned to the bin along with The Hood (No, don't try to defend Thunderbirds, it just won't cut it with me!). But as the film rolls on and his character unfolds, Kingsley provides the greatest moments in a thoroughly enjoyable romp and one is left to wonder whether Downey Jr. respects him for his portrayal as the villain or is severely miffed at having his film well and truly stolen from him. The Mandarin is as memorable a character from Sir Ben as Behrani, Don Logan and Itzhak Stern; and just look at these characters to understand the true versatility of one of the finest actors working on stage and screen today! There are certain names that, when they appear on the screen, leave no room for ambiguity. We know what we're getting from Pixar, Disney, Aardman Animations. The same is true of Marvel and Stan Lee; we're in it for the action, for the spectacle, for the disposable entertainment that will biff, bash and bang. Iron Man 3 gives us all of that and plenty more and it doesn't need 3D to make it work. Having watched it in good old two dimensions, only one scene looks as though it would have been more complete with the third dimension and it was in there purely for the gimmickry. Iron Man 3 doesn't need those cheap tricks with the talent in front of and behind the camera.The final text upon the screen declares that Tony Stark will return. Whether that will be in Iron Man 4 or just the touted The Avengers 2 remains to be seen. But if this is the end of Iron Man in his own right, what a way to bow out! Who knows what the future holds for the franchise? For now, let's just sit back and enjoy every moment of this fantastic, explosive ride.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,1,5,7 May 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Disengage brain, sit back and go with the flow.
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. As titles go, it's up there with Snakes on a Plane and Cowboys Vs Aliens. In terms of quality and sheer entertainment value, it's somewhere between the second half of Cowboys Vs Aliens (about the time the aliens arrive) and the middle third of Snakes on a Plane. It's a 'disengage brain, sit back and go with the flow' kind of film. Don't expect much and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's not terribly inventive, it's deeply flawed but, beyond all else, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a lot of fun.The films starts in 1818 with the young Abraham Lincoln living in Indiana with his parents (Robin McLeavy and, favourite of The Squiss, Joseph Mawle). We're given a quick background lesson as the young Lincoln a) befriends a young African American, William Johnson b) defends Johnson from a beating by the villainous Jack Barts c) watches his mother die after having her wrist 'kissed' by Barts and d) nurtures his desire for revenge for nine years before shooting Barts in the eye only to discover Barts doesn't die that easily becauseÂ… he's a vampire!Lincoln, by now played by Benjamin Walker (as the film progresses he looks more and more like Liam Neeson who, coincidently, was slated to play Lincoln in Spielberg's biopic until he was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis), is rescued from an extremely narked Barts by the mysterious Henry Strugess (Dominic Cooper on fine form). And so begins an odd partnership that leads to vampire hunting, bloodletting, violence and the love of a good woman.After an enjoyable scene-setting first act, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter dives into the action with great gusto and for forty-five minutes or so completely forgets about the niceties of plot or continuity. The lighting and overall feel of the film changes scene by scene; one moment it's moody and gloomy, the next moment sepia images suggest flashbacks but it transpires we've actually advanced in time. It's both clumsy and erratic and there's nothing else to do than sit back, watch the fights and hope it makes sense again soon.A fast-flowing sequence with a horse stampede is blurred with poor digital effects but still enjoyable for the pace and sheer audacity of it, and that's pretty much the format of the film. And using a horse as a weapon is an act of absurdity bordering on genius. The arrival of Refus Sewell as Adam, the big and very bad vampire boss is a welcome boost to the proceedings. It's a very obvious piece of casting but if you need villain who barely resists twiddling his waxed moustache and muttering 'CursesÂ…' then Sewell is your man.Director Timur Bekmambetov doesn't hide from the obvious references and lessons learned from his most successful films to date: Night Watch, Day Watch and the fabulously extreme Wanted. The fight sequences, Lincoln using an axe rather than the standard vampire-slaying silver bullets, are no longer original but still a great deal of fun although everything pales beside the stunning choreography of The Raid, which didn't need to rely on digital effects, blue screens or wire work. As with buses, there's no sign of an historical horror mashup for eons and then suddenly we experience a glut of them. If you're interested, soon to be released are the unrelated Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies (direct-to-DVD and with a budget of $150,000 as opposed to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's $69 million!), FDR: American Badass and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. On the basis of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's box office so far, there'll be a great many more following.And that may not be a bad thing.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",Null,1,2,30 June 2012
John Wick," Keanu Reeves repays a favour in this hit-man stinker. Not good. VERY not good!
","Another day, another review. In the case of John Wick, there's a really short version: Don't bother.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a recently bereaved man whose wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan) kindly, inexplicably, managed to replace herself with a perfectly timed puppy so that John won't be lonely. He also owns a car. Shortly after burying his wife, John takes his dog and fills up his car at the gas station where he attracts the attention of thug Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen, recently seen in Plastic). Iosef wants the car, John doesn't want to sell it, Iosef resolves the issue that night by rearranging John's face, killing the dog and stealing the car. Needless to say, John is a little narked and phones up Iosef's dad, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) to complain. The thing is, John Wick is a retired hit-man and all-round killing machine.John Wick could have been resolved painlessly in five minutes: 'Your son killed my dog and now I want to kill him. If you don't let me, I'll kill everybody you employ, everybody you know and every inanimate object you own.' 'Okay, he'll be home in half an hour. Come on overÂ…'No such luck.It starts slowly, stutters and plummets thereafter.John Wick is the type of film that gives credibility to the opinion that Keanu Reeves stinks on the big screen. It isn't right (sometimes), it isn't fair but in this instance it is fairly accurate. In reality, Reeves is the second best thing (after the dog) in this tedious, ham-fisted mess that attempts to be a thriller, but I suspect there is more to it than that. He isn't awful, he just doesn't appear to be trying. He gives every impression of gritting his teeth, and taking the money before he wanders back into the safe obscurity of the horizon. He looks bored and I suspect he's fulfilling a favour and hoping he escapes in tact.John Wick is the directorial debut of both Chad Stahelski (stunt coordinator and Reeves' double on Constantine, The Matrix films, The Replacements, Point BreakÂ…) and an uncredited David Leitch, who happened to be a stuntman on Constantine and Matrix Revolutions. Either this is one hell of a favour or Keanu Reeves lost big time on the between-the-scenes poker marathons.As we found with The Interview and This is the End, having two directors doesn't mean the film is going to be twice as good. John Wick is proof again that if one director can't make it work, a second director only serves to shoulder the blame. Stahelski and Leitch have hired a goon to 'write' this mess and have then proceeded to direct it in the same manner i.e. in block capitals and armed with wax crayons.Scattered throughout John Wick are subtitles that float across the screen (no bad thing) with random words picked out in block capitals to give the impression of the speakers SHOUTING random WORDS whenever they feel LIKE it (VERY bad THING indeed!). I'm just going to gloss over the needlessly capitalized words sprinkled through them.The performances in John Wick are frequently, painfully wooden and from a cast that also either owed favours (Willem Dafoe) or were cheap (the rest). It plods, lines are repeated and the costume design clearly consisted of shopping; EVERYONE is wearing brand new clothes! John Wick contains some fine action sequences in which Keanu Reeves swings a variety of weapons with maximum effect, but when there is complete reliance on blood spatter and gunfire and a complete oversight when it comes to script, direction, performance, logic and reason, no matter how good your star is, your film is in serious trouble.To refer to my original statement, there is a slightly longer short version: Don't waste your time, money or breath watching, thinking or talking about John Wick.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",2,5,13,21 January 2015
Gravity," Wow! Just, wow!
","Wow! Just, wow! Let's deal with the negative aspects of Gravity first, which are few and almost negligible: I was forced into seeing Gravity in 3D. It wouldn't have been my choice but that was the format of the screening. There are one or two cheep shots (bolts flying into the face) that are nothing more than gimmickry but, to counteract my criticism, I haven't seen 3D work this well since Hugo or witnessed the impressive depth of field afforded by 3D since Avatar. Secondly, George Clooney coasts along in a Doug Ross performance that blends sincerity with a jokey bedside manner. However, it works. Gravity isn't a movie of Oscar-winning performances (though watch out for the nominations and the clean up at the technical Oscars) but of spectacle.Astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final space shuttle mission, onboard Explorer, accompanied by debutant Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). During a standard spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, they are struck by debris travelling at great speed, destroying the shuttle and leaving them spinning in space.After watching the trailer, I had two thoughts: 1. The trailer gave away the entire film and 2. How the heck could co-writer/director Alfonso CuarÃ³n fill 91 minutes with two people floating in the great beyond? It took approximately two minutes to forget my fears and marvel at his achievements.Stunning, amazing, fantastic, superb, beautiful. Pick your superlative. All are apt. Gravity is a ridiculously tense film that had me close to tears at one point and frequently pushing my feet hard against the floor in a vain attempt to help the astronauts survive. Grab it, stop, for the love of god grab somethingÂ… The digital work is astounding. It's like climbing into an ever evolving painting and making it one's own world. The sensation of weightlessness is achieved flawlessly through wirework and digital magic. Space has never looked so beautiful nor been so devastatingly destructive. Every wide shot could be frozen, framed and mounted above the fireplace.It's not often I am compelled to mention the camera work but the shots here are at times staggeringly good. There is one particular fluid shot where the camera sweeps slowly before Ryan's terrified face, turning slowly to slide through her helmet and present her point of view before seamlessly retreating along the same arc. For this cineaste, that was a moment! The screenplay is sparse on dialogue, in comparison to most big screen offerings, but not a single word is wasted. Co-written with his son, JonÃ¡s, CuarÃ³n's screenplay is at times gently amusing and often taut with clipped utterances. Like oxygen supplies in space, words are not to be squandered. The visual feast before us tells us more than the dialogue and Steven Price's magnificent, atmospheric score completes the experience as strikingly as the elongated silences. With all the ingredients blended, Gravity is ridiculously tense! It almost hurts to watch it but it demands repeated viewings and my second will be tonight.Though there are peripheral characters, notably Ed Harris as the voice of Mission Control (just one of many references to space and sci-fi flicks gone by), Gravity is a film of two actors who are frequently isolated on the screen.Clooney is a natural, formidable presence. If one were lost in space and facing possible death 940,000 miles from home, his Matt Kowalski would be high on the wish list of companions in doom. Largely a vocal performance (it's difficult to see much of him behind the helmet), his performance is a tangible aspect in a situation we could never fully appreciate. He leaves us in no doubt as to the urgency of their predicament while refusing to carry a scythe and read the last rites. Matt is the astronaut equivalent of a surgeon finding the humorous benefit of weight loss via amputation.Sandra Bullock has never been better. Not even when earning her Oscar for The Blind Side. No, she may not strike double gold with Ryan, but what on earth is she doing trudging through bilge like The Heat when she is capable of this? It is very difficult to carry a film as (frequently) the lone performer with no-one to bounce off but Bullock's performance is beautifully controlled and profoundly affecting. Perhaps the backstory is a little contrived but that is not her fault and, more to the point, it makes Ryan human and allows the events to unfold as they do. Watching Bullock in Gravity, one wonders if we have seen the birth of a career butterfly finally emerging after 25 years from a comfortable chrysalis.Maybe I'm going soft, maybe I'm hormonal, or perhaps I've just been lucky this past three weeks and seen three fantastic films (after The Kings of Summer and Captain Phillips), but Gravity is stunning. I emerged from the screening drained and I have to see it again.On a slight tangent, earlier this week a certain BBC presenter referred to Gravity as 'this year's Life of Pi.' My heart sank as I thought he implied that none of it had actually happened and that perhaps Ryan would awake to find herself at peace in another place with it all having been in her mind. For those who heard the same report, fear not. The comparison comes from Matt and Ryan being shipwrecked, albeit in space, and the phenomenal special effects. There is a crash, they are floating in space and Gravity is nothing short of an exquisite film.With all the eloquence I can muster, wow!",10,3,5,23 October 2013
Lone Survivor," The younger, less-loved brother of The Green Zone.
","There's been much said about Lone Survivor â€“ mostly by my frequent cinema companion, Bag, who read the book by Marcus Luttrell upon which it was based. Mostly I trust Bag's opinion and heed his guidance, but then there was the Act of Valor episode, and we all know how that one endedÂ… Lone Survivor begins with the titles laid across documentary footage of Navy SEALs undergoing, failing and surviving basic training. It has little bearing on the feature that follows, but it succeeds in giving audiences an understanding of the elite military unit and the essential backstory to the characters as a whole. Based on the actual events of ill-fated covert mission Operation Red Wings, in which a small force endeavours to 'neutralize' Ahmed Shah, a Taliban operative, Peter Berg's film embellishes the truth to make it more exciting, and perhaps palatable, for his niche audience.To the ignorant near-pacifist, it seems a little odd that Navy SEALs should find themselves on a mountain in landlocked Afghanistan, but that is perhaps beside the point. Berg wisely avoids the politics of whether America had any business being in Afghanistan in the first place but cannot resist a moment of self-congratulation with Peter Gabriel's rendition of Heroes over the end credits. But, while both issues rankle slightly, they are understandable moves and still a long way from the blinkered, gung-ho approach of Act of Valor.Lone Survivor is no Hurt Locker but it doesn't scrape the depths of the barrel the afore mentioned battle flick managed to achieve. While it is never going to convince the sceptics that war is good and that it was a legal escapade, it is a compelling look at the camaraderie and the sheer bloody mindedness of soldiers on a mission. Scruples are hinted at and consciences suggested, but I'm not sure Lone Survivor has anything particular to say beyond acknowledging the bond of military brotherhood under gunfire.Mark Wahlberg does a convincing job and I'm sure Luttrell the soldier will be more than happy with his portrayal by the actor. As a small unit, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster, along with Wahlberg, gel as a film watcher would hope a quartet of SEALs would. Was it realistic? I don't know; I've never been paid to shoot at people. But they create a sense of genuine solidarity and, while I was never convinced to actually like them, it was impossible not to admire their spirit.Lone Survivor aims for naturalism with the weaponry, sound effects and the sheer grit and discomfort of mountain/desert warfare and, so I'm told, Berg has achieved a reasonable level of technical accuracy, but there is nothing here that really sets it above or apart from other war films. Black Hawk Down is more thrilling, The Green Zone more shocking and The Hurt Locker far more intense. It's fine, it's good but there's no hint of a sixth star wandering into the rating.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,0,2,6 February 2014
Fury," Shocking, bloody, harrowing film of WWII depravity and heroism.
","Fury has arrived amid much fanfare but it opens with a slow, cold eerily beautiful shot redolent of Lawrence of Arabia, albeit with an air of doom rather than mystery and promise. As the distant, wandering human figure arrives at an impromptu tank graveyard haunted by the smoky spectres of burning machines and the silence of death, the scene is set, the characters are established and we are left in no doubt as to the tone of the next two hours.David Ayer's war film sits somewhere between Saving Private Ryan and The Magnificent Seven as a film of brotherhood against all odds. It is April, 1945 and the Allies are pushing through Germany in the final stages of WWII. In the midst of it is a battered Sherman tank that will not die, containing a crew of cynical, war-hardened, embittered soldiers who will not give in. Commanded by Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), the crew emerges from yet another onslaught, bloodied, shattered and one soldier down. There is little time to recover before they are sent on another mission, the quintet completed by greenstick Norman (Logan Lerman - Noah, The Perks of Being a Wallflower) a soldier whose only war experience is a few months typing at a desk.The greatest achievement of Fury is the depiction of the horror and barbarism of war. Horror is not vampires and monsters, it is what humankind does to its itself; it is what ordinary human beings do to each other in extraordinary circumstances. Wardaddy might have been a decent man once but now he has been all but stripped of his humanity. He and his crew fight, kill, maim and abuse in order, not just to survive, but also to inflict pain and degradation on whatever and whomever they determine is the enemy. This is horror, physical and emotional, in great, grotesque, slopping bucket loads from the pieces of face splattered across the tank to the knuckle-chewing dread of what they might do to German civilians or prisoners of war.Director David Ayer (Sabotage, End of Watch) has not taken the gung-ho stance of showing American soldiers as the heroes of the hour nor presented the convenient 'truth' that the enemy was bad and the allies good. We like to convince ourselves that the Allied troops fought a gentlemanly war against animals but Ayer leaves us in no doubt as to the horror and crimes they, too, committed in the name, and under the pressure, of war.Fury is intense. It is angry and shocking. It is sickening and harrowing. It is a bloody, stomach-churning insight into the despicable acts that both sides committed and a particular sequence in a house with two innocent German women is terrifying for the possibility of what ordinary men may or may not inflict upon them.Frequently Fury is not enjoyable, and nor should it be. At times it is harrowing to observe and Ayer has ensured every shot is truthful, even if the plot is rather more fantastic than realistic. The production design is remarkable with ankle-deep mud hindering escaping refugees while rubble smoulders around them. Even the peripheral shots are crafted with wince inducing care from the crushed and humiliated POWs pressed against wire to the desperate woman hacking at the carcass of a fallen horse for food. But though Fury is often difficult to watch, Ayer's screenplay is also funny at times, lightning the atmosphere and allowing us to understand the camaraderie between Wardaddy, Bible (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo (Michael PeÃ±a), Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal) and Norman. Though their actions are frequently unjustifiable, Ayer is careful to make them understandable without giving them a rose-tinted glow. That they regard the breaking of Norman's spirit as an achievement and an imperative is a damning statement about their war thus far. It is little wonder that so many veterans refused to discuss their experiences of war.Steven Price's score takes us back to the atmospherics of his Oscar-winning composition for Gravity. Again, his work is powerful, mechanical and intense, accentuating the harrowing visuals beautifully.The final act of Fury is a Custer's last stand of epic proportions. It is unrealistic and portrays the SS not as evil but as thoroughly inept. No, there is little chance of such a stand off occurring or lasting so long but Fury is, after all, a work of fiction set against a very real, actual horror. The Boys Own adventure heroics are forgivable in a film of warfare when no pretence has been made of this being a real occurrence.I've read a couple of other reviews in the 'established' magazines/newspapers and there seems to be a snobbery about Rage, with them awarding low ratings. I don't see the issue. Nothing will have the impact that Saving Private Ryan did with the Omaha beach scenes. In that, Spielberg set a whole new benchmark with visual impact. But here Ayre takes us back to similar emotions and doesn't pull any punches in his depiction of the depravity to which some will stoop and the heroism that a few will attain.Fury is not a fun war movie. War is horrific and we should not fool ourselves into believing otherwise. In that, Fury is a triumph.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,2,7,27 October 2014
This Is the End," One long, egotistical dick-waving contest that thinks rape is a joke. Avoid!
","This is the End? I wish! Actually, what this is, is one long dick-waving contest starring a bunch of loud, egotistical 'stars' with money, influence, little sense and producers who are too wimpish to point out that what they've produced lacks plot, cohesion, reason or humour. This is the End is one weak plot line away from a Movie 43 rating of zero stars.It's crass, loud, overwritten, not for Christians or admirers of quality and good taste. Mostly it just isn't funny, not unless you think you'll split your sides as a group of loud, brash morons argue about not raping Emma Watson.Rape as a joke? Yup, that's the level! The interminable opening scene, where they (directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg) introduce us to all the stars who play themselves and we lose the will to live, is saved only by Michael Cera, the solitary person on screen capable of playing a pastiche of himself that is remotely amusing. It's an agonizing ten minutes that aged me by ten years. When it finally gives way to the apocalypse implied by the title there are five minutes of fun, enjoyable effects and the suggestion of an action-packed, funny romp. And then it thuds to depths far beyond those where Rhianna et al end up.The row I was in probably spanned the ages of 16 and 60 and I don't believe any of us laughed once. About 25% of the audience found it occasionally amusing and a group of three lads behind us clearly thought it was the funniest thing they'd seen all week. Either they had snorted the contents of a small country or someone lobotomizes the locals.This is the End, which is asking for trouble with a title like that, is less funny than inhaling someone else's belch. The 'jokes' for the most part shouldn't have started and sure as hell didn't know where to end. Everything is elongated and has the feel of lazy writing, even lazier direction and protracted, narcissistic improvisation with no one to reign it in.My head hurts. Make it end.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",1,28,67,10 June 2013
World War Z," Re-imagines the zombocalypse but misses the heights of 28 Days Later.
","There's been much hoo-ha about Marc Forster's (Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace) interpretation of Max Brook's novel, not least of all the, ah, 'restructuring' of the story but, here at last, we have the Brad Pitt zombie flick we've been waiting for.World War Z re-imagines the zombocalypse with an eye on Contagion and a hope of matching the brilliant freshness of 28 Days Later â€“ heck, Forster's even brought in Muse to blast some tunes across the bloodshed â€“ but though it entertains and occasionally re-imagines what zombies can and cannot do (and that's not a problem â€“ the vampires of 30 Days of Night are vastly different from Nosferatu and more frightening for it), it falls very far short of Danny Boyle's modern classic. In 28 Days Later we appreciate the devastation that has befallen the world as Cillian Murphy wanders through a deserted London with only pigeons and the husks of crumpled double-decker buses for company. The World War Z equivalent is Brad Pitt strolling along a short street of terraced houses somewhere in Wales. It's a pale imitation and, though far from clumsy, is inadequate.Inadequacy is the overall feeling of World War Z. It's enjoyable enough and has the occasional periods of tension, though most are given away in the trailer, and a few moments of magic. For my part, I loved the surging mountain of zombies attempting to breach the city walls in Israel but I wanted tension, I wanted to feel unnerved as well as excited. Alas, I was left wanting.Brad Pitt makes an able hero, as Gerry Lane, and he's believable as the dad who must return to the job he left with the UN to understand the cause and evolution of the disease that is wiping out mankind, in order to guarantee safety for his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), and their children. The scripting is acceptable but there's a dearth of characters that really matter or that one can care about until the arrival of Segan (Daniella Kertesz) as a soldier Gerry acquires along his trek.Peter Capaldi, as a W.H.O. doctor brings a certain gravitas to proceedings but by then World War Z has stumbled into a reasonably predictable formula and, though Capaldi is a pleasure to watch, he's just another body carried along by the film.The occasional moment of genuine delight is marred by the odd example of clunkiness and the periodic travesty. World War Z may boast the best zombie mountain since the last one but it also shrivels under the glare of absolutely the most blatant, jarring, gratuitous product placement since Will Smith gushed over his Chucks in I, Robot: Tired of killing zombies? Why not relax against a drinks machine for a couple of minutes and pop yourself a Pepsi as the other survivors and the audience tick off the seconds and watch youÂ… It's unnecessary and it convinced me to knock another star off the rating.World War Z is emphatically not as bad many people will have you believe. It's fun, it passes the time but, coming from Pitt and a director of Forster's caliber, it jolly well should be better!

The Hunger Games," Entertaining but shallow & you'll need to have read the book to fill in the gaps.
","Late last year I was handed a free book at the cinema as part of a promotion. I read the back, dismissed it as a teen book and plonked it on the bookcase for a day of lazy reading sometime in the future. A couple of weeks ago I saw the trailer for The Hunger Games and dismissed it as a watered down, sanitized version of Battle Royale. Then I noticed the logo and recognized it from the afore mentioned book. Intrigued, I set aside an hour that Sunday to read the first couple of chapters to see if it would be worth watching the film and promptly devoured the book in a single sitting.Whilst it will never go down in history as a literary classic and will be forgotten in twenty years, unlike the Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter volumes, The Hunger Games trilogy is a stomping good read and perfectly fits the overused clichÃ© of 'page-turner.' Though a couple of hundred pages away from the end, I'm loving it. It's easy, gripping, highly entertaining, disposable fun. That said, I've read Catch 22 more times than I have fingers on one-and-a-half hands and look what they did to that on film. And Captain Corelli's Mandolin. AndÂ… For those without a clue, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are selected for the Hunger Games, a barbaric, televised show in which 'Tributes' are taken from each of twelve districts of a futuristic, dystopian America (now known as Panem) to enter a vast, synthetic arena and kill each other until only one remains. There's more to it than that but if you're familiar with the likes of Battle Royale, Rollerball and The Running Man you'll know where it's heading.So, what did they do to The Hunger Games? Well, they cut it. They had to, because it would have been at least a four hour film. Being written largely in the first person, there were no subplots with peripheral characters to excise and so the editing had to come through losing detail with the result that the film lacks depth. I took a friend who hadn't read the books and afterwards I needed to explain some of the exchanged glances between protagonists Katniss and Peeta and fill in the gaps for him. Gary Ross has directed it with the aim of satisfying the vast army of readers whilst hoping not to ostracize those who enter the cinema without background knowledge of the film. Unfortunately he doesn't quite satisfy either camp.Katniss' thoughts, the reason we understand and identify with her so completely, have been lost. Her relationships with both Peeta and her lifelong friend, Gale, are shallow and we are not given enough time with their team in the Capitol to really appreciate the mind games, the relationships and the characters. This is a rare example when a film just shy of two-and-a-half hours needs to be at least thirty minutes longer! Too much is compressed and it feels choked of the life that flowed rapidly through the book. From the film I don't know much about Katniss and couldn't warm to her while, in the book, she is flawed, driven, angry, hopeful and a multi-faceted character I both liked and could respect.The 'game' is all too brief. We actually see very little of the killing and know comparatively little of the battles between the twenty-four adolescents that must dwindle to one. The violence has been virtually eradicated to the point where only a Daily Mail reader could be shocked and the beasts in the final act are completely wasted and the reason for them all but lost in clumsy CGI not at all befitting the $78m budget. More frustrating is the complete redesign of the cornucopia in the arena that is very pointedly described as gold throughout the books and conjures an image of a vast, ornate horn. Instead it more closely resembles an unpainted, bastardized Batmobile stolen from Christian Bale.Is it as good as Battle Royale? Hmmm, probably not in the case of the film. But, particularly with the book, it's different and equally as valid. See the film. It is very entertaining, but read the trilogy first so that you can fill in the gaps as they pass across the screen.Another film review from The Squiss.

The Impossible," Powerful, numbing film of one miracle amongst 227,898 tragedies.
","On Boxing Day 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami devastated swathes of bordering landmasses. It wiped out entire communities, reportedly eradicated an entire race and amassed a death toll of 227,898 people in fourteen countries. From this horror emerged the story of a family who survived and found each other amongst the destruction. It was a story both fantastic and seemingly impossible. See what they did there? The Impossible opens with a couple of horrible scenes that scream 'You WILL love this perfect family!' and demands we know exactly how wonderful and worthy of our crossed fingers they are. My heart sank and I slouched into my seat, resigned to a horribly saccharine experience. And then The Impossible caught its reflection in the mirror, shuddered and got on with being a very fine film indeed.It's not perfect. Firstly, the family is French. Last time I looked, Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and the boys were not. So why were they cast? Box office takings! I'm willing to bet the average British and American cinemagoer, the desired demographic at least, couldn't name more than one French actor (GÃ©rard Depardieu) or a couple of French actresses (Audrey Tautou, Marion Cotillard) and they don't make a pretty couple or open a movie stateside. One suspects the final reuniting of the family is tidier than in reality and it dampens the emotional impact of all that has preceded, but running time constraints make that understandable.Less acceptably, while The Impossible understandably focuses on one family, the peripheral characters are almost entirely tourists. Tourists accounted for approximately 9,000 casualties but little attention is given to two hundred and twenty thousand (give or take) indigenous victims other than showing they helped the injured tourists. Hmmm.And the most frightening scene in the entire film is a truly horrible Carrie-like hand emerging (from the sea rather than a grave) to an endless violin explosion that is entirely nauseating when complete silence would have been infinitely more powerful.However, The Impossible is emotionally stirring and rather than simply tugging at heartstrings mawkishly, it draws us into the horrific situation. In a similar way to the Omaha Beach sequences of Saving Private Ryan, we feel the physical pain of Maria (Naomi Watts) as she is bounced, pounded and pierced by debris under water. Frequently the audience recoiled and inhaled sharply in unison as the utter destruction, to feeble bodies more so than landscape, was unavoidably apparent. As a toddler mewed like tortured kitten, the reality of the impact the tsunami had on so many people struck hard and doubt I was alone in imagining myself in the situation of losing those I care most about.The physical effects (apparently probative cost kept CGI to a minimum) are blisteringly good. To me they were shockingly realistic and more impactful than I had imagined and my thoughts have been echoed by some who were there. Forget cheesy Poseiden water effects, the unforgiving wave is breathtaking and you'll grimace as it smashes with its initial destruction and then withdraws and returns for another attack. And another.Director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) cleverly staggers the horror throughout the film so we aren't blasted with an hour of annihilation followed by endless schmaltz. He weaves it carefully throughout the story so that we cannot escape the reality or slip into carefree comfort but must endure the constant reminders of how truly horrific, how cataclysmic the tsunami was, not just on one Boxing Day but for the days, weeks, months after. Years later the land is still scarred and the dead still do not breath and Bayona takes care to show us this without taking us so far out of our comfort zones we cannot 'enjoy' The Impossible.The star names this is pinned on are superb throughout (overlooking the initial scenes). Both McGregor and Watts have their moments centre stage and their anguish is palpable. It's been a very long time since I cried in the cinema but I wiped moistened eyes more often than I'll admit and my throat felt larger than it should. When Henry borrows a phone to call home but crumples, it is not only McGregor's remarkable performance that induces tears, it is the way he drags us into his situation with him and we find ourselves thinking not 'Who would I call?' but 'Can I remember their phone number?' Once again, after Beasts of the Southern Wild and Jagten, the child actors astound in their ability to match their adult counterparts. Though the younger sons have little weight to carry, Tom Holland's performance as eldest son Lucas is remarkably mature and marks him as actor who just might have the depth and ability to sustain a career beyond puberty. There is such reality in his performance as a son desperate for his mum to hold and reassure him, but called upon to help her live. As she coughs blood uncontrollably, he yells at her 'Stop doing that!' masking his terror with heartbreaking anger. At various times throughout The Impossible, I looked upon Lucas and his brothers and considered no child should be forced to grow up so quickly.The Impossible will surely be criticized for being sentimental but that is both harsh and unfair. This is no Titanic that we'll look back on with embarrassment. This is a remarkable true story of something close to a miracle that occurred in the midst of chaos and obliteration but, even in the moments of elation, Bayona remains grounded and one family's joy is cause for both celebration and damnation as less fortunate survivors wander past, watching in aloof desolation.The Impossible is a numbing experience that will sit with you on your journey home. One miracle does not erase 227,898 tragedies.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",8,1,3,7 January 2013
42," Adequate, average, easy & ideal for a quiet Sunday afternoon.
","It's not a prerequisite to enjoy and understand baseball to appreciate 42, but it probably helps.The latest offering from writer/director Brian Helgeland, the scribe behind Green Zone and the man in the chair for A Knight's Tale, has a smattering of sufficient ingredients to guarantee it becomes a reasonably popular, moderate hit without being striking enough to make it a spectacular blockbuster. Dealing with racism and class prejudice, a good-triumphs-over-evil element and the feel-good factor of an underdog story, 42 will satisfy most viewers and adequately fill a couple of hours without knocking your day out of kilter.42 is based on the true story of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) who, in 1946, became the first African American to play major league baseball when he was recruited by club president and GM of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), and wore, unsurprisingly, the number 42 shirt. It was a remarkable moment in sporting history, a great day for humanity and requires little imagination to see the filmic potential. In terms of cinematic 'beating the odds' films, it ranks above last year's Red Tails, but it doesn't quite have the impact of, say, The Power of One and certainly falls short of the emotional tugging that The Blind Side enjoyed.But sometimes an 'easy', feel-good tale of moral victories and minor tension is exactly what is required and 42 works perfectly if you're not hoping for Oscar bait.Central to the film is Boseman, a TV actor (Persons Unknown, Lincoln Heights) who is finding some success on the big screen (Ivan Reitman's Draft Day, with Kevin Costner, and James Brown biopic, Get On Up, are both in post-production). He gives a temperate performance as the feisty sportsman who refuses to be beaten by prejudice but must sit out the fisticuff fights to win the emotional, political war. Boseman has the charisma to carry the film but it is the supporting characters who add depth to 42.Harrison Ford has entered a new chapter of his career with Rickey. Make-up and padding help, but Ford is in full flow as a baggy, gruff business man with a good heart and a moralistic view bound tightly with his need to make his business (the Dodgers) turn a profit. There is something of Albert Finney in his performance and his Rickey could be a close cousin of Erin Brockovich's Ed Masry. On the basis of this, Ford may just become this generation's Jason Robards. There's no great surprise in his performance but an evolution of the character he has played variations of for much of his career. It's a solid, fun performance that avoids becoming irascible in a Clint Eastwood way.Yes, 42 is woolly at times and it lacks either impact or surprise, but it avoids becoming twee and is a thoroughly enjoyable film. And sometimes that's all you need on a lazy Sunday afternoon.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,1,1,15 October 2013
Argo," A skin-tingling, nerve-wracking five-star experience, politics aside
","There are some who have shouted very loudly that Argo is nothing more than a well-timed slice of propaganda intended to influence the presidential election. Firstly, I'm sure Barrack Obama is hoping that something more tangible than a mere movie will allow him to keep his home on Pennsylvania Avenue. Secondly, that's a terribly scathing view of the American voters. Okay, we'll ignore the embracing of pseudo-patriotic claptrap Act of Valor and the attacks on Kevin Smith for Dogma but you know what I mean.Lay your political bias aside for 120 minutes, regardless of whether you're red or blue. Argo serves up the kind of tension that modern day horror meisters dream of. Such a film faces an immediate challenge in that most of the audience already knows the outcome, although that didn't dampen the fervor for Titanic or the tension created in Bryan Singer's Valkyrie.But like Valkyrie, it doesn't matter that you know the result of the audacious plan in Argo although, if your USA/Iran historical knowledge is patchy and this episode passed you by, perhaps it's better to maintain your ignorance and watch as it unfolds. Let me know how it hits you and we can compare experiences from each other's perspective.In 1979, in the aftermath of the Shah's exile and the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini, the American embassy in Tehran was overthrown and fifty-two hostages were taken. Six, however, escaped and were given refuge by the Canadian ambassador. With the situation volatile to say the least, the CIA floundered looking for an escape route for the six before being presented with the 'best bad idea': smuggle them out as the production crew of a fictitious movie called Argo.The story is remarkable. If we didn't know it was true, who would believe such a ridiculous, life-threatening escapade could be undertaken? This film of that story is absolutely riveting. At times it is genuinely very funny, both for the dialogue and the absurdity of what unfolds in Hollywood and Iran. More often it is terrifying. My skin prickled with the fear and tension in a way I haven't experienced since, oh, probably The Exorcist. The danger most of the participants are in and the likelihood of a brutal death is palpable even from the safety of a cinema seat and I found myself desperately hoping, wishing and willing them on, incapable of stepping back and viewing Argo as simply a film to which I knew the conclusion. Argo is not a film one can sit back and watch, it is an experience that sucks you into its midst.This is Ben Affleck's third feature as director after the superb Gone Baby Gone and equally impressive The Town and yet again he proves to be a far finer director than he is an actor. That said, as Tony Mendez, the man behind the madcap idea of Argo, he proves he is more than capable of holding a film and commanding our attention on both sides of the camera. Affleck is this generation's Clint Eastwood or Sean Penn and his work is proving to be of an extremely high calibre.The cast is superb and greatly varied, in some instances the likenesses to their real-life counterparts is almost uncanny. There isn't a standout performance amongst the hostages but neither is there a character that takes the limelight. They form a desperate ensemble careering towards mortality while supporting, laughing and bickering like children who are being forced into actions they have no say over. It is impossible to judge their petulance or negativity when the reality of their predicament is so obvious.Alan Arkin as Lester Siegel is the light but cutting relief in a film filled with characters starring into an horrific abyss and John Goodman completes the double act in his most enjoyable performance since The Big Lebowski, proving he's worthy of more than the light pap he so often finds himself in. Bryan Cranston is a revelation for those who know him only as Hal from Malcolm in the Middle. The strain is evident in his face and the emotional turmoil he is enduring is barely masked by his occasional smiles and blatantly obvious when he momentarily allows the dam to burst.The greatest delight with Argo is the sense that it is real, that we are part of the dangerous fiasco and not merely observers from the future. For those who stay, there is a lovely touch at the end with photos of the 'reality' paired with stills from the film as the credits roll. These, like the actors playing the parts, are strikingly similar and the horror of the situation is subtly emphasized.Who needs schlock fantasy horror when you can enjoy a genuinely chilling horror of the reality?For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",10,2,6,31 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fun, enjoyable and colourful but missing something integral.
","The Star Trek universe didn't really excite me. I enjoyed the original series reruns as a boy and watched several of the films before deciding The Wrath of Khan was probably as good as it was going to get and that I couldn't deal with watching the wrinklies staggering across the screen in roll-neck jumpers any more. Then along came 2009's Star Trek with a Batman Begins jumpstart.It was a moment (well, 127 minutes) of eye-opening reassessment. J.J. Abrams had cleverly, spectacularly reinvented the franchise for the fanboys and the jaded alike, and the USS Enterprise was back in some fashion! So, naturally, expectations were very high for Star Trek Into Darkness. How could the wizard who conjured it back to life not succeed? WellÂ… No, it's not fair to go as far as to say Abrams has failed. He hasn't. Far from it. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun film, has plenty of spectacular moments, countless visual feasts to consume and lots to enjoy, but it just doesn't touch his first effort. I departed feeling unsatisfied. It should have been so much more and it felt incomplete despite being rammed full of effects, action, dramaÂ…Star Trek Into Darkness is a new take on a familiar story with a villain (Benedict Cumberbatch â€“ I'm not sure if there'll be cries of 'Plot spoiler!' if I reveal his character) on a mission of destruction and revenge; roles are swapped, action ramped up, emotions toyed with and, rather than feeling tired, it gives a sense of comfort. We're with old friends here, both in terms of storyline and characters, but there's a danger of complacency and a real presence of flippancy. Far too often drama or tension gives way to a quip and the positioning of a tongue deeply in a cheek. I didn't buy 'funny', I bought spectacle, but too often the magnificence is diluted by frivolity.There are moments when it works, like the first couple of interactions with Scotty (Simon Pegg) and his pet, Keenser (Deep Roy who, strangely, isn't worthy of a credit on IMDb), but after a while it just becomes tiresome. That said, Pegg slips into the character more convincingly this time around; or maybe it's just that Abrams trusts him with more screen time.There's sufficient on screen to keep the fanboys happy with numerous references to the Star Trek canon, peripheral characters that mean little to most viewers and the obligatory nod to previous incarnations (both with actors and model spaceships lined up) and, visually at least, there are plenty of scenes of pure CG magic. The digital and physical sets are beautiful and the opening scenes, though a little too Indiana Jones to be taken seriously, are an exquisite blend of striking reds, bold yellows, stark whites and, finally, as the sea enters the frame, startling blue. It's a visually gorgeous sequence that feels a little tainted by cheap dialogue.There are periods where Star Trek Into Darkness feels confused. No, not confused, cluttered, as if too much has been stirred into the soup with no real idea of what the overriding flavor should be. We are given a two-hour game of musical chairs with the captain's seat in which every characteristic gets a shot at being in charge of something or just watches longingly from the sidelines: sexy Carol (Alice Eve), priggish Spock (Zachary Quinto), nervous Chekov (Anton Yelchin), grumpy Bones (Karl Urban), supercilious Uhura (Zoe Saldana), dependable Captain Pine (Bruce Greenwood) and, of course, rascally liability Kirk (Chris Pine). It's like watching a weird recasting of the seven dwarfs all vying for attention when they should be doing their jobs.Despite this being the second film in the reboot, Star Trek Into Darkness spends too much time introducing us to characters rather than allowing them to progress the story. We know who they are, so why does it need to be spelt out again so precisely? And why, oh why, does Abram still insist on Chekov mispronouncing his Vs as Ws? Yelchin is Russian, so surely he knows better. Admittedly, I don't have a lot of Russian names in my address book but I've not met one yet who actually drank wodka, other than in unimaginatively stereotypical movies.On a positive note, Cumberbatch makes a very dependable villain. He relishes the opportunity to exude power and menace and emerges the prominent star, or at least the most memorable performance, of the film. Strangely, though Kirk should be the hero of the piece, he is almost lost in the mayhem and his standout scenes are memorable largely for the presence of others: Carol removing most of her kit, Spock being stoically cantankerous or Pine just having the screen presence to swat Kirk aside.Not that it matters. Star Trek Into Darkness is fun. It's worth wasting a couple of hours over. It's just that it feels like the 'difficult second album' after a huge hit. Let's just hope Star Trek 3 is back on track.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,4,20,14 May 2013
Ted," The ideal date film for easily pleased, drunk students.
","I first watched the trailer for Ted while waiting for A Fantastic Fear of Everything to begin. It started, I wondered, I smiled, I laughed out loud and then I noticed the loud silence beside me.Alas, my companion for the evening does not take kindly to profanity and is more easily offended than I. Either my offence threshold is substantial or I'm debauched and immoral. I'll leave you to decide. However, the point I'm making is that Ted is very likely to offend if you're extremely Christian, shocked by obscenities and sexual depiction or just an innocent Aunt Nelly. Written and directed by Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy and American Dad, Ted steps further over the line, delves deeper into the realms of bad taste and would disturb the late Mary Whitehouse far, far more than Dennis Potter or A Clockwork Orange ever did, if she were six feet higher and in better shape than is currently the case.So, Ted will succeed in offending those who choose to be offended but is it any good? Yes, but not amazingly so. Is it funny? Again, yes, but not as funny as it could have been. There are a few moments that prompt muted guffaws but it stands a long way behind the delights of last year's The Guard or even Goon from earlier this year. The funniest moments are the snap reactions (a certain punch in the final act, the horror of Mr. & Mrs. Bennett when they discover their son's bear is alive) but, though there are regular moments to exercise the lungs, there is never a danger of split sides.Ted should be very funny. The core idea is funny: The lonely, bullied, eight year old John receives a teddy bear for Christmas and wishes it to life so that he can have a friend for life. Ted becomes an American celebrity then falls from grace and the two friends settle into a coach potato life of drink, drugs and unrealized potential. All of this occurs in the first few minutes and is explained through a narration from Patrick Stewart in a below-par version of Tom Baker's outstanding Little Britain commentaries. And that's pretty much how the film runs: below par.Much of the comedy is vulgar and puerile but that was bound to be the case. However, it should also be clever and it isn't; it could be subtle but it's almost always over-egged. Once we get past the initial, superb set-up, the story is really quite simple and plods along bypassing every offshoot that offers depth and substance. There is little of either here and that isn't helped by the actors. Mark Wahlberg, as the adult John, wanders through Ted on autopilot delivering his lines with almost the required amount of emotion but less like an actor and more like one of a group of friends roleplaying in college improve club.Mila Kunis, playing his girlfriend Lori, similarly plods along without any real impact. Ten hours later I can barely remember any significant scenes involving her let alone killer lines. The highpoint of her career so far, Black Swan, seems very far in the past. Joel McHale plays a greasier, less sophisticated and more unlikeable version of his Community hero, Jeff, and even the reliable and reliable quality fallback, Giovanni Ribisi is wasted as watered-down familiar crazy. Although far from perfect, the standout is actually the voice of Ted, MacFarlane.There are some fun cameos, one of which is an absolute delight, one short and sweet and one dragged out, strung out, wrung out and washed out. These three cameos say a great deal about Ted. When it's sharp, it's bang on the money but far too often the team just doesn't know when to cut and move on. There have been many examples of when having a one person star, write (or adapt) and direct works admirably (Keneth Branagh's In the Bleak Midwinter, Hamlet and Henry V, George Clooney's The Ides of March, Mel Gibson's Apocalypto) but Seth MacFarlene is none of these and this is a classic argument against such control (or ego).If you're an easily pleased drunk student you'll probably love it but for anyone else, it probably isn't worth the effort. And whilst much of the bad language is merely punctuation and down to lazy writing rather than for comedic effect, it isn't a reason to be offended or avoid Ted. The reason to avoid Ted, if you choose to do so, is that it isn't anywhere near as good as it should be or thinks it is.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",3,3,7,7 August 2012
Rise of the Guardians," Charming, fun, predictable, forgettable.
","When Pitch aka The boogeyman attacks Earth in a bid to be remembered  and feared by the world's children, the Immortal Guardians (North/Santa  Claus, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny) stand together to fight  his onslaught but even united they are too weak and so the man in the  moon adds another guardian to their list: Jack Frost.  Rise of the Guardians opens with a wink to The Bourne Identity with  Jack Frost (Chris Pine) floating in water before springing to life and  extricating himself from the frozen lake and spending the next three  hundred years wreaking havoc with his talents and generally kicking  about the world like a mildly rebellious, bored teenager until called  upon by the big boss.  It's a fun introduction during which we see some beautiful effects as  he frosts windows, freezes trees and causes snowball fights and other  snow fun. Then Rise of the Guardians becomes cluttered and looses some  of its magic. It's an obvious plot where good must triumph over evil  and the reluctant hero must work out what is at his centre (my seven  year old niece, Teah, worked that out the moment it was mentioned in  the film and a good hour before Jack Frost managed to, which says a  great deal about the laziness of the scripting) in order to release the  full power he holds.  There are some charming moments but largely they are due to the  animation rather than the action. In a lovely touch, Sandman is mute  and communicates with sandy icons that appear above his head and though  physically he is a bland, child-friendly interpretation, the animation  of his sandy strings that crisscross around the world carrying dreams  to children are beautifully crafted. Likewise, Tooth (Isla Fisher)  brings colour and warm beauty to the screen that contrasts fabulously  with the nightmarish images that swirl around Pitch.  But, important though the animation is, it doesn't count for much if  the story isn't there. It is all fairly predictable with a resolution  that cheats (without wishing to spoil the plot, a significant  character's situation is reversed without explanation) and is lazy (the  children are the keyÂ…) and renders much of what went before as  pointless.  There were fears that Avengers Assemble would throw too many characters  together with insufficient time or material for many of them to have an  impact. Somehow Avengers Assemble managed to juggle them pretty  smoothly but I'm not sure Rise of the Guardians fares as well. Each  character has his/her own plot thread and moment in the limelight but  do they really bring anything significant to the film?  There is some fine vocal work from Alec Baldwin (North) and Jude Law  has fun with his Rufus Sewell impression as Pitch but Hugh Jackman  brings nothing substantial to the party as Bunny and at what point did  it become okay to swear in a film watched by very young children? Yes,  it may be only a couple of barks of 'bloody' but in a children's  animated film? Really? It's not offensive or shocking but it is  unnecessary.  More problematic for the audience was that Rise of the Guardians just  isn't terribly good. I'll give the final word to Teah, though I'm  overruling her.   'I'll give it seven. I liked it but it wasn't the best.'",5,14,33,31 December 2012
About Time," Some magical moments undone by an endless trudge that doesn't know when to stop.
","I approached About Time with very low expectations. It hasn't arrived with the same fanfare or same star power as many of writer/director Richard Curtis other blockbusters (Notting Hill and Love Actually for example) and the trailer implied something slightly twee rather than truly uplifting. But sometime during the first fifteen minutes I berated myself severely and settled in to what started out as a very sweet, tender and gently amusing film.Then it stuttered. And the stuttering continued as we edged towards highs and stumbled into elongated lows where nothing much occurred and nobody seemed quite sure of how to lift it again.On New Year's Eve, 21-year old Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) listens wide-eyed as his dad (Bill Nighy) imparts some fantastic truth about the men in the Lake family: They can travel back in time. There are rules, of course, but the fact remains Tim's world has opened up in a most remarkable way. Much to his father's dismay, Tim decides the best use of his newfound ability is to finally secure a girlfriend. In a longwinded and occasionally funny manner he courts Mary (Rachel McAdams). Mary is insecure and likes to sleep a lot. And other stuff happens, too. Eventually. And some of it even comes about as a result of time travel. Maybe.The obvious and immediate comparison with About Time is The Time Traveller's Wife, which starred, um, Rachel McAdams. Unfortunately, though the latter was a weak adaptation of a beautiful book, About Time has the feel of what was left on the cutting room floor after they'd excised the humour and protracted subplot.Ten years ago Hugh Grant would have been cast as Tim and at times it feels as though Gleeson has been forced into Grant's shoes. It's a pity because he is a fine actor and, when allowed to be the Tim in his own head, does a wonderfully charming and understated job. The screenplay sucks but that's hardly his fault. There's also about the same level of chemistry between Tim & Mary as there was between the tomato and chard on my dinner plate last night.But when Gleeson and Nighy share the screen About Time sparkles. The relationship between father and son is beautiful, it is tender, it is funny and it is the glue that binds the film. I came away not wishing I had the boy/girl relationship but dreaming that the father/son bond was mine. What a pity Curtis didn't have the courage to turn this romcom on its head and make Tim and Mary secondary to Tim & Dad.There are moments of pure joy where Curtis is on his very best form: The wedding scene is the finest we've seen screen since James Fleet's best man speech in Four Weddings & a Funeral. It doesn't hang around, it is neither schmaltzy nor patronizing but is magically sweet and funny. The theatre sequence, too, is comedy gold. In a completely different way, the last few scenes with Tim and Dad are tender, sensitive and deeply affecting.And then Curtis undoes the stitching. Take the dress scene; we've seen it in countless films before where girl tries on dresses but can't make her mind up while boy fails to help the issue. It's no longer original and, in this incarnation, is at least five dresses too long. It's so protracted it hurts. It's a problem that persists throughout About Time. It just doesn't know when to stop. Frequently, it even forgets what it is about and suddenly throws in a time traveling scene to justify its name. Inside this lumpy, tedious 117 minute trudge is an 85 minute gem desperately fighting to escape. Was script editor Emma Freud asleep when she held her red pen? Was editor Mark Day afraid of offending Curtis? Black marks to them both.The supporting cast is a real boon to About Time. Lyndsay Duncan's Mum is just the right side of eccentric while Uncle D (Richard Cordery) is as mad as a box of frogs and delightfully so. Chief amongst them is Harry (Tom Hollander), the self-centered, embittered playwright who takes any glimmer of joy, crumbles it, insults it and stamps on it for good measure. He is used sparingly to crisp the edges of scenes that edge towards tedium. What a pity he wasn't let loose with a flamethrower throughout.But even with the minor characters and their subplots, Curtis struggles as if he has a checklist of occurrences he absolutely must insert to appeal to everyone and so he throws in a broken sister with alcohol and domestic issues, parental issues with overbearing visiting folksÂ… About Time is too much, too long, too over-egged, and too reliant on previous films. Watching About Time is like swimming through porridge to the occasional pockets of beautifully sweet honey and then struggling onwards in vain the hope of another.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,54,109,21 August 2013
Don Jon," 'Filth' for those who read join-the-dots books. Porn without pleasure.
","Don Jon is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as writer/director/star, and it's a bold endeavour. Technically speaking, it's a success; his vision is clear, the editing works, the style is engaging and there's something of a story in there. The trouble is, Don Jon is billed as a comedy/drama/romance but, whilst there is certainly plenty of drama across the 90 minutes, there was little in the way of laughter generated in the screening I attended and the romance is scant enough to be overlooked, particularly as boredom sets in long before anything genuinely romantic occurs.There's sex, there's porn and there's plenty of aggression in Don Jon, because Gordon-Levitt's film is about Jon (Gordon-Levitt) who, after his family, his home, his car, his church, his boys and his girls, cares about pornography more than anything.Scratch that, Jon is obsessed with porn. He needs it like Lindsay Lohan needs coke (allegedly). The way Jon sees it, no matter how good the sex with a real, fleshy girl, it's not as good as losing himself in his porn. Every day. Multiple times every day. And then, across a nightclub floor, Jon spies Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), the most beautiful 'thing' he's ever seen, and it's love at first sight.Except it isn't love. It's the possession of one unpleasant person by another unpleasant person; though who owns whom is open to question.It's difficult to like Don Jon as a film because there is precious little to like within the film. The characters are largely unlikeable caricatures, chief amongst them both Jon and Barbara. They prompt mild amusement in a don't-let-them-anywhere-near-me kind of way but, when you get down to it, they're just not nice. They are hypocritical, grotesque, aggressive creatures that we gawp at rather than identify with. Put it this way, if you can identify with them, it's time to take a long hard look in the mirror.Don't misunderstand; both Gordon-Levitt and Johansson play their parts well. They are as entirely believable as they are disagreeable and one has to resist the urge to reach into the screen to be equally unpleasant to them. I just want more from a film than good performances.There is humour in Don Jon, though it is mild and subtle to the point of translucence. Brie Larson as Jon's sister, Monica, is amusing as the largely mute sibling who is permanently attached to her cell phone, and her moment in the spotlight, though spotted a mile off, allows one's facial muscles to move at last.Julianne Moore is on good form here as slightly damaged, partly cuckoo Esther, a fellow student in Jon's night class who might modify his behavior. Tony Danza also mildly entertains as Jon Senior, the father who berates his carbon copy son, while Glenne Headly merely annoys as the hysterical, wailing, nagging mother, Angela.Gordon-Levitt has understandably placed himself firmly at the centre of Don Jon and presumably enjoyed the process of creating for himself a persona that thinks with his cock, revolves his life around his cock and behaves constantly like an almighty cock. Top marks for playing it well, but perhaps next time give us something to actually enjoy. It doesn't have to be 'nice'; god knows, I wouldn't want to meet Hannibal Lecter, but both Brian Cox (as Lecktor) and Anthony Hopkins gave us a monster we could enjoy.And, mild spoiler alert, when 'redemption' does arrive, it just isn't believable. Really? That sex-driven, angry, fountain of testosterone would change so comprehensively and fall in love withÂ…? What? I'm not buying it.There's a fun touch to the editing, cutting between the mania of Jon's porn addiction existence, his religious hypocrisy and his personal life beyond porn sites, and the repetition creates an enjoyable predictability in a Reggie Perrin way, though without the anticipation or humour.Don Jon is an adult film that presumably wants to shock and offend Daily Mail readers wherever they may be barricaded, but it falls short of the skill, panache and artistry of last month's Filth. It's like comparing a pimped-up Ferrari with a graffiti-splattered ghetto wreck.And, on a final annoyance, the foley artist needs to spend more time on research. Tissue does not make that sound when it lands in a metal bin. Trust me, I've tried eight times today and I'm working up to my ninth!For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",4,7,15,6 November 2013
Begin Again," Pleasant but insubstantial.
","I was late to the party on this one. Begin Again had a 'blink and you'll miss it' release and I did. It's not hard to see why: though it is warmly entertaining, it is, ultimately, flimsy and unmemorable.Written and directed by John Carney, whose biggest hit to date remains 2006's Once, Begin Again shares a similar theme: a couple making music and discovering themselves.Gretta (Keira Knightley) accompanies her musician boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) to New York when he signs a deal with a major record deal. But while the world glows for him, Gretta soon finds herself the first casualty of his new-found fame and wandering Manhattan alone, but for the company of old friend and busker, Steve (James Cordon). By chance, she is thrown together with disgraced record label executive Dan (Mark Ruffalo) and, astounded by her raw talent, he signs her up for a quirky musical collaboration around New York City.And therein lies my biggest issue with Begin Again: Dan is astounded by Gretta's talent, I wasn't. Yes, it is pleasant, her singing is easy on the ear and her lyrics are several ranks higher than the Cheeky Girls, but she's no Leonard Cohen.Like Gretta's musical output, Begin Again is twee, easy and simple, it is moving wallpaper that doesn't cause any offence. We've seen it before, we've enjoyed it more and last time around, in Once, Carney didn't dilute it. It strikes me that Carney has poured this one out to satisfy the teeny audiences who were told they should have loved Once but just didn't get it.Knightly is fine, Ruffalo is as good as ever, Cordon is slightly less over the top than usual. The plot is simple, the father/daughter subplot is obvious, everything is laid out very carefully for the audiences that need life explained fully for them to understand. Begin Again is all just a little bit plinky plonk, it is obvious and idealistic and, particularly in the instance of the family dancing sequence, plain embarrassing.I love the idea of a group of musicians recording an album in the open around New York but there has to be a far better way of presenting it to the world.Pleasant but insubstantial. Begin Again? Please don't.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,14,23,24 November 2014
The Book Thief," Somebody stole its heart.
","When I finished reading Markus Zusak's novel, The Book Thief, for the first time, I couldn't speak for almost twenty minutes afterwards. I remained stunned, consumed by my thoughts, absorbed in Liesel's world and bereft as both the final chapter and an episode of my life ended.Departing Brian Percival's film adaptation I just felt hollow.The Book Thief is a remarkable story of Liesel Meminger (Sophie NÃ©lisse), a young girl in pre-war Germany, whose communist mother sends her and her brother to live with foster parents. When her brother dies on the train and is hastily buried beside the railway track, the illiterate Liesel steals her first book as it falls from the gravedigger's coat. In this small act of deviance, Liesel finds her greatest resource for survival as World War II unfolds around her in a strange town. Pivotal in her life are her new parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson), her newfound friend, Rudy (Nico Liersch), and Max (Ben Schnetzer), the Jew hiding under the stairs. And overseeing it all is Death.Let's deal with him first of all. Certainly when one reads a fine novel images of characters are conjured that remain unique to the reader's imagination. However, no matter how fine an actor he may be, Death emphatically does not sound like Roger Allam. His narration is casual, almost suave, smug even, when the character of Death is written as an entity that is surprised and awed by Liesel and her effect on her little world and on himself. It is the first aspect of The Book Thief that jars, but it certainly isn't the last.When Liesel arrives at the Hubermann's home, almost the first words out of Rosa's mouth are disgust-filled accusations that Liesel stinks and is flea-ridden. What a pity Percival and his costume and makeup departments didn't read the script prior to shooting the scene; Liesel is dressed impeccably, with tidy hair, not a speck of dirt upon her and giving every impression of being positively fragrant. With the exception of a solitary scene in the final act when Liesel and the townsfolk scrabble amongst rubble, every character is dressed in what appears to be new clothing. It is the correct period, certainly, but at a time of depression and austerity not a single threadbare coat, nor a loose string of wool, nor a tear, patch, smudge or stain is visible. Really? As for Max, when he stumbles through the Hubermann's door, we are supposed to believe he is on his last legs. I don't look that healthy on a regular Monday morning! And when the comment is made that he is developing bedsores (because he is permanently prone), in the very next scene we watch him walk downstairs to the basement unaided! Sometimes the little things mean a lot and there are just too many little things in The Book Thief to overlook.With the first impressions of a film being negative, it is a long hard trudge uphill to win the viewer over again. Alas, The Book Thief is not up to the task. The language issue is clumsily managed with German accents and periodic words and lines delivered in German instead of perhaps starting the film in German with subtitles to set the scene and the seamlessly segueing into English. It worked for ValkyrieÂ… Mostly the acting is fine. The sets are well constructed, the props and Nazi regalia are accurate, the cinematography is adequate, the script flows reasonably smoothlyÂ… But something substantial is missing from The Book Thief. It is empty, incomplete, like a wall built without mortar. The Book Thief is a body without a heart.Occasionally a film gives a fair reflection of the source novel, The Shawshank Redemption perhaps chief amongst them. The Book Thief is not one of those films. Perhaps if I hadn't seen read the novel, this would be a six star film. However, it warrants no more than three stars for all that it could have been and should have been but absolutely isn't.For lovers of Zusak's novel, only disappointment can follow. Don't do it. Keep your memories in tact.And if you haven't read The Book Thief? Go. Do it. NOW! For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",3,35,59,12 February 2014
Life of Pi," Visually beautiful, strikingly brilliant but damaged by 3D gimmickry.
","My recollection of Yann Martell's source novel is hazy but, yes, I know the outcome and, no, I'm not about to spill the beans. However, I invited a friend who hasn't read Life of Pi to join me for the screening and he declined saying 'I watched the trailer and it clearly has no basis in realityÂ…' and promptly made a statement, based on his assumptions, which, if I repeated it here, would cause bellowed accusations of plot spoilers.His other main point was that the trailer rekindled bad memories of What Dreams May Come, a film with a fantastic car crash that then became, well, a car crash. And so it was with trepidation I approached Ang Lee's epic, hoping for the quality of The Ice Storm and dreading another Hulk.In actuality, the film in Lee's canon it most closely resembles is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for its visual splendor. Even when not relying on visual effects, Lee paints his images across the screen with confidence and striking brilliance. The colours excite, the movements draw the viewer in and we are invited to admire a sumptuous ballet of shapes and hues that are sometimes stars, sometimes jelly fish and always beautiful. At one point, the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) explains to the writer (Rafe Spall) that the water in the pool was unbelievably clear, and so it is with Lee's shots and effects; on numerous occasions one isn't quite sure if the lifeboat is floating on a clear sea or in the sky, and it highlights the hugeness of Pi's world, life and God while accentuating what a small but significant part he plays in it.As with Avatar, the principal attraction of Life of Pi, for those who have seen the trailer but not read the book, may well be the spectacle upon the screen and the apparent strangeness of his imagery. Those viewers will not be disappointed and that is where Lee excels. The beauty of the story belongs to Yann Martell and Lee nurtures it, almost babysits it, rather than adapts it. His opening scenes that introduce us to Pi Patel, his family and the zoo they run in India are fun, lively and provide a fascinating game of Which animal is that? But there is a sense that Lee is enjoying himself too much with these moments rather than favouring pace in order to satisfy the studio's demands for 3D 'moments'. For the most part, the 3D format (alas, there was not a 2D option last night) learns from Avatar's example and presents us with a far greater depth of field and a richer experience, but too often Lee slips into gimmickry with lizards running at us and poles lurching into our faces. It isn't funny and serves only to distract.For those who loved the book, Life of Pi is a faithful adaptation (from what I can recall); it is always a challenge for a director to recreate on screen the images we have firmly on our minds, but at least the story remains in tact. For those entering this film without the literary experience, very simply this is a story of a young man whose parents decide to sell their zoo and emigrate to give him and his brother a better life. En route they are shipwrecked and Pi (Suraj Sharma) finds himself adrift in the vast ocean in a lifeboat in the company of a tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan.But far, far more than being a simple film about man and beast hoping for a miraculous rescue, Life of Pi is about a lad's search for depth, meaning and a divine influence on his life free from the prejudices and constraints that govern others. At one point he prays, 'Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.' My principal complaint is not with the film but the presentation, which so badly affected it. Yet another huge black mark for Cineworld Bristol. Whilst the staff is generally top banana, the ineptitude of their projectionist reflects very, very badly on the cinema. Exactly how difficult is it to ensure the film is projected in the correct aspect ratio so as not to scalp characters and entirely lose the subtitles; that the screen's masking panels are set so as not to further reduce the image size; to ensure the speakers along the right hand side of screen seven, as mentioned in at least three previous reviews, are working correctly; and that we don't endure repeated blackouts over the first twenty minutes as s/he attempts and fails repeatedly to rectify the issues? Cinemas have little control and no interest in preventing customers from talking and using mobile phones throughout performances and so it is left to us, the paying customers, to intervene (and, yes, I did!) but they emphatically are responsible for the presentation of both video and audio of the film we have paid to see! Consider yourselves chastised (again!), Cineworld! But, not even an inept projectionist can alter the impact of a fine film. You may not understand every reference or see reason behind every beautiful, fantastical image in Life of Pi but that matters not a jot. I'll give the final word to the beguiling hero, Pi: 'If it happened, it happened. Why does it have to mean anything?'

Interstellar," Chris Nolan astounds again. Sci-fi epic or spiritual experience, it's a mind-blowingly fine trip!
","Much has been written and spoken of the plot holes in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic, Interstellar. That's Nolan's science FICTION epic, Interstellar. If you want science fact, head over to The Sky at Night or listen to Professor Brian Cox. Nolan is in the entertainment business.That said, Interstellar is sufficiently plausible (note, I did not write 'realistic') to hold the attention and to prompt deep consideration of space travel and humanity's future. Heck, this is almost a spiritual experience touching on mortality beyond the physical realm.With Earth virtually devastated through drought and famine that have caused dramatic climate change and a dearth of food, humankind is on the verge of extinction. A rip in the space-time continuum is discovered and a substantially downsized NASA, led by visionary Professor Brand (Nolan stalwart Michael Caine), plans to send a select team into deep space, through a black hole and into the great unknown with the hope of saving our species. Mysterious circumstances contrive to place Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) on NASA's doorstep and he is forced to choose between watching his children grow up and saving the world.Interstellar owes much to the legacy of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Contact in its depth, silence and cerebral possibilities. It is a work of entertainment with occasional thrills, a few questions, much thought and some beautiful effects that will either meld or clash with your imagination. Having never found myself hurtling through a wormhole into an unchartered time, place or dimension, I have no idea what it should look like, but Nolan's vision of such a journey and the destination is colourful and ambiguous enough to prompt contemplation and debate.There are times when Interstellar strolls along, gazing at the scenery and wondering at the possibilities of space and time exploration and those sequences allow for our own reflection upon Nolan's suggestion. Like Contact before it, there is emotional tension and a spiritual journey that accompanies the physical jaunt. This is more than a film about outer space; it is a film about love and with that comes betrayal. Just as space has layers and depths we cannot comprehend (how do we truly grasp the magnitude of infinity?), love and betrayal have numerous facets and strata as Nolan depicts. Unlike Contact, Nolan endeavours to wrap his film completely in explanation and tie it with a bow for us to admire, when perhaps the ambiguity and lack of absolute definition would have been the greatest finale.Interstellar isn't the film the original trailer led me to expect. It first implied Nolan's spin on Armageddon but this isn't a gung-ho America saves the world nonsense. It may not have the emotional attachment or the startling visual effects of last year's phenomenal Gravity, but the central performances from McConaughey, Anne Hathaway (as fellow crew member, Brand) and, particularly, Jessica Chastain (as the abandoned daughter, Murph) make this an experience that resounds with us all. What would it take for you to abandon those you love? Could you see the bigger picture? Hans Zimmerman's score is beautifully redolent of Michael Nyman's best work, and it adds not just depth but character to the mystery of what lies beyond all that we understand and can define. It doesn't, however, explain how an intelligent man like Cooper can be so wrong in his explanation of Murphy's Law and we are left to wonder whether he is confused or just lying to his daughter, adding another layer to the betrayal.I'm not convinced that Interstellar is going to astound sufficiently to prompt multiple viewings in the way Gravity did, but it is yet another resounding success in Nolan's canon that can be tucked away and watched periodically in the future. That lad Michael Caine is turning out to be a pretty good muse for Christopher Nolan. Watch him, he could go far.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,0,5,21 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Cross Transformers with Godzilla, dilute, torpedo and, voilÃ , Pacific Rim!
","My first reaction after viewing the trailer for Pacific Rim was: What the hell is Guillermo del Toro, the master behind Pan's Labyrinth, doing? My hope upon emerging from the screening is that he is laughing at us while counting his huge pile of money. The alternative, that he is actually proud of this mess, is a little depressing.No, Pacific Rim doesn't plummet the depths of the torpedoed hulks of Battleship but it doesn't belong on the CV of such a director. Take Transformers, (yes, that Michael Bay, um, epic) cross it with Godzilla (the Roland Emmerich offering â€“ please, god, let Gareth Edwards make it all better with his Godzilla next year), take it down a notch and you'll find Pacific Rim close by.Sometime in the future, Earth has been attacked, not from space as we all expected, but from the depths. A fissure has opened and great big nasty creatures, known as kaiju, are emerging at regular intervals, trashing cities, killing humans and generally being a bit of a nuisance. Rather than call in the best munitions experts to develop weaponry that will penetrate the kaiju and then explode, somebody somewhere decided it would be better to spend countless billions on building huge transformers, sorry, jaegers, that can engage in hand-to-hand (with some gadgetry) combat, trash cities, kill humans and generally be a nuisance. That's where the sense of Pacific Rim goes AWOL.When the jaegers fail, washed-up pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) returns to the military fold to help save the day under the guidance of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and watched by trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kiluchi).Like Battleship, the acting warrants no comment other than to say it's adequate and suits the film. Make of that what you will.If you do pay your hard earned cash to watch Pacific Rim, try to block out the dialogue. There is little hope for a movie when the men tapping out the screenplay (Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro) lumber Elba with inspirational speeches that appear to be Braveheart castoffs. Did they really think they could get away with such gems as: 'One: don't you ever touch me again. Two: don't you ever touch me again.' and'Today we face the monsters that are at our door, today we are cancelling the apocalypse!' Oh boy. Elba may have boosted his profile with Pacific Rim, but his credibility remains with The Wire and Luther. Fortunately, penciled on his CV are some potentially very impressive films with Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom and The Gunman standing out.Pacific Rim is visually so cluttered it's difficult to see what is going on much of the time, although perhaps that's a blessing or even a ploy to maximize enjoyment. The ridiculous volume, though not ear-bleedingly horrendous like Dredd, is just painful.******** PLOT SPOILER ALERT ******** The greatest achievement of Pacific Rim is its attempt to pack in as many movie clichÃ©s as possible into 131 minutes: Parent/sibling angst is taken care of; injured party who saves the day is present and correct; comedy duo to lighten the mood? Yup. Just not very funny; 'are they/aren't they dead' scenario? Check; selfless act to save the world blah blahÂ… Oh, and why do they have centres for jaeger creation/launch all around the world instead of just one mother of all missile launch pads next to the fissure from which the monsters emerge? My head hurts.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",3,8,18,23 July 2013
American Sniper," Pro-Americanism plunders a passable film. Distasteful.
","Alas, I think that sad day has finally arrived. I think it may be time to wheel Clint Eastwood off to the home for the aged and once-great Hollywood royalty. His (intermittent) acting ability finally gave up the ghost with Trouble With the Curve and now, with American Sniper, his directorial prowess has gone south, too. The king is dead, long live the king.I suffered his latest offering and death knell with my viewing companion, Bag. He approached it with enthusiasm having loved Chris Kyle's autobiography of the same name; I approached it with trepidation having given up half a chapter in after suffering an emotional allergic reaction to the jingoistic, gung-ho, Team America (you know, 'America! F*** Yeah!') attitude.We both hated the film.American Sniper is the story of America's 'greatest' sniper, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), a Navy SEAL who put bullets through the heads and bodies of over 160 men, women and children; a man we are supposed to celebrate as a bona fide hero; a man that we are supposed to believe is a good man worthy of our eternal adoration because, according to Eastwood, he opted not to kill one particular child and carried a (stolen) bible (that he didn't read). How odd, then, that a point is made about a Moslem sniper carrying a Quran as well as a rifle and therefore being evil.The film as a whole is a painful experience. Eastwood veers away from anything that could possibly be construed as 'un-American', painting Kyle and his companions only as hard working, loyal heroes to whom we owe our hearts and minds. No thought is given to it being an illegal war, that what occurred accounted to little more than an invasion, that the majority of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed in the war were peace-loving civilians and not terrorist aiming to destroy America.And yet when, in the final scene, Eastwood has the opportunity to depict honestly the psychological damage war does to humans, even those apparent 'saviours' of the world, he shies away from it, preferring to cut and leave us to work it out. Why the apparent aim at subtlety now when he has hammered home his aggressive point all the way along? Heck, even in the credits there is no let up as we are bombarded with news footage of the 'hero's' funeral procession and the deafening silence so that we, too, can show our awe and respect to a man who chose to take a job with the sole aim of being paid to kill.But forget the politics. American Sniper still stinks. According to Bag, who has read the book more times than I have fingers, screenwriter Jason Hall has shown little evidence of having actually read it fully himself, such are the liberties he has taken with the content, characters and 'facts'. I thought it was just me, but as we emerged into peaceful daylight, my companion muttered 'I know that book inside out and I still couldn't follow which character was which.' Eastwood's hearing is presumably shot, too, as for much of the time it was impossible to discern what many of the actors, Cooper particularly, were saying. Maybe he gave a solid performance, perhaps the Kyle family will be over the moon with his portrayal of the sniper, but it doesn't count for much when most of the audience (in our screening room anyway) are leaning to their neighbours and asking 'What did he say?' I suppose their comments added variety to exasperated sighs, raised eyebrows and longing stares at the ceiling.Sienna Miller makes a valiant attempt to bring something of quality to American Sniper as Kyle's wife, Taya, but she is lost in this noisy, bulldozing mess. What happened to the Clint Eastwood who delicately crafted the sharp brutality and the violent nuances of Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima and Bird? There is little evidence of his skill here.It was a long drive home as Bag fumed. Judging from the sounds many other cinema-goers, they, too, were relieved to see the back of American Sniper.For my part, to end on a positive note, it didn't make me quite as angry as 2012's Act of Valor but I still needed something frivolous with which to clean my mind out.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",3,115,244,6 January 2015
21 Jump Street," Cops, action, humour & a hint of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. What's not to like?
","I never watched the 80s TV series starring Johnny Depp. I was too busy being severely narked about it. In '85 I had the idea for a great TV show about a kid at school who was really a cop. My friends laughed and said it was stupid, unrealistic and, besides, who'd listen to an idea from a skinny little kid in the backwaters of somewhere distinctly not Hollywood? Then, a couple of years later, two blokes in Hollywood created 21 Jump Street.Not one to hold a grudge, I caught a repeat screening of the updated, upgraded, upsized movie version of 21 Jump Street, staring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, with limited expectations other than some disposable fun and a rather large serving of cheese. It was worth the effort.Directed by the double act of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, whose last offering was Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and written by Scott Pilgrim vs the World scribe, Michael Bacall, 21 Jump Street delivers with a cheek full of tongue and embraces its source rather than attempting to obliterate the memory of it, as so many big screen adaptations do.Indeed, they make pretty damn sure we know exactly what's going on with an early line from Ice Cube's Captain Dickson as he unloads the fate of our heroes: 'You see, the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas. So all they do is recycle sh*t from the past and expect us all not to notice.' And when the hapless duo enquires where they should report, Dickson barks '37 Jump Street. No, that doesn't sound rightÂ…' Superb! But don't think for a minute that implies 21 Jump Street isn't fresh, inventive and thoroughly enjoyable. Sit back, go with it and allow a couple of hours to pass with plenty of smiles and a sufficient quantity of eye candy.The principals play variations of their usual, recognizable characters and there'll be no plaudits for acting prowess but that's not why you come to 21 Jump Street, is it? If you visit this film, and it's well worth it if you have a spare Friday evening with a pizza and a beer, you're coming for easy fun that won't stretch the brain or give you nightmares.It's a simple 'buddy flick' about two failing cops who are given an opportunity to redeem themselves and answer the age-old question: What would I do if I could go back but know everything I know now? So, if you like cops, action, humour, s*x, drugs and rock 'n' roll (well, a hint of it) give it a shot. What's the worst that could happen?

American Hustle," Thrilling ensemble piece of corruption and conmen. Fantastic to the last!
","American Hustle opens with the text: Some of this actually happened. Oh, that it were truly the case.Well, actually it is. Sort of.David O. Russell reunites the stars (Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence) of his starkly different but equally superb Silver Linings Playbook in a fantastic yarn, about a brazen conman, that bubbles along from the off and jostles the viewer along with its boundless energy and audacity. American Hustle lifts elements of a certain reality and weaves it into a fiction that is an absolute romp.Conman Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) is a smalltime wide boy who falls completely for the seductive, sharp-thinking Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and forms a partnership for more not-so-petty scamming. Entrapped by FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Cooper), who has promotion in mind and far bigger fish he wishes to fry, Irving and Sydney are forced into organizing the mother of all cons that Richie hopes will bring down Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), the big cheeses in the Mafia and a host of politicians. It is a convoluted and dangerous plan fighting corruption with corruption and with money, power and lives at risk. And hiding in the wings is Rosalyn (Lawrence), Irving's highly-strung, volatile wife.There is so much energy coursing through American Hustle with writers, director and cast on terrific form. This is such a cleverly crafted and beautifully written film with an accomplished director, who can evidently juggle multitudinous strands and ideas, in the chair, and a starry cast that would struggle not to make the best of it. They do, and it keeps the audience riveted until the fat lady sings.Bale, with a comb over that is so awful you have to love it, struts his portly stuff with arrogant panache. Frequently he displays signs of Robert De Niro (in his heyday, not the De Niro of The Family) but Bale is in a class of his own when it comes to method, intensity and versatility and though his Irving is no Adonis, like Sydney, we can't help but fall for him completely.There are many films were the star power works on paper (Larry Crowne, any one?) but on film it is very obvious that someone forgot to invite the chemistry along to the party. Not so here. There is a fantastic crackle of electricity between the principal quintet and, though Bale is clearly in command of our attention here, it is in the company of his peers that he plays hardest. The relationship that develops between Irving and Carmine adds a gentleness to the boisterous mayhem that bubbles away behind the scheming.Apart, both Lawrence and Adams are exciting in their performances as the ladies in Irving's life but, though this is the seventies, neither woman is a doormat and both hold the men around them by the short and curlies, one with guile, the other with desperation. And when they finally share a room, oh boy, hell freezing over could never be that glacial! Cooper, though not in the same league as Bale, adds another superb blend of bumbler and Jack the lad to his CV. Always watchable, inevitably entertaining, he is the equal of his co-stars in this wonderful ensemble piece that will remain vivid in the memory even when we are preparing to bid this year farewell.American Hustle thoroughly delights, entertains and will surely end the year laden with gold honestly gained. Throughout, it is thrilling, funny, dramatic and intense. As the narrative unravels so do the plans of the protagonists, while their lives become ever more complicated by predicaments that could only exist in the mind of the most creative of writers.Couldn't they?

Rush," A dazzling story of F1, rivalry, respect & cheating death.
","Those who have seen the trailer will know that Rush is the 'Formula 1 film'. The presence of Ron Howard's and Chris Hemsworth's names above the title may put some bums on seats but the fact of it being a film about motor racing will undoubtedly ostracize some potential viewers.So stop right there. Rush is not a movie about motor racing for speed fans any more than Titanic was about sailing for merchant seamen. Rush is a superbly shot, directed, edited and performed film that transcends the sport of motor racing, just as the principal protagonists themselves did almost forty years ago.The rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel BrÃ¼hl) is common knowledge. Just a couple of minutes trawling through Google's gifts will tell you how many championships each driver won, how they met, how they sparred, how they lived and (nearly) diedÂ… Rush isn't a film that tells you their story. Rush is the film that takes you into their world and shows you how that story unfolded in all its fast, crazy, riotous, dazzling, cynical, brash excess. By the end you may still not want to be an F1 driver or even watch a grand prix, but you sure as hell will wish you could have been there for at least some of the 70s.Howard has provided us with a mixed bag of films over the years with schmaltzy, flicks (A Beautiful Mind), thoughtful biopics (Frost/Nixon), compelling dramas (Apollo 13) and utter twaddle (Angels and Demons). So which category would Rush fall into? The tension Howard creates is ridiculous. Pistons pump, colours blur, the scream of engines deafen us. The editing is so tight it feels as though something will snap. The anticipation prickles the skin and, though we already know what and when, it is almost too much for us to watch it unfold. Technically, Rush verges on exquisite. The digital creation blends flawlessly with the live action and the skids, tumbles, crashes and explosions are horrifying.But it isn't just with the speed and madness around the track where Howard guides perfectly. The hospital scenes when Lauda is treated are almost grotesque. We find ourselves shying away from the visuals, involuntarily grimacing at Lauda's agony even when he demands more pain in order to drive him towards recovery and revenge.Rush boasts one of the finest film scores of the year so far with Hans Zimmer proving why he is among the busiest composers in Hollywood. It's not that the score that makes the film, but it enhances it beautifully, adding emotional colour to the startling visuals to magnify the tension.The joint leads are on impeccable form. Hemsworth portrays Hunt as the playboy we wish we could be (or bed) and his charisma doesn't ooze, it gushes. He is arrogant, cocksure, charming and handsome. He makes it obvious why men wanted Hunt's life and so many women welcomed him into theirs. It is a confident, full performance from Hemsworth that marks him out yet again as an actor with a certain chameleon-like quality and undeniable star power. Immediately we like Hunt but as 123 minutes rush by, he evolves into a flawed man we admire but ultimately decide we don't really want to be and, in some ways, pity. It's a fine performance that engages us on every level.When BrÃ¼hl's (The Edukators, Inglorious Basterds) Lauda strides onto the screen, it is with purpose, his Austrian directness and confidence taken as conceit and arrogance. He does not suffer fools (or almost anyone else) whether they are subordinates, rivals or the men paying for his drive. Supremely confident to the exclusion of social niceties, the Lauda we observe puts our backs up immediately but, just as the Hunt on screen evolves, so, too, does Lauda and by the film's end our allegiance has wavered. It is a sensitive performance from BrÃ¼hl and his understanding of the man he portrays and clear admiration for him infects us thoroughly.Some of the dialogue is lumpy, there are numerous liberties taken with the truth (though not to the extent that U571 completely rewrote history!) and much is glossed over. Howard has perhaps tried too hard to appeal to a mass audience by focusing on the principal women in the drivers' lives, notably Hunt's wife, Suzy (Olivia Wilde) and BrÃ¼hl's, Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). In Marlene's case, she is relatively impactful on her husband's life, suffering through his accident with him. In Suzy's case, however, though she was influential on a period of Hunt's career, it is difficult to see her as anything other than a bystander in his life and yet Howard sees fit to return to her though she is far from his thoughts.These are minor quibbles that make Rush a very good film instead of a 'great'. Nevertheless, my companion for the film who has no interest in motor racing and less knowledge gave a simple summary: 'Excellent.' Me? I'm a fair weather F1 fan. If there is a realistic hope of Button, Hamilton and Di Resta winning or there's been enough hype, I'm there. Otherwise it's Formula what? But, as I wrote, Rush transcends the sport. I was gripped throughout, I gritted my teeth, I gasped, clenched my buttocks and willed the drivers to the finish, on the track, in the hospital and in life.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,33,42,5 September 2013
Nightcrawler," Dark thriller of paparazzi, murder & ethics that excites instead of horrifies.
","Nightcrawler is a disturbing thriller that entertains as much as it unnerves, and I'm not sure that's necessarily a good thing.The directorial debut of screenwriter Dan Gillroy (The Bourne Legacy), Nightcrawler does for paparazzi what One Hour Photo did for shop assistants and, indeed, Jake Gyllenhaal is on similar, sinister territory to Robin William's award-winning turn.Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is an unemployed petty criminal searching for work and a quick income. As driven as he is desperate, he chances upon an emergency situation and observes the underbelly of journalism at work: The nightcrawlers, an unsavoury breed of TV news camera operators who monitor the police radio channels and scour the streets to capture lucrative, graphic 'real life' footage of accidents, murder and mayhem for the early morning news. The greater the tragedy and the more gratuitous the footage, the bigger the cheque.A self-professed quick learner, Bloom buys a cheap camera and shoots his first footage. An astounded news veteran, Nina (Rene Russo), snaps up the footage, gives him a quick lesson in shooting for the news and sends him on his way, unaware how ambitious Bloom is, or that he just might be a psychopath.Nightcrawler is a film of blurred lines. Is Bloom obsessed or unhinged? Does the news provide a service or macabre entertainment? When a cameraman shoots bedlam, is he a courageous professional opening a door onto another world for us, or just a voyeur twitching back the curtain for us to gawp? And are we any less guilty for watching? Gillroy has also ensured the relationship are as blurred as the themes, creating an ambiguity around that of Bloom and Nina. The scales of control waver and quite how much one party is coerced or a willing participant becomes hazy as Nightcrawler progresses, and it is all the better for it.The dynamic between Gyllenhall and Russo is exciting to watch, with the actors sparring beautifully. There is a crackle in the air when they share the screen due in part to the actors' possession of it, more so to the balance of fragility and confidence of their characters as the see-saw of power teeters on its fulcrum. While Bloom and Nina might claim to be newshounds offering a public service, when we get down to it he is little more than a grubby paparazzo and she his pimp.For those who recall the night and the aftermath of the paparazzi hounding that resulted in Princess Diana's death, Nightcrawler highlights the apparent good intentions of the responsible press and their overtures of self-governance and accountability by pointing at their abject failure to actually change. But it doesn't go far enough.Nightcrawler gives the impression of being really edgy but it doesn't quite hit those heights. Certainly it is unpleasant at times, occasionally it is downright distasteful, but it needs more. It scratches the filmy surface when it desperately needs to penetrate and sink to the murky depths of the mire beneath.Its strengths are in the idea and the characters, both the two principals and the supporting characters: Joe Loder (Bill Paxton as a rival nightcrawler who regards Bloom as a dangerous threat) and Rick (Riz Ahmed as Bloom's put-upon assistant troubled by both scruples and fear). But while both characters add a layer of depth and understanding to the human mess that is Bloom, in Joe's case, at least, I couldn't help feeling there was more that should have made the cut.Gillroy has packed Nightcrawler with darkness, brutality and the kind of horrific shots that make it onto the worst news shows on TV, but here they make the viewer want to see more, not to squirm and look away as we should. His film, though a fine debut, doesn't shock or horrify in the way it feels as though it should, and in the end Bloom doesn't come across as a sinister man, just an unpleasant geek with dark methods.Nightcrawler is exciting in a gratuitous way and I'm not entirely convinced that was the intention or that I am any better than Bloom for having sat there and enjoyed the experience. But I can handle that. Rather more concerning is that it peters out with a whimper instead of a stinging finale.I don't care about the morals of the film, I wanted to emerge either enraged or whooping it up in celebration. Instead I departed with a sigh akin to eating a fine cake, saving the cherry until last only to discover it is a wax decoration.",6,3,11,30 October 2014
Oblivion," It's fun & it won't ruin your night. Just don't think about the plot holes
","Tom Cruise is one of the few films who can 'open' a film merely by starring, regardless of the quality. Oblivion proves the point. Cruise's latest offering is far from awful but there are plot holes big enough to fly spaceships through and it falls a long way short of his and Spielberg's futuristic masterpiece, Minority Report. Nevertheless, it'll make profit. HUGE profit! The only way to point out the many, many plot holes is to ruin the film so forget them, sit back, disengage brain and go with the flow.It's 2077, Earth has been abandoned following the invasion and destruction at the hands of the alien 'Scavs', and Jack Harper (Cruise) is one of the last remaining drone repairmen overseeing, repairing and zipping around the small 'safe segment of the planet. He and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) live in clinical quarters (with the best swimming pool you've ever seen!) high above Earth's surface; an 'effective team', as they repeatedly assure Sally (Melissa Leo), their superior in some far-off mission control.But while Victoria is unquestioning in her loyalty to Sally and the mission, Jack questions his raison d'Ãªtre and is plagued by dreams of a woman he cannot possibly know from a time long gone by. And then there's the small matter of the 'Scavs' who remain on Earth and keep shooting down the drones.Cruise coasts along in Oblivion. It's an easy role in which he flies, runs, jumps, looks great on screen (far younger than his 51 years) and flexes his face to portray sincerity, thoughtfulness AND heroism. There's nothing wrong with his performance at all. He's perfect in the role; he's Tom Cruise! He's just not given the film, script or role that requires him to really act. Oblivion, fun as it is, is no Magnolia or Born on the 4th of July.Likewise, neither Oscar winner (for The Fighter) Leo nor Olga Kurylenko, as the girl of Jack's dreams, Julia, has depth written for them. Leo is little more than a displeased face upon a screen and Kurylenko doesn't appear to know what to do with Julia. It is left to Riseborough to provide the variation and gravitas and she blends from docile subservience to cold, determination seamlessly but still allows a hint of inner concern to bleed though her eyes. Other actors might hurl turmoil at us but Riseborough is as controlled in her performance as Victoria is in her duty. Hot on the heels of Welcome to the Punch, it's a reminder of the value that she quietly adds to any project.I can't avoid mentioning Morgan Freeman because he appears in the trailer even though, given half a thought, it's a clear indication of the way the film is going. He rolls along happily, looking pretty sprightly for an apparent octogenarian, as Beech, the um, yeah, I have to stop there or it gives the game away.Stop thinking, stop asking, just watch. It looks good, it's reasonable fun and it's not going to ruin your night just as long as you don't think about the plot holes. The dirty great big gaps in reason. The huge...Okay, I can't bite my tongue any longer. If you don't want Oblivion ruined for you stop reading now. I feel the need to rant about just a few of the 'issues' that bugged me.************ PLOT SPOILER ALERT ************ I emerged from Oblivion satisfied that I'd been reasonably entertained but troubled, no, downright annoyed, by the appalling lack of thought and reasoning by director/scriptwriter Joseph Kosinski. Either he didn't notice the glaring errors, in which case who the hell gave him the budget and the directors' chair, or he didn't care, in which case who the hell gave him the budget and the directors' chair? I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on the following: How does Jack remain unaware of the other Jacks on identical platforms around the world? There must be thousands of them. And why don't any other Jacks investigate the explosion on the power station? Why bother with the whole Titan story for Jack & Victoria? Why not programme the clones to follow orders unquestionably and without the need for bribery? Furthermore, why do the aliens bother with human clones in the first place? Why not just plonk their own army down there and avoid all risks? Why is it that after 60 years of warfare and abandonment, the dust that covers 90% of Empire State Building has managed to defy gravity and avoided falling into Jack's valley? Not one speck rests on a tree, not one single dust mote rolls across the fields! Why did it take three years to bring the new Jack to Julia? What happened to him after Jack MKI pummeled him?Why didn't NASA pick up the escape pod 60 years ago when it was launched? How did the flight recorder on the escape capsule record the conversation on the main ship when they were travelling at great speed in opposite directions, putting thousands of miles between them? How was it that Sally knew Jack was lying by his heart rate but couldn't tell it was Beech and not Julia in the pod. For that matter, why the need to put her in the pod anyway? She knows she's going back, Sally knows he's bringing her back and there are two seats! Who sat in the producer's chair and thought, Ah, the audience is too stupid to notice?Maybe they were right. Box office receipts don't lie, right? Oblivion is box-office gold and Tom Cruise remains pretty high on the bankability pile.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",4,1,7,23 April 2013
Man of Steel," Little substance, mostly enjoyable and better than Snyder's Sucker Punch.
","In 2005 Christopher Nolan reinvented Batman. In 2013 Zack Snyder has a go at shaking off the Christopher Reeve years and atoning for Sucker Punch. And Watchmen.Man of Steel is a good attempt. It's reasonably fun, mostly enjoyable and kick-starts another franchise, but isn't so much Batman Begins as Superman Stagnates.You know the essentials so I won't insult you with a backstory.Man of Steel kicks off with a fight between Jor-El (Robin Hood Dad No. 1, Russell Crowe) and General Zod (Michael Shannon) as the former friends fall out spectacularly, Krypton disintegrates and tedium steps dangerously close for the audience. It's a protracted sequence that, though it matters to Kal-El/Superman's life, doesn't need to take quite so long; a theme that runs through the film.Then comes a blast of freshness from Robin Hood Dad No. 2: Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, the finder and adoptive father of Clark and the finest aspect of the film. There's a depth and tenderness to his performance that is evident in much of his work but sorely lacking in Snyder's film. Thereafter we bounce from set piece to set piece with little of consequence linking it. It's not that these set pieces are poorly staged (far from it), it's just that there's no substance beyond them.It's a great shame because Superman is perhaps the most identifiable superhero, Henry Cavill is a stroke of casting genius (in looks at least) and the principal supporting cast enhances the film nicely (and, yes, my use of such a bland word is entirely deliberate). With Marc Webb's reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, he gave Andrew Garfield half the film to develop the character of Peter Parker, which allowed us to understand and identify with him. Here, I still don't feel any empathy for Clark.Man of the moment, Michael Shannon, on strikingly good form in The Iceman, resorts to chewing the scenery and picking up a fat pay cheque in Man of Steel but he is always watchable and it's certainly not cringeworthy in a Rhys Ifans (as the lizard) kind of way.Conversely, Amy Adams plays Lois Lane not as an egotistical preener with an axe to grind but as a regular journalist seeking a story and a decent human in search of the good in the world.At 143 minutes, I felt as though I aged through every single one of them, unlike Zod et al who look unchanged after 30 years of travelling. But all is not lost. As my companion mumbled as we departed 'I think tomorrow it won't have been as bad as you think it is today.' He's right. With a few days distance Man of Steel has earned another star from me and I'm happy to give it another viewing, now that my expectations have been reduced. After the sheer joy of Nolan's five-star trilogy, the Iron Man films, and even The Avengers perhaps I'd set my hopes too high and forgotten that we are talking about Zach Snyder here...Mostly Man of Steel is more than adequate but it verges on tedious and that is the fault of the director. In the final scenes he even resorts to some minor comedy in the form of a gushing soldier who swoons after Superman and simpers to her CO, 'He's hot.' It feels as though Snyder had doubts over the tone of the film at the last minute and is only marginally less jarring than Lois' query early on: 'What if I need a tinkle?' Maybe it's Snyder's way of telling us he's taking the p...Superman deserves more than this, but at least it's better than Sucker Punch.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,3,8,19 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble with boredom! One tidy ending short of being stinker.
","I have nothing against Clint Eastwood. No, let's rephrase that slightly. In Squissland, Clint Eastwood rocks! I need only present Unforgiven as evidence and there's a huge canon of fine work to back that up.Certainly he's acted in the odd turkey (Space Cowboys, anyone?) and even directed the odd embarrassment (stand up and be counted, Firefox), but generally speaking, Eastwood has been a perfectly respectable actor, a far superior director, has a fine taste in music and, his politics and my ineligibility to vote aside, I'd put my cross against his name for US President any day of the week except if he was up against Martin Sheen. Or maybe Morgan Freeman. OrÂ… Well, you know what I mean.Trouble with the Curve, however, is not a film of which he should feel terribly proud. It's the first time he has acted in a film that he didn't also direct since 1993's In the Line of Fire (for Wolfgang Peterson) and, if nothing else, he should have learnt one important lesson from the experience: Don't do it again! For the first forty-five minutes, director Robert Lorenz clearly used the cardboard cutout of Clint from Million Dollar Baby; it snarls in the same manner, it moves the same way and it's even wearing the same T-shirt, just without depth, quality or conviction. It isn't remotely convincing and it's a huge relief when the real Mr. Eastwood finally arrives. It isn't a startling performance, in fact it's just a variation of the turns he gave in the afore mentioned boxing flick and Gran Torino, but then he is in his eighties and it must tire him out.And on that subject, Mickey (Amy Adams) is his daughter? Really??? Apparently so. Gus is a senior baseball scout who is losing his patience as quickly as his eyesight, and his contract is about to follow suit if the young(er) pretender to his throne, Phillip (Mathew Lillard) has anything to do with it. Gus' virtually estranged daughter, Mickey, is a successful lawyer who is about to make partner. They don't like each other very much. Or rather, in good Hollywood schmaltz style, they do but they like to think they don't. Gus is sent off on another trip to prove his worth, his manager and friend, Pete (John Goodman) persuades Mickey to go along and help him out. At a crucial time in her career and at a critical time for the firm, Mickey agrees. Her decision is inexplicable other than that without it, there would be no film. Everybody loses. Except for Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a newbie scout, who falls for her. Predictably.Why is it one tidy ending short of being a stinker? Deep sigh.Well, Trouble with the Curve is too long, too obvious, takes far too long to establish itself, is poorly acted for the first act and is convoluted and depressingly trite.And if that isn't enough, Mickey enters her father's house in the middle of the mother of all rain storms, and even comments on it, but has nary a hair stuck to her face nor a drop of precipitation on her skin or clothes.And they dance in front of an admiring, encouraging busker.And an entire crowd in a bar whoops and applauds a retort from Johnny in true, cheesy Roxanne style, despite them having clearly ignored the entire conversation prior to his comment.And then there's the horrible sequence that jars completely and makes no sense until one reads the credits. To wit: Mother, son and daughter arrive in a bar in the background. Camera cuts to close up of them.Daughter: 'I wish Dad was here.' Mother: 'I know, Honey.' It adds nothing to the film, is irrelevant to the action in the foreground and serves only to give a blatant cameo to the wife and children of director Lorenz! On the upside, it appears screenwriter Randy Brown provided a checklist of emotions to work through and we know the characters will be recognizable because they've been photocopied from countless other poor films.You've been warned but don't let me stop you. Go ahead, make my day.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",3,27,47,4 December 2012
Coriolanus," Oh, good, it's Shakespeare. Or perhaps: Oh, god, it's Shakespeare.
","Shakespeare and I don't get along very well. As a graduate of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and former FOH Manager for Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory (SATTF), it's not something I'm particularly proud of. Mr. Ward succeeded in revealing Twelfth Night to me in secondary school and our companion for tonight's screening, Rev Nev, the font of all things Shakespeare, has tried, largely in vain, to remove the mental block I have with the bard.The trouble is the language. I hear the first line and attempt desperately to understand every single word but inevitably fail. SATTF's Comedy of Errors last year is a notable exception that gave me hope and Branagh has this ignoramus in mind when he directs Shakespeare for the big screen. Absurdly, the most accessible production I've seen to date was a rendition of A Midsummer Night's Dream performed entirely in Korean.So why did I hand over hard earned cash to endure yet more Shakespearean agony tonight? Well, I'm a sucker for a good cast and that of Coriolanus is right up there: Ralph Fiennes (who also directs), Brian Cox, Jessica Chastain, Vanessa Redgrave and, with a heavy heart, Gerard Butler. That and (in a quiet voice) the trailer impressed me.Apparently, according to Nev, it was quite good. Shakespeare aficionados may be disappointed that the three-hour play has been pared down to a more manageable two hours and two minutes but for me the strained relationship with Shakespeare is finally over. I just don't know why I put myself through it.It looked good, there's great vehemence and the spittle flies during the most impassioned soliloquies but I just didn't get it. If I'm to be judged by my understanding of Shakespeare then I am little more than a squished slug in the grooves of Coriolanus' boot. I concede Vanessa Redgrave is as compelling to watch as ever and her cobalt eyes manage to be both warm and piercing. She, as an actress and as her character, Volumnia, demands attention with her flawless (so I'm told) performance. Fiennes is powerful, absorbing and a very fine Coriolanus in Nev's book and this marks an impressive directorial debut.For those who know, understand and love the works of Shakespeare, this apparently ranks a little below Olivier's Henry V. For those with an Ed-type brain, stick to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.Ending on a high point, this was my tenth film of the year and January still has a week to run. At this end of 2012, my target of 120 films looks distinctly possible.Another film review from The Squiss.

We're the Millers," Simple, no-brainer with sufficient laughs & the best balls on screen this year.
","When small-time dope dealer, David (Jason Sudeikis), is robbed of his stash and cash he is forced to undertake a dug smuggling run for his boss, Brad (Ed Helms), to bring a small quantity of marijuana across the Mexican border. He recruits stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), geek Kenny (Will Poulter) and homeless dropout Casey (Emma Roberts) to be his clean-cut 'family' for the trip but what looks to be a milk run rapidly descends into dangerous farce when the 'package' fills their RV.We're the Millers is a comedy of recompense where Sudeikis goes some way to making amends for his inexplicable appearance in the execrable Movie 43 while Aniston restores our confidence in her ability after her lukewarm flop, Wanderlust. There's not a lot of depth, it's a ridiculous premise with dubious morals that you know from the outset Hollywood will feel the need to temper but, you know what? It's funny! From the trailer We're the Millers gives the impression of being the hilarious sleeper hit that The Hangover was in 2009. Alas, it falls far short of that but Helms is on his best form since his big screen breakout hit and it works as a simple, no-brainer Friday night flick.Sudeikis holds the film together as the selfish manchild with some deeply hidden morals and is wonderfully deadpan when the mania around him needs to be played down. Aniston gets to be both sexy and bitchy while playing the mumsy role and Roberts has the opportunity to pout and give her 'mum' a run for her money.The funniest moments, however, come courtesy of Poulter who's come a long way since his debut, Son of Rambow. His Kenny is embarrassing, nerdy, sincere and very funny at times presenting us with plenty of opportunities to cringe or wince at his expense. Oh, and he has the honour of owning the funniest balls seen on the big screen this year so far.There are plenty of enjoyable cameos from Helms, Luis GuzmÃ¡n (as a Mexican cop) and Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn and Molly Quinn as the RV-freaky Fitzgerald family ensuring We're the Millers ambles along at an enjoyable pace and providing sufficient laughs to keep the attention.Unfortunately, there is too much reliance on old jokes badly reworked and pretty obvious scenarios for We're The Millers to be anything more that a fun evening and a distant recollection, but it is fun, you WILL laugh and it's worth a small amount of effort.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,0,1,5 September 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Cooper & Lawrence are mere eye-candy no more in a heartfelt battle against love.
","Silver Linings Playbook is in the enviable position of having been nominated for eight Oscars and it deserves every one of the nods. But that doesn't mean to say it will walk away with any statuettes. Just look back at the 1994 ceremony when The Shawshank Redemption walked away empty handed despite seven nominations. Shawshank was robbed but, unfortunately, Silver Linings Playbook is up against better films in every category. But there is hope; Academy has been known to occasionally get it wrong.Though there are better films on release, Silver Lining Playbook is a very good film that owes much of its success to the very fine work from the cast, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in particular. Both actors are known predominantly for light, entertaining films rather than gritty performances in films that count and remain in mind long after the event, but this will go a very long way to Hollywood viewing them as serious actors rather than mere eye candy. As for Robert De Niro, it's probably his best performance since Sleepers and almost erases the pain of Meet the Fockers. Almost.Pat (Cooper) emerges after several months from a mental institution, where he has been treated for bipolar disorder, against the better judgment of the doctors and moves back with his parents (De Niro and Jacki Weaver). He attempts to rebuild his life and win back his estranged wife, despite her restraining order on him. Then Tiffany (Lawrence), a widow with her own substantial emotional issues, crashes into his life and an explosive friendship ensues.Silver Linings Playbook isn't a traditional love story and there's no guarantee of a sweet beautiful ending, so if you're looking for a predictable, ordinary rom-com you're in the wrong screen. Go and see I Give it a Year and be damned. Here we have two broken people who cause others as much pain as they themselves are struggling to overcome.For those who have no experience with bipolar disorder, Cooper gives an enlightening performance of a man who knows after the event that he has behaved irrationally, but at the time is incapable of preventing the monster inside from taking control. For those who have, it is a reminder that causes one's head to nod in acknowledgement. But Pat isn't just a disturbed character; Cooper plays him as a man with at odds with what seems obvious to him and the current of understanding that runs beneath the surface.The performance Lawrence serves up as the angry, destructive Tiffany is like watching Katniss on heroin though a cracked spyglass. Buried deep inside her is a lost soul that needs care and unconditional love but she has developed her own detrimental methods of self-preservation. It is an eye-opening performance and has set a standard for Susanne Bier's Serena, in which Lawrence and Cooper will reunite later this year.There are no great surprises or shocks with Silver Linings Playbook if you keep your wits about you, but it is a heartwarming film that further cements David O. Russell's status as a writer/director rushing up the A-list. Add it to the 'must see' list at number four or five.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,0,1,9 February 2013
Ender's Game," Passable entertainment for those who didn't read the novel.
","I had no intention of watching Ender's Game. The trailer didn't excite me beyond a cursory fascination and it was only on the insistence of my companion for the screening, Bag, that I relented. In the event, I enjoyed it more than he.Part of the trouble is that Bag read, listened to and loved the Orson Scott Card sci-fi novels, whereas I haven't. Part of the trouble is that Gavin Hood's (Tsotsi, Rendition) adaptation isn't very good, it isn't terribly true to the source novel and there's a reasonable amount ropy acting on screen.Seventy years after Earth has been twice ransacked by an alien race, The Buggers, and foiled by the now-mythical hero fighter pilot, Mazer Rackham, humankind has turned to a new breed of fighting machine: Children. Children have a unique way of viewing the stress and challenges of warfare and are able to approach it in an entirely fresher and superior way to stubborn, caught-in-the-ruts adults. Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield, Hugo Cabret in Hugo) is one such child and is removed from his family and transported to the International Military's academy deep in space where he is trained and subjected to all manner of harsh emotional tests in the hope that he just might thwart the Bugger's next attack and be the savior of mankind.Ender's Game rolls along easily enough. There's plenty to interest the eye and the weightlessness is handled well, though not in the same class as that of Gravity. It will please the kids and pass a couple of hours without too much regret but, by the sound of it, it will really cheese off those who read the novel. Too much has been changed: the parentage of Ben Kingsley's character inexplicably switched, characters in the finale who have long since gone in the novel, and, worst of all for Bag, 'the entire point' of the ending and Ender's journey is lost in favour of a more palatable end that will allow for a more filmable sequel than the second novel. Take it from me, he was not best pleased.I can't comment, only advise, on that matter. The performances, however, are fair game.Butterfield, excellent in Hugo, has lost his mojo. He might be able to turn on the tears but he sure as hell can't run convincingly. It's a passable performance from a lad carrying the weight of a film but lacks the depth and maturity that he displayed in Scorsese's Oscar-winning delight.But Butterfield is a positive Laurence Olivier next to Nonso Anozie as Sergeant Dap. We haven't seen ham as overcooked as this on screen since Gerard Butler in Olympus Has Fallen. His performance is not just poor, it's embarrassing.Viola Davis gives solid support as Major Gwen Anderson but is barely given the time to have an impact. Likewise, Abigail Breslin as Ender's sister, Valentine, makes her self known adequately without coming close to the standard she displayed in this year's The Call.Thank goodness for Harrison Ford! There's nothing startling about his performance, but it's the Ford of old. He's reliable, entirely watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. He dominates every scene he's in and makes for an imposing officer. He has to; by the looks of it, there are only four in the entire academy, and one of those is Dap.Ender's Game is passable entertainment for those who have no knowledge of the novels, but don't expect a life-changing event or anything particularly memorable.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,4,12,28 October 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A fun, bloodthirsty, ballsy romp through the woods.
","In 2005, Terry Gilliam suffered a rare blip in his mesmerising career when he served up The Brothers Grimm. Presumably, what he was aiming for was something along the lines of this loose adaptation-cum-extension of one of the brother's best-loved tales. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters picks up the abandoned siblings' story many years later, far more streetwise (um, forestwise?) and with an insatiable desire for witch obliteration; removal of the head is fun but nothing beats a good burning, apparently.As silly as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and just as much fun, this is a bloodthirsty, ballsy romp through the woods that doesn't pretend to be anything other than disposable, claret-splattering entertainment. It's a fast, violent gore-fest that doesn't take itself remotely seriously but still delivers enough quality punches to be satisfying.Make no mistake, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters has 'franchise' written all over it with Gemma Arterton challenging Kate Beckinsale for the 'vamp with guns' crown from but, whereas Selene pouts and kicks ass with an undercurrent of darkness and the hope we'll take her seriously in the Underworld chronicles, Gretel is just out to have fun and kill as many evil bitches along the way as possible. In a duel, my money would still be on Selene but the new, Gretel-shaped, killing machine in town might just take over at the box office and she's a lot more fun to watch.Gore splattered after the messy demise of another hex victim, Gretel expels an exasperated thought to no one in particular: 'The curse of hunger for crawling things! I f*****g hate that one!' It's a moment to relish in a delightfully messy film that refuses to shy away from the blood splatter and gore.Thumbs up to writer/director Tommy Wirkola who deals with the awkward backstory (for those who somehow missed out on fairy tales in childhood) pre-titles and brings us up to date via newspaper clippings as the titles are splashed across the screen. This feels like a boyhood dream project of his that's finally come to fruition and is littered with subtle comedic moments as he melds the modern approach with period setting; milk bottles have 'missing child' posters hung around their necks and later Hansel (Jeremy Renner) laments his diabetes, the result of being force fed candy by their childhood witch. Get that: the moralistic side of slaughter! Although this should be a double act vehicle, Renner seems a little lost in the events. Certainly he has his moments in the sun but this feels like Arterton's film with Renner there to make her and arch villainess, Muriel (Famke Janssen) look good. Hansel's awkwardness with the is she/isn't she witch suspect, Mina (Pihla Vitala), is weak and the evolving relationship is stilted and superficial so as to be almost irrelevant.Janssen clearly has a ball chewing scenery and generally being nasty in fancy dress, perhaps doing her damndest to shake off her dreary, constricting character of last year's Taken 2. She succeeds admirably with just the right amount of melodrama to make it amusing without being laughable.The other supporting characters, Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare) chief amongst them, are simply there as cannon fodder and the inclusion of Hansel & Gretel's own groupie and a disillusioned troll are plonked in to fill some gaps with a view to filling out their characters in the inevitable sequel. It's not a problem but with a little more attention to the peripheral characters, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters might have been a fuller experience instead of just disposable entertainment.As with Dredd last year, 2D screenings are in short supply and so I was forced to suffer another jarring, juddering display in the third dimension with gimmickry the order of the day instead of depth of field and a more exquisite canvas Ã  la Hugo. It's a horrible experience, it detracts from the fun and it's painful to watch at times, but still the money-grabbing Hollywood execs foist it upon us. Bah! If you can find a 2D print of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, go for it. If you can't, wait for the DVD and watch it on a HUGE TV with a couple of beers and a friend who enjoys splatter and gore as much as you.Don't take it seriously, watch it once, enjoy it, move on.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,0,2,16 March 2013
The Intouchables," Tender, beautiful & very funny. One of the French joys of 2012.
","Intouchables / Untouchable **** 10 September 2012 I hate having to start like this but, based on the discontented grunts from the morons who walked out in the first minute, I regret I must begin with: Intouchables is a French film. Which means it's in FRENCH. Which means there are subtitles!!! Arrrggghhh.For the readers who actually have a brain, Intouchables (Untouchable for those who can't work it out) will almost certainly end the year as one of the most tender, beautiful films of 2012. Yes, it was released in France last year but this is no place for such pedantry.Intouchables is the true story of Phillipe (FranÃ§ois Cluzet), a wealthy, aristocratic quadriplegic and his relationship with his caretaker-cum-care assistant, the reluctant, defiant Driss (Omar Sy). When Driss turns up for an interview at Phillipe's home it is with the sole intention of failing in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. Phillipe, however, sees in him a man who will challenge and inspire him and, much to the annoyance of Magalie (Spiral's Audrey Fleurot), hires him on the spot.And so begins a clash of culture, class and conduct from which both parties will surely emerge richer, softer and sharper.There are no surprises in the broad story; if a true-life tale is worthy of the big screen treatment, there's a very good chance it sticks to the formula, although don't dismiss Intouchables as merely formulaic. The surprise here is how effortlessly engaging, inspiring and downright funny it is. No, it isn't specifically a comedy but I laughed out loud more often and with less control than I have in any films billed as such this year so far.There's no great villain, no huge love story, no major tragedy, just a simple story of friendship where two men, though apparently diametrically opposed in every aspect, are absolutely meant to share their lives and have more in common and so much more to give each other then either could have considered.Cluzet, in a welcome return to British screens after last year's superb Little White Lies, is huggably dour as Phillipe with an outer crust and a rod up his backside that are begging to be shattered. Sy meanwhile, in his most prominent film for English-speaking audiences (other than a supporting turn in Micmacs), storms into frame with a demeanour that would make most of us back away and cover our throats. But though we get the measure of both men fairly quickly and there are no road-to-Damascus conversions, each of them evolves and when the inevitable tug at the heartstrings arrives, it brings a hollowness that you'll hope desperately can be filled. Soon.I really want to award Intouchables another couple of stars but it misses out on perfection for being too swift and not allowing itself the time to unveil the arcs of a couple of supporting characters that could have added greater depth to the film. Although we meet members of Diss' family at various points, there is another plot line with them that is never fully explored and there is more that occurs in Phillipe's household than we are allowed to fully enjoy.But these are minor quibbles. See it. See it before it disappears from your local screen. See it if The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left you hankering after India, see it if The Chorus made your heart skip, see it ifÂ… Oh, just go and see it. It's beautiful, warm and very, very funny.",8,6,11,20 September 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Why a Spider-Man reboot so soon? Here's why
","I have to admit I had low expectations for The Amazing Spider-Man. Yes, I enjoyed the first of Tobey Maguire's outings as Spidey back in 2002 but the quality diminished with each sequel to the point that I didn't care if a fourth installment came to fruition or not. More than anything, it was the feeling I had a mere five years after the last installment, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, of 'Why another Spider-Man so soon?' However, the decision to return to the timeline of the source comics and introduce Gwen Stacy as Peter Parker's girlfriend (instead of the more familiar Mary Jane Watson) increased the interest. Maybe this would be a new approach. Then the casting of Andrew Garfield intrigued. His superb turns in Never Let Me Go and in the more widely seen The Social Network certainly suggested he may have something new to bring to the part. The trailer clinched it for me, hinting at a Spider-Man Begins leaning. If Christopher Nolan could obliterate the camp, tarnished Adam West Batman with a completely reinvented trilogy, what could director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) create with The Amazing Spider-Man? It's not Batman Begins, let's get that straight immediately. Nolan's trilogy stands head and shoulders above all other superhero films at the moment and is unlikely to be dethroned any time soon. But The Amazing Spider-Man is a huge success and an extremely enjoyable first foray into Spidey world by all involved and this is down to some fine writing by James Vanderbilt (who has just penned next year's RoboCop reboot) and the courage of Webb not to rush into the action and villain chasing too soon.A large part of the film is spent meeting, understanding and developing a relationship with Peter Parker through his childhood, the loss of his parents, his relationship with his aunt and uncle, the death of his uncle and his decision to become the superhero and gradual evolution of his crime-fighting alter ego. We see that Peter is flawed. He's cocky at times, he's angry, emotionally wounded, damaged goods and incredibly lonely. When he's bullied at school, it isn't the obvious type of bullying that results in a dramatic conversion to prize-fighting champion, it's the slow, constant drip-drip that niggles, that eats away at confidence and distills the inner turmoil to anger that could easily become rage but veers towards sulky stubbornness and carries its own consequences.Such time is spent with the family that when Aunt May (Sally Field on fine form that surely must lead to more screen time in the sequel) rebukes Peter we, too, sit up and listen and when Uncle Ben (the ever-excellent Martin Sheen in another flawlessly strong and sincere performance) is murdered in front of his nephew, though we know it will happen and is only on a screen, it wrenches our gut and we know Peter's anguish for ourselves.When Gwen steps into Peter's life it, too, is gradual and believable. There are no great fireworks or sudden changes but a slow maturing of their friendship into something stronger. The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone (so much more watchable here than in the good but overrated The Help earlier this year) is tangible and a pleasure to witness. They work together, they suit each other and one really hopes they stay together.Inevitably, the superhero must eventually take centre stage and the catalyst has to be an (almost) equally super villain. In this instance it's Rhys Ifans' Dr. Curt Connors, aka The Lizard, with a destructive agenda. So good has The Amazing Spider-Man been up to this point that it's almost a pity when The Lizard arrives at all. It has to happen and it brings with it an increased level of excitement and action but something dims, the quality dips slightly and it becomes a more predicable, certainly a more standard comic book flick.Ifans is dangerously close to panto villain at times but in his human form he is straight enough to offset the predictable swerves in naturalism and believability when he transmogrifies into lizard form. His make-up is better than the CGI and at times The Lizard's moves are clumsy and the facial expressions lacking in emotion. In the wide shots, however, Spider-Man's leaps and swings are far smoother and more elegant than in the Maguire years and are a minor annoyance when they are less than perfect rather than a jarring disturbance.The Amazing Spider-Man is very good indeed and I am, for the first time, looking forward to Spidey sequel but I'm guessing the real amazement will come next week when at last The Dark Knight Rises.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",8,36,51,6 August 2012
The Lego Movie," Everything is Awesome? Um... Not quite a joy but certainly a pleasure.
","I had little interest in seeing The Lego Movie until I heard Mark Kermode's verdict in his blog about Liam Neeson. Even then it wasn't enough to make me buy a ticket. It took Roocayke, the nephew who last month subjected me to Walking With Dinosaurs 3D, to force me into it. Would this be two strikes against him or could he earn a redemption?Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a bog standard, Lego mini-figure construction worker who smiles, sings, follows instructions and is completely unremarkable until he is mistaken for the Master Builder, the chosen one, who will fulfill an ancient prophesy, find the Piece of Resistance and thwart the evil plan of the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Accompanied by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and her egotistical, vain boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett), Emmet journeys through every conceivable Lego theme in its universe on a mission to save their world from being glued together, and of personal discovery.Without doubt, The Lego Movie is a fantastic merchandising film. It is one long, feature length video catalogue that you can be thankful was released in the spring rather than prior to Christmas. But whereas The Internship was just a horrible, humourless Google commercial, The Lego Movie is a clever idea that entertains first and foremost. Oh, it's far less subtle than the product placement of Toy Story but you won't emerge feeling bludgeoned by the marketing bods.The plot is simple enough for the youngsters to follow but there is little time for boredom as the screen is constantly filled with action and movement and the dialogue rattles along with little time to reflect on the gags as they whiz by. As you'd expect, the scenery is beautifully constructed with Lego, the model numbers of bricks and components tumbling across the screen like Sherlock's (the BBC Benedict Cumberbatch incarnation) thoughts.The Lego Movie's 100 minute running time is perhaps too generous for the plot and its demographic, and there were too few children's giggles and too many shuffling bums but, if Roocayke was anything to go by, it will be a big hit with the under tens and an acceptable movie for the parents to enjoy rather the endure, as is more often the case. There are plenty of gags, references and in-jokes that sail over the youngsters' heads to entertain the adults and, though there is nothing to make us laugh out loud, The Lego Movie contains plenty to amuse.The vocal talent, too, will be of little interest to the kiddies but there is an impressive roster of stars having fun including half the cast of Star Wars and, in the battle of the scene thieves, Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius) narrowly beaten by Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop. Add to that Alison Brie, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum...The Lego Movie is no Fankenweenie but it is a lot of fun. Just ask Roocayke. In amongst the gabble of enthusiasm that accompanied us home were two gems: 'I really liked the lady (Wyldstyle) but I don't want to marry her.' and 'Uncle Yed, I seriously want to see that again!' The Lego Movie is not quite a joy, though it's certainly a pleasure. But be warned, it contains the nastiest brainworm on the big screen so far this year. It's a marketer's dream but an accompanying uncle's nightmare! Trust me on this: the drive home is a painful experience with a six-year old singing non-stop Everything is Awesome!

Dallas Buyers Club," AIDS will end Ron Woodroof's life, but it just might save his soul.
","1985, Dallas: Electrician and occasional rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a stereotypical redneck who drinks, smokes, snorts and screws his way through life. He is forthright, judgmental, homophobic and upon reading of Rock Hudson's AIDS related death, regards it as just reward for being a 'faggot'. AIDS is, after all, the 'gay plague'.When Woodroof lands in hospital after an industrial accident and blood results show that he is HIV positive with just 29 days to live, his immediate reaction is rage and denial. He discovers a clinical trial for a new drug, AZT, but his attempts to buy himself onto the trial are thwarted and he is introduced to Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), who offers a different treatment. Woodroof might be ignorant but he is wily, far from stupid and sees a business opportunity. But nothing is straightforward and the disease that will end his life just might save his soul.Based on the true story of Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club is an insightful reflection of the good that came out of something and someone rotten. Whereas 1993's Philadelphia took on the role of education and breaking down the barriers of homophobia, Jean-Marc ValÃ©e's film assumes that we already know what is good and just, and those who still share Woodroof's twisted views won't come within a mile of Dallas Buyers Club.There is nothing schmaltzy about Dallas Buyers Club. This is not a self-conscious weepy designed to yank on your heartstrings. Yes, it is terribly sad and frequently stirring but it is also funny for the audacity of Woodroof's plans and his doomed flirtations towards his doctor, Eve (Jennifer Garner). More than that, it is sweet and tender with the evolution of Woodroof's relationship with transgender AIDS patient, Rayon (Jared Leto). And in the midst of the quarrels, sickness and political shenanigans, Dallas Buyers Club has time to be silently beautiful, particularly when Woodroof finds himself covered in butterflies. It is a magical moment of calm both for him and for us.McConaughey is on a fantastic roll of fine performances in a succession of wonderful films (Mud, Killer Joe, The PaperboyÂ…). As I have written before, he is in serious danger of becoming a heavyweight amongst Hollywood's royalty if he continues in this vein. Much has been written about his dramatic weight loss for the role and though it is startling, it is not the achievement here that we should celebrate. It is his performance alone that should warrant our attention and admiration.When you get down to it, Woodroof isn't a terribly nice man; he is the trailer trash brother of Jordan Belfort, but he is real. His prejudices stink and he's never going to be in the running for pope. McConaughey doesn't play him as a beautifully scripted flawed character but as a real man with a body-rotting death sentence who is subjected to the prejudice and hatred he once dished out. With the loss of job and friends and a burgeoning loathing of authority and injustice, Woodroof finds both his cause and his allies in the gay community. McConaughey maintains the abrasiveness and judgment of his character though the direction of it subtly alters. It is a performance that grips the viewer and may well become one that (re)defines McConaughey.With his sensitive, engaging performance as Rayon, Jared Leto has leapt to the forefront of the cinema-goers' consciousness after a career hitherto as a solid peripheral actor. There is nothing gauche or gaudy about his Rayon and again this is a multifaceted character that is sensual, sassy and terribly damaged by a father's judgment. Leto brings much of the light relief to Dallas Buyers Club though Rayon's story is perhaps more traumatic and affecting than Woodroof's.Adorned with awards already, when Sunday's BAFTAs arrive and the Oscars shortly after, Dallas Buyers Club may not triumph with the top gong, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to see both McConaughey and Leto walk away with gold. And, no discredit to their fellow nominees, but both will thoroughly deserve it.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,2,2,14 February 2014
Goon," Comedy that serves a generous dollop of blood & splatter amongst the ice hockey.
","It's a bloody comedy.That's not profanity, Goon is a comedy that serves a generous dollop of blood and teeth splattering across ice, face and anything else in its way.It's violent, it's funny, it's violent, it's about ice hockey and it's violent.Lost amongst the high-profile cinema listings of The Iron Lady, The Artist and other such worthy films vying for gongs, Goon is not a threat to their glory and a perfect opportunity to sink into your cinema seat and enjoy laughing and grimacing in equal measures.Inspired by actual events, Goon is the story of the runt of a litter, Glatt, (played by Seann William Scott, Stifler in American Pie), the black sheep in a family of intellectuals who discovers his 'thing' is beating the crap out of anything that offends. He's spotted pummelling an opposing player by a hockey coach and brought into a team despite a complete ineptitude on skates. He doesn't last long before being palmed off on a lower league team with little skill and less hope whose star player is a washed up loner who's afraid of being bumped.Glatt's job is to protect the team and fight any player that gets in their way. Obviously, this being a David and Goliath film, he becomes the unlikely glue that sticks the broken team together again. If that's a plot spoiler for you, you evidently don't go to the cinema often enough. The enjoyment this film gives is not in the resolution to the story but the manner in which it finds it.There's no great depth; you're not going to be challenged mentally or emotionally and it isn't going to warrant a mention in your Top Ten of 2012 but it is bloody good fun. That's not so say it's perfect. It's not. There are times when, actually, it isn't even very good. It has its fair share of dips and there are some scenes clunkier than John Sargent dancing. Quite often the expletives are tedious and there for effect rather than reason and break up what might otherwise be a good verbal exchange. The love story aspect is superfluous and the platonic friendship between star players improves as quickly as flicking on the light switch.However, Goon delivers more guffaws than most comedies of late (The Guard a notable exception) and (pacifists look away) some of the violence is just plain funny. I don't propose you try this at home but it transpires it is very funny watching a guy have a hockey stick wrapped round his head.And how can you not admire a film that has the genius of such lines as 'You make me wanna stop sleeping with a bunch of guys.'

Now You See Me," Nolan-esque spectacle. Illusion, crime & superb cast.
","Some people spend the duration of magic shows trying to spot the sleight of hand, to work out how the magician fools the rest of the audience; others sit back and allow themselves to be amazed by the illusions; a few convince themselves from the outset that all magic is genuine, that they are in the presence of a miracle worker and the naysayers be damned. Audiences will inevitably approach Now You See Me in much the same fashion, and that will have some bearing on how much they enjoy it.Take heed: don't think; just roll with it.Four magicians each receive a mysterious tarot card invitation to an address that holds secrets and a challenge. The reward is membership of the exclusive, perhaps mythical, magic circle known as The Eye. A year later, rebranded as The Four Horseman, they perform a spectacular sell-out show in Las Vegas that culminates with an apparent bank robbery and redistributing the cash to their audience. Is it magic or just a remarkable illusion? FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) regards it as nothing more than an elaborate crime and launches an aggressive hunt for the truth to expose and capture the Four Horsemen.Though Now You See Me lacks the drama of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, it's a thrilling romp that begs to be seen at least twice; once for the spectacle, twice for clearer understanding. It's no mindbender, like Inception, but is a thoroughly enjoyable romp that will keep some people guessing. The biggest surprise is that it comes from Louis Leterrier, the director of clunking bombs The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans. Who'd have thought? Take the bling and blast of David Copperfield (who is credited as the inspiration), give it a screenplay with some criminal zing and what would once have been known as an all-star cast and that's pretty much Now You See Me. Dave younger-brother-of-James Franco holds his own as street illusionist Jack Wilder against the 'above the title' star power of Woody Harrelson (Merritt McKinney), Jesse Eisenberg (J. Daniel Atlas) and Isla Fisher (Henley Reeves) as the Four Horsemen. There's very little in the way of character development but this isn't that kind of film. This is a movie where the stars play second fiddle to the spectacle and the quips, snaps and asides to each other are seasoning to the visual feast.Now You See Me feels like a Nolan film (though he appears not to have been involved) in tone, character and casting choices, not least of all for the double act of Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler, multi-millionaire financier of The Four Horsemen, and Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, the debunker of all things illusory. But it never feels like a rip-off because of it, more a case of beneficial influence.It's difficult to pick out a performance that overshadows all others here because Now You See Me is a superb ensemble piece that deserves to be seen for the grand scale. I'm not claiming it's a modern classic, nor that it will feature in the top ten at the end of the year, but like last year's Chronicle it's stomping good fun and a flick worth having on the hard drive for one of those evenings that require a beer, feet up and a small amount of thought without the need for pure reality.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,0,1,22 July 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Much-needed shot in the arm. The X-men live. And die. And live again.
","In 1994 David Carson linked two eras of the Starship Enterprise with his Star Trek: Generations. It wasn't entirely successful but was far from being the biggest turkey in the cinematic outing of the franchise. With X-Men: Days of Future Past, Bryan Singer returns to the series (as director) with a more audacious link between eras and with markedly greater success.X-Men: Days of Future Past is a convoluted but thoroughly enjoyable excuse to throw two Magnetos, two Professor Xs and a host of our favourite mutants into a time travel romp with evil doings, minor destruction, moderate violence, naked pecs and blue breasts. And what's not to like about that? It's a hit, it'll be a success and there's clearly a market for more.Waaaaay back in 1973, money-grabbing, almost villainous Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) develops a blueprint for an army of sentinels to hunt down the pesky mutants, aided by the DNA of Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Fifty years later, the sentinels are not only wiping out the mutants but also the humans who aided them and time is running perilously short for the remaining X-Men. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) opt to send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to persuade the young Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to prevent Raven from inadvertently initiating the demise of mutantkindÂ… There's lots on screen that doesn't quite make sense, there's an awful lot of action packed into the 131 minute running time and there'll be plenty of viewers who emerge scratching their heads, having had a great evening but not really following all of it.But no matter. X-Men: Days of Future Past is great fun that packs in the cameos, ups the ante and opens the door for a whole new chapter of X-Men movies. The Marvel world has always been in good hands with Singer at the helm and his reappearance has strengthened it just as the attraction was beginning to wane.Where X-Men: Days of Future Past rejuvenates the series is that it remembers not just to thrill and entertain, but to have fun being fun. The introduction of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is a most welcome injection of adrenalin and the scene in the Pentagon basement is an absolute joy. Singer takes his time, slows the pace down and enjoys constructing the sequence as though choreographing a ballet with the mother of all punch-lines. It is thrilling, funny and a superb change of pace that will have you pressing the rewind button when you watch it again at home.Yes, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a little cluttered and there is the sense that drastic steps needed to be taken to put the franchise back on track and refill the Marvel bank account, but far from being desperate, it works. It's fun and it's too long to wait for 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,0,2,29 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Oh dear!
","Oh dear.My initial concerns about casting and the unreasonable padding of a fantastic short novel that I voiced in my review for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey still stand. The Hobbit trilogy is already far too long, far too protracted and all about the money. But whereas part one of the unnecessary trilogy was a visual feast that I mostly enjoyed, part two, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, is a few bright scenes away from dull thud.You don't need a synopsis so we'll skip that part and simply say that Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the clutch of dwarfs venture forth through forests and mountains to the lair of the dragon, Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). There is gold, there are elves, there are ugly creatures that will maim and kill aplenty, there are a couple of wizards (one of which still doesn't belong in this tale), there is often more CGI on screen than reality and there's even a certain gold ring slotted into this arduous one hundred and sixty one (!) minutes.Let's deal with the front and back ends of The Desolation of Smaug. I knew we were in trouble when the first face we saw was Peter Jackson chomping animatedly on a carrot. Again! As for the end, when the screen cut to black, there was a spontaneous, audible groan from the audience as we realized that, yet again, we had been cheated out of any kind of conclusion. Forget a cliffhanger, what Jackson left us with was the video equivalent of half a sentence. *** MINOR PLOT SPOILER ALERT *** Ignore the title; the 'desolation' it implies has either happened eons ago or will happen in the third installment. When Smaug is on screen it's more a case of The Slight Disturbance of the Piles of Gold of Smaug.And then there's the dialogue, which includes such greasy smudges as:'Why don't you search me? I could be hiding something in my trousers.''Or nothing!'Yet again characters fill the screen that don't belong: Radaghast (Sylvester McCoy), Legolas (Orlando Bloom)Â… With a book so filled with characters, why on Middle Earth does Jackson insist on mixing up timelines and throwing in trespassers? Is he afraid there isn't a market for his films unless he sexes them up with popular characters? As my companion once again, Bag, complained, Jackson no longer makes films; he makes platform games with each scene taking us up to another level. Oh, to return to the Jackson of Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners. In a fit of worry, I slipped my Lord of the Rings extended editions into the DVD player to see if I had lost my love of Middle Earth. I haven't. Those films still rock as five-star triumphs, even with the artistic licence taken to fit them into the running time. There was an awful lot of fidgeting in the seats beneath and around us that just didn't occur in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I know at least two members of the audience were fighting very hard to stay awake in the final third. And that just shouldn't be the case.It's far from being awful; the performances are largely as expected and there are moments of action and adventure to warm the heart and take one back to Tolkien's triumph. For the most part it looks absolutely beautiful. The sets, both physical and digital, are spectacular and the scenery is as breathtaking as ever. But, overlooking the copious CGI, Peter Jackson didn't make New Zealand.We departed the Directors' Lounge with shoulders slumped, dragging feet, heavy hearts and a new title: The Hobbit: The Disappointment of Bag.If you're looking for a Freeman/Cumberbatch double act that works, step away from the cinema queue, turn around and visit the BBC for series three (and one and two!) of Sherlock; evidence that you don't need bucket loads of cash to make great entertainment and it really is possible to fit an enthralling story into 90 minutes.Another film review from The Squiss.

The Fault in Our Stars," 2 parts schmaltzy trudge, 1 part beautiful heartbreak. Worth working through. Just.
","The Fault in Our Stars, adapted from John Green's novel of the same name, is the story of Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort), two teenage cancer patients who meet at a support group, form a friendship and fall in love. It is a fairly typical teen romantic drama of two souls reaching out to one another, each with their own emotional and physical baggage; Gus a prosthetic leg, Hazel the constant companion of an oxygen tank.For two thirds of the 126 minute running time, Josh Boone's follow up to Stuck in Love is an uncomfortable experience. Not because of the subject matter of cancer and inevitable death, but because The Fault in Our Stars tries so damn hard.Constantly we are pushed and cajoled into empathizing with the sick teenagers and to feeling the depth of their friendship. It all feels far too forced. Hazel's mother, Frannie (Laura Dern) gushes and sighs sycophantically, everything is amazing, fantastic, absolutely beautifulÂ… The dress she gives her daughter is just one example of painful gushing that is promptly undone in the very next scene when a waitress shows them to a table wearing a genuinely stunning dress.It is irksome, annoying, cringeworthy and the worst kind of labored, insulting, schmaltzy teen pap that ostracizes anyone with at least two years distance from the completion of puberty. I just wanted Hazel to get on and die so I could go home and whinge at my wife for dragging me along.Then, in the final act, Boone turns The Fault in Our Stars around. In a scene I shall, in the interest of avoiding plot spoilers, refer to simply as the 'poultry' scene, the dynamic changes. From there on The Fault in Our Stars finds a grip on reality, it stops propelling us into emotional traps and just flows, carrying us along with it.From there on it feels real. The contrivances evaporate, the bludgeoning ends and it just gets on with the job of showing us a heartbreaking story of life that sometimes isn't fair and death that is inevitable, the only mystery being the timing and cause of it.Elgot is barely watchable without inciting feelings of mild, petulant violence. He is smug, the ultimate jock without an American football team at his back. While I'm guessing Gus should be suave, confident and just ballsy enough to be admirable and lovable, Elgot plays him as cocky and in need of a jolly good slap. Again, regard that as for the first two thirds; in the final act he, too, manages to rein it in a little and pulls us on side. His Gus isn't bad, just annoying and the kind of kid you'd make you wonder why your daughter wasn't aiming higher.Woodley (The Secret Life of the American Teenager, The Descendants), however, gives a stunning, tempered performance that pulls us onside from the outset. Hazel is a good kid, a sweet girl but not apple pie perfect â€“ close, but Woodley just avoids it. The emotion that pours from Woodley, racks her and shocks us. It is impossible not to imagine ourselves in that situation even if we have limited experience of it. There is no suggestion of onions rubbed into the eyes prior to rolling the camera, just an outpouring of pent up anger and an unfair amount of heartbreak. Stunning! Though The Fault in Our Stars belongs to Woodley, director Boone and his screenwriters deserve the final compliment. It would have been far too easy, and from the first hour or so I imagined it no other way, to extend the film to its final mulchy conclusions. Boone exercises restraint, turns around a two-star trudge into a journey that ends with possibility within the inevitability. It is a perfect end that leaves a heaviness in the heart rather than the earlier tightening n the stomach.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,3,6,24 July 2014
To Rome With Love," Reputedly a farce, it is more accurately described as awful.
","Having survived the disappointment of Hope Springs, I crossed to the next screening room confident that my evening's viewing would substantially improve.Woody Allen has continued his filmic tour of Europe in his 40-something cinema outing as director with To Rome With Love. It's a tour that has introduced his work to new audiences, seen him tread new ground, particularly with the murderous Match Point, and given us some engaging, funny, thoroughly enjoyable films like Vicky Cristina Barcelona and last year's delightful Midnight in Paris.To Rome With Love is not one of those films.Reputedly a farce, it is more accurately described as 'awful'. Attempting to weave multiple plot lines through a city apparently filled with love, it manages to lack the quirky charm of Annie Hall, will never garner the plaudits of Hannah and Her Sisters and falls woefully short of the entertainment value of even Match Point. It's not quite a stinker it's justÂ… No, who am I kidding? It positively reeks! I like Woody Allen more when he's not acting. Unfortunately, in To Rome With Love there are 2.5 people playing the standard Woody Allen role: Allen, himself, who performs like a knitted, woolen toy that has been through a washing machine cycle a good 60 degrees too hot, Jesse Eisenberg, who does a far better (read: annoying) job of being Woody Allen, and Roberto Benigni who seems unsure whether to give us a third Woody Allen impersonation or reprise his performance from Life is Beautiful.Allen plays Jerry, the father of Ellen Page's Monica, though he looks more like her grandfather and, at 77, is old enough to be her great grandfather while his wife, Phyllis (Judy Davis), isn't much of an improvement. Poor girl, she must have been severely bullied at school. But don't exert yourself feeling too sorry for Monica, she's purported to be an absolutely stunning Venus in human form and so engaging that men throw themselves at her feet, or so Jack (Eissenberg) and his girlfriend, Sally (Greta Gerwig) believe. Sally believes it so much she invites her to stay and spend time alone with Jack despite the warnings of John (Alec Baldwin). None of them seem to have realized this is Ellen Page we're talking about! Meanwhile, Antonio has brought his new bride, Milly, to Rome to meet his aunts and uncles who may give him a job but he inexplicably pretends his wife is actually Anna (PenÃ©lope Cruz) who actually earns her living on her back.Then Hayley meets, and moments later, falls in love with Michelangelo whose father, Giancarlo, likes to sing in the shower. And then there's Leopoldo (Benigni) whoÂ… Have you lost the will to live yet? Maybe it looked funny (or even fun) on paper, Allen certainly savours (milks) every line he evidently thinks is funny, but actually To Rome With Love is akin to watching eight year olds improvise for the most part and is always far less amusing.I tried gnawing my leg off after thirty minutes to see if it was more fun. It wasn't but it was a close run thing.In the audience of six, the silence at the 'funny' parts was resounding and, judging from the comments I overheard as we all scuttled out before the credits, all of us endured the full 112 minutes because we couldn't quite believe it would be that bad all the way through.It was. You have been warned.",1,10,19,21 September 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Pretty but no masterpiece. Jackson reinvents The Hobbit to suit his pocket, not our expectations
","While Peter Jackson is a fine director, he is emphatically not Tolkien or the authority on Middle Earth.As with TLOTR trilogy, Jackson has given himself carte blanche over Tolkien's world. We all knew long ago that Jackson decreed Galadriel should feature in his adaptation of The Hobbit despite her absence from its 270(ish) pages, and it was to be expected he'd write Frodo back into the tale so as to bring back the star power of Elijah Wood and allow Ian Holm a cameo as the senior Bilbo Baggins. But Saruman? And Radagast? However, whilst for purists such meddling is unnecessary, Radagast the Brown is an enjoyable and beautifully crafted addition. Let's not forget that Tolkien wrote The Hobbit for children and not for cynical grown-ups or demanding fanboys. Sylvester McCoy embraces the role with humour and is absolutely delightful as Middle Earth's great eccentric.There has been very vocal criticism of Jackson's decision to shoot at 48 frames per second rather than the standard 24fps and claims the result looks artificial. Twaddle! If we're going to criticize Jackson for The Hobbit, and I will, let's do so over the genuine issues and not for a technical decision that definitely enhances the clarity and vastly reduces the juddering on the panoramic sweeps. New Zealand, sorry, Middle Earth, looks absolutely stunning (top marks again to DoP Andrew Lesnie) and I can't wait to see it in 2D to appreciate it fully without the gimmicks of today's third dimension.The biggest issues here are pace. It so often feels protracted beyond reason; the clear result of a team thinking of their bank accounts rather than the needs of the novel. The meeting of the council at Rivendell plods like a committee meeting and even the first act takes its time to develop into a film, whereas we meet the dwarfs within a mere 6 pages in the novel and begin the adventure swiftly afterwards.Jackson seems to have forgotten the gravitas of his original trilogy and has spiced up The Hobbit with slapstick routines rather than occasional, naturally humorous quips. The trolls around the campfire sequence will certainly entertain your youngest children, and those who tend to dribble while they watch, but for discerning viewers it's another moment to look around the auditorium.I cringed at the announcement that Martin Freeman had been cast as Bilbo. Entertaining as he was in The Office and Sherlock he is an actor of limited range and there is far too much Freeman and too little Holm in his performance. The odd gesture aside, it requires a great suspension of disbelief to imaging this Bilbo Baggins will become TLOTR's Baggins in a mere 60 years. Why oh why didn't Jackson bring in the CGI bods from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to de-age the flawless Holm instead of subjecting us to the hopeful but inadequate Freeman? As with TLOTR, careers will be substantially enhanced by The Hobbit, and chief amongst those will be that of Richard Armitage who draws the attention as Thorin far more than Freeman can manage as the titular character. Whilst the band of dwarfs work well together and are perhaps the greatest part of the film, they are an ensemble and it is difficult to single out a performance from their group. It isn't an issue for the Great Goblin, a character that is as thoroughly enjoyable as he is hideous, played with gusto by Barry Humpfries.The showpiece character, at least until Smaug arrives, is undoubtedly Gollum and the price of admission is worth it purely for his scenes with Bilbo in the gloom as they riddle for either safe passage or a hobbit-sized meal. It is astounding that the AMPAS has not seen fit to create a 'Vocal & Motion Capture Actor' category at the Oscars and that Andy Serkis has not won it at least three times. Incidentally, Serkis also undertakes second unit director duties on all three Hobbit films, perhaps in preparation for his directorial debut, Freezing Time.Flaws aside, The Hobbit is a sumptuous visual feast. It demands your attention in a quiet cinema with a vast screen. Don't be put off by the criticisms and decide to wait for it on DVD. The criticisms are perhaps so sharp because we now expect so much more from Peter Jackson. It may not match TLOTR but it is fun, it is beautiful, it is worth the effort to see it and, at times, it is actually quite affecting. In Bag End, as Bilbo slinks off to bed stubbornly refusing to join the quest, the dwarfs sing Misty Mountains and it is an unexpectedly touching moment that takes us closer to the brilliance of TLOTR than almost any other moment in The Hobbit. And the end titles song, Song of the Lonely Mountain, performed by Neil Finn (of Split Enz and Crowded House) is a strong contender for an Oscar after Annie Lennox's success with Into the West. And it's far, far more deserving than Adele's repetitive dirge, Skyfall.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a good film. But it isn't great and it jolly well should be with the money, time and talent that has been thrown at it. After each installment of The Lord of the Rings I departed the cinema desperate for the following twelve months to evaporate so I could watch the next part, or for The Hobbit to miraculously appear. Alas, the final scene of The Hobbit feels exactly what it is: an awkward pause that is entirely out of place, and today I departed not desperate for more but frustrated that the job hadn't been completed.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",7,0,7,14 December 2012
Non-Stop," Perfect pizza movie: some ham, plenty of cheese, needs a beer but enjoyable at the time..
","Bish. Bash. Bosh. Kaboom. Bang. Get down, motherfuÂ… That's Non-Stop. Don't gripe, don't bitch about it. If you want something cerebral, mind-spinning or morally and emotionally challenging, why not take a punt on Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac Volumes I & II? Predictably, far fewer cinemas offered me a chance of the latter, so mindless, fun Non-Stop it was! Non-Stop sees Liam Neeson escape Legoland and team up with his Unknown director, Jaume Collet-Serra, for the second time (their third outing, Run All Night, is already in post production) in another action thriller romp with guns, suspense and heroics aplenty.Air marshall Bill Marks (Neeson) receives a text on his secure phone while on a transatlantic flight demanding a ransom of $150 million be deposited in an off-shore account within twenty minutes. Failure to deliver will result in the death of a passenger. Marks contacts his superiors but, viewing him as damaged goods, nobody believes him. Nobody, that is, except for air hostess Nancy (Michelle Dockery) and even she isn't quite sure.Non-Stop begins like a 1970s disaster flick (think The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno) with a mini tour of the principal players including Marks' fellow passengers Jen (Julianne Moore), Tom, (Scoot McNairy), Zack (Nate Parker) and Nancy's colleague, Gwen (Lupita Nyong'o, fresh from her Oscar-winning turn in 12 Years a Slave) so that you know the villain has to be amongst them somewhere.There are plenty of plot holes in Non-Stop, it's almost as unrealistic as Denzel Washington flying a plane upside down in Flight, and Collet-Serra cannot resist swimming in cheese in the final act, but for the most part there is enough tension and intrigue to keep the viewer alert and guessing. It is almost everything you want from a thriller with plenty or excitement in the confines of a small aircraft and, even though you know everything is going to be just peachy in the end, it's a ride of bumpy thrills that won't put you off your pizza.Neeson has convincingly picked up the baton dropped by Harrison Ford and proves yet again to be an everyman hero and pretty good eye-candy to boot. There's nothing here to write home about performance wise and though you can evidently take the girl out of Downton Abbey, I'm not convinced you'll ever take Downton Abbey out of Michelle Dockery but she gets away with it here. As for Moore, she's providing the ham to go with the cheese.No, Non-Stop isn't very believable but it is a most(ly) enjoyable romp for a Friday night after a week of brain ache.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,1,2,12 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Fantastic shaggy dog story that is colourful, off-kilter & epic.
","Wes Anderson's latest offering is perhaps his most accessible, perhaps his most polished, perhaps his most downright enjoyable. And, unlike many, this one even has a tangible McGuffin. Welcome to The Grand Budapest Hotel.The Grand Budapest Hotel contains a tale within a tale. The Author (Tom Wilkinson) recounts his memoirs, which includes the time when as a younger man (Jude Law) he dined with the mysterious Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Mr. Moustafa in turn, tells the story of Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) the former womanizing concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, who satisfies his elderly female guests in more than merely professional matters. When one such patron, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton), pops her clogs, the adventure kicks off in earnest with Gustave on the run with his bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori).The Grand Budapest Hotel is unlikely to divide audiences, simply because those who savour Anderson's work will find this as delightful and engrossing as the best in his canon and those who don't 'get' him, won't part with cash for this. Like his 2009 gem, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel variously meanders in a carefree manner before kicking of with a rampant chase depicted in part with deliberately clumsy animation befitting Monty Python.As one has come to expect from Anderson, The Grand Budapest Hotel is packed full of deadpan, angular and quirky characters inhabited by an eclectic band of Hollywood's finest. Anderson regulars Owen Wilson (in a brief cameo) and Bill Murray play alongside newbies Fiennes, Law, Harvey Keitel, Saorise Ronan, Adrien Brody and Jeff Goldblum and at every turn there is another feast of performers and peculiarities to revel in.The sets are spectacular both in their grand scale and simplistic nature whether the hotel itself (in both incarnations) or the almost cardboard cutout cable car, and the costumes and make-up give anything Tim Burton can dream up a run for its money.There was a time when it looked as though Anderson's inventiveness was dwindling but with Fantastic Mr. Fox and, more recently, Moonrise Kingdom he has proved there is plenty more off-kilter gold to be mined yet, and The Grand Budapest Hotel is testament to that.The Grand Budapest Hotel is less like watching a film than listening to a magnificent story with moving pictures. It is a shaggy dog story, a ripping yarn, a splendid fiction played out by the cream of leftfield Hollywood. And like all the best bedtime stories, it can, and surely must, be enjoyed over and over again.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,0,4,18 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Fun, flawed but the best of the four.
","This should have happened yesterday but the cinema failed to update its website despite the screen being closed for two days! Black marks to Cineworld, Hengrove Park.We shared the cinema with four other people, which might concern some but delighted me. Give me an empty cinema over excited morons with phones and popcorn any day of the week. I don't need 'atmosphere' to experience a film; I save that for the football & tennis.The short version is: Fun, flawed and the best of the four.It's certainly a 'sit back and go with the ride' kind of film and doesn't stand up to a great deal of scrutiny. It's good (in a dark kind of way) to watch the Kremlin go boom instead of yet another rehashed White House wipe out and the scenes on the Burj Khalifa are certainly entertaining as long as you don't look too closely at the sandstorm and the background artistes failing to react to it. I enjoyed the ingenuity with which they did the deed inside the Kremlin (I'm trying not to give too much away here) and, as you'd expect with a Mission: Impossible flick, there are plenty of stunts, lots of action and sufficient noise to drown out most of the cheesy dialogue. Most, not all.Unless you have bucket, it may be advisable to leave five minutes before the credits to avoid the wave of nausea caused by the schmaltzy metaphorical group hug celebrating the true friendship that carried the IMF team through the dark times. On second thoughts, stay, vomit and send it to Mr. Cruise in protest.There are low points within the excitement, not least of all Paula Patton's periodic impression of a plank of wood. You won't be seeing her at the Oscars any time soon, methinks. The greatest annoyance for me is Simon Pegg. It's not that he's bad; he's not. He plays Simon Pegg better than anyone else I know. It's what he's required to be, as Benji, that raises the blood pressure.Why, in an action film, does Hollywood think we are too shallow to cope for two hours without a half-assed smile or a childish comment? Does anyone look back at the Roger Moore Bond years with admiration for his unique brand of spy-humour? Pegg's turn in this is almost as painfully, embarrassingly humourless as (the usually fine) Alan Cumming's Boris in Goldeneye. We do not need another computer nerd/inept agent making stupid, childish, groan-inducing comments polluting our films. He isn't funny, he isn't clever and he's completely out of place. Don't do it again, Tom! But, yes, it's fun. Just watch it selectively.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at http://bit.ly/LlmUcl",6,0,4,16 June 2012
Foxcatcher," Chilling tale with remarkable performance from an unrecognizable Steve Carell.
","Based on the true story of multi-millionaire John du Bont, part of what was once America's richest family, Foxcatcher is a dark brooding eight-star drama with three central ten-star performances.Desperate to prove himself as a man of ability and power, John du Pont (Steve Carell) uses the family money to help an ignored Olympic wrestling champion, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), realize his potential without financial constraints. Du Pont establishes the Foxcatcher training facilities in the hope of ensuring Schultz, his brother, David (Mark Ruffalo), also an Olympic champion, and the American wrestling team strike gold again at the Seoul Olympics. But du Pont is not simply a magnanimous benefactor but a damaged, lonely and quietly violent man who is desperate to buy the love and approval of his condescending mother, Jean (Vanessa Redgrave), his wrestlers or any substitute he can pay off.The obvious and overused comment is that Steve Carell is physically unrecognizable here. Many's the viewer who has sat through much (or all) of Foxcatcher, blissfully unaware that it is the star of simplistic comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Evan Almighty who is unnerving them from the big screen. But that has little to do with him; give those accolades to the make up department. What really matters is that Carell is unrecognizable because he gives one heck of a performance! Talk about chameleon-like ability! This is Carell as you could never have conceived him.It would have been incredibly easy to portray du Pont as an outright monster, raging and throwing his weight around, but Carell owns the screen with a performance that is quietly chilling. There is a distinct lack of facial movement or expression, but the pauses, the silencesÂ… In those eyes we see a man who is capable of great cruelty and damage in his quest for power and pseudo love.Carell is the obvious star turn in Foxcatcher and the absolute about turn from his standard fare is nothing short of astounding, but both Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are on fire here. With Ruffalo, it is solid support, gravitas and a powerful gentleness as the old brother looking out for his sibling as well as his family. Tatum is also something of a revelation as the wrestler of few words but much brooding. With a CV packed with the dreary, dumb and dire (White House Down, This is The End etc.) Tatum has a track record of convincing heartthrob beefcake, but at last he gives us a glimpse of the potential ahead.But performances alone don't make a great film and Foxcatcher falls short of excellence due to director Bennett Miller's (Capote, Moneyball) apparent reluctance to commit. There is a great deal of ambiguity about Foxcatcher and that doesn't serve to intrigue but to frustrate. Du Pont's sexuality is implied but not made clear and there is suggestion of a sexual relationship and abuse, but Miller seems content to make vague references without ever committing.Beyond that, Foxcatcher is a cold film. The aloofness and the suggestion of impending violence keeps us permanently on edge, and that is a great strength of the film, but there needs to be more to draw us inside du Pont's world. As it is, but for his final act, I was left wondering quite why Mark was so upset by du Pont's behavior. Yes he was a strange man, but strange doesn't explain Mark's reaction and emotional turmoil. We needed to see more actuality and not only implication.A great film leaves the viewer wanting more. With Foxcatcher, Miller has given enough to intrigue but leaves us wanting enough to be satisfied.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,3,9,15 January 2015
Behind The Candelabra," Let yourself go & bask in the dazzle of the diamonds. Queentastic!
","When Stephen Soderbergh announced his retirement as a director, he may have told a little porky. Though it was reported he would no longer direct for the big screen (indeed, Behind the Candelabra was produced as a TV movie for HBO), his latest foray behind the camera has deservedly earned a cinematic release in the UK, at least, in a similar manner to which Truly Madly Deeply did in 1990 following great acclaim after it's initial airing on TV.If this is to be his swansong, what a way to flounce out! Based on Scott Thorson's (played here by Matt Damon in sparkling form) exposÃ©, Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace, this is a fluffy boa wrapped around a lead pipe; soft to touch and a little exciting but able to cause a headache of you cross it. Soderbergh has once again proved to be a master of control in handling a flamboyant story about a great pretender, that could easily become a tawdry pastiche on less skilled hands.Michael Douglas is beautifully queenly as the maestro Liberace. He sails onto the stage in the opening scene, dazzles at once as his fingers dance across the ivory keys and doesn't stop preening, even when his character's body fails and fades. No, that's not a plot spoiler if you understand this is based on truth and we all die. You don't need to have read the book to grasp that! Douglas inhabits Liberace with a delicate grip and wonderful manipulation of the screen and all those around him. It is staggering to realize that most of the pianist's adoring public was completely unaware (either genuinely or by subconscious decision) that their idol was gay, and Douglas' presentation of him on the screen renders it impossible to see him any other way.But though he is obviously brash, camp and regal, not far below the makeup is a man who struggles with the need to be loved, the obsession to be in subtle control and the fear that he will achieve neither. Why else would he invent girlfriends and hide his truth so solidly while tantalizing the press and fans with unabashed excess? Freddie Mercury was perhaps the greatest showman to strut across a stage, but Liberace was a unique monarch of glitz and glamour and Douglas is flawless in resurrecting him.Damon rarely disappoints in his career and has proved to be equally comfortable as a romantic dad (We Bought a Zoo) as when playing the action man (Bourne), with a great deal of variety between. As Scott, the closet gay country boy turned Liberace plaything, Damon astounds again as he gently excites in his fearless approach to a character the bigots will despise (though I'm sure most will damn Behind the Candelabra without seeing it). Scott's excitement dissolves into his own brand of neediness and torture and Damon effortlessly presents us with a multi-dimensional man who continually evolves, both for better and for worse, upon the screen. While Liberace may be the star, Behind the Candelabra is truly a double act from two actors in their finest form.If Behind the Candelabra had received an original cinematic release and we were mid-way through our post-Christmas diets, I would predict Oscar nominations for both Douglas and Damon. However, they must contend themselves with Emmy nods as Behind the Candelabra waits to see how many of its 15 nominations turn to gold.Beyond the two star turns, honorable mention must go to the almost unrecognizable Dan Aykroyd as Seymour Heller, the puppeteer tugging the strings of Liberace's business and purse. Part snake, part sledgehammer, Heller is a man always less than pleasant to those who aren't his boss and Aykroyd is a revelation in a performance (and makeup) that is far removed from what we expect from him.While many have and will continue to turn their noses up at a biopic of a long-dead queen who denied the truth up to his death, it is not necessary to know about Liberace's life nor be a fan to enjoy Behind the Candelabra. It might help, but it is far more important to understand this is a film for those who applaud actors for breaking their own moulds and who delight in surprising performances. Go on have a gay moment; let yourself go and bask in the dazzle of the diamonds. Soderbergh's next slated directorial project is TV miniseries The Knick, staring Clive Owen. Tantalizing though that is, life just isn't going to be the same without another Soderbergh cinema release to look forward to. We can only hope he was economical with the truth about his retirement.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,0,4,19 July 2013
Gone Girl," Fincher's adaptation of Flynn's novel enthrals and engrosses. Just don't get ideas.
","On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) arrives home to find signs of a struggle and that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), is missing. The police are suspicious because it looks all too convenient and there seems to be more to it than Nick is letting on. Nick's portrayal of a blissful marriage is a little frayed around the edges and he is facing a trial by media. Is the woman who, as a child, inspired her parents' Amazing Amy stories and became America's darling, really missing or did secretive Nick murder her? Adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own bestseller, Gone Girl is quite simply a triumph. I read the novel a year ago and it quickly ranked as my book of the month. As I wrote at the time, I saw much of the plot twists and turns a mile off but it was so well crafted that it did little to spoil the enjoyment. Inevitably, sitting in a dark cinema, I knew exactly what was coming but, again, the pleasure of watching it unfold before me was complete, if a churning stomach and the vague feeling of sickening dread is enjoyment.When the author of the source material writes a film adaptation, there is no excuse for clumsy changes and Flynn has avoided them, staying remarkable true to her novel. Because of this, it jars all the more that Gone Girl is rated 18. The novel didn't require it and the film earns it probably due to a brief exchange of particularly harsh sexual expletives that Flynn has thrown in to guarantee the adult rating. It was a decent enough thriller without the needless, very self-conscious step and I rather suspect the hand of director David Fincher in this.It is a small quibble (along with the character who appears to have ballooned in the space of just a few days) in what is yet another exceptionally fine film from the ever-reliable Fincher. He knows how to wring out the suspense and ramp up the anticipation, almost causing the viewer to yell at the screen 'What theÂ…?' Gone Girl is situation horror at its finest. While unlikely to happen to us, Flynn has devised a plot that is plausible enough to scare the heck out of us and Fincher takes the situation and pummels us with it so that we feel utterly powerless. My cinema viewing has taken a hit in the past few months (paying the rent while publishing a book can do that to you) and it was fantastic to find myself completely immersed in a film again.The resurrection of Ben Affleck is complete. After the dark years of Beniffer, Holywoodland reassured the few who watched it, The Town and Argo stamped his credibility across the globe and Gone Girl places him firmly back in the A-list of leading men. It is a creditable performance as a man lost in the quagmire of hidden truths, dark lies and bending under the weight of judgment and persecution from the police, the public, the media and even his family.Whilst Rosamund Pike absolutely holds her own and her star is slowly ascending (after the likes of A Long Way Down, The World's End and Jack Reacher), I'm still not entirely sure about her performance. This is a better performance and a far better film the afore mentioned, but the variation in her Amy just isn't there. As her arc (told frequently in flashback) develops, so should our understanding of her but from their first meeting, at a party, I found myself asking what Nick saw in her. She doesn't come across as terribly genuine or particularly pleasant and yet Nick is bowled over by her.That said, as Gone Girl progresses and we see and learn more, Pike convinces more completely and her interaction with the obsessive old flame, Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), is enough to unnerve and, eventually, cause temporary revulsion.At a little under two and a half hours, Gone Girl flows rapidly and smoothly, consuming the minutes while it thoroughly engrosses the viewer. It was one of the most imaginative novels of 2012 and is sure to be regarded as one of the most enthralling films of this year.But perhaps think twice before taking your spouse. S/he just might get ideas.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,0,6,16 October 2014
Django Unchained," Fabulously fun frolic, stunning imagery & a bucketful of belly laughs.
","It's been said that Quentin Tarantino has lost his edge, and the evidence of Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds supports that. But that doesn't mean he's making poor films now. I may look a fool in a couple of days but I predict Django Unchained will pick up two Oscars tomorrow night: Best Original Screenplay for Quentin Tarantino and Best Supporting Actor for Christoph Waltz.It isn't classic Tarantino and it's far from a great movie, but it has elements of classic Tarantino and is a fabulously fun frolic with some stunning imagery and a bucketful of belly laughs. The dialogue is mostly sharp, frequently funny and largely eschews the trademark (and tedious) irrelevant soliloquies and it dances with as much action as the visual fights and explosions around it.The principal issue is that Django Unchained is just too long. The 165-minute running time isn't an issue per se, but it has far too many potential climaxes and doesn't know which one to take. More than that, Django Unchained isn't quite sure what type of film it is and has too many slapstick moments and odd scenes that change the direction of the genre without committing fully. Clearly Mr T set out to make a great film but perhaps the danger of having his level of success is that producers are afraid to step in when he veers away from great storytelling and into the danger zone of personal whims.Waltz, as the dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, Dr King Schultz, who buys Django (Jamie Foxx) his freedom from slavery is superb. He finds the right balance between sincerity and humour to be entirely compelling on the screen and some many of the funniest moments come courtesy of his brilliant delivery. Schultz is a more stable and reserved character than the Inglourious Basterds' Col Hans Landa but he is even more watchable because of it and Waltz seems to have cornered the market in gently off-kilter nut jobs.Foxx, playing against type in perhaps his most memorable role since Ray, is a joy to watch from the moment he arrives on screen looking like Darnell from My Name is Earl through to his transmogrification into the free man consumed with violent, bloody revenge as he searches for his wife. He duels with humour and steely anger with equal aplomb and is every part the leading man, though he would be little without Waltz by his side.Both Leonardo DiCaprio, as Calvin Candie, the plantation owner who owns Django's wife, and Samuel L. Jackson, as Stephen, his slave-cum-butler, have a good go at stealing the film and both bite great chunks out of the scenery in their contrasting roles. DiCaprio plays nasty in a cruel, vindictive kind of way and has surely shaken off the pretty boy days of Titanic now, but it is Jackson who has the most indelible effect on us, though that may not be always for the best reasons. Yes, he gives us enough to know that Stephen is as unpleasant as his is funny, but too often his antics as the old slave wander into the world of pantomime and needless slapstick.Tarantino isn't always generous to his actresses, though he has given us some great female characters. Broomhilda, wife of Django, is no Jackie Brown but Kerry Washington plays her with depth and compassion. She is the beauty, the sincerity and the reason for Django Unchained and as such she carries the weight without fault. While Tarantino serves us up plenty of horror, it is Washington that gives us reason to pause and contemplate the harsh inequalities of life in the deep south of America before the civil war.Musically, Tarantino is usually on the button, but here he again seems confused with the effect he wishes to create and, whereas Plunkett & Macleane placed modern music in a period film to clever effect, in Django Unchained there are times it jars. The music is inconsistent and occasionally pulls us in the opposite direction to the action. It isn't a reason not to watch this, but at times it just feels wrong.Tarantino's greatest skill is in the overall feel and effect of his films and, in his third collaboration with DoP Robert Richardson, he is bang on the money with most of his shots. Django Unchained isn't merely sprinkled with great shots, it's littered with them. Tarantino does spectacle well and here he is in overdrive. Heads explode, bodies erupt with geysers of blood, limbs audibly splinter and, in a moment of pure beauty, cotton plants turn into swabs as another demolished body sprays claret the full length of them. Stunning.Stunning, funny and beautiful. Just too damn long! For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,2,6,25 February 2013
The Theory of Everything," Fine performances in a good biopic that can't match the brilliance of its subject.
","Arriving amongst much fanfare and hype surrounding possible Oscar nominations and a predicted avalanche of gold, The Theory of Everything set a lofty benchmark for itself and expectations were incredibly high prior to the screening.So did it meet those expectations? The short answer is 'No', but that doesn't mean it is a poor film, only that those anticipating perfection and something truly outstanding will feel a little disappointed.There are few in the western world who are not aware of Professor Stephen Hawking and the impact he had on the scientific world with his multi-million-selling book, A Brief History of Time, even if they know little about his own history or that of his wife and support, Jane. If nothing else, Professor Hawking has touched the lives of the ignorant masses (and I count myself amongst them) through his omnipresence in contemporary entertainment such as Pink Floyd's Keep Talking, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Futurama, The Big Bang Theory, The SimpsonsÂ…The Theory of Everything is a classic biopic prÃ©cising the remarkable life of a modern genius from his academic career at Cambridge, through the onset and development of his life-defining motor neuron disease (or more specifically, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis aka Lou Gehrig's disease) and his personal relationships with Mary, their children and the staff and students at Cambridge.A glance through Hawking's achievements makes it abundantly clear that a detailed analysis of his life would be both too long and excruciatingly dull for most of us, and so director James Marsh (Man on Wire, Project Nim) has sifted the sparkling elements to forge a film that enthralls and delights whilst, apparently, remaining largely faithful for the source material, Jane Hawking's book, Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The two central performances are, indeed, outstanding. Eddie Redmayne is on a career high as Hawking with an empathetic turn that pours anguish and steely determination onto the screen filtered through a gauze of classic 'Englishness'. It is a performance that it is impossible not to admire for the control and subtlety in portraying such a pronounced disability and if 2011's My Week with Marilyn suggested stardom, The Theory of Everything pretty much confirms it.As his wife, Mary, Felicity Jones is equally absorbing and commands the screen every bit as much as Redmayne. Come award season, though both may land Oscar nominations, I predict a greater chance of success for Jones in the Best Supporting Actress category than for Redmayne as he, surely, jostles with Michael Keaton and Steve Carell.Though The Theory of Everything is an extremely good film with some fine performances throughout, there is nothing remarkable, nothing that grabs the viewer by the throat, forces tears or leaves one wanting more or repeat viewings. It is another very good film that, come year's end, the viewer will vaguely recall seeing and enjoying but about which is unable to remember specifics. There is nothing really obvious to point at and say 'Oh dearÂ…' about; it's just that there isn't enough, it lacks that extra fire in its belly that the fanfare promised.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,0,0,5 January 2015
Frozen," Amiable Disney flick that will entertain most.
","Inspired by (rather than adapted from) Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, Disney's latest offering, Frozen, is a light, amiable singsong through the ice and snow that will entertain most, delight the young and eventually fall into place behind The Lion King, Aladdin and numerous other classics in the Disney catalogue. Princesses Anna and Elsa are as close as good fairytale sisters can be until Anna inadvertently unleashes her ice power upon her younger sibling and almost kills her. Her parents decide the best way to prevent it happening again is to hide Anna from the world, and prevent her from seeing Elsa by locking her in her room. Their parents die some time later, the isolation continues, much to the dismay of Elsa, until the decision is made to open the gates to the world for Anna's coronation. In a bout of misunderstanding, Anna (Kristen Bell) almost terminates Elsa (Idina Menzel) again, horrifies the townsfolk and takes to the hills. Elsa recruits reluctant ice salesman Kristoff (Jonathon Groff) and his trusty reindeer, Sven, and aims to bring her back to end the winter that has sprung up in her wake.Frozen has the feel of a musical (Ã  la Les MisÃ©rables) rather than a comedy film with songs (The Muppets) inasmuch as the songs aren't used as condiments to the meal but as principal ingredients, and there is a danger of this wrenching the viewer out of the film instead of propelling them along with it. Most of the songs very quickly fade in the memory and, with a solitary exception, I cannot name a single one less than a day after the event. The exception, however, is the mighty fine (and, I predict, the soon to be Oscar-winning) Let It Go. In a film that lacks magic, this is the sequence that makes the ice truly sparkle and stands out as the moment Frozen becomes a film worth watching. In the transformation of Anna as dejected queen into icy vamp, she firmly supplants Ariel as the most fanciable animated character on the big screen.The animation in this sequence also comes alive. From the opening scenes of water and ice being cut into blocks, the backdrops are the stars of Frozen but in the latter part of Let It Go, the character animators finally hit their strides and we are given a character that is as watchable and complete as the scenery.Disney has, in the past, become a byword for schmaltz and sanitized stories. Take another look at Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame for stories that have been watered down for delicate audiences. Here, again, Disney holds back on the trauma and, whereas in Bambi we were left in no doubt as to the fate of his mother, here it is almost a suggestion and glossed over quickly. So much of Frozen feels like a trip of shortcuts when it should be a journey of adventure, false turns and new avenues.Frozen also suffers from the lack of a bona fide villain. Yes, the Duke of Wesleton (Alan Tudyk) has his moments and for an awful moment it looks as though Anna may transmogrify into something evil but there is nothing we can really sink our teeth into. The comedy character, Olaf (Josh Gad), the snowman, adds some comedy variation but even he is amusing rather than outright funny.Frozen is a sweet, easy fairytale that will distract your children from killing each other one rainy Saturday and most Disney animations are worth having on the DVD shelf eventually. But therein rests the issue: this is a Disney film and not a Pixar event.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,3,6,12 February 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Dull, but for Iceland, Greenland & Sean Penn!
","It wasn't an auspicious start for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty in my life. With the screening due to start, the lights remained on and the screen remained black. For almost an hour. Then, when Ben Stiller's fifth feature as director finally started, the quality was so unbelievably, um, unwatchable (it appeared to have been bleached and mashed through a cheese grater), that approximately 95% of the attendees for the advanced screening walked out en masse. The hardcore ten or so remained, the film faltered, the lights came up, staff wandered aimlessly around the auditorium and finally, almost 90 minutes late, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was reborn.Was it worth the wait? Hmmm.It bears little resemblance it the 1947 original, starring Danny Kaye and adapted from James Thurber's short story, although modernization of such an old story is often essential. More distressingly, it lacks the magic and fun of the original.Walter Mitty (Stiller) is an anonymous worker cataloguing photographs at Life magazine and dreaming his dull life away; the scenarios that whizz around his brain being infinitely more exciting than his mundane reality. As Life prepares to publish its final print edition, Mitty clashes with his villainous new boss (Adam Scott), longs wistfully for the attention of co-worker, Cheryl (Kristen Whig) and looses one frame of a roll of film sent by legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), prompting Mitty to improvise quickly.It's a great idea poorly realized. There are sparkles to attract the attention (the opening titles on noticeboards etc.) and occasional, smile-inducing subtle humour. But mostly The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is dull. Predictable and dull. Long, predictable and dull. Long, predictable and dull but with some beautiful scenery. The film reinforces my desire to visit both Iceland and Greenland and, yes, I want to experience many of the situations that Mitty finds himself in, in reality. Who wouldn't? That's where The Secret Life of Walter Mitty works.But mostly it's dull.When, at long last, Sean Penn wanders into the screen, or, rather, the camera finds him, the film blossoms. It evolves into an entirely different film of depth, joy and beauty. And when the camera has finished with him, guess what? It becomes dull. Lost, perhaps.There are a few 'action' sequences but they bubble along rather than flood, gush and hurl. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a film of almosts. It almost works, it almost entertains, it almost finds a funny boneÂ… Whig does a reasonable job with a small supporting role and Stiller is a step above his Zoolander level but, scenery aside, the star worth watching is Penn. Find the DVD, fast forward to his scenes and quit once he's moved on. It won't take a genius to fill in the gaps. Like the protagonist, your imagination is almost certainly more colourful than the reality.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,11,25,3 December 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Can you imagine Bond without James Bond? Or Batman without Batman?
","Can you imagine Bond without James Bond? Or Batman without Batman? How about The Bourne Legacy without Jason Bourne? How about The Bourne Legacy without the quality, impact, intelligence or lasting impression of the original Bourne trilogy? How can it be Bourne without Bourne? How can it lack so much when the writer/director, Tony Gilmore, wrote the previous three Bournes? Let's start with the tagline: There was never just one. We already know that. Well, those of us who watched the trilogy, witnessed numerous Operation Treadstone agents attempt to kill Jason Bourne in Identity and then the uncovering of Blackbriar in Ultimatum. Didn't Gilmore read his work as preparation before milking the cash cow once again? Robert Ludlum must be rotating wildly in his grave.The Bourne Legacy apparently expands Ludlum's universe and portrays the debacle that is Operation Outcome, following the exploits of Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) while the CIA is doing its utmost to bump off Bourne and sweep the increasing pile of doo-doo under the rug. One of the big cheeses decides everyone in Operation Outcome should die (dÃ©jÃ  vu, anyone?) and so Cross goes on the run, picks up scientist babe Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who has just survived a massacre in the laboratory, and proceeds to kill lots of bad people with fists, feet, kitchen utensils and, probably, rolled up magazines.It's pretty much what you watched across the real Bourne films but with substantially less clarity. The Bourne Legacy is a noisy, messy, cluttered film that resembles the almost-flawless trilogy and mimics it frequently (the opening scene sees Cross floating in water, stationary, before swimming down to the depths â€“ it doesn't make sense but get used to it) without saying anything new or creating its own identity.Post-film, I couldn't even remember the name of the protagonist and had to check IMDb to find out who the Bourne-copy was. While images of the original three films are still strong in my mind, I can only recall a general blur of chases, fights and explosions from The Bourne Legacy and don't really care.The cast are adequate, there are numerous role reprisals and some (Paddy Considine most obviously) will have been paid again without having to set foot on set. Renner is a rising star and deservedly so and Weisz is always watchable whether giving us award-winning sincerity (The Constant Gardener) or visual bubblegum (The Mummy). But that isn't enough.The Bourne Legacy is fun, it is disposable and it filled a couple of hours one Sunday night, but no matter how exciting it is, no matter how good an actor Renner and Weisz are, this isn't Bourne.When The Bourne Identity crashed onto our screens in 2002, reviewers went wild declaring 'It out Bonds Bond'. Then came Casino Royale and there was no more talk about it. Nobody is making those claims about The Bourne Legacy. Maybe they've already seen the trailer for Skyfall.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",5,5,11,10 September 2012
Lincoln," A powerful, riveting film with an Oscar-baiting performance at its centre.
","Ask the ordinary bloke in the street to tell you something about Abraham Lincoln (one that isn't an American who learnt about him at school), and he'll probably mutter something about the Gettysburg Address, his assassination at the theatre and the battle to pass the 13th Amendment to end slavery. Two of those momentous events are only lightly dealt with in Spielberg's epic, and that immediately sets him apart from other directors and Lincoln from most biopics.Where other directors skim through the highlights of a subject's life in a moving scrapbook, The Iron Lady being a prime example, Spielberg has focused on a few short months in the 16th President's second term with intense detail and little action to sidetrack the viewer from the issues at hand. We might expect the Gettysburg Address, but Spielberg settles for giving us just a hint of the power and the effect it had on the American citizens in the 1860s. Instead, the focus of Lincoln is the debating, heckling, arguing and frustration in the House of Representatives and the resulting vote.Yes, Lincoln is a film where little more than talking occurs. And it is absolutely riveting because of it.But Spielberg doesn't patronise us with a stilted history lesson. Our ignorance is our own fault, not his duty to rectify, and it is a rare pleasure to be left to work it out rather than given a paint-by-numbers lecture. I found the final vote unexpectedly emotional and tense, despite history telling us the result. But it shouldn't be surprising that the director who made a man driving a car, in Duel, a nail-biting affair should make a vote such a thrilling event.We see democracy at work, we witness the struggle to achieve one of the greatest moments in a great country's history and it isn't always pretty. Honest Abe, though a hero and a truly great man, was clearly not above manipulation, bribery and threats to achieve what was right and just. In Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal we see a man who wouldn't, and didn't, take no for an answer: 'I am the president of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me those votes!' We don't accurately know what Lincoln sounded like but from now on he sounded like Day-Lewis. His performance is as measured as we have come to expect from the ultimate Method actor. He is always controlled, restrained, whether contending with his bleating, unstable wife, Mary (Sally Fields), or laying beside his sleeping younger son to kiss him, his movements and speech are deliberate and precise. This is a man who, though anger at injustice bubbles within him, is not reactive but always considered. There is very good reason why the smart money is on Day-Lewis to collect his third Oscar.Likewise, Fields powerful presence as the wife who is patient and strong for her Presidential husband, while frequently being a thorn in his side, is one that quietly demands plaudits. She remonstrates with him over their older son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who wants dearly to join the ranks of the soldiers fighting the Civil War and who cannot earn his father's blessing or kind attention, and she delivers an ultimatum that makes even the most powerful man in the world stop for a moment to appreciate the gravity of the situation.Yet again (after my comments in The Sessions review), Lincoln is a film that benefits hugely from a fantastic ensemble and it is perhaps unfair to highlight one performer from the supporting actors that include David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, John Hawkes and James Spader. They bring humour and variety to what is a very intense film, but none of them is merely a foil for Day-Lewis to play off. Tommy Lee Jones, as the irascible Thaddeus Stevens, transcends his usual crusty persona as a man that made others quiver in his presence, an attribute Jones knows all too well, and the actions of the man, as well as the performance of the actor, stay in the mind long after the film has ended.Lincoln is a fine film. It is a detailed, thrilling film that excites and enthralls because of its intensity and not for its action. It is a film that will stand out as one of the best of the year and will earn a great many awards before the season is over. But it isn't for everyone, as was proved by the two teenage girls who grumbled loudly throughout, 'God, this is sooo boring...', but lacked the intelligence to stand up and leave.But for those who appreciate Spielberg as much for Munich as for ET, I'll give the final word to one of my companions for the evening, a man who refuses to listen to reason and believes Daniel Day-Lewis is a most overrated actor: 'I only remembered I was watching Daniel Day-Lewis in the last ten minutes and I have never wanted to applaud a performance in the cinema before tonight.'For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",10,0,3,27 January 2013
Brave," Exquisite scenery, shame about the plot.
","There are certain unwritten rules by which we all abide and one of those seems to be that it is entirely unacceptable to dislike a Pixar film. Fortunately, Brave is likable.I didn't say it's brilliant, just likable.Much has been said about Brave being the first Pixar film with a female protagonist but that is far from being the reason to see it. Back in 1995 we marveled at the uniqueness of Toy Story and how new benchmarks had been set in much the same way as with Spielberg's Jurassic Park. Then, in 2001, we raved at how far Pixar had advanced and delighted in the movement of Sulley's hair. Today, I gawped at the vast screen and was stunned, amazed at the almost photo-reality of the Scottish scenery. Lochs, mountains, glens and clouds filled the screen as the camera glided across the Highlands so perfectly defined that the panoramas could almost have been lifted from a documentary.I have nothing but the highest praise for the scenery, the backgrounds of Brave. What troubles me is that that is what was foremost in my mind after 100 minutes of animated magic.It's not a bad film, not by a very long way, but it is weak. The plot is simpler than implied by the trailer (Princess Merida takes umbrage at her parents' plans for her betrothal to one of three clan chief's sons and heads off into the woods with a scheme that, naturally, goes awry) and has but a single strand. There are no great subplots, no great surprises, no great laughs, no great scaresÂ… It weaves along happily with some pleasant touches, a few smiles and a couple of cute episodes but there's nothing really about Brave that stands out. There are no jaw-dropping scenes, no standout moments to talk about later (WALL-E keeping the box but discarding the ring, Buzz Lightyear actually flying...) and no memorable quotes with which to entertain over dinner.There are plenty of adequate vocal performances: Kelly Macdonald gives life and emotion to Princess Merida while Billy Connolly obviously relishes his latest animated role and a fine supporting cast, led by Julie Walters and Robbie Coltrane, make the most of their expanded cameos without being particularly memorable. The surprise amongst the cast is Emma Thompson as Princess Merida mother, Elinor. Her vocals, in my distinctly English ears, were perfect but, in much the same way it was baffling why Mike Myers played Shrek as Ewan McGregor instead of casting Ewan McGregor in the first place, it seems a little odd that Thompson was cast instead of, say, Blythe Duff or, oh, umÂ… Maybe that's why. Surely there must be more Scots actresses.For those south of the Hadrian's Wall, there is still a week or so of summer holidays and this is almost certainly the best of the pick if you have a(nother) rainy day and stir-crazy children, but I can't help thinking there'll be far more memorable and entertaining cinema outings in the autumn with the arrival of Tim Burton's Frankenweenie, Rise of the Guardians and even Paranorman.In five years time when you find yourself reviewing Pixar's finest moments, I suspect Brave will not immediately come to mind. Certainly, it will rank above Robots and Cars 2, but it falls a long way short of Monsters Inc., WALL-E and Toy Story. But at least the scenery was attractive.",5,0,5,30 August 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun, funny, fantastic. Marvel's best to date? Bring on the sequel!
","I'm bored of superhero films. There are so many of them and so little that is original within them. I loved what Nolan did with his near-perfect Dark Knight reboot, I've thoroughly enjoyed the Iron Man series thus far, the third installment being a particular high, and Andrew Garfield succeeded in making The Amazing Spider-Man his own. Beyond that? I've almost stopped bothering. Ho hum.And then came Guardians of the Galaxy.I knew nothing about this series of comic books. I hadn't read them. I hadn't even heard of them. The trailer amused me, the concept intrigued me and last night James Gunn's third full feature as director added the sweetest cherry to a very fine cake of a day. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 can't come soon enough for me! Guardians of the Galaxy opens with the young Peter Quill watching his mother die of cancer before escaping the morbid hospital scene only to be whisked into space by aliens. Fast-forward a few years and the adult Quill (Chris Pratt) aka Star Lord steals a mysterious orb much to the chagrin of Korath (Djimon Hounsou). Quill finds himself the subject of a manhunt and is thrown together with a tree (Groot - Vin Diesel), a green girl (Gamora â€“ Zoe Saldana), an oaf who takes everything literally (Drax â€“ Dave Bautista) and a Racoon (Rocket â€“ Bradley Cooper). Together they form the Guardians of the Galaxy as they bid to evade Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), stay alive and, oh, save the universe.Guardians of the Galaxy is silly, funny, rapidly paced and an absolute ball. Gunn's writing and direction are filled with energy so that, whilst there is a formula to the proceedings, it is thoroughly enjoyable and demands a second trip to see it in the next week or so. I'll even forgive him for his segment in the execrable Movie 43.There is little need for thought and no effort required for emotional attachment to the characters; they are so beautifully written that one engages with them from the off and delights in every second spent in their company. Guardians of the Galaxy is an exciting, enticing and very funny. The standing jokes are not over-egged and on the occasions where one can guess the outcome of a particular mishap, the result is entirely satisfying.The costumes, production design and CGI meld seamlessly to make Guardians of the Galaxy as visually pleasing as it is exciting. Everywhere there is colour, shape and sparkle and when we reach the domain of The Collector (Benicio del Toro) it is such a visual feast of quirks, curios and filmic references that the lack of a pause button in the cinema is a frustration. As for Glenn Close's Nova Prime, she might easily have stepped out of The Hunger Games' District 1. Fabulous! Fun, funny and fantastic. It's rare that I say this, but bring on the sequel!",8,6,11,5 August 2014
Evil Dead," Hold on to your intestines; something very bad is about to happen.
","It's been a while since I saw a genuine horror film (I'm glossing over American Mary, which was horrific for all the wrong reasons), the previous one being last year's superb Sinister, a film that really got under the skin and made my drive home through the dark country lanes a great deal more unnerving then usual. The arrival of Evil Dead, a re-imagining of Sam Rami's 1981 classic, ensured I could put off the first fright of the year no longer. Shattered from a day of chopping wood, I wondered if it would engage or terrify sufficiently to prevent me from dropping off in the Cineworld darkness.No worries there! There's more reason to the plot of Fede Alvarez' update, with David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend, Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) arriving at a woodland cabin to offer moral support to his sister, Mia (Jane Levy), as she goes cold turkey under the supervision of her friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). They discover evidence of some very dark dealings in the basement and, while Mia is busy fighting her own demons, Eric discovers a book secured with barbed wire and bound in human skin, and unwittingly unleashes something very, very demonic indeed.Evil Dead isn't a film you watch in the hope of mind-blowing performances but, bar the occasional wooden moment, all five principals romp along perfectly convincingly and it doesn't seem right to single out one above the others. Compare the performances here with those in last year's teen blood-flick, Piranha 3DD, and you'll forgive the odd slip from this quintet. When the odd wince moment arrives (David doesn't know where his heart is, for instance), the splatter and gore more than make up for it.Alvarez, making a spectacular leap into Hollywood as both writer and director in his feature debut AND his first film foray in English, knows how to make bodily fluids spray horrifically. By the time the final credit rolls, we've seen just about every leakage the human body can produce and most at terrific velocity. Put it this way, it's gonna take one heck of a cleaner to sort this mess out! I'm ashamed to admit that I only got around to watching Raimi's original The Evil Dead a couple of months ago. The friend I watched it with informed me it was the first film to give him nightmares. Thirty-two years later and instead of frights it causes mild hysteria with the prosthetics and effects as rubbery as Bruce Campbell's acting. Alvarez, however, while keeping an eye on the original, has ramped up the horror and gore all the way to 11 and there are more occasions than I care to remember when I found myself pushing back in my seat to escape or half covering my face involuntarily.People talk flippantly about hairs standing up on the back of the neck, but Evil Dead manages to do just that. It isn't pant-wettingly terrifying but is far more than just 'scary'. Alvarez avoids the cheap shots of building the music and knocking over a vase only for it to be a cute kitten wandering innocently into the house. Here, when the tension builds, hold on to your intestines because something very bad is about to happen. Every time! The prosthetics and make-up are stunning and matched only by the physical effects. It's a tragedy in the making because, come March 2014, the Oscar for best makeup will probably be won by another 'serious' drama (Les MisÃ©rables in 2013, The Iron Lady in 2012 etc.) instead of by Patrick Baxter and his team for Evil Dead. Regardless, I don't think we'll see better amputations and disfigurements on the big screen this year.The biggest issue with Evil Dead is that it has too many endings and, until we reach the grand finale when the fat lady stops singing and disembowels herself instead, we know that each one is a false conclusion. It's an annoyance but it doesn't detract too much from the overall impact. Two warnings, though: Don't use this as a first date and empty yourself at both ends before you sit down to watch it.Perhaps the best summary of Evil Dead comes from my companion for the evening, Ben Mears (author of the Tyler May novels) who invented a new word for the occasion: 'What the hell did you make me sit through that for? It was s***ifying!' I don't know about you, but I'm going to sleep with my axe tonight! For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,4,17,3 May 2013
The Imitation Game," Cumberbatch enthrals as the brilliant, troubled man who shortened the war.
","There is a danger that, come February 2015, there may be three British men vying for the Best Actor Oscar. There is plenty of buzz surrounding Timothy Spall's Mr. Turner and Eddie Redmayne's performance in Professor Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything, and keeping them company is the ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch, star of The Imitation Game.With WWII raging and the Germans edging closer to victory, it was one thing seizing an Enigma machine but an entirely more challenging task cracking the code that changed daily. Mathematician, Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) was recruited by the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's code breaking centre. Heading a select team in Hut 8, while his aggrieved colleagues battled daily to crack each new configuration of the Enigma code, Turing was obsessed with creating Christopher, an innovative machine designed to think faster than even the team of brilliant cryptanalysts aiming to shorten the war.Based on truth, director Morten Tyldum's (Headhunters) film is incomplete as a biopic but draws the viewer in as a historical thriller where the enemy is time and the most visible battles, both literal and emotional, occur in a small hut with his colleagues and superior, Commander Dennsiton (Charles Dance). Turing's life is prÃ©cised and the impact of his life's work is only hinted at in the final summary. Turing accelerated the development of computers, he became a figurehead for the campaign for equality and the legalization of homosexuality, was instrumental in the shortening of the war and his reward was persecution, prosecution and a royal pardon almost sixty years after his apparent suicide.The Imitation Game cannot possibly do justice to his story but what Tyldum does beautifully is give an insight into the man, his daemons and proclivities, and a brief, intense and hugely significant chapter in his short life. The explosions in Turing's war occur in his mind, in his difficulty in relating to his colleagues, not least of all Hugh Alexander (Belle's Mathew Goode), and in the bustling hub of invention and cypher cracking.Graham Moore's screenplay, based upon Andrew Hodge's book, is a prodigious feature debut, cutting to the core of Turing's tortured mind and his platonic relationship with Joan Clark (Keira Knightly), the closest he is able to come to a friend. It would be easy to overcomplicate The Imitation Game with information and data or slip into a slanted portrayal that inevitably fails to right the wrongs a puritanical society did to Turing. Fortunately, Moore guides us instead through the excitement of the drama and the peripheral relationships that were mere fripperies compared to Turing's focus. We already know the outcome but, like Valkyrie, the conclusion matters less than the journey. It doesn't matter that history tells us the result, we're still gunning for Turing and his team.Cumberbatch is on superb form, opening the mind and soul to us of a man that many found difficult to like and few ever really understood. He is awkward, obsessed, a prisoner of his own mind and intellect but Cumberbatch still allows us to warm to him, to be excited for him and outraged when stubborn superiors and peers seek to attack and thwart his unorthodox brilliance.Knightly is something of a yo-yo actress, swinging between intense and enthralling performances (A Dangerous Method) and bland turns in forgettable films (Begin Again), but in The Imitation Game she delivers a fine supporting performance of sensitivity and strength. This is without doubt Cumberbatch's film but solid performances from Knightly, Goode and Dance add depth and variety to an involving story of an enthralling achievement by a remarkable man.Alan Turing: saviour of millions, creator of the computer, source of Benedict Cumberbatch's first Oscar? Maybe. Subject of a fine film that glimpses through the glass and demands a detailed accompanying documentary? Without doubt.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,4,9,25 November 2014
Prisoners," Enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, prompts inner rage & questions one's scruples.
","The trailer for Prisoners is yet another example of Hollywood giving far too much away. Usually it implies a poor film with the funniest/most shocking moments spliced together because the distributors know the film is substandard and are terrified the film will bomb. So why on earth did they feel the need to give away so much in the Prisoners trailer? Prisoners is just a few plot holes away from being a ten star film. It is enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, it prompts inner rage, it questions one's scruples, it is the cause of much thought and heated discussions. Prisoners is a very fine film indeed and the best thriller we've seen on the big screen for many months. The summer blockbuster period is officially over and cinema just got down and dirty again! Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello) and their children join friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving. After lunch the parents do their thing, the two older children escape to the basement and the two youngest, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) head out to the quiet road to play. When they don't return, abduction is assumed and panic and suspicion set in. The cops are called, headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the finger is pointed directly at Alex Jones (Paul Dano). When the police release Jones due to a complete lack of evidence, Keller declares him guilty and takes matters into his own hands.Prisoners kicks into full thriller mode from the outset. The tension is ramped up with finely directed early scenes and a subtle score (from JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson). Though it occasionally stutters, the obvious 'jump' in the basement failing miserably (fortunately!), it picks at the nerves for the full two-hour plus running time. It's not a film that makes the viewer leap out of one's skin, but niggles unpleasantly as it ask multiple questions: Is he/isn't he guilty? What happened? What does it mean? Does the end justify the means? How far is too far? What would YOU do to protect your children? Director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) has cleverly stitched together a film that is often too close to reality for comfort and looks at issues that fill our newspapers. Take the case of Keith Bennett, the Moors Murderers' fourth victim. His body was never recovered and his mother died without being able to bury her son. Given the opportunity, would she have been justified in having a week alone the Myra Hindley and Liam Brady to find the truth of his whereabouts? The ordeal suffered by Christopher Jefferies, vilified and proclaimed guilty by the press and public, simply for looking 'odd', is also too fresh in our minds to be ignored as we watch Jones' suffering. Subtler is the prospect of ambiguity; just as Derek Bentley was hanged for his equivocal cry of 'Let him have it!', does the alleged utterance from Jones, 'They only cried when I left them.' have only one interpretation? The performances throughout Prisoners are from the top drawer, and the actors have been gifted realistically written roles. The four parents have not merely been crafted to satisfy a particular stereotypical reaction, rather we are presented with understandable reactions. In Keller it is a desperate rage at his own impotence to protect his family and Jackman is flawless in his violence and despair. His actions are never acceptable but the way Keller is written and performed allows us to care deeply and consequently I'm sure there are many, many viewers who would turn a blind eye or even outwardly condone his methods.Though Jackman's Keller is the showier role here, Howard gives a very measured performance as the other father who has a firmer grasp of his morals though still floundering at the loss of his daughter. Equally, Bello's Grace is perhaps even easier to identify with as she crumples and enters a voluntary stasis, unable even to shower and change let alone control her emotions. Bello depicts a mother so distraught her ability to function abandons her.Davis is short changed; her Nancy brings a steely decisiveness to the table but she is given too little screen time for us to fully engage with. Gyllenhaal is the solid character in Prisoners that we can look to for balance. We don't really see what makes him tick but that is a plus point here; how many detectives arrive on the scene with the life stories laid out for us? Loki is there to do a job, solve a crime and remain as emotionally detached as possible. It is a creditable performance to add to Gyllenhaal's every-growing list.Unsurprisingly, Dano is excellent as the 'freak' who clearly 'must' be dangerous simply by dint of looking odd and being educationally subnormal. Dano has few peers in Hollywood and has cornered the market in oddball roles and there's a very good reason why: He's superb. Likewise, Melissa Leo as Jones' aunt, Holly, is perfect. Leo is a true chameleon of the screen. Enough said. Just watch her.Post-film, my companion for the evening and I debated heatedly the moral issues and how many parents may stoop to such extreme measures given cause. We agreed to differ though the questions remain. Our agreement was entire regarding the quality of Prisoners as a film, however. I can't mention the flaws without destroying the film but there are unresolved matters, unrealistic scenarios and lazy devices that keep Prisoners short of perfection. But it remains a very powerful film that, if it's intention is to leave the viewer wondering what kind of man/woman they are, succeeds admirably.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,1,2,24 September 2013
Hotel Transylvania," Fun but not really funny, enjoyable but not enthralling, merely an appetizer for Frankenweenie.
","Today my ten-year-old niece overruled me. Her treat, her call and Hotel Transylvania won the duel over Frankenweenie. Oh well, she'll learn and Burton's latest will earn a review later in the week.Hotel Transylvania is the latest in the current wave of kiddie horrors and certainly better than last month's Paranorman, but let's hope it isn't as good as it gets.Following the death of his wife, Dracula (Adam Sandler) creates his Hotel Transylvania as a resort where monsters can holiday safe from the intrusion of nasty humans and where he can ensure his daughter, Mavis (Selina Gomez), can spend her life under his (over) protection. Fast forward a century and a bit to her one hundred and eighteenth birthday and all of Dad's friends arrive for the 118th time to celebrate. Daddy Drac is trying to organize the same party he's staged for the past century and Mavis is monumentally cheesed off by feeling trapped when the door opens and in stumbles Jonathan (Andy Samberg), the kind of human your father would groan at and your mother would pity if you brought home.There follows 90 odd minutes of Dracula's ineptitude, Jonathan's geekiness, Mavis' frustration and a predictable meeting of minds (of sorts). Oh, and love might be in the air. While Hotel Transylvania flows fairly smoothly and it entertains, it never really hits any great heights and the final act is tied up rather too neatly, obviously and without imagination. Whereas animation was once the domain of Disney, Pixar appears to own it now (and, yes, they are now part of Walt's company) but Sony Pictures Animation is trying hard to catch them. Their highpoints, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Aardman's The Pirates! In an Adventure With Scientists!, fall short of the brilliance of Pixar's WALL.E and Monsters Inc. but Hotel Transylvania is a definite step forward.While none of the voices stand out in the way Robin Williams did in Aladdin, all are suited to their characters and nothing jars, though no-one makes the ears tingle. That said, any film is improved by the presence of the put-upon Steve Buscemi, in this instance playing werewolf Wayne, long-suffering father to an anarchic brood too numerous to count.Whilst the belly laughs are non-existent, there is a real joy to be had from watching the disparate crew of monsters dancing and performing water aerobics, the animation is expressive and detailed and, overall, Hotel Transylvania is a very enjoyable, if unremarkable viewing experience, although the biggest smile of the film occurred when, upon the date appearing on the screen in the prologue, my niece whispered, 'Uncle Yed, were you born in 1895?' Her verdict? 8 out of 10. I'm going to downgrade it to six because it could have been so much more. And it really, really annoys me that writers Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel don't know that Frankenstein was the human and NOT THE $%^*&!!! CREATURE!!!!

Elysium," District 9 on steroids. Max action, minimal social comment, good entertainment.
","In 2054 the super rich have abandoned Earth for a space station of opulence, Elysium. Earth is now the domain of the poor, unhealthy dregs of humankind who serve the industrial needs of the Elysium privileged but are never likely to receive invitations to champagne-fuelled soirÃ©es. Like an extreme version of the American dream, those on Earth stare up at the sky and dream of a citizenship chip in their arm that will give them entry to a society where life is perfect and illnesses are cured by a few seconds in a 'med pod'.Max (Matt Damon) is a factory worker who is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. The computer calmly informs him he has just days to live so Max agrees to embark on a mission for black marketer Spider (Wagner Moura) accompanied by his friend, Julio (Diego Luna) with a pass to Elysium his payment. Up on the space station, however, Secretary of Homeland Security Delacourt Rhodes (Jodie Foster) has no intention of allowing the mission to succeed and brings in her violent secret police forces, led by Agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley).The immediate comparison to be made with Elysium is with writer/director Neill Blomkamp's feature debut, District 9. Elysium has the same initial 'look' to it with a rotting, corrupt and uninviting futuristic Earth and massive social issues that reflect the troubles of our world today. Blomkamp's work looks largely at inequality and injustice though a sci-fi avenue. His next offering, 2015's Chappie (based on his short film Tetra Vaal and again staring Copley) looks likely to follow the trend, at least in the sci-fi crime aspect. But Elysium is to District 9 what Aliens is Alien. He has moved from thought-provoking human study set against a particular backdrop, to full on action thriller that is more about weaponry and spectacle than surprise.But that's no criticism in itself. I loved Aliens. It's just a different type of film than Ridley Scott's original. Elysium is a good film. It's a fun and engaging film. It's just important to know from the outset there are no surprises, it's formulaic and pure entertainment using social comment as an excuse rather than it's raison d'Ãªtre.Damon further flexes his muscles as the intelligent action hero, ably assisted by good-looking sidekick, to selflessly take on the two-dimensional evil, arrogant villain. In her role, Foster is a joy to watch. It's rare we are permitted to watch her chomp scenery and get down and dirty with people's lives. Her Rhodes is deliciously conniving. She is the power-hungry bitch you can't help enjoying while looking forward to her destructive end.Likewise, Copley is on overdrive here, dosing up his District 9 persona with a bucket load of steroids and going on the rampage. This isn't another performance of desperation and panic; in Elysium, his Agent Kruger is a gun-totting, black-hatted Wild West sheriff hurled forward in time a couple of hundred years and given access to weaponry bad sheriffs couldn't even dream of.Luna feels underused as Julio and perhaps the predictable thread of Max's childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), and her sick daughter could have been jettisoned in favour of a deeper relationship and screen time for these two characters.Enjoying District 9 is a fine starting point when approaching Elysium, but leave your expectations at the door. You'll see the conclusion almost from the moment the opening credits fade but it's still an enjoyable romp.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,0,2,2 September 2013
The Artist," Not all the hype is true.
","Unless you've been living in hole, you'll be very aware of The Artist. The principal issues that have been widely reported are as follows: It is a black and white silent French film about the silent Hollywood era, a fading star and a rising starlet, there's a cute dog, it is winning just about every award going and is hysterical, absolutely amazing and the must-see movie of the year.Not all of that is true, however. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is Hollywoodland's biggest heartthrob but the arrival of the talkies ends his career as the starlet he helped launch, Peppy Miller (BÃ©rÃ©nice Bejo) rises to prominence. He sulks and wallows in his self-pity, the big bad studio boss (John Goodman) sacks him and it becomes entirely predictable there on. Oh, and the dog has two tricks that it repeats ad nauseam.Yes, it is black and white. Yes, it is largely silent other than the music, a few moments of audio brilliance and the two French students who talked incessantly behind me. Yes, there were a few forced laughs when the Jack Russell did its thing but it felt as though the minority who did laugh felt as though they were supposed to. Yes, it is winning the majority of the awards, it swept the BAFTAs and is likely to do the same at the Oscars. But, no, it is not brilliant. I don't think it will even rank inside the top ten at the end of the year, bearing in mind we're only in February and it is already ranked lower than Tabloid, Shame, The Woman in Black and The Descendants in my chart. In 1997 Titanic swept the Oscars, taking eleven in total. It wasn't long before reason overtook hype and the world realized LA Confidential and Mrs Brown had been robbed. I'll give it two years before the world realizes the same is true this year of The Descendants and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy.There are some lovely touches, particularly when sound is introduced, and the stylized look of the film is perfectly crafted. There are some fine actors present, performing in a melodramatic style of the period, and the smiles and music make it thoroughly engaging but nice legs, a good dance and a wink at the camera do not a great film make.The Artist is good, nice, sweet, light and entertaining but that counts for little when the hype promises excellence, greatness and ground-breaking perfection. And if you want truly entertaining non-humans, The Muppets is a far better option.Another film review from The Squiss.

Sinister," Avoid the trailer, watch it cold & clench your buttocks. Or watch the trailer and have the experience spoilt.
","It was with great trepidation that I took my seat for Sinister. I often veer away from horror films, as frequently they tend to be less about chilling and more about shocking with gratuitous violence. No sensitivity required, just a strong stomach and a certain bloodlust. The likes of Hostel and the latter Saw gore-fests may have made mucho $$$ but were never going to trouble Oscar or satisfy a discerning audience in the way The Exorcist still manages.Oh, and I was clenching my buttocks even before the lights dimmed having read a fellow reviewer's comment: I have never heard a female audience member scream as loud as I heard last night...Oh, dear.Post event? Well, the midnight drive home through dark, winding country lanes wasn't the most fun I've had on my own but Sinister is nowhere near the terrifying experience that some would have you believe. If you've seen the trailer, you know what's going to happen, you'll know when the biggest shocks are coming and there is nothing left to be surprised by. If you haven't, I'd urge you to ignore the link above and go into Sinister blind and completely unprepared in order to benefit fully. When is Hollywood going to relearn the art of 'teasers' rather than feeding us 'show all the best bits' trailers that destroy the experience? Watching Sinister after viewing the trailer is akin to sitting through The Others when you know they are ghosts.Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a 'true-crime' writer whose success has dwindled. Close to financial ruin, he uproots his family and moves to a new home, neglecting to tell them it is the scene of the murders in his latest book. Oswalt then finds a Super 8 projector and spools of films in the attic. Spools of film that show grisly scenes. And then bad things happen. Very bad things.There is more than a whiff of Jack Torrance about Oswalt but that is almost inevitable given his career choice and location (author writing in a building with dark secrets). However, the hints of madness, the inner torture and the genuine fear with which Hawke imbues Oswalt are original and not lifted from another character. His determination that evolves into stubbornness, teeters on the edge of insanity and then tumbles into considered panic is real enough to feel from the safety of a cinema seat and highlights again the quality of Hawke. Perhaps true movie stardom has bypassed him but he consistently gives fine performances and is an actor who will paint multi-faceted characters for us to watch, admire and shy from for a great many years yet.The lack of impact from the supporting actors implies a heavy-handed editor or over-bearing producer. Juliet Rylance is given little to do as Oswalt's wife, Tracy, other than to react to his actions. Likewise, the children, Trevor and Ashley, feel as though there was more given to them that was consigned to the cutting room floor. Yes, they have an impact, they are important to the plot in their own ways but neither is allowed to develop fully. Upon arrival at the house, Oswalt verbally spars with the sheriff and we see the mutual contempt they feel for each other's roles but again, this left unexplored and the most we get is a cameo, that is almost humorous but never really effective, in the shape of a cop forever known as Deputy So-and-so.But, flaws aside, Sinister is a film of tension, a film that, given a dark room, no fore-warning and the right mindset, will really put the willies up you, not least of all for the soundtrack. The music frequently feels little more than moans, screeches and rhythmic noise that claws its way under the skin and scratches at the underside of your hair follicles.Inevitably, given the success of the Paranormal Activity series, writer/director Scott Derrickson (The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) has set Sinister up for both sequels and prequels. But with his next film an adaptation of Stephen King's The Breathing Method, it remains to be seen if he takes the easy money or leaves it to another b-lister on the rise. Regardless, Sinister is a film that currently belongs at the top of his CV.Now switch the light off, try to ignore the banging and creaking in the attic and sleep wellÂ…For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",7,0,0,23 October 2012
Jack Reacher," If this was based on Lee's 9th novel, how bad were the first eight?
","Back in 1997 Lee Child published his first Jack Reacher novel, Killing Floor. I read it, was mightily unimpressed (you'll love it if Dan Brown's literary prowess rocks your world) and forgot he existed. Then Lee made it big. Very big. He sold the rights to his ninth (were the first eight no good???) novel, One Shot, and the world went nuts over the casting of 5'7' Tom Cruise to play 6'5' giant Jack Reacher.Cruise's height is not an issue, so if you're a fan of the books quit your whinging. Cruise is a big enough star to fill Reacher's boots and the problems with this film have nothing to do with the actor's stature. It's just not a great film.If you're looking for light, easy, disposable entertainment that won't require you to engage your brain then Jack Reacher may suffice, if you've already watched Seven Psychopaths, Skyfall, Tower BlockÂ… I'm sure you catch my drift.Jack Reacher is a war veteran with no past, no driving licence and no way of tracking him. He's a shadow and he'll contact you if and when he wants to. When James Barr is accused of randomly shooting five pedestrians, he says simply 'Get Jack Reacher' and as DA Rodin (Richard Jenkins) and cop Emmerson (David Oyelowo) are attempting to work out why and how to do just that, in walksÂ… Jack Reacher. Over the next two hours or so he and prosecutor Helen (Rosamund Pike), who happens to be Rodin's daughter, attempt to prove Barr's guilt (or innocence, depending on which side you sit). While Helen attempts something vaguely resembling intelligent investigation, she recruits Reacher as her investigator and he favours the results gained by beating the crap out of people and we're supposed to believe he doesn't want to use such methods and is really a sincere, thoughtful bloke who wants to be left alone. It's about as convincing as James Bond being a secret agent but telling everyone who he is â€“ just a great deal less entertaining.It's plinky plonk filmmaking again; all rather predictable and convoluted and I rather lost interest part way through and opted instead to count how many times the bloke in front checked his mobile phone (eight times) and the man behind farted (only twice but they were truly horrendous). Earlier this year, Cruise gave us Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. It was far-fetched, well crafted and very entertaining in a way Jack Reacher cannot hope to attain. It's all so wooly, has little pace and lacks anything to really compel the viewer to engage with it.There are some fine touches including the stunt in the trailer where Reacher abandons the car and a sequence that establishes who, how and when each civilian was murdered, but at the heart of Christopher McQuarrie's second film as director (after The Way of the Gun) is a couple that has less on-screen chemistry than Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Cleopatra (i.e. not much!). If McQuarrie can't be bothered to hire a convincing actress or cast two stars that spark together, I can't be bothered to persuade you to watch his film.Why would you when there are so many others out there? It's been reported that McQuarrie, who also wrote Jack Reacher, and Cruise will reunite for Mission: Impossible 5. Let's hope it's the McQuarrie who won an Oscar for writing The Usual Suspects that turns up and not the one who gave us the worst Tom Cruise film this year.It's not awful. It's just not terribly good and, for all its flaws, Skyfall is by far the better option for simple entertainment that's still on general release.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",4,4,14,31 December 2012
Les MisÃ©rables," Perfect for aficiandi, endurance for all else. And apparently the French Revolution was fought by Cockneys!
","I'm not a big fan of musicals. I love the great rousing songs that lift the heart and prickle the hairs on the back of the neck, but I just can't get to grip with all those people singing dialogue instead of just talking. As I child I enjoyed the classics (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Sound of Music et al) on TV and ventured forth to the West End to relish Time and cringe at both Cats and, yes, Les MisÃ©rables. So what the heck, I hear you ask, was I playing at by going to see Les MisÃ©rables at the cinema? Um, (in a tiny voice) I was impressed by the trailerÂ… And there's my lesson for the day: Great trailers are not indications of great films! The trailer for Les MisÃ©rables is excellent. It provides us with a glimpse of the stunning sets, an introduction to the principal stars, sorry, characters, and excites with snippets of those famous rousing songs (you know the ones I mean) that do the prickly hair thing. The trouble is, they account for only about twenty minutes of the 157-minute running time, which is still five minutes shorter than the stage production.It's not a bad film, in fact it's more than adequate and has moments of being excellent but, my goodness, it goes on and on and onÂ… The opening sequence is a terribly clumsy mix of set and CGI in which an almost unrecognizable Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean pulls on a rope with a hundred other prisoners while glaring up at the disdainful Javert (Russell Crowe) and we understand the relationship between the two and get to grips with the history of the former. It's when we also discover that Crowe isn't a terribly good singer and get accustomed to hearing him strain himself as he attempts to warble masterfully. Perhaps he should return to gladiatorial school.Jackman owns the screen when he is emblazoned across it. His performance as the unfairly convicted man who finds good in the world when a priest refuses to shop him for theft is masterful. He sings powerfully and will surely take a Golden Globe tomorrow night for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. While his screen time with the standout Anne Hathaway as Fantine (I predict a Golden Globe and an Oscar) is brief, their scenes are amongst the most watchable. Hathaway's presence is sorely missed when she exits the film and her performance is saturated with heartfelt emotion. Director Tom Hooper shoots her I Dreamed a Dream sequence largely with a single shot and the wretchedness of the mother forced in to prostitution to support her daughter is palpable and deeply affecting. What a pity such emotion and high quality doesn't continue throughout the film.Eddie Redmayne, as Marius, continues his ascent of Hollywood but while he sings surprisingly well and he seems comfortable in the role, his impact is reduced by the ridiculousness of the plot. While most readers will know the story, for those odd one or who who don't, I shall refrain from pointing out quite how ridiculous the events are for fear of spoiling the film. If you don't know the story, just don't approach Les MisÃ©rables hoping for logic. The film is faithful to the play but that doesn't make the idiocy of certain characters' decisions any easier to deal with.Amanda Seyfried (as Cosette) carries much of the film but she is overshadowed by her rival for Marius' love by the Samantha Barks' Ã‰ponine. Barks has a screen presence Seyfried can only dream of and there is a sense of belief in her performance as opposed to Seyfried who lacks depth or passion.In all such films, there has to be a comedic turn or, if you're really 'lucky', a double act. With sour memories of The Dictator, I dreaded the appearance of Sacha Baron Cohen as ThÃ©nardier, the innkeeper, but he and Helena Bonham Carter waltz brashly through Les MisÃ©rables bring life and colour when it is most needed.Yes, Les MisÃ©rables looks good, the songs will engage, it will satisfy the die-hard musical aficiandi and it is clearly the best musical on the big screen at the moment (yes, I know it's the only one!) but why, when it is based in France is it performed largely by Kiwis, Aussies, Brits and Americans in every accent other than Gallic, the notable exception being Cohen? Since when did peasants in the French Revolution have Cockney accents? If you love musicals, and watch the stage version a million times, you'll love Les MisÃ©rables, but it isn't going to convert anybody to the musical cause and is an endurance rather than a great night out.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",5,1,5,14 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," A gritty reality beyond a filthy window we can't resist peeking through.
","That Zero Dark Thirty is a stunning, superb and at times deeply affecting film is common knowledge (if you keep even half and eye on the major award ceremonies) and to be expected, coming as it does from Kathryn Bigelow, the double Oscar-winning director of The Hurt Locker.For those living in a sack at the back of a cave who aren't aware of the events of 2 May 2011, Zero Dark Thirty depicts the elongated investigation, build up and execution of the events that led to the raid on Osama bin Laden's hideaway in Pakistan. How accurate it is may be open to some speculation but this is certainly no jingoistic propaganda flick in the vein of the god-awful Act of Valor. This is a brutal look at the impact America's stance had, and continues to have, on operatives, terrorists and suspects alike. It isn't always pleasant viewing and is, particularly at the beginning, nothing short of brutal.Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a novice CIA operative whose first job is with the team interrogating prisoners resulting from the aftermath of the Al Qaeda attacks of 9/11. When she observes her first waterboarding session, led by Dan (Jason Clarke), she is shocked and sickened, barely able to watch the barbaric act performed on one human by several others. The discomfort we feel is matched by that which she portrays initially and, as we settle into the difficult viewing experience, she settles into her new existence as, if not perpetrator, then at least agreeing witness to the torture.But this is where the audience seemed to separate into two camps. As the initial torture victim, Ammar (Reda Kateb in a harrowing performance), clutches a rare morsel of food and bottle of juice to his chest, fearful of losing it before he can down it, some seemed to shrug it off as deserved punishment and veered towards the impartiality that Maya displays. For some of us, though, Ammar's treatment was intolerable and his terror gnawed at our nerves while our heads filled with cries of contempt directed at America. The America that leads the fight against terror. At what cost perceived freedom? As Ammar is dragged around in a dog collar and leash, and examples of ever more extreme torture are further depicted, Dan repeats his mantra: 'When you lie to me I hurt you. ' No, Zero Dark Thirty should not be comfortable viewing. But while one camp in the audience squirmed, the other camp seemed to follow Maya's example as she watched, impotent and interested, as if learning. And that made for even more uncomfortable viewing.Bin Laden's capture may be the subject of this film, but Zero Dark Thirty is about the impact not of a military exercise but on the people involved; 'civilized' people who fight terror with extreme methods and the effect it has on their minds, bodies and souls. Bombs and gunfire await them behind every door and every corner, nowhere is safe and the erosion of their security eats into their lives.Dan is already damaged irreparably but even in him we see a flicker of humanity when that which he cares about is taken from him. In Maya, the soul destruction is almost too much to watch at times. She learns quickly, first dehumanizing herself then becoming confident in her work, but all the time her skin pales and she looks more drawn and lifeless. At the sharp end of her work, we realize her bosses have created a monster hardened beyond redemption and when the CIA director (James Gandolfini) barks 'Who are you?', he is met with 'I'm the motherf****r that found this place, Sir.' It's almost humorous but the look upon her boss' face is not merely anger but resignation; another soul lost.Chastain is a fine actress with an already impressive body of work that includes the unparalleled Take Shelter and the higher profiled The Help, but she has never been stronger than she is here. While Maya evokes anger and fear in her superiors and colleagues, Chastain causes our emotions to fray as our feelings towards Maya contort to follow her development. The character may not be easy to truly like in the end, but it is impossible not to regard the actress with the greatest admiration.Bigelow has structured Zero Dark Thirty beautifully and, whilst we never truly relax, we become at ease with the tension and attuned to the mumbled voices and dark images. It is strikingly shot and bleakly etched, no inscribed, on our minds. This is the dirty side of war where the battlefield has no boundaries and the rulebook has long been dispensed with.There is rarely any sense of mere drama, rather a gritty reality beyond a filth-streaked window through which we should not be peering but cannot resist. Mark Boal is a very serious contender for this week's Best Original Screenplay Oscar and it is no wonder. Never is the dialogue contrived. It is variously bitter and desperate; two adjectives that perhaps best describe the film as a whole.That some viewers emerge from the cinema celebrating the greatness of America and proclaiming how much they enjoy Zero Dark Thirty is disturbing. Certainly this is a film to celebrate but is it really an event to cause joy? Isn't that missing the point? Certainly the man needed to be captured, absolutely terrorism must be fought and extremists on every side of the fence must be dissuaded from heinous acts of violence, but our reaction to Zero Dark Thirty should be tempered with thoughts of whether the end always justifies the means. How can a film depicting torture and execution be enjoyed? However, my heartbeat increased when the go ahead was eventually given for the mission. Was that excitement? Hmmm.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",9,3,7,23 February 2013
12 Years a Slave," Exceptional, harrowing film. Not just a must see; a should see!
","Do we really need to see such vivid displays of barbaric abuse tantamount to torture in the 21st century? While educated humans still hate, judge and mistreat others for their sexual proclivities, gender, religion, class, physical appearance and race, then the answer is emphatically yes! Steve McQueen's third feature as director (after the lauded Hunger and Shame) is harrowing. Don't even think about entering the cinema if you're looking for entertainment or an easy ride. There are many fine films dealing with the issues of racial inequality and slavery (try Amistad or Django Unchained) but 12 Years a Slave is in another league and it's unlikely you'll emerge light of heart and dry of eye if there is even a nugget of justice and humanity inside you.12 Years a Slave, adapted from his autobiography, depicts the true story of Solomon Northop (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a husband, father and respected free man living in New York until 1841 when he is duped, kidnapped and sold into slavery by Theophilis Freeman (Paul Giamati) and bought by the comparatively kindhearted Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) before being passed on to the sadistic landowner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). For twelve years Solomon endures unimaginable violence and abuse that to merely survive requires a miracle of fortitude and fate.It is difficult to present any negative criticism of 12 Years a Slave without sounding petty. If there are any weaknesses, they are substantially drowned into submission by the deafening volume of all that is powerful upon the screen. At every turn there is excellence, in every blink a sound or image to not merely prick our conscience but to perforate it.McQueen has crafted a film that numbs as much as it wrenches. But whereas Mel Gibson set out to horrify us with his flaying of Christ's back in The Passion of the Christ but served only to sicken us with his gratuitousness, a similar scene in McQueen's sensitive hands is compelling. It is horrible and horrific but so carefully shot that we cannot look away because this is yet another part of the lesson we absolutely must acknowledge and comprehend. There is no sense of entertainment, only a reluctant presentation of the truth.But it isn't just in the physical displays of violence that McQueen shreds our comfort zone. His lingering shots that refuse to be hurried along hold our reluctant gaze, intensifying our discomfort. As Solomon dangles from a noose on tiptoe, battling to remain both upright and alive while fellow slaves play and toil around him, steadfastly refusing to be moved or involved, it is left to us to witness the barbarism. If Solomon cannot escape, why should we? The seemingly endless shots occasionally bring temporary comfort; the embers of a burning sheet of paper lingering, dancing silently, peacefully before the next scene shakes off our security blanket once more. Joe Walker's editing works symbiotically with McQueen's direction, juxtaposing contrasting emotions to ramp up our discomfort; as the peaceful scene of a Christian service unfolds with Ford preaching kindly to his workers, the soundtrack of the previous scene, Paul Dano's Tibeats tauntingly singing Run, N****r, Run, hangs over it like a poisonous cloud. We try to hear the kindness in Ford's words but the unbridled hatred of Tibeats' deny us peace yet again.McQueen sprinkles 12 Years a Slave with suggestions of compassion (a gift to Solomon from FordÂ…) but these are only hints of humanity from people too afraid, too cowardly to do something meaningful, and each hollow gesture is just another, subtler act of betrayal.It isn't much of a prophesy to say that this is certainly a career-changing and perhaps a career-defining performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor. He was reputedly reluctant to take the role, fearing he would not do it justice and would let those down who suffered Solomon's fate. He need not have worried. The memory of his eyes variously piercingly defiant or hollow with grief remain long after the final credits roll. There are others who have performed with the same honesty and intensity as him this award season, namely Robert Redford in All is Lost, but none will leave you feeling raw and ashamed to be the same species as Solomon's owners. I think the phrase you are searching for is tour de force.In his third film with McQueen, Fassbender plays Epps as a man who, in another life, might be Amon Goeth. Though Epps' actions are monstrous, Fassbender resists playing him simply as a monster, managing to portray his weaknesses and thoughtful reasoning as valid parts of him. In the moments when he refuses to give in to his hateful wife we see a man who has his own brand of goodness buried under his prejudice.Making her cinematic debut, Lupito Nyong'o as the object of Epps' attention, Patsey, gives a performance beyond that of many season stars. Again, it is a performance that leaves one feeling raw and bereft. 12 Years a Slave is complete because the cast enhance the emotion and intensity that McQueen creates around them and every scene lives because of the skill of the actors that fill them. Brad Pitt as the Canadian abolitionist, Bass, brings a welcome gentleness to the film but we, like Solomon, don't know if his words are genuine or the precursor to another betrayal.It is perhaps an understatement to say that 12 Years a Slave is a very, very powerful film. It is not just an exceptionally well-crafted film but an important one that leaves the viewer numb, tear-streaked, shaking and wondering if the biggest betrayal is not that we once behave so abominably but that in so many ways we still do.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",10,6,12,8 January 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Sci-fi D-Day meets Groundhog Day. Blunt & Cruise kick alien ass again and again and
","Mostly cinema should be about great entertainment. Sometimes it needs to be educational. But not today. Today is all about romping with guns and explosions and adventure and thrills with two fine stars and a generous portion of intelligence.The Edge of Tomorrow is essentially a futuristic D-Day thriller; it's a science fiction Groundhog Day with aliens, a Source Code with warfare instead of terrorism.Earth is losing the war with a hyper intelligent alien species and no military force seems capable of thwarting them. Humankind is doomed unless a miracle occurs. Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a soldier with no combat experience whose reward for p*****g off his superior is a reposting as cannon fodder from which he is not expected to return. He doesn't. Except he does. Kind of. Killed in minutes, Cage finds himself reliving the day, but with memories of each previous experience. He finds Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) who understands his unlikely 'gift' and together they must learn quicker than the aliens in order to win the war before time stops resetting.It's easy to take potshots at Cruise; he's just about the biggest movie star in the world, has been box office gold for 30 years and has the odd turkey to his name. But Cruise is a star for a very good reason and The Edge of Tomorrow more than makes up for last year's clunky Oblivion. This is an intelligent action thriller where Cruise doesn't merely fall back on his cheeky smile and winning screen persona, he gets down and dirty with the task of killing that which would destroy our planet. And what a fine job he does of it.The Edge of Tomorrow is clearly sold on Cruise's name. He's the star, the box office draw and the principal reason it was green lit. But the greatest joy here is that he almost plays second fiddle to Emily Blunt. And it works. Rita kicks Cage's ass, she absolutely rocks and is a gritty heroine who doesn't need the tight-fitting Lycra and a heaving bust of the Lara Croft-types Hollywood mostly serves up to capture our attention; shut up, watch and listen or she'll beat the crap out of you and leave you to pick up your own dismembered limbs. Cruise is the bigger name, but Blunt is the centerpiece of The Edge of Tomorrow and it's a refreshing change from the expected norm.Top marks, then, to screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Jez & John-Henry Butterworth for their gripping adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel, All You Need is Kill, that retains the brutality without ostracizing viewers with a leaning towards sit-back-and-relax action thrillers.Director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Jumper) is on his surest ground since Mr. & Mrs. Smith 2005 and ramps up the thrills, injecting them with humour that never detracts from the task at hand. There is a worrying moment when he puts Blunt in a 'look at me, I'm an action heroine' sequence in a battle rehearsal warehouse, but it is forgivable for being brief; Liman clearly respects his star and her ability to grip us firmly by the short and curlies without needing to resort to pseudo machismo and constant cleavage shots. And he respects his audience enough to realise we'll buy into our heroes, irrespective of gender, if their performance is strong. Neither lets him down and Liman reciprocates. Just, please god, resist the temptation from the men with the dollars in their eyes to fabricate a pointless, needless sequel.After my disappointment of the sure-fire hit that was X-Men: Days of Future Past, I approached The Edge of Tomorrow cautiously. I needn't have worried. Yes, it is fantasy. But this is science fiction and it's a movie, so stop your whinging about it not being realistic. It is, however, thrilling, exciting and the most fun I've had at the cinema I've had for a good few months.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,1,3,12 June 2014
Whiplash," Astounding, intense & damn near perfect!
","Wow! Just wow! A young drummer, Andrew (Miles Teller) enrolls at a prestigious music conservatory. Plucked from a rehearsal room, he is given the opportunity to play with the studio band under the tutelage of aggressively driven band leader Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a man with a vicious mouth, extreme methods and an obsession with driving his students way beyond breaking point in order to achieve their potential and find absolute perfection.Perhaps my greatest joy with Whiplash is that just a few weeks ago I was barely aware of its existence and deliberately knew little about it as I took my seat in the screening room. There is something very special about being blindsided without expectation, and blindsided I was. My screening companion and I felt exhausted by the end and were still discussing animatedly it an hour later.I knew I was in the presence of greatness within minutes of Whiplash. From the opening scenes of Andrew rehearsing and Fletcher observing, passing judgment and scything him down with sharpened tongue and looks that slayed, it was abundantly clear that writer/director Damien Chazelle was on a mission to hammer us repeatedly with verbal blades, withering looks and an intensity that other directors would kill to produce.There are insufficient superlatives to express the power and effect of Whiplash and Chazelle's achievement. At least four times in the course of the screening my heart sank as Chazelle took us towards an alleyway that was predictable and certain to kick a five-star experience into another four-star, notable also-ran. Each time, he turned it around beautifully, steadfastly refusing to take the convenient route, instead aiming another kick at the tender parts, slamming us with the unexpected and leaving us to reel or look on in wide-eye admiration.His brilliance is in the subtlety, the sharp cracks of dialogue that slice through the opposing character's confidence; it is in the reactions of the onlookers that we see once and only once, never over-egging a moment; it is in the blood, sweat and tears, literally, that coat the symbols; it is in the music, the performance and the slam of hand and stick on metal and skin and it is in the accompanying venomous glares that scream more eloquently than a thousand words could ever achieve.Until last night, I didn't really 'get' jazz. After 107 minutes of Whiplash that passed in a heart-pounding, hair prickling moment, I can't get enough. If there had been a second screening I'd have put myself through the exhaustion again in an instant.When the Oscar nominations are revealed tomorrow, I doubt if the Academy will honour Whiplash with a Best Film nod but I sincerely hope it is in the mix at least for director and editing. As for J.K. Simmons, his nomination and win as Best Supporting Actor are probably as much a certainty as Daniel Day Lewis was for Best Actor in 2013 for Lincoln. If Simmons doesn't clean up 90% of the principal awards and see his already superb career take a whole new trajectory after this, I'll eat my hat, and yours and every one I can find in the village! Good? Whiplash is damn near perfect and J.K. Simmons is a major reason for it! For those who know J.K. Simmons as 'that guy fromÂ…', no longer is he going to be the go-to guy for irascible bosses and supporting characters. There is an effortlessness to his commanding performance as the teacher his students fear but whose validation they crave. Powerful, venomous, controlling, manipulative, vindictiveÂ… Fletcher is at turns both horrible and, perhaps, a genius. J.K. Simmons' utter ownership of the character pokes an electrified finger into every nerve prompting us to hate, fear and, just maybe, respect and admire a man who walks a razor sharp line between obsessive insanity and genius, all the time staring his victims in the eye, screaming into their face and daring them to take him on.On the receiving end of much of his venom is Andrew, played with equal measure and control by Teller. It is a solid performance that meets Simmons' all the way. More than that is Teller's performance at the drums that astound. He plays with his hands and his fists and his mind and his emotions and every ounce of fluid he can ring out of every available pore in his body. At the risk of sounding repetitive, wow. Just wow! I recently reviewed Big Eyes, a true story that really didn't warrant a feature-length big screen outing. Conversely, Whiplash is an event I wish I could make a reality so that I could experience it in the flesh repeatedly.Chazelle has crafted a film that is pretty much perfect. I fear it will receive a limited audience because, on paper, the premise doesn't blow anyone away: Teacher gives student a hard time; student struggles to find himself... But back in 1994, a little prison movie was released that was badly marketed, garnered seven Oscar nominations, didn't win a single one and bombed at the box office. It was only word of mouth and the DVD release that made the world sit up en masse and notice that The Shawshank Redemption for what it is. Perhaps Whiplash will go through a similar experience, though I suspect Oscar won't make the same mistake this time around.The year is young but Whiplash is the best cinematic outing from it so far. See it, see it now and prepare for something remarkable.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Thrills, excites, inspires & entertains without boundaries.
","The Wolf of Wall Street is one heck of a jaunt. It out Wall Street's Wall Street, it thrills, excites, inspires and entertains without boundaries, and for three hours I was completely immersed in a world that, for the most part, I wanted to be my own.Inspired by the true events of Jordan Belfort's escapades on Wall Street and beyond, The Wolf of Wall Street is a rip-roaring helter-skelter ride of dubious morality and no-holds barred excess of sex and drugs, with money trouncing rock 'n' roll. Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young stockbroker who is a casualty of Black Monday. Undaunted by the unemployment mountain and buoyed by his own brand of confidence, Jordan secures a job brokering penny shares, makes a bundle, inadvertently lands an employee, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), launches his own company, Stratford-Oakmont, reinterprets the law and embarks on an audacious journey of wealth and debauchery while the FBI gnashes its teeth.Know this from the outset: The Wolf of Wall Street is not a film for those with tender minds and fragile ears. Though obvious comparisons will be made with Wall Street, its tone is more in line with Filth, and Jordan Belfort makes Gordon Gekko look like a timid convent girl.While its 180-minute running time may put off some viewers short of attention and weak of bladder, Scorsese has not included a second that does not need to be upon the screen. We barely have time to think, let alone blink. An undisputed (by anyone with even a single brain cell) master of his craft, The Wolf of Wall Street is his ballsiest offering since Gangs of New York and emphasises the sheer breadth of his versatility. Yes, there's a moral in there somewhere, but that's not the point. This is an absolute joy to behold and the most outright fun I've had at the cinema since James McAvoy got down and really dirty.The Wolf of Wall Street is written, shot and edited so sharply that it manages to simultaneous flow smoothly and jar us sufficiently to keep our eyes wide and our backs rigidly to attention. One's pulse increases and laughter bubbles under the surface, sometimes erupting, though this is not a comedy, and the soundtrack is welded so solidly to each scene that it is not merely complimentary but integral.DiCaprio has been a major Hollywood star for a long time. Titanic made him a heartthrob (to some) and he has convinced and engrossed frequently. Occasionally his performances have made us stop and reevaluate his rank amongst the Hollywood elite, most notably What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Catch Me if You Can. His performance as Jordan is cause to reassess once again. He doesn't just present Jordan as a man arrogantly living on the edge, he makes sure we know he thrives on it, loves every second of it. But even for a man as brash and self-assured as Jordan, we see the scruples, understand the hint of doubt.Margot Robbie looks certain to permanently shake off the shadow of 311 episodes of Neighbours as Naomi, the second prominent woman in Belfort's life, with an assured performance that is sexy, gutsy and cruel. Likewise Rob Reiner has a ball and entertains thoroughly as the explosive Max, father of the hero, conscience of the company. But it is Jonah Hill who surprises most. Until Moneyball he was just another funny bloke in films. With The Wolf of Wall Street he is the actor who is very funny occasionally but, more importantly, is a fine actor who doesn't look remotely out of place in the limelight of a significant, box office smash. The reinvention of Jonah Hill is well underway.Forget the moody, brooding Scorsese of Taxi Driver & Raging Bull, this is Scorsese letting it all hang out and ramping up the energy and impact for maximum effect. The Wolf of Wall Street is the fourth five-star film of 2014 (alas, I fear we're in for a slump once the award contenders pass) but easily the most fun of them. Take a trip to the cinema and live a life of debauchery and excess secondhand tonight!For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",10,0,5,22 January 2014
Dark Shadows," At least it looks good...
","I love the way Tim Burton's films look. He is undeniably a master of concept and dark designs. Just look at the sets and costumes of Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sleepy Hollow The list is almost as long as his list of films as a director. His set builders construct vast, intricate worlds that dominate studio lots, his costumers dress the actors in exquisite creations and the geniuses holding the makeup palettes sculpt hideous beauty that draws the viewers eyes.However, beautiful sets and exquisite make-up do not compensate for poor direction and shoddy films and yet again I find myself starting a review with a defence of Burton with 'Well, it looks good ' I really wanted to embrace Dark Shadows and emerge from Cineworld proclaiming 'Burton is back!' I really want to say that after a chronic dip in form since 1994's largely unappreciated but almost flawless Ed Wood, Burton has returned to the screen to fulfill the promise he showed with the heart-warming Edward Scissorhands and the anarchic comedy of Beetlejuice two years earlier. I want to but, as you'll have worked out by now, I can't.Yes, in 2003 he brought us Big Fish. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it a couple of times in the past year alone, but it isn't a 'great' and it doesn't hit the heights of his best work. And it certainly isn't compensation enough for Planet of the Apes or Alice in Wonderland! So what of Dark Shadows? It should work; it has great pedigree, the source is a quirky (cult, if you will) soap opera of days gone by, the cast is a cocktail of Burton stalwarts (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter), new-to-the-fold stars (Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Lee Miller, Eva Green, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) and barely known stars-in-the-making (Gulliver McGrath & Christopher Lee â˜º) and even the plot is an engaging spin on a familiar idea.In the late 1700s, wealthy landowner Barnabas Collins (Depp) makes the grave error of resisting the advances of his maid Angelique (a delicious performance from Eva Green) who just happens to be a witch. She transforms him into a vampire and buries him alive. Two hundred years later workmen unearth his coffin and release him, whereupon Barnabas drinks their blood and returns home to find his penniless descendants camped out, suffering, embittered and unaware that the cause of their misfortune, Angelique, is also two hundred years old and that they've been sitting on a fortune locked in hidden vaults all these years.What follows is a fish-out-of-water tale of resurgence, revenge, unrequited love, death, blood and a tired, embarrassing, pointless, gimmicky appearance from Alice Cooper. It has all the ingredients to make an amazing black forest gateau but somewhere along the line someone has attempted to make a sausage with it and ended up with a mess that won't even enhance the compost heap.Cooper aside, there isn't really a duff performance. Depp is as controlled and delightfully off-kilter as ever, Pfeiffer engages as the matriarch, Bonham Carter reigns in her OTT tendencies to give a sad, sexual performance and Johnny Lee Miller's Roger is just enough of a nob to regard with enjoyable disdain.The inescapable problems are the direction and the hastily cobbled third act that ran out of ideas. The right amount of effort has gone into casting and visuals, but too little has been spent on writing and crafting a film that deserves our attention. The final act could have been written by a committee of performing monkeys with a decent collection of DVDs as a reference point. It flops about weakly in a resolution of sorts that fails to get under the skin, excite, shock or even entertain adequately. The script plods, much of the dialogue is leaden and the overall impression is of a high performance car being driven uphill, backwards and in third gear.Once upon a time, Tim Burton created; he crafted out of virgin clay and exhibited delights that surprised, thrilled and remain strong in our memories and hearts twenty-five years later. Here, he's borrowed, referenced, rehashed and recycled. Dark Shadows is a weak hybrid of The Exorcist and Mars Attacks! with a splicing of Nosferatu. Is Angelique anything more than the witchy sister of Lisa Marie's alien girl from Mars Attacks!? Even the sex scene, which should be hugely entertaining, and maybe a little titillating, is a diluted imitation of Jeff Goldblum's & Emma Thompsons in The Tall Guy.It's a pity. It's a waste of a fine talent and a great idea. But at least it looks good.Another film review from The Squiss.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Sharp, funny & with career-defining turn from Michael Keaton
","It's not hard to see why Birdman has divided audiences. It isn't an easy viewing experience and it would be all too simple to call it a 'Marmite' film, but it's not as straightforward as loving or hating Birdman; I think some people just don't 'get' it. And, no, I'm not setting myself above all others and claiming that I do get every point and nuance.Writer/director Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu (21 Grams, Biutiful) has crafted a comedy drama of depression and insanity where the viewer isn't always entirely certain what is going on either upon the screen or in Riggan Thomas' mind. For that matter, Riggan isn't entirely certain where the dividing line is between reality and psychosis, so what hope is there for us? Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is a washed up, wrung out movie star famous for his role as the titular Birdman. With his film career on the wane, his personal life in tatters and his mental state fragile, he endeavours to kick-start his career and prove that he is a real 'actor' by adapting, directing, staring and producing an adaptation of a Raymond Carver's short story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, on Broadway. The production is troubled with recasting problems, relationships, clashes with inflated and fragile egos and family issues including a daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), who is begrudgingly working as his PA. But these problems are nothing compared to the maelstrom in his head.Birdman is a very dark and frequently disturbing film that is lightened by occasionally also being very funny. There are snaps of dialogue and physical action that thrust a belly load of laughter into the air to lift the mood and the action, though mostly the action of language and retorts, keeps the viewer on edge. Antonio Sanchez' jazz drum score, however, scratches at the brain so that we are never truly comfortable, regardless of the humour and action upon the screen.The camera work is an absolute joy to behold. Periodically a film comes along (The Player, Atonement) that causes us to rave about a particular scene that is one long, elaborate shot and which must have been rehearsed and choreographed endlessly. Birdman is comprised almost exclusively of such shots that are so beautifully edited that it is frequently very difficult to see where one shot ends and the next begins, although it is difficult not to be distracted by IÃ±Ã¡rritu's skill and play 'spot the edit' rather than concentrating on the film.Birdman is loaded to the brim with fine performances from Edward Norton's egotistical actor, Mike, to Lindsay Duncan's viciously cutting critic, Tabitha. With solidly impressive support at every turn from Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts et al, IÃ±Ã¡rritu has filled Birdman with variety and sparkle from his cast. In any other year, Keaton would be looking pretty damn confident in the run up to the Oscars but he has a battle on his hands with Eddie Redmayne's turn in The Theory of Everything. Regardless of how much gold he wins this year, he is on blisteringly good form here as Riggan in what may very well displace Betelgeuse as his career-defining role.I'm not entirely convinced that Birdman is a film to enjoy, but it is a fantastic, mind-mending, disturbing experience of madness and surrealism that needs to be witnessed more than explained. Take a deep breath and go for it, but don't blame me if you emerge with your head spinning and less relaxed than when you went in.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,3,10,20 January 2015
Prometheus," Almost a religious experience unveiling the cause & meaning of life
","Prometheus, Ridley Scott's twentieth feature (I'm not including the 'announced' Untitled Blade Runner Project, nor The Counselor, which is still in pre-production) as director takes him back to the world of his second, Alien. That said, it isn't an Alien prequel. In the words of Sir Ridley himself, 'If there was a sequel to this, which there might be if the film is successful, there'll be two more of these before you even get to Alien 1.' Got that? Prometheus is most emphatically not a prequel! HoweverÂ… For those who know their onions, it acts primarily as the backstory to the space jockey, a skeletal, petrified creature that was revealed in Alien but, much to Scott's bemusement, was never revisited or explained by the directors who followed. After watching three sequels, which reduced in quality and impact with each release, and a few related aberrations, Scott decided to jolly well deal with it himself.But it's more than even a backstory. Prometheus is almost a religious experience, or rather an esoteric journey through the cause and meaning of life. There's a great deal more to it than simply a trek across space to kill a few villainous aliens but that's not to say you'll need to be a Mensan to understand it, although I certainly feel the need and desire to see it at least once more to benefit fully.As one would expect, it being an Alien film and a Scott feature, the sets are astoundingly intricate and beautiful. The camera pans may be slow but they are nowhere near gradual enough to take it all in. These sets and props are the very dark brother of Tim Burton's and even now H.R. Giger's influence is strongly evident in Arthur Max's production design. Prometheus begs repeated viewings for the aesthetics alone and one wonders how much more remarkable the original Alien would have been with a vast budget and the technology available to Scott now, although I sincerely hope he doesn't 'do a Lucas' and digitally enhance it for the sake of his wallet.If the aura that surrounds the Alien franchise isn't enough to attract an audience, the cast should certainly add weight. If you haven't already, take a few minutes to view the two virals starring Guy Pearce as Peter Weyland and Michael Fassbender as David. They aren't imperative to an understanding of the film but they are superb introductions to the characters and the world they inhabit. Charlize Theron is on coldhearted bitch duty as Meredith and as controlled and compelling as ever. Cruel as it is to say so, though the comparison is inevitable, the Ripley role is filled by Noomi Rapace, as Elizabeth Shaw, showing further versatility and contrast from the roles she is currently best known in The GirlÂ… trilogy and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.The supporting cast is ably rounded out by strong turns from Idris Elba, Rafe Spall and Sean Harris who further cements his status as the 'go to guy' for cynical arsewipes you wouldn't invite to a party but would be happy to stand behind in a battle.The biggest star, beyond the design, is Sir Ridley. He's brought together a story, a world, a cast, an entity that gels and entices. My principal criticism is also one of the attractions: it doesn't satisfy completely. I left the cinema wanting more, needing to know more. Two sequels, providing Scott shoots them himself and with the same passion and detail, are a very attractive proposition indeed. I'm not sure I understood every aspect fully and I certainly wasn't able to absorb absolutely everything painted across the screen and so this week I'll return to Cineworld for a second immersion.I'm not sure whether my cautious four stars are unfair and if my leaning towards a fifth is justified and, either way, like my cake of the month, one portions is not sufficient!Addendum â€“ 14 June 2012 The second portion has just been savoured. Prometheus remains a four star film; a very solid four star. It misses out on the fifth star, a mark of near perfection, because it could have been improved on. Without giving anything away, the prosthetic body part (I'm not going to be any more specific than that in case you haven't seen it yet) is obvious. It may only appear briefly but for those few seconds it is very obviously not real. With the rest of the CG on display, I'm not sure how or why Sir Ridley allowed that one through. More than that, though, there is some very clunky dialogue written for idiots and performed without belief.However, those moments are thankfully brief and the overall film is just shy of excellent. For me it improved with a second viewing in much the same way as my tureen of red lentil soup matures with each glug of Bordeaux and reheating experience. But I need to see it again. I need to see it in my own cinema, with a HUGE screen and the facility to pause it frequently to admire the beauty of the photography, the magnificence of the sets and the vast, exciting, intricately detailed canvas upon which Scott has painted an epic. It may not be remembered or received in the same manner and affection as his original Alien, but it is substantially more complete and utterly exquisite.",8,1,2,17 June 2012
Taken 2," Predictable, passable & emphatically NOT scripted by David Mamet, more's the pity.
","In terms of the greatest mysteries in the world, why 2008's Taken was given a sequel isn't up there (it's all about the money, money, moneyÂ…). But quite why this Liam Neeson vehicle was green-lit over an A-Team sequel is, however, a mystery. The first installment was enjoyable, the second, cheesy, predictable and lacking any new ideas. Heaven forbid there'll be a third.Taken 2 occurs a year after Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped and Bryan Mills (Neeson) rampages across Paris to rescue her and kill every last mofo who even thought about being involved. Unfortunately for Mills, on an Albanian hillside cemetery in front of the graves of the eight would-be kidnappers, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija, Gregorovitch in Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows) vows to avenge his son and the other scoundrels in the ground, conveniently overlooking their villainy.Meanwhile, Mills, his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Jansen), and Kim find themselves holidaying in Istanbul. Leaving her parents to wander the streets, Kim opts for an afternoon in the hotel pool only to be disturbed by a phone call from her dad with the fateful words, 'Kim, your mum and I are gonna to be taken. People are going to come for you tooÂ…' And so begins another chase and a fresh crop of corpses.It's adequate, but that is nowhere near acceptable when dealing with an actor of Neeson's stature. This is the actor that gave us Michael Lamb, Oskar Schindler and Michael Collins. That he also delighted millions as Ra's Al Ghul and Qui-Gon Jinn only adds to his star power. But in the past couple of years he's coasted along with bland performances in a series of poor films that includes Battleship, Clash of the Titans and now Taken 2. Yes, he can run, scowl and shoot at the same time, he snaps necks with conviction and has the good grace to at least feign regret as he snaps another limb but, come on Liam, you're worth so much more than this.It isn't entirely his fault, though. Some of the dialogue he and his co-stars are required to deliver is pure Gorgonzola. The opening scenes are so filled with stilted exposition that when a brief exchange arrives that doesn't cause one to cringe, it feels as though David Mamet has stepped into the scripting room. To wit: 'Dad, I can't do it.' 'Can you shoot?' 'No.' 'Then drive.' Okay, after the event it doesn't stand up to much but actually, as those words filled my ears, I felt as though we might be getting somewhere. Yep. That's about the sum of it.Director Oliver Megaton, who brought us both Transporter 3 and Columbiana, has dipped towards the standard of the former rather than striving to exceed the latter and screenwriter Luc Besson seems to have lost his way completely. Even together they fail elevate Taken 2 to the level of Hostage, Ransom or Panic Room all three of which make the art of kidnapping far more thrilling.Grace has more fun in Taken 2 than she did in the original and is fairly convincing as the protected daughter forced to find some inner steel, but she's no threat to the likes of Angelina Jolie or even Kate Beckinsale. Jansen fares less well and is largely called upon to simper, smile adoringly at her ex-husband, cry and play at being unconscious. Perhaps if there is a third installment, Mills will be bound and gagged and the girls can have all the action. We can but hope.As for the villains, most are virtually faceless, have no characters and nothing to identify them from each other, the exception being Krasniqi who instigates the onslaught but is barely involved. What a pity we were not allowed to see his point of view and understand his pain. While we would have still rooted for the heroic trio, Taken 2 would have been a far richer experience if there had at least been some ambiguity and the opportunity to glimpse the other side of the crime before condemning the criminals.Taken 2 is a predictable, passable way to spend part of an evening but even more forgettable than the original. The risk of spoiling the film prevents me from commenting about some ropy plot devices. I'm sure you know the formula and expect pretty much everything to work out, but does it really need to be so tidy? Couldn't it have had just a little bit of depth? Or have stood up to even a tiny amount of scrutiny? Ah, there's the mystery!",3,3,11,5 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Don't watch it late at night if you have to go home alone.
","It is not a good idea to watch the 10pm screening of The Woman in Black and then drive home alone through dark, mysterious lanes to an old house that creaks and groans in the night.There has been a great deal written about Daniel Radcliffe's first film since Harry Potter graduated and much of it for entirely the wrong reasons. He's an actor and he plays different roles. Career (and life, perhaps) defining as it was, that episode has ended and he's embarked upon the next seventy years of his life. Some reviewers have been overly critical of his performance but, having watched it with a dozen other viewers who were equally unnerved, that, too, is unfair criticism. It's a bit like condemning Beckham for not scoring when he set up all five goals.Certainly, it isn't an award-winning performance and he looks too young, despite light stubble, to play a lawyer, but it is a convincing turn, albeit one that occasionally needs more oomph. At times he seems afraid to really immerse himself in the character of Arthur Kipps, but it is a vast improvement on his early over-acting as the wizard boy.It isn't the only criticism of a film that is certain to boost the resurgence of Hammer. There are one or two cheesy moments we could do with out, not least of all Jane Goldman's unnecessary rewriting of the end sequence, which novelist Susan Hill left with an air of hopelessness. And the scream that we hear at various times through the film feels like a generic sound effect last heard from the mouths of the ringwraiths in The Lord of The Rings trilogy. But when the film is seen as a whole, these really are very small quibbles and the overall production quality renders these almost insignificant.The sets and locations are superb, from the dark, cobwebby Eel Marsh House and its overgrown cemetery to the thick, devouring swamp by the causeway. Though the film is largely shot in muted hues of blue and grey it feels rich and magnificent upon the screen and throughout the film I was torn between thoughts of how stunning it could be and stifled calls of 'What the hell are you doing there?' Radcliffe brings a desperate sensitivity to the screen as a bereaved husband whose son tellingly draws him with a frown and there are times where he looks quite the hero. He won't look back at this as his best performance ever but it is solid and a definite step in the right direction. CiarÃ¡n Hinds predictably gives another supporting character depth and life and it is always a pleasure, although too infrequent, to see Janet McTeer on the big screen. She has very few scenes as Mrs Daily but is flawless in her performance as the unhinged woman that is, at times, almost as disturbing as the titular character, and in the hands of a less capable actress Mrs Daily could easily be little more than a freak.The Woman in Black is loosely termed a horror film, although it is more of a chiller, but is it scary? If you like your frights gory and blood-splattered, then no. But if your fears are of the unknown and the barely seen you won't be disappointed. There are moments towards the end when we see too much of the ghostly woman but the fleeting glimpses and the hints of terror are enough to really put the willies up you. The small audience jumped in unison to frequently for comfort and more than a few were very vocal in their fright.The fingers of fear scratched my spine with their fingernails and I left the cinema with a damp shirt and a desire for company and light conversation before bed. I managed neither and have just realized I promised to see it with another friend next week. Fool! Another film review from The Squiss.

The Dark Knight Rises," The phenomenal completion of a trilogy as close to perfect as we're ever likely to see.
","He did. It rocks! The Dark Knight Rises is my third ten-star film of the year.There was a possibility and a fear that after the unique, blistering start to the trilogy and the mind-blowing, Oscar-winning follow-up, the third installment would dip. Not even The Godfather series managed three films of equal importance, impact and quality but in The Dark Knight Rises Christopher Nolan has given us a trinity of near perfection.This final offering from the team that reinvented superheroes with Batman Begins in 2005 and produced a staggering, thrilling and at times shocking sequel in The Dark Knight in 2008 has closed the book in majestic style and, as the finest directors do, Nolan has left us wanting more. However, we don't always get what we want and in this case, maybe that's a good thing. Why risk devaluing perfection with a shoddy, money-grabbing bolt on? The Dark Knight Rises sees Gotham in a state of confidence amid mumblings that the absent Batman is neither needed nor really missed after eight years of self-imposed exile. Bruce Wayne has isolated himself from the world, his reputation in tatters having taking the blame for Harvey Dent's demise, his empire is close to financial ruin and his costume of choice is a now a silk dressing gown, an unkempt mass of facial hair and a miserable scowl. Then he catches the delectable Selina Kyle burgling his home and all hell breaks lose with the emergence of BaneÂ… Nolan is confident enough in his product and team to take his time in setting the scene, building the pace and drawing our emotional involvement. For those who saw the trailer, there is an expectation of mortality, though we hope desperately that he has misled us, and there is little risk of us not being absorbed in the emotional tangle of Wayne's life and the decisions he must make.The Dark Knight Rises harks back to the first installment but there is never an impression of retreading old ground or rehashing plot lines. This is an entirely new beast and what Nolan unleashes on us is enthralling, engrossing and inventive while remaining comfortably familiar. We care about Wayne and his alter ego because we've travelled with him. Like the reinvented Bond in Casino Royale and The Quantum of Solace, we've felt his pain and understood how his mind works. Why? Because Christian Bale is one of the finest actors of his generation and doesn't merely don a cowl and play a part, he inhabits the man and embraces the yin and yang of altruism and monstrousness that makes him who he is.It is obvious to focus on Bale because without him Batman, the film and the character, just wouldn't work. But again Nolan has cast his ensemble with perfection. While Bane is not as spectacular as The Joker and Tom Hardy, though superb, will not emulate Heath Ledger and win an Oscar, he is an expansive villain who thrills and chills and who just might come on top. Beyond Hardy it is a delight to watch Marion Cotillard's beautiful, steely Miranda and, of course, the presence of Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine reprising their roles is as welcome as it is rewarding. Even at 164 minutes, The Dark Knight Rises feels too brief to explore the lives of Gordon, Fox and Alfred as deeply as we would like, but that is also an asset as we're never allowed to be complacent in the company of the familiar allies.And then there is the cat.In Batman Returns, Michelle Pfeiffer stole the show, seized our hearts and adorned our bedroom walls as the oh-so-sensual Catwoman in her stitched-in cat suit. Could Anne Hathaway come close to the impact Pfeiffer had on us? Emphatically, yes! Hathaway gives us a very different Cat and steals both the crown and the hearts of a new generation. Though never actually referred to as 'Catwoman' she leaves us in no doubt as to who she is and how the world should revolve around her. Hathaway exudes sexuality without needing to purr and is feisty, stubborn and naughty enough to step out of the Bat's shadow and for us to clamour for more. And they way we are shown exactly who she is, with the revealing of her ears, is a subtle act of class.Jonathon and Christopher Nolan have written yet another screenplay that is taut and thrilling without a single wasted or superfluous line. The pace is varied enough to allow us time to enjoy the odd quip and occasional surprise without ever permitting us to wallow and admire the scenery before it whips across to a new scene or snaps in a different direction.The sets, effects, costumes and machines are darkly dazzling as we've come to expect and time doesn't allow for me to elucidate as expansively as they deserve. Let's just say this is a film where one Batmobile isn't enough.The Dark Knight Rises is not just a good film; it's an excellent film and it completes a trilogy as close to perfect as we're ever likely to see.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",10,4,11,6 August 2012
The Croods," Neither magical nor memorable but fine in an emergency with bored kids
","It's Easter and there's a slew of films to distract your children. If they're very young and you're desperate the current animation, The Croods may get you though 90 minutes of the school break.To be fair, the old man who sat across the aisle from me with his grandchildren bellowed with laughter for much of it. However, he was in the minority (of one) and I'm sure I saw him dribbling. Conversely, my five-year old nephew sat virtually silently throughout and spent some of it with his head on my shoulder. Trust me, he's a great deal more animated every single time he watches Monsters Inc. and the Toy Story canon. I reckon that just about sums up The Croods.The Croods is 'nice' but there's nothing magical or even particularly memorable about it other than it's one of the few films involving Nicholas Cage where he doesn't SHOUT AT US THE WHOLE TIME.After their cave is destroyed, the reluctant Grug (rhymes with slug, hug, bug and any other damn thing the writers can squeeze into the script in their search for a shallow smile) leads his family of cave dwellers out of their dark world into an exciting, colourful land with the object of his daughter's affection, Guy (Ryan Reynolds).That's not just the introduction; that's pretty much it. Grug doesn't think much of his mother-in-law; his son, Thunk (Clark Duke), is a dunce; his daughter, Eep (Emma Stone), wants adventure; and his wife, Ugga (Katherine Keener) is long-suffering. Oh, he has a baby that's more of an animal that the creatures they encounter.There are some pretty moments as the world opens up to them (in a diluted Avatar kind of way), some mild humour, courtesy of a Sloth called Belt and his one, repetitive joke, and a few moments of insipid danger.The emotion is slight, the lessons heavy-handed, obvious and simplistic enough for even the youngest of children to grasp: hiding in darkness bad, walking towards light good, sometimes dad being boring is best. Blah, blah, blah.Don't bother unless you're desperate. But if you are desperate, take a strong coffee and use the time to learn to knit.Better still, take the children out for a long trudge through the woods or a game of rounders and save the cinema treat for Monsters University.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,5,16,27 March 2013
Monsters University," Fun, amusing & with exquisite animation, but not a classic for the Pixar canon.
","Before Pixar upped the ante with WALL.E, their offering that found it's way into the DVD player most often was Monsters Inc. Beautiful, beautifully original, funny, fantastic vocal talent, characters the entire audience could engage with fully (whether hissing at them or wanting to hug them) and animation to drool over: 'Wow, Scully's fur is sooo realistic. Look how it movesÂ…' I'll admit it, bar the odd blip (Cars, Up â€“ Yeah, I know but they just didn't work for me), I'm a sucker for Pixar. Cautiously, but with high hopes, I packed up nieces & nephews and headed out for the Sunday morning sermon of the cinema with fingers crossed that this sequel would match the quality of Toy Story 2 & 3.Clearly, Monsters University is a prequel. A young, largely ignored and belittled Mike (Billy Crystal) is inspired by a school trip to Monsters Inc. and dreams of becoming a respected scarer. Fast-forward eleven years and Mike enrolls at Monsters University in the hope of achieving his life-long ambition. The trouble is, Mike just isn't scary as egotistical oaf, Sully (John Goodman), points out. Mike impresses Professor Knight (Alfred Molina) with his studious attitude but Professor Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) is a far greater challenge and his future at the university is in jeopardy unless he can prove he is fearsome.I did enjoy Monsters University, as my star rating attests, but it lacks the magic and originality of the original. For a start, it feels like a slip backwards; we know that screams will be replaced by laughter, we know how Mike's and Sully's friendship blossoms and so there is no room for surprise, or at least no opportunity for surprise is seized upon by writer/director Dan Scanlon.Instead of originality, Scanlon falls back on familiar devices to propel the story and it feels as though his mission was to make a Monsters sequel that swells the coffers rather than giving the audience a thrilling, warm, laugh-out-loud journey through the mind of Pixar again. Essentially, what we are served up is a group of misfits, failures and underdogs that must overcome their own issues and prejudices and to work together to overturn the odds and come out on top. Queue frat parties, student jealousy, initiation ceremonies and a villainess, Hardscrabble, who must be put in her place.However, the familiarity (or lack of originality) also allows for some enjoyable nods and twists on what we know. A few characters from the future wander through Monsters University in supporting roles and cameos that allow us a knowing chuckle, chief amongst these being the welcome, albeit brief, return of Randi (Steve Buscemi).The animation is exquisite. Post-viewing, we put the original on for the youngest who didn't come to the cinema and, compared to the blend of colours and movement of Monsters University, it looked dull and clunky. That's how far Pixar has evolved in the past decade.Monsters University is a fun film. It's a good addition to the Pixar canon and the children will love it. My little companions all claimed they enjoyed it more than the original. However, that was two minutes after the credits had finished rolling. My wife, however, echoed my view that, fun though it is, it's no classic and when both DVDs stand side by side on the shelf, it will be Monsters Inc. that will continue to be alternated with WALL.E.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,0,0,23 July 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Beautiful, funny & eye-moisteningly wonderful.
","Despite watching the trailer and knowing the broad story, Saving Mr.  Banks still managed to surprise me. It's a beautiful, tender film that  manages to be sad without being mawkish, funny without detracting from  the emotion and with far greater depth than expected.  Unfolding the story of Walt Disney's attempt to persuade P.L. Travers  to sell him the rights to her beloved Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks is  a delightful film that is deceptively emotional and flows smoothly  enough to be entirely engaging.  Travers (Emma Thompson) thwarts Disney's (Tom Hanks) attempts to secure  the rights for twenty years until a flatlining bank balance and a  mildly panicking agent persuade her to at least consider Disney's  proposition or lose her home with certainty. Whisking her to Hollywood  and bombarding her with all things Disney, the master of the House of  Mouse spares no expense or effort to woo Mrs Travers and persuade her  to allow him to keep his promise to his daughters to film the books  they loved so much. But nothing prepares him for the stubborn, exacting  curmudgeon who challenges him at every twist and turn and demands and  demeans in equal measures.  After the recent Captain Phillips, in which Hanks was astounding, there  is a very good chance that he may join an exclusive group (of twelve so  far, including co-star Emma Thompson) of actors to be nominated for two  Oscars in the same year. Even more rarely, he'll deserve both  nominations! Quite simply, it is impossible to imagine another actor in  the role of Uncle Walt. He oozes charisma and his smile is used for so  much more than merely expressing happiness. There is a genuine warmth  to Hanks' performance and this is one of those rare occasions where I  temporarily forgot I was watching him. He's been a very good actor for  many, many years, but this year I've had to reassess my opinion of him  and state that he has transcended his deserved 'movie stardom' to  become a very fine actor indeed.  Unsurprisingly (and most welcome), Hanks is matched every single step  of the way by Thompson. There is a magical thawing in her Travers in  the course of Saving Mr. Banks where she pokes her head out of her  hard, crispy chrysalis and threatens to become a warm(ish), witty  woman. Early on in the film, it is difficult to like Travers as her  demands become more extreme, her retorts more cutting and her demeanour  downright unpleasant, but Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay  weaves the story of the film rights with the tale of Travers' troubled  childhood to give reason for her crustiness and context to her literary  creation. It is this aspect of Saving Mr. Banks that surprises most and  completes the film.  Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) approaches each side of his  female protagonist's life very differently and her buried history is  shot in muted, dusty colours with a jagged Western romanticism that  tempers the bleak happenings that shaped the girl into the woman. Colin  Farrell is on his best form for years as Travers Goff, the drunk father  who lives in his own fantastic world of imagination and adventure to  escape the harsh reality of the real world. He is a man who fails  consistently and knows it, but loves his daughter unequivocally. As  with Hanks and Thompson, the chemistry between Farrell and Annie Rose  Buckley (playing Ginty, the young Travers) is effortlessly beautiful.  The casting is just one of the joys of Saving Mr. Banks, with Paul  Giamatti chief amongst the supporting actors as Travers' driver, Ralph,  a doleful puppy in human form that responds to every brush-off and  verbal slap with another smile and encouraging word. In the studio  Bradley Whitford as screenwriter Don DaGradi and B.J. Novak and Jason  Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers bring more gentle humour as  Travers' desperate, unwilling adversaries. There's no lazy leaning  towards slapstick or cheap shots, rather Hancock steers their scenes  gently allowing both the frostiness and the occasional sprinkles of  sunlight to sparkle with sincerity.  There are hints of Travers' adult life beyond her books but, though  comments remain, it feels as though the backstory was excised for the  final cut and so I came away from the film feeling that something was  missing. The final act is perhaps a little too tidy; it glides towards  a resolution too smoothly and nothing is made of the rumoured aftermath  of the deal, but these are minor niggles in a beautiful film that  carries one along and moistens the eyes occasionally.  Saving Mr. Banks is an unqualified success. It is a joy to watch and  leaves one hoping that Mary Poppins earns yet another screening in this  year's Christmas TV schedule.",8,84,116,9 December 2013
Thor: The Dark World," The cinematic equivalent of wearing all your favourite clothes at once.
","Kenneth Branagh's take on Thor (2011) was a surprising departure for him but it worked. The sequel, Thor: The Dark World, works less well. It's entertaining, there's plenty of noise and digital effects, but it's the cinematic equivalent of wearing all your favourite clothes at once.Like the original, it is credited to two directors: TV director for hire, Alan Taylor and James Gunn, who was partly responsible for the execrable Movie 43. Presumably the producers realized from the outset that it was too unwieldy for one man to handle alone. What a pity they didn't do something about it before production began.When the Dark Elves, a race hitherto thought to be extinct, rock up and have a go at trashing Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is decidedly narked and sends Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and friends to sort the mess out. Thor decides the best ally to have is his bother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), releases him from prison, sets off to Earth for some quality time in the company of old friends, including Jane (Natalie Portman), and redesigns Greenwich.Thor: The Dark World isn't a poor film, it's just messy and has been loaded with far too many ingredients to be fully cohesive or comprehendible. It's part sci-fi fantasy, part Harry Potter, part Lord of the Rings, has a smidgen of slapstick humour, a dollop of action, makes a half-hearted attempt at profundity and has been haphazardly stirred with shovel. We know there should be something in it for everyone but it's not quite possible to discern exactly what that something is.The fanboys will love it, those with a penchant for all things superhero will want to tick it off their 'must-see' list and parents seeking a diversion for bored kids could do far worse than to sit through two hours of this pleasurable mayhem.Thor: The Dark World is big, loud and chaotic but it's fun. Just don't expect to be moved or to be able to explain it all the following day.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,0,1,27 November 2013
Lucy," A whimsy built on a fallacy. Exciting, but conveniently wrapped up.
","It's been a while since Luc Besson really excited me. I'm going to say 1994, with the sublime LÃ©on. His most recent outings as writer (3 Days to Kill) and director (The Family) have been dull thuds that threatened to overshadow the resounding successes of his hit-man triumph and the likes of Subway and The Big Blue. Twenty years is a long time to wait for something worth celebrating, but finally we have Lucy to admire.Let's not get too excited, though. Lucy is a curio, an enjoyable return to form from the French auteur (a contentious mantle and one worthy of debate another time), but is a long way from being a classic, despite a solid, central performance from Scarlett Johansson in the title role.When Lucy is forced to deliver a briefcase to the violent criminal kingpin Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), she winds up with a bag full of a new synthetic drug sewn into her belly. Before she can complete the delivery, the bag bursts and the drug infects her, unlocking the unused 90% of her brain and transforming her into an acutely aware, brilliant superhuman with warrior-like powers and a drastically reduced shelf life on this earth.At this juncture we should perhaps take a momentary step back into reality. Lucy is a whimsy built on a fallacy. We don't use a mere 10% of our brain. We use all of it (although a look at some people around here does bring that accepted 'fact' into question) but understand perhaps 10% of the brain's workings. And while we're at it, if you cut a worm in half, you don't get two worms, you end up with a dead worm in two parts. Deal with it! However, facts can get in the way of a good story and so Besson dispenses with them from the outset, not that I have any particular issues with that. For the most part, Lucy is exciting and a thoroughly enjoyable romp. There are plot holes aplenty but Besson bats them away with aplomb, and concentrates on the thrills and the race against time. This is Limitless meets Transcendence with a serious armoury thrown in for good measure. There is much to enjoy as we watch Lucy evolving physically, mentally and emotionally before us, becoming ever more resourceful and violent as she seeks out Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), the authority on the mind and brain function, for help and to impart her knowledge to him.Morgan Freeman, though a comforting presence, is unremarkable, playing essentially the same role as he did in Transcendence. His Professor Norman is virtually indistinguishable from his Joseph Tagger and the impression he gives is of a man coasting in his dotage. His performance doesn't in any way detract from Lucy, it just doesn't enhance it.The presence of the hominid Lucy is awful, however. Didn't Besson think about looking at the make up and CGI created for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or even the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Awful, just awful. And the confusion of travelling through space first and then time is clumsy and implies he is uncertain of his historical chronology and geography.The principal failing of Lucy is its culmination, which of is largely unsatisfying though hardly surprising. Lucy sets out with high ideals of uniqueness, boldness and enlightenment but is unable to be truly original and has to settle for a rearrangement of old ideas. That isn't entirely the fault of Luc Besson as we must shoulder some of the responsibility. We are creatures of limited comprehension, we cannot truly fathom the infinity of the universe (something has to contain it, surelyÂ…) and this, Lucy, is no different. We have a need to box things up to understand them and by doing so Besson immediately limits it.'It', the expansiveness of intelligence and our potential, becomes something tangible for us to scrutinize. Professor Norman states early on that he doesn't know what would happen if we ever harnessed the entirety of our brain capacity. He can only hypothesize; the rest is a mystery. Besson, however, attempts to explain and portray it for us. The bolder move would have been stop short of an explanation, to perhaps watch Lucy's brainpower percentage rise and to fill the screen and auditorium with white noise until the credits cut in, leaving us puzzled, confused, befuddled, just as Professor Norman is, but I suspect Besson feared the cries of outrage from audiences and critics and instead he gives us a convenient, comprehensible resolution.Lucy needed a visionary at the helm. Whilst Besson is imaginative and delivers a rollicking good ride (on a good day), he lacks the courage to create something truly unique and astounding.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,3,10,28 August 2014
Flight," Flying upside down cannot possibly help you, even if you're Denzel Washington.
","When his plane malfunctions, airline pilot Whip Whitaker remarkably, no, miraculously, pulls the plane out of a nosedive by inverting it and then landing it in a field saving the lives of all but a few of those on board. He wakes up in hospital a national hero only for it all to go spectacularly pear-shaped. Whip, you see, is a drunk with a rather large snowdrift stuffed up each nostril.Contrary to the opinions of many, based on comments splattered on certain chat rooms and networking sites, Flight is emphatically not based on true events. In the words of John Goglia, National Transportation Safety Board member, 'Flying upside down cannot possibly help you', even if you're Denzel Washington.Got that? Flight is not real, your pilot is not drunk and pilots don't generally snort cocaine.What Flight is, however, is a very entertaining film. It isn't action-packed, it spends very little time on the crash in question and it gives us the opportunity to enjoy Washington in a rare unpleasant anti-hero role. He wrestles with, and loses to, his daemons while splattering his screwed up life across the screen. Whip is a man who should have everything but has shoved half up it up his nose and flushed the rest down the toilet.The talent of Washington is that he allows us to like and root for Whip for the first third of the film. We watch enthralled and hopeful that somehow he'll be vindicated but slowly he unravels his internal tangle for us to see what a mess he really is. As the film progresses, he becomes ever more desperate as he sinks further into the quagmire of his own making and resorts to emotional blackmailing those who care about him most. It is both a tragic sight to witness and a marvelous performance from one of Hollywood's favourite stars.But Flight isn't Washington's film alone. We are gifted a double whammy of eye-catching cameos from John Goodman (as Harling Mays, Whip's dealer, who munches the scenery in a bigger version of the character we've seen frequently) and Don Cheedle (as Hugh Lang, the defence attorney who could be working for the prosecution).Beyond them is a solid supporting cast of colleagues, union reps and family that includes sterling turns from the likes of Brice Greenwood and Tamara Tunie in particular. But by far the stand-out is Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a heroin addict Whip meets on the hospital stairwell and is drawn to only to absorb into his maelstrom.Reilly, so often doomed to playing bit-part in big flick (Sherlock Holmes) or principal in unseen gem (the fantastically chilling Eden Lake), is finally given a significant role in a big film and is every bit the equal of star name, Washington. Whilst Nicole's development may be a little too quick to be plausible, that is the fault of script and director (Robert Zemeckis) and we root for her. We want her to survive her own sickness and attachment to Whip and Reilly gives us a beautifully played character that gets under our skin. With three more films in the can or shooting, let's hope Hollywood finally catches up. And if it doesn't, at least we'll have the promise of her teaming with Brendan Gleeson in Calvary, from The Guard's John Michael McDonagh, to look forward to.After the brace of turkeys (A Christmas Carol and Beowulf) and the ill-fated Yellow Submarine remake, Zemickis is back on solid ground and closer to the form he showed when he gave us Cast Away thirteen years ago. It is a brave move to eschew a crowd-pleasing 30-minute action sequence and instead focus quickly on the drama of character clashes instead and Flight is a richer film and far more worthwhile viewing experience for it.Zemeckis handles his cast carefully to draw out sensitive performances from each of them, a little ham from Goodman aside, and directs the digital flight and crash sequences with panache so they are exciting and gasp-inducing without being gratuitous or flippant. He is also wise enough to keep them to a minimum to ensure we 'buy into' Flight not for the effects but for the performances.Mid-way through, Hugh Lang tells Whip, 'The FAA and the NTSB took ten pilots, placed them in simulators, recreated the events that led to this plane falling out of the sky. Do you know how many of them were able to safely land the planes? Not one. Every pilot crashed the aircraft, killed everybody on board. You were the only one who could do it!' It's a fine moment when we understand the brilliance of Whip beyond his addiction. And it matters not a jot that neither he nor the other ten pilots really exist!

Unbroken," A remarkable POW story of survival packaged into a fine Sunday matinÃ©e flick.
","Unbroken, Angelina Jolie's second outing as feature director (her third, By the Sea is released later this year) is a rewarding, engaging delve into the remarkable true story of Louis Zamperini; trouble maker, Olympian, airman, prisoner of war, survivorÂ… Growing up on the breadline in Orlean, New York, Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), a son of Italian immigrants seems destined for a life in trouble until, running away from it one day, his talent for speed is discovered. Several years later, with one Olympics under his belt, WWII breaks out and Zamperini finds himself in the Pacific fighting the Japanese. When their aeroplane plunges into the sea, Zamperini and the other airmen battle the ravages of the sea to survive 47 harrowing days only to be rescued and taken to a Japanese POW camp. The camp commander, Corporal Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara), makes it his personal mission to make life both incredibly painful and short for Zamperini but the athlete refuses to be broken.The trailer for Unbroken was enough to put it on my 'Must See' list but, barely ten minutes in, it had the feel of a Sunday matinÃ©e and not a challenging look at the harsh realities of war. It showed every sign of being another insipid, failed attempt to tug at the heartstrings, like last year's disappointing Japanese POW flick, The Railway Man.My concerns were (mostly) unfounded. Certainly it is sanitized, it pulls the punches and feels a little too gentle far too often. Unbroken has the sense of being directed by a concerned, caring mother rather than a tough, headstrong director. If that is how you approach Unbroken, everything will be good in your world. Jolie has crafted a fine film out of a remarkable story that is not too gritty a viewing experience if you wish to take granddad along or want to give the children an education that is only moderately shocking to the innocent.Jolie has certainly produced a far more affecting and valuable film than George Lucas did with Red Tails. Her vision is grand and the sets and vistas give Unbroken a dark warmth. There are moments that, even after the event, are easy to pick out as potentially iconic: the scene with Zamperini raising the sleeper above his head, the aerial shot of the POWs bathing and resembling rats in a vast tank of water. Wonderful! As Unbroken weaves its tale, segueing between times to complete Zamerpini's story, it becomes surprisingly moving at times, more for the horrors it suggests than actually depicts, but that's no bad thing. Andy Dufresne's first rape in The Shawshank Redemption was horrific and Darabont didn't show a thing! While dÃ©butant Ishihara struggles to convince us at times, O'Connell carries the film with a gentle strength. There's nothing here to make one sit bolt upright and pour accolades over him, but his performance suits the overall feel of Unbroken. Perhaps more eye-catching is Domhnall Gleeson's performance as Phil, Zamperini's fellow airman and POW. It is yet another solid entry on a CV that suggests he will be around as long and as effectively as his father, Brendan.Unbroken remains a 'bunk off work day' film rather than one to devote to a precious evening, but it is still an enjoyable way to remember what people fought for, even if it doesn't trouble the emotions as much as it should.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,1,6,7 January 2015
The Purge," Moderately violent, occasionally shocking diluted take on Battle Royale.
","Some time in the future, America is in a similar state to the Japan of Battle Royale and the Powers That Be decide something must be done to restore law and order. That 'something' is The Purge, an annual event lasting twelve hours where all criminal activity (within certain boundaries regarding weaponry used) is legal and without risk of punishment.On this particular night wealthy security alarm salesman, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) locks himself and his family behind the shutters to enjoy a peaceful night within their home and view the events via their security cameras. Then a bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge, imaginatively credited as Bloody Stranger) hammers on the house and pleads for help. Unfortunately, the faction of middle class college kids with murderous intentions, led by a polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield, credited as, um, Polite Stranger) doesn't take too kindly to being denied their prey when Sandin's son, Charlie (Max Burkholder) opens the shutters for him.The trailer for The Purge intrigued and marked it out as a must-see film for me. It's a fine idea, though not entirely original, but the execution falls short of the potential. The principal issue is that everything is established so obviously that anyone who has watched even a handful of violently dramatic films will know exactly where we'll end up. The boyfriend's comment, the neighbour's bitchy quip, the deliberate lack of focus on one particular character in the final act: they all serve as blindingly obvious signposts to what follows. Many of the events are so predictable one could almost write a checklist in the first act and then tick them off in the dim glow of the big screen.Whereas Battle Royale threw a solution at the public and didn't pretend it would resolve the breakdown of their society, The Purge seems to conveniently overlook the inevitable bitterness that would follow when neighbours kill each other. The Purge might allow them to release their pressure for twelve hours but it sure as hell isn't going to end the resulting tension the follows during the next 364 and a half days.Beyond the 'deeper' considerations, this falls apart as we watch a peaceful couple that opposes The Purge suddenly acquire the skills to convincingly fight a group of sociopaths who have been purging themselves for years. In Battle Royale, inept, innocent schoolgirls armed only with terror and a saucepan lid died pretty damn quickly! And the film was far more entertaining and shocking for it.Ethan Hawke holds the film together adequately as the husband and father fighting for the lives of his family, though how he prevents himself from screaming even once at his children 'What the hell were you thinking?' is beyond me. His wife, Mary (Lena Heady) is a victim waiting to happen (no, I'm not going to tell you if it works out for her), and if one of the family is going to cop it, she would absolutely get my vote.With Bloody Stranger being such an integral part of the plot, why does writer/director James DeMonaco not make more of him? Perhaps if the action wasn't restricted entirely to one house we might have seen more character interaction and development. Heck, we might have been better entertained. But I suppose there must be room to expand the inevitable sequel.With the arrival of Polite Stranger and the manner in which he deals with one of his own friends, expectation increases for an exciting villain and a game of chess where humans are the playing pieces and checkmate is terminal. Alas, Wakefield merely gives us a nut job with one emotional setting. And so it goes.The Purge is moderately violent, occasionally shocking (though never surprising) and a reasonably enjoyable nine-star idea that is diluted into a five-star film because it's so damn obvious.Save your cash and watch Battle Royale again instead.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5,0,0,10 June 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Slightly darker, far more thrilling mid-section of the trilogy
","As a general rule (The Godfather II, The Empire Strikes Back and one or two others), sequels don't match the high expectations set by the original films. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is another rare film that bucks the trend.I'm not saying it's a perfect film or one that will survive time to be hailed in the same breath as the afore mentioned sequels but, having read Suzanne Collins' trilogy, this second outing in the franchise is both more satisfying than the thoroughly enjoyable first film and stamps all over the source novel. Whether you're a reader or viewer, if The Hunger Games excited you, you're going to love the sequel! Set a year after Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) won the 74th Hunger Games, the reluctant couple find themselves on the Victors' Tour, visiting each of the districts and witnessing ever more desperate examples of oppression and abuse at the hands of President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Dissatisfied with their half-hearted effort to maintain the front as a loving couple, Snow recruits Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to devise a way to be rid of Katniss without causing a revolution: The Quarter Quell. Consequently, Katniss and Peeta find themselves back in the arena fighting for their lives, but this time their opponents are other former victors and the battle will be particularly vicious.As much as it is possible (and acceptable) to enjoy violence, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a very exciting and pleasing experience. Clocking in at well over two hours, it rattles along entertainingly and feels shorter and with far fewer glitches and flaws than its predecessor. There are a few, infrequent examples of clumsiness that could and really should have been avoided (a man executed in one scene is, moments later, carried away with nary a speck of blood on, or issuing from, him) and, naturally, there are elements of the book that have been condensed to fit the running time but despite those issues it remains a thoroughly entertaining film.The introduction of Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones) is a short-lived delight. He is just one victim in a long list of underused characters performed beautifully by accomplished actors (Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley TucciÂ…) but most audiences wouldn't sit through a four-hour epic and so there must be casualties. Woody Harrelson is allowed to evolve his Haymitch so that he adds more gravitas than light relief and the relationship with Haymitch and Katniss crackles frostily, remaining a highlight of the series.The 'love' triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) makes its way adequately into The Hunger Games: Catching Fire but, more than anything, sets up the third (and fourth for, alas, revenue dictates yet again that the final installment must be milked fully) installment. For Lawrence, this feels easy work. She knows her character and inhabits her with sufficient scorn and resentment to make us root for her without being so standoffish as to leave us questioning our feelings for her. The first of two autumnal cinema releases for Lawrence (next up is American Hustle), it is certain to further amplify the spotlight on Lawrence, a genuine movie star who is also a very fine actor.Come awards season, Lawrence may be a lucky winner of multiple gold for American Hustle, but as far as the masses are concerned, it will be The Hunger Games: Catching Fire that convinces them that she can open a film. A bona fide star in a dark and hugely entertaining romp. It may be a year away but I'm looking forward to parts three and four. What a pity the same cannot be said of The Hobbit.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7,1,14,6 December 2013
Godzilla," Transformers with dinosaurs. Only better.
","Do you remember the hype and build up to Roland Emmerich's much-anticipated Godzilla in 1998? Do you recall the disappointment that followed? Did you catch the hype and build up to Gareth Edwards' take on the behemoth? Does it follow the pattern? The short version is yes. And no. Godzilla doesn't live up to the hype, it doesn't match expectations and, yes, it is mildly disappointing. But as for it being a let down, nope, not so much. Edwards, in his second outing as director after 2010's low budget blinder, Monsters, gives us a big budget B movie packed with effects that thrills and entertains even if it doesn't excite, terrorize and inspire awe in the manner we'd like. Part of that comes down to Edward himself. Monsters was such a fine, unexpected delight and he set the bar so high for himself that it was unlikely he could surpass it with so much of other people's money and the pressure and interference that presumably brings.The Godzilla aficionados will possibly find much to howl at, but for the casual viewer and happy bystander amidst the havoc wreaking there is much to enjoy here with the nuke-crunching prehistoric monsters. A little more backstory and reason is given for the emergence of Godzilla and his prey, and the human interest story is given a fair run with the relationship between scientist-cum-embittered-conspiracy-theorist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his estranged, cynical, soldier son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).Though Taylor-Johnson has come a long way since Nowhere Boy and makes a reasonable focal point, Godzilla hangs on the name of Cranston, the biggest 'star' on screen here. That comparatively little is made of Joe is something of a surprise and the greatest disappointment. The charisma he threatens to exude is wasted in a lack of screen time and Taylor-Johnson's Ford has neither the impact to be truly memorable nor the circumstances to really shine on this occasion.Godzilla is sprinkled with a few actors who deserve more, but Edwards wastes them, or rather doesn't waste time on them when he can focus on monsters ripping cities to shreds. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife, Elle; Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa; David Strathairn as Admiral William Stenz; Sally Hawkins as Vivienne Graham; none of them are allowed to really sink their teeth into their characters or dominate the screen. Hawkins is particularly wasted (and more than a little wooden, alas), disappearing for a vast chunk of the movie and reappearing almost as an afterthought as though Edwards suddenly remembered she was on the payroll. Not that I'd noticed she had gone AWOL.Yes, Godzilla is the star of this franchise, but then so were the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park series, but that didn't stop Crichton and Spielberg from making the human characters count for something.There is some lovely camera work on display and this is where Edwards' Godzilla really shines. Frequently we are positioned behind people or objects, jostling for a view of the monsters, our vision frustratingly blocked by heads and obstacles, placing us right there in the action and causing us to unconsciously move in our seats to look around the obstruction. But is it enough? Will you enjoy Godzilla? Think of it as Transformers with dinosaurs (and a smidgen of Alien) only better and if that grabs you, take a punt. Better still, take the kids. And stand by for the sequel.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6,5,9,29 May 2014
Looper," This time travel crap; just fries your brain like an eggÂ…'
","Time travel films open up all manner of questions because of the paradoxes every action and reaction produce. If X occurred, surely Y would happen, which means X wouldn't happen after allÂ… And so it is with Looper. Alas, to avoid dishing out hugely unpopular plot spoilers I need to skirt around the concerns, so you'll just have to come round with cake and we can discuss it in private. But there are some pretty substantial issues with Looper that cause questions to be asked and lead to more than a couple of possible explanations as to what exactly is going on. Don't see it alone; you'll need a friend around to discuss it on the journey home.Equally, don't be put off. You don't need to be Einstein to enjoy Looper, as some of the audience provedÂ… In 2072, time travel is both possible and illegal and murder is more easily solved because corpses are harder to lose. However mobs and Mafiosi types are prevalent and have ingeniously devised a solution: tie your victim up and send him back in time to a location where a looper will be waiting to blow his/her brains out. However, when a looper's contract is up, they find themselves blowing the brains out of their older self. Except when looper Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stares down the barrel at a version of himself that is thirty years older, Old Joe (Bruce Willis) outsmarts him and so begins a cat and mouse chase where there are multiples of each species and most of them aren't called Joe.Confused? Good. Don't think any more or you'll confound yourself with your wondering and wandering along all the possible flows and tributaries that lead from them. Like, Is he actually... Dammit.Along with the quirks, possibilities and matters left to interpretation, there are one or two clear boo-boos that cut against the rules writer/director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) has set himself. I'm sure you can work out from the subject matter that there are occasional murders so I'm giving nothing away by stating that a particular murder in 2027 cuts against the rules. It's not a major problem in terms of enjoyment but it does cast a shadow over everything if minor errors are not avoided.There's only one way to watch Looper: suspend all disbelief, put your logic in stasis and get on with enjoying the romp. With that frame of mind employed, it's a superb film. No, it's not as intelligent a film as Inception, but it kicks the ass of Wanted and Gordon-Levitt is potentially a bigger star in the making than either Leonardo DiCaprio or James McAvoy.I'm not sure that I buy Gordon-Levitt as a young Willis but the transition is simple and effectively executed and it needn't stand in the way of a couple of hours of great entertainment. He's matured as an actor and, though he's been stamping around Hollywood for a good couple of decades, it's the last five years or so that have really seen him ascend the ranks and there's no sign of his climb slowing with both Spielberg's Lincoln and Don Jon's Addiction (which he also wrote and directed) in the can and Premium Rush earning plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic.As for Willis, it's good to see him earning his fee again in a film worthy of his presence rather than phoning it in for a fat wad in the truly awful The Expendables 2. Emily Blunt (Sara) and Jeff Daniels ably provide support, the former, sadly, barely stretched and the latter, as Abe, the loopers' boss, clearly enjoying himself. Equally, Paul Dano gives a wonderful, trademark sniveling wretch performance that is all too brief. But Looper belongs to Gordon-Levitt and One Tree Hill's Pierce Gagnon as the child, Cid, whose middle name is probably Damian. Unnerving is an understatement! There is a very strong argument that the best person to direct a film is the writer because s/he knows it better than anyone. Clearly that wasn't the case with Maximum Overdrive (Stephen King being the fine writer who should never be allowed either in front of or behind a camera again) but with Looper it's a very strong case in point.Johnson, though he bends his rules, has created a multi-layered, rapidly paced trip that is littered with bodies and to-die-for quips, to wit, 'I cleaned you up. And put a gun in your hand.' He juggles the time zones effortlessly and maintains the excitement while allowing sufficient moments for us to pause, cogitate and catch up before whipping us to the next sprint, jump or shoot-out. Though he has nothing (publicly) on the slate, there'll be plenty more from him in the next few years.As is increasingly the case, my biggest complaint with last night's viewing has nothing to do with the film itself but with the screening, namely the blown speakers all along one side of the auditorium (big thumbs down to Cineworld) and the moron in front who played with his phone and gave muted shrieks of excitement every time there was a shot or splatter of blood, even taking the time to relive it with his friend. Who are these people? Why are they allowed to breathe? When will time travel come to my aid? Ah, but these are niggles and hopefully you won't be subjected to such when you watch Looper. And do see it. Maybe you'll absolutely hate the confusion it causes you, but if you don't mind giving a film some real thought and you enjoyed the possibilities of Inception, then Looper is for you.Just don't think too hard. As Abe laments, 'This time travel crap; just fries your brain like an eggÂ…' For more reviews subscribe to www.thesquiss.co.uk Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",8,135,248,25 September 2012
What We Do in the Shadows," Vampire mocumentary that is less funny than intended. Spinal Tap this is not!
","From the team behind the hugely successful Flight of the Conchords and the fabulous indie hit, Eagle Vs Shark, What We Do in the Shadows is a comedy horror mockumentary with 'hilarious' stamped all the way through it.Except it isn't. Hilarious, that is.Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi write, direct, produce and perform in this spoof documentary about a group of vampire flatmates trying to deal with life in modern times and each other's annoying traits. Being immortal and hundreds of years old does not iron out the problems of who takes care of which chores in any given week. Nor, it appears, does being several centuries old help one iota when it comes to deciding what to wear to the nightclub.There is plenty to like on display: the costumes are fabulously camp, there are references aplenty to the great vampires of film and literature, the sets are fun and there are one or two lovely, practical effects that splatter blood, but nothing too horrific or likely to raise the pulse.There are even a couple of surprising, and very welcome digital effects thrown in. What We Do in the Shadows feels cheap and it's a surprise when the budget allows for something extra.But it isn't enough. The performances are adequate but it all feels a little too much like college kids playing at drama. Forget pastiche, this is weak parody and there is little skill in it here. Clement, as Vladislav, is amusingly gauche in his 'god's gift to women' act, but Waititi, as Viago, appears to have bought his performance, or at least his grin, from Danny John-Jules' Red Dwarf jumble sale. In terms of performances, the greatest joy comes from the deadpan, detachment of Stu (Stuart Rutherford) and Ben Fransham's Petyr, the bastard son of Nosferatu, whose dialogue would probably fit on the back of his fangs.Alas, there is a distinct lack of strong female roles on display here, with the women reduced to comedy fodder bit parts. When they appear, they are amusing, but perhaps What We Do in the Shadows could have benefited from a matriarchal touch.For years Christopher Guest has delighted audiences with mockumentaries like Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and the peerless This is Spinal Tap, and my guess is this this is what Clement and Waititi were aiming for. The trouble is, where Guest played it straight, they work too damn hard at eking out laughs at every turn. Heck, this is nowhere near as funny as Anvil: The Story of Anvil, and that wasn't even a spoof! Whilst not a flop by any means, What We Do in the Shadows was clearly far more amusing to make than it was to watch and the final, post-credit, line is sadly prophetic, and not for the reason they intend.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",4,23,74,3 December 2014
Cloud Atlas," A spectacle that entertains while simultaneously numbing the brain.
","Cloud Atlas is the latest event in the Wachowski brothers' adventure in cinema. Depending on which stage of their career path you look at, their name on the credits either excites or sinks the stomach. Beginning with the superb high of Bound, shot rapidly and cheaply to 'prove' they could be trusted with a mega budget for The Matrix, their career trajectory has been downwards ever since, bottoming out (hopefully) with the ill-judged, stodgy mess that was Speed Racer. Four years on and they're back with, well, what is it? Cloud Atlas is a spectacle. It's beautiful. The cinematography and effects edge towards astounding, are mostly satisfying and make for a very attractive, no, a stunning film. Visually, that is. Much (most?) is shot against green screens, which has allowed them to sculpt worlds that present to us that which swirls around in their minds. It's a trip most will enjoy looking at immensely.For me, the visuals are the principal selling point. The contrasts between the closed sets of a study and ship compared with the expansive realms of forests and cityscapes are expressed wonderfully; the costumes and make-up are vivid, imaginative and prompt silent games of Guess Who as the star names play multiple characters, Halle Berry and Jim Sturgess leading the pack with seven characters apiece.On the subject of stars, Cloud Atlas is packed with them: Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Ben Wishaw, James D'Arcy, Susan SarandonÂ… It's no mean feat watching each of them bounce between roles, so it must have been one heck of a task for each of them playing them. Each, without exception, manages to differentiate between characters suitably but, man, it's hard to keep up sometimes.Cloud Atlas is so chock-a-block full of worlds, times, characters and story lines that it becomes cluttered and confused early on and doesn't ever let up. Perhaps the best advice to heed when viewing Cloud Atlas is to approach it like Shakespeare: Don't attempt to understand every syllable of every word (or even every soliloquy, for that matter), just sit back, go with it and then assess what you've absorbed as the credits roll.I've said it before (most recently with American Mary) it's not a good sign when a film requires two directors. But three? Really? This is a classic case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Maybe the Wachowskis were so concerned about their rapid descent through Hollywood's hierarchy they felt they needed to bring in Tom Tykwer (Perfume: The Story of a Murderer) to save them. Perhaps they should have employed him and left him to it.Instead, despite/because three men shared the megaphone (as well as writing and producing duties), we have a three-hour head spin that entertains while simultaneously numbing the brain. Brevity is not in the directors' vocabulary; hell, you can even watch the 'extended' trailer, which is a full 5 minutes & 42 seconds, the length of some short films! So what is it actually about? Cloud Atlas is summed up perfectly in the final few minutes when Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) states, 'Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.' It's a beautiful sentiment that allows our thoughts and imaginations to journey across worlds, times and planes of existence and it's not the slightest issue that the journey Tykwer and the Wachowskis take us on is eight minutes shy of three hours. The issue is that feels like three hours! There is a more succinct explanation courtesy of Stephen King in his Dark Tower epic: 'Go, then, there are other worlds than these.'

Kingsman: The Secret Service," A sit back & go with the flow romp. Violent, bloody & hugely entertaining.
","Adapted from the acclaimed comic book by Jane Goldman (Stardust, The Woman in Black) and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick-Ass) Kingsman: The Secret Service is a sit back, put your feet up, go with the flow romp. It doesn't pretend to be anything else, and it achieves its goals admirably.Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is an agent with a super-secret undercover organization hidden behind the faÃ§ade of an exclusive tailor's outlet in London. When one of the Kingsman agents is killed in action, a brief, intensive selection process begins through which a replacement will be found. Whilst the majority of the potential recruits are public school educated and born with silver spoons in their mouths, Harry's proposition is Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a streetwise kid from the wrong side of town and a pitiful history. With death or expulsion the penalty for failing each task, Eggsy battles prejudice as well as aptitude tests in a bid to become a Kingsman.From the opening titles of Kingsman: The Secret Service we know we're up for fun. The credits tumble out like rocks from exploding walls as Vaughn sets the tone of adventure and derring-do. We think we know where we're going but Goldman and Vaughn have formed a reliable partnership that maintains the ability to surprise, to appall and to shock simultaneously. This is tongue-in-cheek, logic be damned magic.Throughout Kingsman: The Secret Service we are treated to bloody, violent, beautiful choreography that leaves us wincing, laughing and admiring the audacity of the mayhem they spread across the screen. The church sequence is a marvel to behold and a scene that Tarantino must wish he had created first. As for the grand, spectacular finale, well, let's just say you've never seen fireworks like this! It is a visual triumph that is, in an odd kind of way, mind-expanding. Riotous, beautiful and very funny indeed.One of the great joys of Goldman's and Vaughn's collaborations is that they seem not to care too much what anybody thinks. They just do it. They know the rules and they play the Hollywood game but they do it their way. Product placement has long been a standard of filmmaking, and though there is plenty of it on display here, one particular example is the funniest, classiest most blatant since, well, ever! Like Goldman's and Vaughn's other work, Kingsman: The Secret Service doesn't take itself seriously. It is joyfully camp at times, frequently taking digs at the genre it is mocking. In the Roger Moore years, James Bond became a buffoon, an unbelievable pastiche of himself. Here, Bond gets a makeover and frivolous fun is on the agenda throughout. All the ingredients are here: a super villain, excess, beauty and gadgets. This is gadget heaven and umbrellas have suddenly become cool.Colin Firth is clearly having an absolute blast as the suave agent. Who needs Paddington to boost your cinematic profile when you can shoot, stab, smash and bludgeon this stylishly? Firth is a class act and this is proof once again that there is far more to him than simply the stiff upper lip persona.Samuel L. Jackson is on scenery munching duty the as Valentine, a twisted tech genius holding the world to ransom under the guise of being its savior, and why not? There's a certain amount of ham in his performance but it works perfectly here and he's in good company.Egerton makes for a fine, watchable secondary hero that we may perhaps find it easier to identify with but he's not in the same league as Colin Firth or Michael Caine and does not easily drag our attention away from them. Mark Strong's accent takes a little while to settle in but he, too, brings light humour and a certain gravitas to Kingsman: The Secret Service, as we have come to expect from his presence.There are plenty of gaps in the plot (at what point does Eggsy actually learn to fight properly?), and occasionally the humour is a little too obvious and slips below the level Vaughn sets, but all of these glitches and flaws are forgivable when a film is this much fun.Unfortunately, when a film is as much fun as Kingsman: The Secret Service, the temptation (and pressure from the studio) must surely be there to forge a sequel. Let's hope Goldman and Vaughn resist that money making exercise and leave Kingsman to stand proudly as a unique experience that thrills and entertains completely.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,3,10,3 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," No hangover, no laughs, no point.
","I attempted to clean my brain out after the dire waste of life that was The Moth Diaries. Only humour would help.Alas, humour was in very short supply in The Hangover Part III.So were hangovers, for that matter, but perhaps that's just being picky when there are so many other issues to be riled about. However, I don't care. I lost the will to live, or at least explain my life, somewhere after the tenth minute. This turgid film follows the law of diminishing returns.The Hangover (2009) was inventive and funny; a true sleeper hit that took the world by storm and entertained enormously.The Hangover Part II (2011) was crass.The Hangover Part III is just crap.This time round Doug (Justin Bartha), Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) take Alan (Zach Galifianakis) on a road trip to the funny farm as he's losing the plot. And not in a funny way. Rather than being more eccentric, more extreme and more bizarre, Alan is just unpleasant. And, no, that's not funny either. Along the way they get dragged into Marshall's (John Goodman) underworld and must locate his missing millions and the equally missing Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong).Oh, and Jeong gets his willy out again just so we can be sure it really is that tiny. How I split my sides...That's pretty much it. The plot of The Hangover Part III is as thin as Patrick Stewart's hair and only marginally more amusing. It never goes anywhere (the plot, not Stewart's hair), revisits old scenes, squeezes in the characters and situations it feels obliged to and bumbles along until the end wanders in from the wings and plonks itself down in front of us.Rather than give us something new, writer/director Todd Phillips prefers to stick with feeble tradition and dispense with Doug early on. He then rolls in Heather Graham, as Jade, again but forgets that she is a funny and engaging actress and squanders the opportunity to brighten up his dull thud of a film.To be fair, the obligatory post-film credit scene raised a smile but we shouldn't have to wait 90-odd minutes for the first real bout of humour. The funniest sequences in the actual film (i.e. the bits I smiled at) are in the trailer and were far funnier for being shorter: Alan singing at his father's funeral (dealt with in the first five minutes) and the decapitation of the giraffe (tragically over-egged in the film) both worked far better in their severely edited form.Todd clearly has yet to learn that less is more. But that's pretty much the way it runs in The Hangover Part III. At least it doesn't have the racist undertones of the second installment.Take it from me, if you've seen the trailer of The Hangover Part III, you've seen just about everything worthwhile. Save the price of your ticket, buy some beer and watch the original The Hangover again instead.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",2,3,6,5 June 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Subtle tale of folk music & cats. Sharply written, viciously funny.
","There are two versions of Coen brothers (I'm not including the evil, shadowy version that inflicted The Ladykillers on us). Inside Llewyn Davis is not from the Coens of The Big Lebowski or Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? This is from the gloomy, shuffling, subtle Coens of The Man Who Wasn't There.Know this from the outset: this isn't for flighty fans who want to sing along, laugh out loud and enjoy the romp. This is a slow, inward-looking film that gently delights and brings smiles that occasionally bubble into light chuckles. I loved it.Taking a week out of the life of a young, troubled and struggling folk singer from Greewhich Village, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), Inside Llewyn Davis follows him as he trudges from sofa to sofa in a New York winter as bitter as himself, searching for validation and a breakthrough, incapable of seeing that the greatest obstacle in the way of success is himself.Of the regular Coen company only John Goodman is present, as irascible jazz musician Roland Turner, filling the back seat and armed with a cane, but as we have come to expect from Joel & Ethan's work, the screen is littered with memorable characters that aren't so much carved as cut from the script with pinking shears, jagged edges catching on those around them.Always beautifully written, their characters are brought to life by an invariably eclectic bunch, from New York outsiders to Hollywood stars. Lead from the front by Oscar Isaac, sprinkled through this 104 minute joy are the likes of Justin Timberlake, F. Murray Abraham and Carey Mulligan, as the fantastically dour, dowdy and razor-tongued Jean. When she sneers at Llewin, 'Everything you touch turns to s***, you're like King Midas' idiot brother' we laugh and shrivel simultaneously. Hers is a wonderfully nuanced performance of a character that is sharp of tongue and blunt in attitude. With evenings spent in her company, is it any wonder that Llewin's self-esteem packed up and went south long ago?Isaac, in a rare but welcome lead role, marries the social ineptitude of Llewyn with the natural talent and bloody-mindedness that attracts friends and supporters before pummeling their emotions. We cringe, not from Issac's performance, but from each verbal bludgeoning Llewyn dishes out in his tiny life cycle. It is like watching a blinkered hamster lumbering around a barbed wire wheel when there is a vast stretch of calm and freedom a couple of steps to the left.Shot with muted hues that peak at 'dim' and trough at 'dull', Inside Llewyn Davis is a delightful comedy of folk music and cats with undertones of Greek mythology that takes its time, wanders at its own pace and stings with killer dialogue that the Coens have mastered.Where else would you hear a character screech 'Where's his scrotum?'For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,0,2,17 February 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," An entertaining, thrilling and titillating bloodbath.
","It's not easy to write a review about The Cabin in the Woods without giving away a fairly important plot point so stop reading after the next paragraph if you don't want to know too much. For that matter, don't watch the trailer either because that definitely gives away the game! The initial impression is that it'll be another standard teen romp that we've all seen a million times: Group of good looking teenagers go away together for a weekend of adventure, arguments and innocent(ish) sex, meet and insult a very obviously 'if I had an IQ two points higher I'd be a daffodil and I'm definitely unhinged' local man and it all goes belly up from there. However, this is co-written by Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dollhouse, and 'standard' doesn't enter into it. If you like twists, darkness, a little bit of horror and the odd belly laugh and enjoyed the likes of Zombieland and The Cube, you'll probably enjoy this.******* SIGNIFICANT PLOT SPOILER ALERT ******* The five friends (two girls, two boys and one male geek) head off for a break to a cousin's cabin that none has visited before. Meanwhile, in a control room somewhere, a large production team places bets on an outcome, exchanges banter and launches a new, well, what is it? Game? Broadcast? Event? All will be revealed but what is very evident early on is that money and technology are absolutely no object when it comes to providing an entertaining, thrilling and titillating bloodbath in the cabin that is not quite the simple, decrepit wooden structure it appears.The younger, beautiful cast members are adequate but unremarkable cannon fodder, headed by the hunk of Thor, Chris Hemsworth. The real casting delight comes in the form of a 'surprise' character late on and, particularly, the ever-brilliant Richard Jenkins (Burn After Reading, The Rum Diary, Eat Pray Love) and Bradley Whitford (Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, West Wing) who are both effortlessly entertaining and add the weight of real talent and experience to the humour and panic they inject into the control room. Without Jenkins and Whitford, The Cabin in the Woods would still be fun but their presence, for me, makes it a must-see for non-puritans.From a deliberately predictable start, it rattles through to the suspenseful arrival at the cabin and then, shall we say 'when the doors open', all hell breaks loose in a mess ofÂ… Nope. I can't give it away. Just watch it! And more than once. Suffice to say, it's superbly written with nary a duff scene, a few genuine surprises (sometimes because the action has rattled along so swiftly you'll have forgotten about the set-up) and some laugh-out-loud dialogue.On a second viewing, you'll spot more clues in the opening titles and you'll want to revisit it for the reveal of all the possible directions it could have taken. The second viewing is no less entertaining but is a different experience and it's heartening to know that the Hollywood money grabbers are leaving The Cabin in the Woods well alone. When director Drew Goddard was asked at a preview screening Q&A 'Will there be a sequel?' he sardonically replied 'Have you seen the ending to my movie?' Is it good? Hell yes! What's not to like about a film with thrills, blood, bodies and lines like 'Good work, zombie arm.' Another film review from The Squiss.

Her," Digital love, human emotion. Another 'Wow!' from one of Hollywood's most inventive directors.
","In the not-too-distant future, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a writer who earns his living composing heartfelt letters for other people, is alone, lonely, almost divorced from Catherine (Rooney Mara), and playing video games with characters that are abusive to him. Seduced by an impressive ad campaign, Theodore buys a new operating system, answers a few questions, selects a female voice and 'meets' Her.The Her in question is OS1, aka Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), but, as the commercial states, 'It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness.' And so begins Theodore's and Samantha's relationship; a relationship that transcends that of computer and owner to become an affair of love and mutual understanding.Spike Jonze's (who also wrote the screenplay) fourth feature as director is an odd and slightly disturbing look at our need to replace reality with technology. Incapable of making genuine friends we boast of having hundreds of Facebook 'friends; at a loss for meaningful conversation we revel in the banality of Twitter and its 140 character restrictions. Now, incapable of finding true love and happy ever after, we create a substitute for love with binary. The shock with Her is not that humanity could fail so monumentally that it must resort to the digital version of a sex doll but that Jonze masterfully makes it seem perfectly reasonable and palatable.Her is perhaps the audio companion to the video of S1m0ne. Whereas Andrew Nichol's film gave us a movie star who was pure fantasy in physically form, Jonze has written a character that is seemingly real in everything but body. So advanced is the artificial intelligence that Samantha learns, suggests, leads and fully relates to Theodore. She is not merely a 'perfect' plaything that he controls completely and switches on and off at will, she has a mind of her own, a brain that hungers for touch and experiences, and she has a will as forceful as any human partner's.Her looks at the cycle of relationships and asks us questions about ourselves, our hopes and our expectations. It is at times uncomfortable viewing as it forces us to look at how we deal with our emotions, how we react to those of our partners and what we invest in our personal relationships. Like Lars and the Real Girl, Her presents the issue as a actuality rather than an issue that we can dismiss as pure fantasy, and that is why it is uncomfortable viewing. Would you go there? How would you handle it if your friend introduced you to his new girlfriend and she turned out to be a voice on a computer? Jonze cleverly balances the desirable futuristic advances with frightening possibilities while avoiding the obvious route of prejudice and judgment from others. Theodore's friend, Amy (Amy Adams), doesn't just tolerate his 'relationship', she supports it, understands it and embraces it to the point of going on a double date with the happy couple.Phoenix gives another sensitive performance that allows us to care about and invest our time in Theodore. It's not that Theodore is a hero of the modern age, it's that, like us, or people we know, he has seen the flaw in his emotional life and advanced beyond Internet or speed dating and found an instant solution without the trauma of introductions and clumsy invitations to dance. It is a performance that very quickly dissolves the natural questions we have of 'But how do theyÂ…?' and replaces them with 'Would IÂ…?' Johansson's performance, though not as naturalistic as the girl next door Samantha initially sets out to be, yet again raises the question asked with Robin Williams' Aladdin and repeated most recently with Andy Serkis' Gollum: When is the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences finally going to create new Oscar category for Best Vocal Performance? I'm not saying, on the strength of Her, that she would deserve to win it, but it is just the latest, convincing performance from an actor who doesn't have the luxury of body or facial expressions to hide behind.With a wonderful score from Arcade Fire to compliment the emotional battle upon the screen, Her is yet another fine achievement from one of the most original and inventive writer/directors working in Hollywood today. Yes, it's probably a 'niche' film, but this niche is deep enough to hold an awful lot admirers. Take a punt and join me in it.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8,0,1,3 March 2014
Warm Bodies," Dull, dull, dull, dreary, twee, dull. Take only the kids you don't like!
","Warm Bodies opens with a long, rambling, interminable voice-over from sort-of-zombie, R (Nicholas Hoult). I say 'sort of' because here the rules of being a zombie have changed and R's kind of zombie is known as a 'corpse', as opposed to a 'skeleton' (the very bad zombies). And maybe 'interminable' isn't quite correct; it certainly feels endless but is interspersed with snatches of dialogue from the group of teenagers sent out from their walled city to collect medical supplies for their community.However, 30 minutes in, a full third of the movie, I was ready to start eating my toes just for a little excitement. It did pick up the barest hint of a heartbeat in the final third but, rather than opting for action, it wandered of in the direction of twee twaddle.R thinks. He explains in painful, trudging detail how he sees something more than regular zombies. He tells us about his best friend, M (Rob Corddry), another zombie he meets occasionally in the airport where they live, to stare and grunt at each other. Occasionally, apparently, they manage to utter a complete word. Then, while eating her boyfriend's brain, R sees Julie (Teresa Palmer), falls in love, takes her home, and begins evolving at an astonishing rate. Love, it transpires, can bring you back from the dead.But all good love stories need a dark side and here we have two: First up are the skeletons, those zombies who have given up all hope, ripped off their skin and are in it just for the bloodshed; then there's Grigio (John Malkovich), big daddy of the walled city and father of, dumb dumb dummmmm, Julie. In traditional, two-dimensional style, Grigio has forgotten how to show love, is unpleasant, won't listen to reason and just wants to kill zombies.And so it goes on. For 98 minutes that feel like a lifetime in purgatory.Warm Bodies is dull. It establishes its pace (deathly crawl) and maintains it for all but the final fifteen minutes. Writer/director Jonathon Levine (All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) forgets to explain or make the evolution reasonable. In the space of a few minutes the corpses go from grunting the odd intelligible word to communicating in staccato sentences, gesticulating and running smoothly.The makeup is awful, the CGI for the skeletons looks like something Ray Harryhausen produced 60 years ago with his hands, the acting is ropey to say the least and the script hasn't so much been written as slapped together with papier-mÃ¢chÃ©.Maybe Warm Bodies suffers by emerging in the wake of the excellent, bloodthirsty The Walking Dead. Maybe it's just because it's dull, tedious, twee and annoying. Did I say it's also dull? Come back Twilight, all is forgiven. Better still, roll on The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Let's have the return of teen movies that understand their demographic actually has a brain.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",2,3,5,25 July 2013
