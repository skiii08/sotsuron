Alien 3," Don't Believe The Bad Hype
","Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.",10,3,5,31 August 2013
