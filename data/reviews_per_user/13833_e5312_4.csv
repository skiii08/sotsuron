The Avengers," A great merge of many great movies
","As many, I have been waiting for this film since ages. As I was quite fond of all the previous Avenger movies, I obviously had great expectations, some were fulfilled and some were not. The movie started quite thrilling. Bringing in the Chitauri was brilliant, I kinda wish they would have got a bigger part in the story than just being the bad-ass alien army to defeat. But of course, as the film had so many things to expand it would have been a little bit too much. And that was quite the bad point in the movie, even though I was expecting it to happen. With so many main characters and with all their background stories, there was not enough time to unfold everything that was behind the story. By that I mean, some of the characters were not even near as complex as in the previous movies. For example, I think Thor turned out to be pretty one-sided in this film. I really liked the movie Thor and while it was obvious that most characters were not going to be in this one, I still missed Hopkins, Portman and Dennings, mostly because the character of Thor was more like the angry prince like in the beginning of the movie Thor, rather than the wise king he had became in the end of it. Another problem the amount of characters brought up was that the movie was a bit too fast. Unlike the calmer nature of the original films, in this one there was always something happening, mostly fight scenes. I love fight scenes and usually enjoy them to the most, but only with a fine balance of them and calmer moments. Of course in short terms, it was very amazing and exciting, but when it came to the death scene of Coulson, as Fury sat next to him in silence had I only realized how tired one can get of seeing almost nothing but battles for an entire movie. Yet, as I've said before, with so many characters making this film calmer would have been simply impossible. The acting otherwise was really nice, the crew seemed to do their best during the whole film. Smulders was a pleasant surprise, she was truly marvelous in the role of Agent Hill. Ruffalo was just as well a good exchange of Norton, he made the character of Bruce Banner very likable. The scores also did catch up to the spirit of the film pretty well, the music kept you in the mood during the whole time. As for the amazing sides of the film, the visuals were utterly cutting-edge. 3D effects were not that outstanding though, guess it still does not really worth the headache. For a sequel (as I hope one will happen in the near future), I just hope that they will have more space and time to expand the characters' personalities a bit more precisely. As for the first film to merge all these stories, I don't think they could have done any better. Maybe not the best directing nor the best superhero movie of all time, but for sure is a fun film to watch with many great moments and good acting. A must-see for all Marvel fans.",7,3,12,26 April 2012
Memento," An unforgettable movie but not the best from Nolan
","We have a really original story here: Leonard, a man suffering from short-term memory loss is hunting for the man who raped and killed his wife. I guess I don't have to mention that his illness does not make his job easy, since once he starts a conversation, at about the fifth sentence he forgets how did it start, and only takes him a while 'til he forgets who is he talking with. Basically he can't remember anything since the day he got the wound on his face, but thanks to the notes and photographs he keeps creating all the time he manages to find the killer. Or at least that's what he thinksÂ… The directing is most definitely what makes this movie as unique as it is. The whole story is going backwards, so you just have to wait for the reasons, they will always come later. It reminded me a lot of French movie Irreversible, which had almost the same schema, but of course Memento is two years older, and to be honest I didn't like Irreversible since I found it a bit weird. On the other hand, the whole movie somehow magically reminded me of Fight Club, the thing between Leonard and Sammy was a bit like the 'connection' between the Narrator and Tyler. Crazy, I must say.Watching this film was a nice and interesting experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who is not scared of a little headache while trying to figure out what is going on. Not the best from Nolan but definitely worth watching.",6,1,3,15 January 2012
Shutter Island," A real twist
","I got myself to watch this movie since a lot of people kept saying how much better this was than Inception. It's hard to compare the two movies, since they both do amazing at their own kind. I'm a true fan of Inception, but the great psychological content made this film absolutely unforgettable to me.Just to start with, we're in 1954, on an isolated island where an asylum for the criminally insane takes place (in other words, they have put some of my very favorite subjects together, nice). Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) visits the island on the purpose of investigating the disappearance of one of their patients (or as he calls them 'prisoners'), but from the very beginning he knows that something is wrong with the place. As the events go on, there are more and more weird things happening, and all together with Teddy's tragic memories as a war hero and from his personal life, he's starting to see hallucinations and feeling worse about the whole situation. Time passing by, he seems to be losing his sense of reality, and becomes more and more aware of that there's something the staff of the mental hospital won't tell him. He continues on with his investigation, but there are dark things awaiting him to find out. One question which is up during the whole movie: is there really conspiracy, or is the reason of the unreasonable oddity something more obvious, which he can't see through the veil of his past blinding him? The atmosphere of the movie is magnificent, and the acting was great as well. I'm not one big fan of DiCaprio, but I must admit that he did an amazing job in this movie, probably the most amazing act of his I have seen so far. The movie had its scary moments, and it was really exciting so it's nearly impossible to get bored of.I recommend Shutter Island to everyone who likes films that makes the audience think after watching them, or even read a couple of film analysis to fully understand what they have seen. In short, a beautiful masterpiece of modern cinema.",9,3,6,15 January 2012
Zombieland," Maybe a zombie apocalypse wouldn't be that scary after all
","When you think there are no more cool zombie movies left, you just always happen to watch an awesome new one. Zombieland was another example for this fact.The whole story is built up in such a funny way that the fact that the world is taken over by zombies doesn't appear scary at all. Our main character, Columbus is a typical geek from your everydays who could only survive the zombie apocalypse due to his fear of countless things. All the characters are lovely on their own way, and it's really adorable how they become kind of a family as the movie rolls on.The great sense of humor that appears in the movie permanently makes it really enjoyable and fun to watch, and with the great soundtrack it really gives you the feeling that probably a zombie apocalypse wouldn't be that deadly after all.Not much more to say, a fun and entertaining horror comedy that will definitely give you some good laughs.",8,1,3,15 January 2012
