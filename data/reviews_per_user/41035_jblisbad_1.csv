Blade Runner 2049," Get me outta here
","F*** me this is worse than going to church every Sunday.... I knew when my mum whipped out her f*****g iPhone 7 to show me the trailer of the film and the internet where our holiday accommodation was, was that s**t it wouldn't load.... that this was a risky feat. Anyhow my sister, mum and I took to the cinema with expectations that were not fulfilled. I reckon I dozed off quicker than a dog being put down because the thunderstorm was too violent, so it escaped and took a chunk outta a lil girls f*****g leg. After the first hour or so of enduring this motion picture, I kept telling myself it'll get better... Kinda like the people living in Ethiopia... But just like the citizens of Ethiopia it was just skin and bone, boring. I would give this to psychologists to put there mentally unstable patients in a deep sleep. F*** you Harrison Ford I'm still waiting for Indiana Jones 5 and as for you Ryan Gosling, you make me disgusted to be Australian. I thought that this film was about Oscar Pistorious... You know the one that slaughtered his girlfriend in the bathroom. God damn the title 'Blade Runner' is so misleading.",1,10,21,5 November 2017
