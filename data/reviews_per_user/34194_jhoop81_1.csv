Captain Phillips," A movie that is well worth the price of admission
","I'm sure Tom Hanks will be up for an Oscar with this role. But man I'm telling you that capt of the pirates deserve an Oscar or at least a Oscar nominee for best supporting role or something. I've never seen him before until this movie but I'm telling you he really is the reason this movie is like a fun roller coaster. Hanks is brilliant as well and his character play in the last 15 minutes is sure to make you jerk/hide a tear. Just a great movie through out and if you are about to have a movie date or outing and you are looking for a movie that is worth admission this is the one without question. One that will get off to a suspenseful start pretty much 10 minutes into the movie, and from there will just lure you in more and more with action, suspense, and drama. And occasionally or maybe I should say about 5 or 6 times the entire movie you will chuckle at what really is not meant to be comedy it just comes out that way given how the characters appear. But trust me this movie does not in anyway need to be funny to sustain its high level of suspense action and drama. It is just fine with all it offers. Enjoy people and you can thank me later :) !",9,1,7,13 October 2013
