Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pure escapism in keeping with the Star Wars tradition.
","I have read many comments about the nature of the screenplay and the high-tech special effects, but seldom do I read that the Phantom Menace is a wonderful and pure fantasy experience. I have been a fan of the Star Wars saga since first viewing episode 4 in theaters and have found myself, on occasion, completely immersed in the lore and mythology of this universe. The Phantom Menace proved to me that there is so much more to the Star Wars world than that which we have all read, and dreamed about in the past. This exploration into the lives of individuals on, until now, unheard of planets was completely in keeping with the tradition of Star Wars thus far. Everything is new to us and therefore should not be judged as critically as the direction that the reviews often seem to take. Could it be that other planets have advanced technically more quickly than those in the previous episodes? Could some catastrophic event have occurred in the universe (eg. the Clone Wars) that could have wiped out many technological advances from the galaxy? This is the beauty of Star Wars. It took place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, and none of us could possibly know how its history and technology could change life from one episode to the other. So please remember, when watching this new world unfold before your eyes, that it is a world unlike our own, supporting flora and fauna, human and alien, and a technical knowledge that we can't help but to believe is possible. I recommend that all Star Wars fans take a trip to see the Phantom Menace.",10,0,1,14 March 2000
