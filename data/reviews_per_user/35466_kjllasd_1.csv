Black Swan," Silly movie
","Natalie Portman spends much of the movie flapping her stiff arms in an artsy ballet rehearsal room. She has been made to appear anorectic, what may have earned her an Oscar taking into consideration the fact that she had had her head shaved for another movie previously. Painful to watch the transitions from her sticky frame to a dancer body double and back again. Good intentions galore but you cannot make a ballet movie when the star is not a trained dancer. Hollywood may wish to believe so, and there will be a few viewers to agree, but in the end this is too embarrassing to watch. Skinny Natalie Portman looks wistful in facial closeups, passable in full body shots, but she is just plain awful from the neck down. And her arm flapping is just comical. She turned up for Oscars pregnant and ready to burst, maybe her way to comment on this silly movie.",Null,2,3,16 February 2013
