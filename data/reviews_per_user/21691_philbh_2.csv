The Blair Witch Project," Worst Movie of all time
","One of the most famous bits in the Blair Witch Project has to be when the female (can't remember her name - more on this later) is apologising for bringing them all out into the woods.  'I'm so sorry' she blubbers.  This I believe is what the makers of this movie should be doing right now.Never have I been so bored out of my skull watching a movie - it has to be the worst film of all time. In my first sentence I said that I don't remember the characters names, and there is a good reason for this.  I don't care enough about these characters.  I don't care if they live or die, I just wanted something to happen so that I hadn't wasted £20.  Again, let's take a look at the female, why didn't she put that Camera down and make a run for civilization?I sat through the first 1h10m thinking when is this going to get scary, when finally things started to get interesting.  I sat up and paid attention, my heart starting to beat a bit harder, the movie finally begining to show promise.  Sadly, the movie finished without making good on this promise, and the feeling of utter disapointment reared it's head.One good thing though was the fact that I had the DVD version which contained the vastly superior documentary 'the curse of the Blair Witch'.  This is closer to what the actual movie should have been.  As I have told many people before, the 'real footage' should have been intercut into a larger whole.  A proper movie with the kids going out looking for the witch, then them not returning home, a police search, finding the footage followed by clips, then they either find the missing youths (dead or alive) and get a little bit closer to solving the mystery (Scooby Doo ending anybody?).   As the movie stands it seems to be unfinished (possibly the lure of a sequel was too much to handle!) it is a complete waste of time - avoid this at all costs.",Null,0,1,8 June 2000
American Pie," I am probably amoung a minority but....
","I only recently saw American Pie, and was quite looking forward to finally seeing it, so now imagine my disappointment after buying the DVD.  Now, don't accuse me of not being into crude comedy, but this movie just wasn't funny.Ok, it had it's moments, but alas I can't remember them at this time, but man that was another 1 and a half hours of my life wasted along with £20. I seem to have been struck by a plague of  awful movies over the past few months, I've probably wasted £300 so far.The infamous pie scene was not even remotely funny.  If it's comedy you want stay away from this one and go for some classic Monty Python or Mel Brooks rather than this one.If I had more thumbs I'd give it 4 thumbs down.",Null,0,0,9 June 2000
