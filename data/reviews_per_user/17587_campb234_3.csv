Requiem for a Dream," I'm not going to tell you what you already know...If you haven't watched this you need to.
","So, I finally watched this movie yesterday, 13 years after it's release. I remember hearing about this movie over the years and I had wanted to see it, but I never got around to it for various reasons. I am glad and disappointed that I waited this long. I have seen most of the directors other films (I always forget how to spell his name so I just won't) and I guess I wasn't surprised at how intense this one was. It was very interesting to think of how the movie opened and closed. It was the same mood, tone, etc, but that's all I will say. There are already over a thousand reviews for this, and I doubt anyone will see this, but if they do thank you for reading. This is one of the most horrifying non horror movies ever. Now I know why everyone always references it.",9,1,2,15 September 2013
Warrior," Could not get behind this one.
","Does contain spoilers.First, Let me say that I am a fan of Nolte and Hardy, and I also really enjoyed 'pride and glory'. The difference is that I was actually able to finish that film. O'Connor has a knack for creating/showcasing tension between family members, and 'Warrior' is no exception. The movie is shot well and the MMA stuff is pretty cool, although I am a fan of boxing myself, but the movie is just too clich√©, and perhaps that's why I wasn't able to finish it. For example, the principle reprimands Brenden but eventually comes around. Paddy destroys his sobriety, and the guilt becomes too much for Tommy. I think the acting and dialogue was good, but the MMA seemed more like an afterthought to me. I hope one day I can go back to finish it because I made to the last fight, but I don't know if I care to see what I know is going to happen. For an MMA movie, it's sad that it is the least enjoyable part of the movie, and that's not to say the fighting is bad, it's good, I just think the drama between the three is more important and more enjoyable.",6,0,2,20 July 2013
Drive," Decide for yourself. Don't Let Negativity Sway you.
","This May contain spoilers. I haven't seen it in a while, but I know I've seen it at least 5 times. I recall watching trailers, but I unfortunately didn't get to see it until I watched in on Netflix about a year ago.First off, I would like to acknowledge everyone that responded to this film negatively whether it be the slow pace, useless action, or whatever. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I'm really surprised how people feel so offended by this film.For those people who say the plot is useless, it's kind of shocking to me how they missed the plot that is there. This is supposed to be a noir type of film. I don't think it set out to be the greatest movie ever, but as a 'period piece' or even homage to the 80s I think it was successful. When the title sequence began and Kavinsky's 'Nightcall' began playing I instantly fell in love, and to be honest, like a lot of negative reviews, the soundtrack made the film for me, but that could be because I love 80s music, and more so the recent emergence of 'French House/Nu Disco/Dreamwave' Not once was a taken out of the movie and thought 'The acting could be better.' To be honest, the characters that made the least sense to me were those played by Cranston and Perlman, although, they do provide back story to the driver's mysterious past. I remember one instance where Cranston talks about how he made money off of the driver (something of that effect) so you know they are a team of sorts, both in movies and on the street.I don't see how people can view the violence as irrelevant. The guy is helping his neighbor, and he's dealing with gangsters. Hostel is useless violence, I thought all of the action sequences were entertaining and well-fitting. He's obviously not just a driver.About the pace. All I have to say is, did people criticize Kubrick's films for people slow paced and confusing? Maybe, but just look how well they have stood the test of time. 2001 and Eyes Wide Shut are still a couple of my favorite movies.Bottom line: Don't let negative reviews stop you from watching this if you have yet to do so. Watch it and decide for yourself.",8,2,6,20 July 2013
