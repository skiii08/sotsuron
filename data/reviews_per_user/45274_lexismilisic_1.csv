Come and See," Aleksey's performance
","I was deeply affected by Aleksey Kravchenko's (Florya) performance in Elem Klimoc's film 'Come and See'. From the beginning of the story, we see an innocent boy, somewhat emotionally foreign from the direct contact of savages and war. His naive eyes sparkle and show interest toward the idea of war, yet he has no idea as to the trouble that is about to drop dead before him. As he is introduced to the turmoil that his country and people are going through, his innocence diminishes and with him we begin to experience Florya's journey into adulthood. Throughout the movie, Florya detachment from his youth is heartbreaking; he is immediately thrown into the cruel world of men and machinery. The character Florya, along with Klimoc's stylistic approaches, drew me in and made me feel emotionally involved from beginning to end. This is one of the most powerful war films I have ever seen.",9,1,1,26 July 2012
