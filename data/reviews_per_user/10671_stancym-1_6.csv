3:10 to Yuma," This screams out for you to see the ORIGINAL!
","The original 3:10 to Yuma with talented, magnetic, and sexy actors Glenn Ford and Van Heflin is one of the best Westerns ever made. Crisp direction, believable plot and character development, terrific mood and atmosphere, fine cinematography. Great music even, and music can add a LOT to a Western. Get it from your public library or on NETFLIX and you'll spend a worthwhile hour and a half.I always have doubts when a classic is remade. It is usually not as good, but this one is bloody awful! I've read so many pithy critical reviews of this version that there is really no need to add any details. I WILL say, during my viewing of the DVD I kept backing it up and replaying scenes, saying to myself, 'I must have misunderstood, cause that makes no sense!' or 'I can't believe that just happened; that is absurd.' Sure enough, the movie absolutely insults our intelligence and our credulity, over and over again.I liked the review that was titled 'plot holes that can be seen from outer space.' Amen to that. SEE THE ORIGINAL 50's VERSION if you want to see a good Western, which bears no resemblance to this remake.",1,1,4,3 March 2012
The Other Boleyn Girl," Why did they bother with a bit of accuracy at the end?
","OK, I will admit that since I am descended from Mary Boleyn,I do have a bit of family honor at stake here....I knew the film was going to take liberties with historical truth, but REALLY. The Other Boleyn Girl is almost PURE FICTION from beginning to end. Why did they bother to tack on SOME accurate historical outcomes (in written sentence form) of the characters at the end, just before the credits rolled? Just to name a couple of examples: Mary Boleyn was married to William Carey as depicted, and Henry took her as his mistress with Carey's approval as he was richly rewarded. Maybe emotionally conflicted approval, I don't know. I rather doubt it. Anyway, in the film Mary marries a commoner at the end. The film never explains what happened to Carey, it would seem to suggest she is committing bigamy! In the closing 'write-over', we read that Mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy; in fact, her family coldly rejected her because she brought down their status. She suffered emotionally and financially due to the marriage, but was still glad she finally married for love. Other things that are totally false: Anne and Mary did not hang out all the time as is suggested in the film; I understand that serves the plot well so maybe I will let that one go. Can't let this one go: Henry raping Anne before she surrendered to him. That is ridiculous. And Anne convincing her brother to have incest with her so as to produce an heir? That is even more ridiculous. She would never have broken the incest taboo; also, if Henry was really shunning her bed by that time, as Anne suggests in the film, then if she turned up pregnant she would be accused of adultery and sent to the Tower! Speaking of being sent to the Tower, in real life Anne conducted herself with great dignity and restraint before and at her execution, likely she was trying to protect her daughter Elizabeth and better secure her daughter's future relationship with Henry. She was innocent of adultery but kept her mouth shut when she knew her fate was sealed. This is not at all how Anne is portrayed in the film. Cardinal Wolsey is left out of the movie entirely, and he played a MAJOR role in the whole drama of the divorce from Catherine of Aragon and Henry's desire for Anne Boleyn. I just don't see why this same type of movie could not have been made with FICTIONAL kings and queens and other characters--no authentic names. Then it would not be a particularly good movie but it would be less aggravating. Of course, it could not then claim to be based on Gregory's book about Mary Boleyn. I don't plan to read that; there are too many accurate books about Henry VIII that are no doubt more interesting, and I can read about poor Mary Boleyn in those.",1,25,33,24 May 2009
The Favourite," So Inaccurate the Director Should Have Used Fictional Women
","To tell this kind of story...why make it about Queen Anne., Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Abigail? These are real people whose lives can be researched.
Queen Anne loved her husband and had many children by him. Sarah was PASSIONATELY in love with her husband, the Duke, Winston Churchill's ancestor and one of the greatest military strategists and leaders of all time. Sarah was NOT bisexual or gay. Abigail Masham, not sure, but very doubtful she had an affair with the Queen.If you want to see a more accurate portrayal of the Sarah-Anne relationship, get The First Churchills, a TV series from the BBC, from your library's interlibrary loan or Amazon or wherever. I think the release date was 1971.The movie has many other inaccuracies: Anne was a few years YOUNGER than Sarah, in this film she is quite a bit older. Sarah had light hair, they couldn't even bother to put the correct wig color on the actress Rachel Weisz. The men are not portrayed realistically at all. It's fine to take a few liberties with history, but The Favourite goes way beyond this. If it were being played strictly for comedy, that would excuse this, but it is not. It is too dark for that. The Blackadder series was better, that played British history entirely for laughs and therefore no accuracy at all was expected.Also, I agree with reviewers who thought the language and swearing were too geared toward 2018 moviegoers. Why not just do a film about a Lesbian triangle and woman power then, why revise history yet again to this extent?",3,1,4,16 May 2020
Get Out," Get Out before you watch this movie!
","SAD. It started off OK if you can swallow the 'all white people are hypocrites, all white people are phony,' 'all white people are not trustworthy' theme.....but then it slipped into a rip off of three movies: The Stepford Wives (the original), Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen. Loosely speaking.....and the first two are infinitely better films. What really earned it a TWO rating for me was the last part, where it deteriorated into a pure slasher film. Pure gore, pure horror. And totally ridiculous. This was totally unnecessary for us to get the point. This is why the other mentioned films were far superior. Best script of the year according to Oscar? Hard to believe. Hip and PC and Hollywood-pleasing does not mean outstanding writing is assured.The lead male actor was very good in his role not to mention eye candy. I will look for him in future films that are more worthy of his talents.",2,4,20,31 March 2018
Wimbledon," Awful
","Awful is the lowest rating so that's my subject heading, sorry. I am a fan of the Wimbledon event, and there's nothing I'd like better than to see Andy Murray or another Brit win it. And 'our hero' in this film is a struggling British tennis player trying to win it.But this movie is dreadful. The lead characters do not have a convincing romantic relationship AT ALL. The female lead does not seem like a real person, and is not developed well. The plot is extremely contrived, predictable, and trite, with a tacked-on ending that is way too glib and phony. Paul Bethany is good looking, and it's fun to see Evert and McEnroe, and that is just about ALL that is good in this movie!",1,1,3,31 March 2012
Murder on the Orient Express," Worthy Remake, Full of Style and Visual Beauty
","I am a big fan of the 1974 version with Albert Finney as Poirot and directed by Sydney Lumet. I read that Sir Kenneth Branagh wanted to do a fresh version with a different take so he deliberately did not view the 1974 film. His Poirot is a bit sweeter and more sentimental than the one written for, and acted by, Finney. However, I find him very convincing! There are touches of humor, especially in the first half of the film. The second half is more serious as Poirot realizes he must solve the crime and has limited time to do so. The cast was excellent, and the scenery whether real or CGI was beautiful. The opulence and grandeur of this kind of train travel in the 1930s came across vividly. If anything, these characters are a bit more touching, a bit less campy and 'over the top' than the characters in Lumet's film. That's not a bad thing, it is just a different approach. Even at the end, Poirot displays a little unintentional humor because with his perfectionism, he cannot help himself. It is a very enjoyable film, and Branagh is a fine actor, always. He makes the film work. That and the sight of alps at sunset!",10,12,29,14 November 2017
