The Avengers," Surprisingly very good!
","It was a surprise that I actually liked Marvel's The Avengers. My expectations were a film about a bunch of superheroes exercising their powers for the sheer amusement of the comic-book fans. Indeed, I was right about the exercise of power (naturally enough) but the way such showing-off was employed is what I like about the film. While, on the surface the events may seem to revolve about a group of mentally immature superheroes, there are several references to a deeper meaning, presented in a hilarious, light way with focus on both action and dialogue alike.The undertone found in The Avengers has to do with the current universal trend of freedom and rebels. Loki makes it clear that his purpose is to fix the 'problem' which earth inhabitants have of misunderstanding the meaning of 'freedom' claiming they 'are made to be ruled'. Also, there is an indirect mention of fallen regimes, in general, and particularly the fall of the Soviet Union. Though this subject is not dealt with depth, it gives some weight to the light nature of the film. A film about superheroes is not expected to tackle serious issues but, at the same time, films whose main aim is to entertain the viewer should still not be an embodiment of triviality as is the case in many comedies of the last few years.This is delivered through a balance between action and dialogue. The film is action-packed like a superhero film should be, though this does not come at the expense of dialogue; action sequences are supported by the amazing CGI (with a special nod to the resemblance between Dr Banner and the Hulk). Dialogue, similarly, plays an important role in the development of events and the relationship between the characters.Wittily, this is coated with a fair amount of good humour. Though some jokes could be predictable, the spontaneity of the performances makes them, unarguably, funny. For example, towards the end, when Rogers is giving orders to policemen, what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves. Non-verbal humour even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard – when Dr Banner's 'other guy'shut Loki up with a slight movement of his huge arms.Such elements gather, in the end, to make a film that, successfully, transcends the circle of comic-book fans, delivering one of the best films of the season.",7,5,11,6 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Not as violent as it should be
","I finished reading The Hunger Games book trilogy three weeks before the Egyptian Revolution. Seeing what happened during the 18 days was like watching Suzanne Collins' books on screen. Until today, more than a year after the revolution, I believe The Hunger Games remains the closest work of fiction to the events of the revolution in Egypt. After all, it's about a game that the Capitol of Panem has started after the people made an uprising against it. The Hunger Games has 24 tributes but only one can win and that's by surviving.Violence, thus, is the keyword. It's the core of the world created by Suzanne Collins who mentioned in an interview that she got the idea of the books while watching footage of the US crimes in Iraq. On the other hand, Gary Ross's film adaptation did not survive the gleam of Hollywood. The result is unnecessary scenes of romance (which filled the theatre with giggles at its silliness) at the expense of core violent scenes, all for the sake of topping the box office.Despite that, most of the performances were excellent. When fans of the book trilogy (me included) made their disagreement clear when she was first cast, Jennifer Lawrence replied that she will do her best, playing Katniss Everdeen. And she did. When it comes to other leading characters, Josh Hutcherson is no less good, though there should have been much focus on the character of Haymitch and the humorous side of it as well as the relationship he developed with Katniss and Peeta.Of course it couldn't all fit in 2 hours and 8 minutes. However, this is no justification for the film's clear means to win the war to the top of the box office. But, in the end, the first book is my least favourite. The best is yet to come.",7,2,5,6 May 2012
