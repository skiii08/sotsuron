The Blair Witch Project," Real World IX: Crystal Lake
","First of all, I give a lot of credit to the three main actors for their believability; most notably Heather Donahue as the goal-obsessed director of this doomend documentary.But it wasn't scary. More important, for the film to work, you had to see the right footage. Heather, Mike, and Josh of course, just happened to have their cameras running at the right times for us to get a full sense of the picture. (Even edited down from complete footage, it still strikes me as odd.)The ending, for me, failed to leave me with enough information to want to have questions about it. It simply left me with a feeling that this was Real World IX: Crystal Lake.",4,0,1,9 August 1999
Alien 3," Condescending Ellen Ripley
","One major beef I had with Alien3 was the condescension on Ellen Ripley's part, namely the scene where she is chastising the warden for not having weapons of any sort (it is a prison planet after all, and given its circumstances, hardly not understandable.) Overall, I found the movie bothersome and annoying, an unnecessary sequel that offered little to the mythology or to the moviegoer.",3,294,307,24 August 1999
Batman Returns," Michael Keaton: Underappreciated
","Easily the best of the Batman series of any era, this film's unusual take on Oswald Cobblepot (The Penguin) and Selina Kyle (Catwoman) and the nature of evil itself presents Tim Burton and Michael Keaton and their best. Of the three modern performers, Adam West, and earlier Batmen, Michael Keaton best portrayed the schizophrenic nature of Bruce Wayne and Batman, and much like the original, offers us a believable duality.",7,0,0,24 August 1999
Scary Movie 2," Same Style, Different Jokes
","Scary Movie 2 isn't that much different than Scary Movie -- the level of humor is the same, the grossouts are truly grossouts, and the basic premise is there. It's worth nothing that this movie is not a sendup of horror movie sequels, but of a different set of horror movies than the first.Funny bits include parodies of Hollow Man, Charlie's Angels, and The Exorcist. Unfunny bits include Chris Elliott. Unfunny bits always include Chris Elliott. But that goes without saying.",3,0,1,5 July 2001
Pitch Black," Interesting Horror Film
","Pitch Black is an interesting piece of film in the 'group of people picked off one by one by killer or monster' genre (cf. Deep Blue Sea, Virus, any Friday the 13th movie). There's a great big implausability in the movie (they land right around the eclipse that comes along once every 23 years) but otherwise, this is a decent picture.",8,0,0,5 December 2000
BASEketball," Bizarre Parody Not For Everyone
","A friend of mine met Robert Vaughn shortly after this film wrapped production; Robert Vaughn suggested he go see it, but he wasn't sure what to expect. One doubts that Robert Vaughn fans would really enjoy this movie, but its satiric sense of humor, albeit juvenile, was enjoyable. Yasmeene Bleeth and Jennie McCarthy both deserve credit for their performances, as does Robert Stack.",Null,1,2,23 August 1999
Coyote Ugly," Piper Perabo Saves This Film
","If this movie were more about Piper Perabo's character and less about the bar, this might have been halfway decent. Piper's Violet Stanford and Karen Friendly (Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that's endearing. Here's hoping she'll find a better movie to be in.",4,1,1,28 January 2001
Event Horizon," Formulaic But Enjoyable
","Sam O'Neill knows how to pick the crazies; in both this and In The Mouth of Madness he manages to effectively portray a character that goes insane. Lawrence Fishburne, an entirely underrated actor, is convincing as a starship captain on a trip to the outer reaches of the solar system.The final scenes stretch believability thin, but the crew deserves credit for their performances, and the writers deserve credit for trying to giving us characters we could care in. But ultimately this is another example where budget that could have gone to better scripting went to special effects.",6,0,1,19 August 1999
