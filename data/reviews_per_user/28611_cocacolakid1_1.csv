The Avengers," Best Movie of The Year
","This movie ROCKS! I've been waiting for this movie for 37 years. Joss Whedon nailed it, the action is paced just right, with a good amount of one liners to keep it light. Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of fun as Tony Stark. The story works well and the actors sell their roles with ease. I wasn't sure about Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, he did alright, but he's a little too beefy to be Bruce. All the other actors have played their characters before and this just cements their position. This movie is better than any of the solo hero movies that led up to it. Hopefully Joss comes back for the next one and can pull it off again. I saw the IMAX 3D version and while it looked and sounded fantastic, the 3D didn't pop as much as it could have. It had some depth but it didn't really add much. It should make a substantial amount at the the box office, and should get a few nods for the Oscars, but we all know that won't happen, the Academy always passes over movies like this. I just want to state again, this is a great movie, action packed and hilarious.",10,1,4,5 May 2012
