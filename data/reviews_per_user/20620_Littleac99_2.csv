The Longest Yard," This is hands down, a great movie
","If anyone has ever seen the original movie starring Burt Reynolds, it's hard to walk into this movie with completely open-mind on account of all the other movies that have tried to surpass its predecessors these days. I went into this movie thinking that it would be good for a few laughs of course, because it's starring Adam Sandler and Chris Rock,but little did I know that I would leave with the mindset that 'I'm buying this on DVD the day it comes out!' This movie stayed mostly true to the original, the differences being, besides the actors, a ton of knee-slapping laughter. The audience of the theater I was in, and I must have laughed nearly th whole movie. Not only did this movie have priceless comedy, but it had a storyline that wasn't to far-fetched.Plus, it had hard hitting sports filmography to entertain the even the least athletic crowd. I must say though that Chris Rock stole the show with his countless brilliant 1 liners and comedic timing, with the rest of the cast not to far behind him. Not once did this movie get boring and not once did this movie get real stupid. The laughter and interesting story just kept coming, keeping you into the movie. Another good thing about the movie, was that as we all know, the ending can make or break a movie, in this case, the ending (though kinda predictable)made it for a great movie. I'd highly recommend this movie to comedy fans and sports fans alike.",10,1,6,29 May 2005
The Village," Great acting leads this predictable, but good, movie
","The Village from the beginning seemed odd. But so were the other M Night. movies. But the story, though good, was not the strong point. No, I thought that the solid acting was. Ron Howard's daughter was great as the blind girl who was a lovable character. Pheonix, who played the shy, quiet, and alittle too curious and fearless character, was also superb. But one of the best acting came from Adrien Brody, as the mentally ill, character that could of either been loved or hated. Oh, and Weaver and Hurt wern't bad too.The story was great, the acting was great, the scenery was great, and if you wern't already predicting the ending after an hour of the movie than you'll probably think that this movie was great too. But for some of us who did, than oh well, better luck next time M. Night. for making a movie that is'nt predictable like your others. But, on the other hand , I'll still be first in line to see them. He's still one of my favorites.",6,0,0,31 July 2004
