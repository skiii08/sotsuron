Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Positive Review
","I was not disappointed with The Phantom Menace as I went into it not expecting an incredible movie. That's not to say I didn't think it would be good, but I knew the bulk of it would be introducing characters and events, and setting up the next two prequels. Overall, I would say that it was a great movie. The podrace was amazing and the light-sabre duels were incredible. I'd say the people at ILM and John Williams have outdone themselves again. I just hope George Lucas has the sense to PLEASE kill JarJar off early in Episode II...",9,0,0,27 May 1999
