Black Swan," Black Swan
","The Black Swan is a movie based on obsession. It is one of the most talked about movies of the time as it should be for its empowerment over the mind. It is absolutely genius from beginning to end and I believe deserves all kinds of praise. Even though it is a dark movie it is still very beautiful to watch the struggle of a young woman who wants to be the best. It is not your ordinary obsession of being infatuated with someone else but it is based on a ballerina becoming so obsessed with being perfect it ultimately drives her crazy. Nina whose character is played by Natalie Portman has been part of the New York ballet company for a long time and has constantly pushed her self to be the best, she is already the best white swan ballerina in the dance company but drives to overpower her mind in order to become the dark, evil, black swan. Nina constantly feels like people are after her and are trying to hurt her. Throughout the course of the movie you see different scenes of violence and blood all dictated by Nina's imagination. This movie is heavy yet really pulls you in to understand what is going on to make Nina see what she sees. Nina becomes so smitten with becoming the perfect black swan that she thinks that she is turning into a swan...causing her to see feathers coming out of her body. Everyone in Nina's life is trying to support her and help her not become too overwhelmed by this life style but she only sees it as pure evil. She thinks her mom and friend Lily are out to get her. Lily's character is played by the beautiful Mila Kunis. Lily is constantly trying to be a good friend by talking to Nina when she is upset and tries to even help her find a life outside of ballet but Nina cannot handle this which is portrayed in a few scenes of the movie. All in all this is a great movie and i definitely recommend it to people who enjoy dark yet moving films. To try to compare this movie to another is nearly impossible. If i was to compare it to any movie it would have to be Inception director and writer Christopher Nolan. Inception is based on the mind and going beyond ones dreams to live a life that you choose. I compare these two movies as similarities because they truly make you think and open up ones mind. You truly have to let go of your everyday life and open up your mind and eyes to these crazy, twisted films.",10,1,3,22 January 2011
