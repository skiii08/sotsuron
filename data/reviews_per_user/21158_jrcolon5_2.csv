Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Waste of time, money, and Film
","I do not consider myself a 'picky' or critical movie goer. I can equally enjoy a great classic and then howl at a silly comedy like 'Something About Mary' or Napoleon Dynamite.There wasn't even a chuckle for this mess. This wasted use of celluloid was not funny at all. How this piece of garbage won awards is quite beyond me. This looked like a bad Improv act. I saw better Improv sketches in my Jr. Hi Drama Class. Yes it was crude but that's not my problem with it. It just wasn't funny.Even after reading some of the comments others wrote, it didn't help. I like 'good' Satire. This certainly was not it. Thank God I used my 'Netflix' subscription to see this and I didn't waste an extra dime on it. The only thing I found close to clever were the credits. Direct to DVD??? This should be more like Direct to the Garbage Dump.",1,3,9,28 January 2008
The Godfather," What Can i say? The Best
","What can you say about this? This is close to a 'perfect movie' The direction was perfect. The casting, the script, the drama, the editing all Superb.Watching Al Pacino as Micheal literally changing his 'personna' throughout the course of this story is awesome.And of course this was 'Brando's' finest hour. Also the score and editing were perfect. The effects were done masterfully. James Cann's portrayal of the 'Hot Tempered' Sonny was stunning. An absolute MUST for every movie collection!",10,0,2,3 April 2007
