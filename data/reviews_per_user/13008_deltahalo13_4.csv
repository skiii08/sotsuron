The Benchwarmers," A decent teen movie...
","I went and saw this movie last night with 2 of my friends. There were definitely some funny parts in there (and, we all have to admit that whatever Jon Heder does is hilarious), but, there was nothing that really made this movie stand out from the huge pile of teen comedies out there.There were several scenes that included vomiting or farting, which was rather awkward. Are we watching a PG-13 movie or a G movie? Most of these jokes were ones you would find in a kid comedy. This movie simply added some language and unneeded sexual comments to make it PG-13. Not really my idea of a good movie.That aside though, there were MANY other parts that I laughed so hard at, it sort of canceled out the ridiculous qualities.OVERALL: 6/10",6,0,0,30 April 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A+ Book-to-Film movie (for once)
","I must say that, as a huge fan of C.S. Lewis' books, I was a little weary when I heard the news of his most treasured book being made into a movie. Despite that fact, I eased up slightly when I heard that WETA (the people who made the CGI, armor, miniature effects for Lord of the Rings) was doing most of the work on it.Watching the movie, I was surprised at how closely the movie followed the book. I mean, sure, there were moments when you thought 'I don't remember this', but, hey, besides that, the movie was excellent.This is one of the few Disney movies that I will actually want to watch again and and again. Great job!",10,0,1,12 December 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A pirate's life for me...
","I attended the 8:00pm showing of AWE on May 24th with some of my friends. We had all been anticipating the film for months (we made some costumes as well). Obviously, there was a lot of hype behind the third installment of the Disney's uber-popular Pirates of the Caribbean. And now, after finally seeing the nearly 3 hour film...all I can say is believe the hype.The movie picks up where Dead Man's Chest left off: Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan, Captain Barbossa, and their troop of comical, yet useful comrades set off to world's end to fetch back Captain Jack Sparrow from Davey Jone's locker. Meanwhile, Lord Beckett and the Royal Navy plan to remove piracy off the face of the world.The film is fantastically paced...there are just enough conversations and slow parts to understand what is going on, without taking away from the action and comedy. Then again, most of the conversations are comical...almost too much. I say that with the utmost looseness; I realize that the Pirate's franchise is comedy/action. As usual, Jack Sparrow steals the show with his witty one-liners and physical quirks. Keira Knightley (Elizabeth) has also notably improved her acting skills.As you've probably heard before, the final battle sequence is one of the best you will ever see. I can't imagine the sheer amount of hard work that went into that 20-30 minute block of film. It is utterly fantastic. I must also note the spectacular scene towards the end of the movie, featuring Lord Beckett. All I could think was 'this is the coolest thing I've ever seen.' The water-fall scene is also quite notable.Now that I've got the good out of the way, I must note the very minor, yet annoying, negative qualities. I think many people will agree with me when I say that Gore Verbinski should've thought the entire 'Jone's locker' sequence out so much better. There are many other ways to portray hallucinations than showing Jack Sparrow 'killing' his mirage for half a peanut. Also, towards the end of the film when Calypso is introduced, you would think that the 'goddess of the seas' would have a better entrance than a pile of crabs.With that said, these small annoyances hardly take away from the grand scale and quality of this film. You will laugh, you will definitely cry, and you will love every minute of this spectacular Pirate's addition.I give it an 8/10.(Please don't take your small children to this movie...it really is a lot more violent than the other two movies.)",8,1,1,26 May 2007
Children of Men," You will NOT be disappointed!
","I traveled to New Zealand about 4 months ago and was pleased to discover that this movie was released there a whole month before it would be in the US. What started out as a simple boasting right quickly became one of my favorite movies for many reasons.The cinematography alone in Children of Men is absolutely stunning...you will feel like you are right in the middle of the action. I do remember one particular shot running about 5 minutes long that is just incredible...it must have taken extreme rehearsal in order to get that shot down. Needless to say, the hand-held camera work is brilliant as well.The acting is incredible. You will not find a better performance than Clive Owen's at least for a few months. I give it a 9/10.",9,3,6,6 April 2007
