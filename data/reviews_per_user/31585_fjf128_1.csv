Ali," Great film tainted by overuse of music
","I found this to be a well-written, well-acted movie, but too many times the music served as more of a distraction than an enhancement to the film. Michael Mann has always featured music in his projects (dating back to Miami Vice in 1984), but its use in this film was excessive and unnecessary.  In fact, at times it detracted from the drama when it was supposed to help support it.There are great performances by Will Smith as Ali, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Voight as Howard Cosell that make this movie worth seeing.",Null,0,0,19 February 2003
