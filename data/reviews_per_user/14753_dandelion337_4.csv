The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," i like this one
","C'mon guys, after Twilight and New Moon, everyone should admit the fact that the movies are made for fans; and fans around the globe will watch it no matter how suck it is! We, fans, want to see it on big screen, our own imagination is never enough, so we want the movie to include every tiny teeny weeny details, which others might think boring.OK, I don't like the first one, but am able to see that the followings were getting better, and this time, seriously, I give it a 7.5 out of 10. The director should get most of the credit because he is capable of adding elements that weren't in the book, but felt natural while watching. Kristen did an outstanding job while Rob and Taylor's acting skills are improved. (spoiler alert) I like the scene where Edward challenged Bella that they were supposed to be partners but Bella made the decision on her own, nice work ~Soundtrack is fine, nevertheless, the first album is so far the best in comparison. No offense, CW's The Vampire Diaries applied better music, Twilight needs to work harder on this aspect.Looking forward to seeing Part II, gosh, another year?",7,2,9,21 November 2011
Twilight," it might be better if converted to TV series
","the movie is just too short and shallow. no one will understand how the love has gone so deep without reading the books. pattinson's performance was poor. he failed to show the determination and confidence that edward possessed. it was a bad choice to let pattinson to play edward. kristen is acceptable, perhaps she is more experienced and capable of acting. for those who want to see the twilight movie, be prepared that it is just a low-budget and below-averaged production. other than luck, i cannot figure out any other reasons that it could be a box-office hit. people who are really interested in the story, the books will be a way better choice than spending money on the movie.and about the music, bella's lullaby sucks. just couldn't figure out why and how they picked this piece out. it doesn't necessarily have to be an original or newly created. think of 'somewhere in time', isn't the rhapsody on a theme of paganini really really nice and fit? the music was created way earlier than the time of the film story background, but so what? who cares?heard that the movie is moving ahead to new moon, however, Catherine Hardwicke is no longer the director. perhaps it is a better move. the company should re-think the whole thing since there is so much room for improvement. i am a big fan of the books and hope the company can make a best plan for the sequel. please create something that is worth spending money on the movie tickets and dvds.",2,1,6,26 November 2008
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," not good but better than the first one
","first of all, i am a fan of the books and very disappointed by the first movie. after seeing the trailers of new moon, i have better hopes this time. i expected the changing of director probably might improve the acting, but well, obviously it is the problem of actors now i have found. the few that can act are Michael Sheen and Peter Facinelli; the rest were playing either the roles of stone or wood.i don't know what happened to kristen's eyes? sometimes in the movie she gave me an impression that she's stoned; and sometimes the way she blinks (very rapid) looked very annoying. she seems to have only one or two expressions in the whole movie. i can't see the joy when she's with edward again and the guilt she felt towards charlie.rob is as bad as the first movie, no improvement at all. edward in the books is funnier and 'livelier', but rob, jeez, my advice is he should attend some drama classes before taking other jobs.taylor's acting is a bit better, but whose idea was it that every words he spoke was coming from his throat? maybe he was trying to be husky but hey, the way he delivered it just seemed unnatural and pretentious.i wonder why this production team would still give us crap with the hugely increased budget? are they putting most of the resources on cgi only? or was it because the major casting was set, can't do anything about it? with their poor acting skills, the poor performance will be in consistent no matter how much more money to put in? look at true blood and vampire diaries, they are also adaptations from books but are way way better than the twilight movies. even the songs are better.to be fair, new moon is better than twilight (most of the credits to Michael Sheen --- don't recall anyone can act in twilight), however, i can't give it a pass. it is a four out of ten.",4,7,12,29 November 2009
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," first one is crap, second is a bit crappy, third time is a charm
","i have given comments on the first and second, and i decide to continue this task ~ i am a die-hard fan of the books and can't help seeing the movie adaptations, no matter how crappy they are ~ honestly, twilight was sooooo crappy that while watching it, i got a feeling of killing someone in the production crew, perhaps the whole crew, cast included. new moon got a bit better than the first one, but still, missed out a lot and obviously lacked of acting, i mean professional, not amateurs.however, this time, i must admit, third time is a charm ~ RobPat improves, finally, thank goodness ~ although he is not-so-edward and less-almighty-edward, in comparison with the previous two, he is 'a lot livelier' ~ the only thing i dislike is the scene that he confronted Jake about the i-kissed-bella-thing, i am not saying the acting is bad, but hey, in the book, Bella is the most important thing in the world to Edward, his first priority is to check on her broken hand ~ i hate the core of the character has been changed, especially it comes to EDWARD ~ Melissa Rosenberg, do you hear me? Dexter is great, without doubt, you are an amazing screenwriter, so please stop 'downsizing' Edward ~ Jasper and Rosalie did good, perhaps because they got a bigger part to play ~ actually, everyone ACTS this time, including Royce's gang ~ i have a theory, don't go into the cinema with great expectations and then somehow, you may be able to get some surprises ~",7,11,29,30 June 2010
