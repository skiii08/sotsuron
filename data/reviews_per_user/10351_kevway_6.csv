E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Mystifying treacle causes instant diabetes to susceptible sentimentalists.
","OK, 'E.T.: the Extraterrestrial', is not horrible, but that which is 'off' about it is especially irritating. Steven Spielberg chose to ground ET too firmly in the more banal aspects of the early 1980s zeitgeist, which might creep out a latter day viewer from the get go -- at least it did me. Of course much of this was well done, but it seems only mass hypnosis or some kind of 'groupthink' can explain what makes this flick so incredibly popular when it is so very average. Everything Mr. Spielberg ever made is far, far better than this treacly, saccharin-coated kid movie. I have to give it a 3 star to make up for so many undeserved tens. There is no doubt that this movie achieves it's tens because it pulls so well on the heart strings of a fair number of viewers. That's all very well to a point. Coming away from a two hour investment in edification should leave one feeling better, in one way or another. I would admit that my review is infected with an unfair bias but for the fact that I am usually biased in favor of including entertainment along with mere art, especially in comedies, of which ET is one, in a very broad definition (look it up!). 'Forrest Gump' comes to mind as a comparable treacly-saccharin movie that I absolutely loved. At the end of the day, I can't put my finger on it; maudlin can be tolerable in the right package, but not in E.T.",3,4,12,25 May 2008
Lion," Miraculous, Disturbing,Rivetting, Incredible, Life Affirming, Beautiful
","Lion is certainly not the greatest film of all time, nevertheless, it is one of the few that engaged and amazed me, hence my ten stars. I have no illusions that the story was not simplified, homogenized and depicted to make its point, yet the kerygma of this stranger-than-fiction biography is indubitably true, and what a heart rending story it is! Along the way, the audience is given a slice of the hard life in low-caste and demimond India, and discover some idea of how many children there are abused and neglected. Out of this horror, just one little miracle, so unlikely, offers up the joy of hope and the promise in mere survival, if one persists in pursuit of truth. If any film earned the right to a happy ending, it is this one. If any single human ever deserved a good outcome, it is the protagonist in this film, not for his (their) good acting, but for the real life tragedy incredibly erased, out of a sudden flash of memory. 
 (How much we take for granted in the First World, complaining that the electorate and politicians don't do enough for citizens and resident aliens who suffer relative want or injustice. What a joke our real-enough problems are by comparison! The agony in the slums of India, or North Korean slave labor camps, or Syria, and many more such countries, makes a homeless person in America much closer to Jeff Bezos than he would be to those wallowing and dying in Third World squalor! While we freak out over the potential that mother earth is being hurt by too much anthropogenic emissions, there are real people, by the hundreds of millions, suffering torture, extermination, starvation and callous neglect in dozens of nations around the world.) This fine film, Lion, shows us how good we have it here, and how much help the truly desperate need. It touches on many other points, too. Some characters clearly are led to extremes for survival, but others are evil for mere easy advantage or gain, and also, the adoptive brother demonstrates the limits of kindness and love for the unfortunate few who suffer brain trauma or psychosis, as a caring Australian couple do their best to help two boys, but only one surmounts his stumbling blocks. To sum up, all I can say is 'wow!'!!
 I close on the music of Sia, 'Never Give Up', played over the end credits. Talk about icing on the cake, this made me wonder how often we walk away with positive dharma in our heads when the music adds to your already high opinion. It is the ideal lyric and music for the film. I have no problem with marketing when it drives more people to such a film, to promote the hope inherent in life, striving, and following Sia's call to 'Never Give Up.'",10,0,0,22 February 2018
Lawrence of Arabia," Rivals The Godfather and Citizen Cane
","The American Film Institute awarded Peter O'Toole the distinction of greatest performance by an actor in the history of cinema for his performance as Lawrence. Also, director David Lean and crew picked up more all-time top tens for this film than any other. So you might ask why it gets less attention? For one, it does bog down a bit 3/4th of the way through, that, and it has no parts for women, unless you count three seconds dragging off the mens' leftover food, and four seconds of ululating from a distant hillside, or playing dead after the rape and massacre of a village. I suppose I can understand why female movie buffs are less enthralled by this all-guy war adventure than I am. I was only ten years of age when my Mom took me to see this in 1962, and I was affected so utterly by Lawrence as David Lean and O'Toole created him, that I could not endure to see the film end after two and a half hours. (The director's cut is longer for you lucky DVD owners). In the final reel, as Lawrence hitches a ride in a motorcar back to the port where he'll return to England, he sees a few Bedouins riding their camels and he takes a long look back once they pass. At that moment, knowing that, like Lawrence, I was about to leave the romance of war in the desert too, I felt a bond so complete that no hero would ever replace Lawrence of Arabia for me. As Lawrence approaches 50, I have been a cinema fan ever since; but of the thousand odd movies I've seen, although some do come close, this is my favorite movie ever.",10,3,5,17 March 2012
The Man Who Would Be King," Best Adventure Movie of All Time?
","If you rate foremost by sheer entertainment, then yes, for me this John Huston gem is arguably the best adventure put on film, ever. I love Apocalypse Now, and Lawrence of Arabia, and several classic films perhaps even greater than this Caine/Connery collaboration, but this could best all the greats for sheer fun. I can understand that Huston's other masterpiece, 'The African Queen,' might appeal more to women; the interplay between Hepburn and Bogart was incredible. The love interest in The Man Who Would Be King is deliberately cold and minimal, in part because it is the ultimate 'buddy movie', which might be pejorative, but not intended so. It's a transcendent buddy movie, part epic, part comic, part morality tale. It seems strange that 1% of critics were underwhelmed. When positive consensus is that close, one has to wonder how one or two 'experts' could diverge so much from the glories piled on by the many critic worthies, like Roger Ebert, who adored it: I trust him more than some half-baked know-it-all form Variety for appreciation of the art of film making.Based on a Rudyard Kipling short story, itself inspired by the true story of Josiah Harlan in mid-19th century Afghanistan, it is the rare film that is better than its own source material by any measure. Also, you can find dozens of great movies starring Michael Caine, but here is one of the handful of really great movies that did not squander the massive talents of Sean Connery. For this last reason alone, The Man Who Would Be King is a must- see.",10,1,4,17 January 2015
Paranormal Activity," Avoid this film at all costs! The horror is so boring it might kill you!
","I gave this a 2 because I have seen a fair number of movies made for more money that were not any better. However, that is a mere curiosity. I confide that I have written a couple reviews for movies I love, but for this dreck so foul I found the impetus to declaim before all you who are fortunate to have up to now missed out on this stupefying movie! The low budget results in a very poor sound quality: I had to watch the movie at jet engine take-off volume because my partner could not make out what the characters were saying. This made it torture to watch AND to hear. I want to be scared, not tortured, but Paranormal Activity offers precious little scariness, yet countless annoyances, the sound being only one of many. I won't continue with details. Just trust me, one who rarely shares his opinions -- this is at best an absolute waste of time.",2,5,7,30 October 2013
Black Hawk Down," My second favorite war film of all time
","Ridley Scott blew me away with this tragic and heroic work on 1993s troubles in Somalia. Having been entranced as a ten year old boy viewing Lawrence of Arabia in 70mm, I found even the better war films since wanting by comparison. These two films are utterly differnt in myriad ways but this; they a perfect on their own terms, executed so well, and engrossing -- so engaging that one ought to go away only disatified that one could not have lived through it in person, although the violence is a bit much for REALLY wishing you'd been on the scene, with limbs flying about and such.
I can't adequately describe how this film was so effective, to even dare compare it to the incomparable Lawrence. Every scene just worked. So much battle action pervades, you might think, 'what is the differnce between this and a Van Damme or Chuck Norris picture?' Fair question. All I can say is the acting is fantastic and the action scenes are directed by one of the truly brilliant auteurs of cinema. This is Ridley Scott in his finest hour, and if he were to make movies for a thousand years....THIS will be his best picture!",10,1,3,21 January 2018
