The Blair Witch Project," Don't be fooled - this movie STINKS!
","This movie stinks from beginning to end. It's a waste of time and money. I went in without any proconceived expectations. I knew it was a low budget film and that production value would be minimal, and I expected it to have many faults. But I rarely walk out of a film and I was on the verge of walking out of this one at least five times. Not from motion sickness, but from the nausea that these guys pulled the wool over so many eyes and made so much money from a film that can't even be deemed a decent 'student film.' The story line is decent. The acting moderately passes. But I couldn't wait for someone to put this film out of it's misery! For what it's worth, this film could have been 20 minutes, with the same ending, and been much better! Don't waste your time with the blair witch, her bark is a barely a wimper and there's absolutely no bite!",2,0,2,16 August 1999
