Sucker Punch," Sooooo disappointed with this film
","Once I heard about this film last year at comic con, I was literally counting the days and now that I finally got the chance to see it, I am extremely disappointed.The first 10-20 min of the film is like a damn music video and the so- called 'dancing' scenes made no sense whatsoever. I did like the fight scenes; they weren't good but were the best scenes in the film and I'm sure any guy who saw it would love it considering the outfits the girls were wearing while fighting. Also I like the concept of how she created a world for her to escape the procedure and through that she was fighting to stay alive, but for me those were the only pros in the film.The acting wasn't bad, I think the people who stood out the most was Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino. Abbie Cornish and Jenna Malone were good and I was impressed with Jamie Chung. As for Emily Browning and Vanessa Hudgens, they were mediocre. I guess someone who doesn't have high expectations of this film would enjoy, but I think the majority of the people who liked it would be men and people who love video games.",5,3,9,2 April 2011
