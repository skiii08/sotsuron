The Blair Witch Project," A kind of genuine horror that will never be captured again.
","I really doubt that there could ever be a more terrifying movie than the Blair Witch Project. Most Horror movies depend on cheap tactics like high pitched stringed instruments that chime in as something flashes across the screen, or lots of fake blood and gore spilling out of bodies, but this is the only movie that takes advantage of the suspension of disbelief so vividly, that it takes the worst horror imaginable, one that is created in the mind, and makes the viewer wholeheartedly wish to not see the movie conclude. It was so well acted and believable which made the horror so much more poignant. I dare anyone to find a movie scarier than The Blair Witch Project.",10,1,2,16 June 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," infinitely more fantastic and infinitely more confusing
","Action that pushes the envelope, rich characters in an epic story and filmmaking so stunning my jaw is still dropped. What more could one ask for? How about a climax that didn't involve a dissertation on logical fallacy? The last person on earth that needs to understand the commonsensical repercussions of a decision like love vs. `the good of the many' is our dear friend, Keanu. For about four minutes the movie lost me. And we expect our favorite `one' in shades to follow as if his mind were a sponge? Wait..Dozer said that, didn't he? But he is dead. Will neo remember it anyway? I wanted to finish this comment on this movie, but I thought it would be better put to rest on crap that doesn't make sense, like the ending of this movie.",10,0,0,16 May 2003
Am√©lie," Most charming movie I have seen
","Simply charming. You fall in love with every character, and the first five minutes make you not even care if there is a plot. Tremendously creative and enchanting. Our protagonist brings with her the kind of perk that hasn't been seen since Audrey Hepburn!",10,1,3,8 January 2002
