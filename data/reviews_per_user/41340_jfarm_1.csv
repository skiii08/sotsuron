Conquest 1453," evidently cheap production
","this must be the 100th Turkish movie about the fall of Constantinople, but it is still a cheap epic with poor acting and special effects that remind me of the seventies. for God's sake people, even the beards of the actors look fake, I have better costume for the halloween...the score in IMDb is so unreasonably high that obviously serves other purposes rather than providing the global audience with a reliable rating. had this movie been of a different topic, the score would have been around 2-3.civilised countries do not pose with pride on events of their history when they invaded other people's homes and burned the most glorious wonders to the ground. there are things that, we in Europe, try to forget because we are embarrassed. it is sad and scary that Turks still take pride on this side of history.at least do me a favour:do not mislead the IMDb audience by rating a movie guided by your 'national pride'. because this is indeed a bad movie.",3,5,13,12 September 2012
