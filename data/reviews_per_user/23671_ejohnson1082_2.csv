Requiem for a Dream," What a terrible decision
","Requiem for a Dream is truly a pioneering effort, delving into the back streets to find three drug crazed teens in New York. While the performances are strong on the part of Connelly and Leto, this movie is a horrendous way to spend two hours of your life. Anyone who is thinking about trying heroin, might find this movie to be a useful deterrent, but my prediction is that if you are stupid enough to try such a harmful substance, this powerful message may not even do enough to dissuade you. I basically wanted to vomit for roughly half the movie, and furthermore could not believe that anyone would consider this movie to be of any value. It is a physical impossibility to derive pleasure from watching such a spectacular piece of trash, no matter how stunning the acting performances were.",1,5,13,12 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," this is a fantastic finish to one of the greatest stories ever told
","I didn't want to put too much hype on Episode III, because I have a penchant for doing so and becoming rather disappointed with the movie after doing so. However, I knew that George Lucas was going to blow us all away...and he did! The action scenes are unparalleled by any other installment in either trilogy. The light saber battles between Yoda and Darth Sidious, and the light saber battle between Anikin and Obi Wan are each spectacular. There is lots battle taking place and it all was shot well and the entire movie is extremely enjoyable and captivating. The acting is superb. Hayden Christensen continued to evolve into the actor we were hoping he would become. Ewan McGregor turns in a performance that is gut-wrenching, his closing dialog with 'Darth Vader' nearly brought me to tears. Natalie Portman is sophisticated and sexy as always. In my eyes, the epic series could not have gone out in much better fashion. Lucas went out and made a compelling feature that was finally on par with Episodes IV-VI. It is sad to see it all come to an end.",10,3,7,22 May 2005
