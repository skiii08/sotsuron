Conquest 1453," This is it...
","First of all, huge thanks to anyone involved to make this dream came true for Turkish cinema industry.Trailers were very promising, but also carried some doubts for me ; 1. How we will see Sultan Mehmet The Conqueror role in the movie? As an emperor, or as a human being? 2. Will the weight of religion effect take into consideration? A sensitive issue. 3. Will the siege and battle scenes satisfy spectators?I got all my answers, no doubt it's the best Turkish movie so far, without shaping us to one specific direction, we saw the sultan as an emperor and as a human, weakness and strength are given in perfect balance, religion took it's part as it should be and the battle scenes are very satisfying.Every Turk must see the movie not for only to learn more for history, but also see the level of the progress and of course support for the industry to see such movies in theaters.",9,17,50,20 February 2012
