The Legend of Bagger Vance," Guidelines to life with help of golf
","I liked this Robert Redford film as well as I liked the another film by him, the one which was about fishing. I like the way he tells of life and sports. The sport, fishing or golf, is just an outer part of the film. It is the equipment what with he tells more important things. So the sports doesn't really matter, it could be any sport.I also liked the style of the movie. There were some special effects in the movie, but they were not in the main part. They served the movie well. I liked the whole casting of the movie. Will Smith, Matt Damon, Theron, and the actors of the two other golfers were all good.The golf game lasted only a couple of days, but during that day the golfer played by Damon got instructions to his whole life. In my opinion this film is underestimated.",8,0,1,9 February 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Skillful Horror
","Roman Polanski has used very skillfully methods to make a creepy horror film. Excluding the ending of the film, Rosemary's Baby reminded me of Hitchcock's brilliant horror and thriller films. But I should watch this movie twice because after just one view of the film I can't think of anything lousy in this film. And no film is perfect.But as I mentioned, I have watched this film only once, so I have only good things to say about this movie. So: the actors and actresses are great. I like movies which don't have dozens of characters. This movie hasn't got too many characters. When there are only few characters it is easy to learn to know them better. I liked especially Mia Farrow. She was great. Also the title music was fantastic!Rosemary's Baby shows how to make a good horror film, without any cool special effects. Many movies have been spoiled with too many effects so I'm glad this one is made in the 60s when it was impossible to make decent effects, at least compared to what you can do nowadays. Well, I don't want to write all day. I gave this movie 9/10 points and recommend it to everyone who likes Hitchcock-movies.",9,1,3,8 July 2004
