Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For me this was an incredible experience.
","I am a fan of the Star Wars saga. I have always enjoyed the movies and I believe those who were disappointed are not being objective about this movie at all. I'll admit that I was expecting more from this movie in some aspects. The main problem that overall people really have with this movie and many don't even realise it is that one of the major plot elements, the conflict between the Naboo, and Gungans was not brought to the forefront with more of a sense of danger. I think Lucas was caught in a bind presentation wise because he wanted to bring the Jedi's conflict to the forefront and it cost this movie in the long run. There were specific scenes in the first three films that put the raw dangers of the Empire to the forefront.Examples of these scenes are when Luke returns home in 'A New Hope' to see that his only family in the universe have been killed, Han Solo being frozen in carbonite just after he and Leia realised their love for each other in 'Empire Strikes Back, and when Luke is tested and tempted by the Emperor, the Emperor apparently two steps ahead of Luke in 'Return of the Jedi.'All the while in the movie there were references to an invasion and people dying of catastrophic numbers but this was not for me at least brought to the front page. Qui Gon tells the queen at one point that he can't fight a war for her but with the way the cowardly Neimodians and weak droids are pushed around I don't see why not.The Gungan droid battle should not have been relegated to a mere distraction and even if it were the Gungans had no casualties. Even though I know Lucas wanted to preserve the PG rating I still think he should have brought the grittiness of the conflict equally through the major characters eyes. Just a pinch more of Dramtic punch would have done th trick. He had done that so well in all of the other Episodes and ultimately the dangers of the conflict were not evenly distributed. However this movie still is a remarkable achievment. The imagination and talents of many people  still flow through this movie. The realisation of the underwater Gungan city, the podrace sequence, and the Duel of the Fates is visuallly amazing. I don't think the performances are wooden. I like Natalie Portman's portrayal of the young Queen. Jake Lyod's Anakin is very raw and he has an unpolished quality that naturally comes through for me. 'How does this wideeyed boy become so disenchanted with his life that he believes his only recourse is the Dark Side?'These elements are done very well and are typical Star Wars fare. To me this movie is a great opening act introducing the world to the players and eludes to future events. For me this movie sure teases the appetite for more and I know that I will see Attack of the Clones because of the questions left unanswered by The Phantom Menace. As a stand alone film this movie was an incredible movie experience.",9,90,180,21 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An experience that ends so suddenly.....
","I personally enjoyed this film tremendously. There are few superlatives to describe the experience that have not been used used previously and I recommend this movie that enjoys adventure and fantasy in their storytelling because to me these things were fully realized on the screen for 2hours and 10 minutes. I do however believe that the pacing of the movie itself is faster than I would have wanted. What a short 130 it is indeed. I, for one, would not have mind staying in that galaxy for a little while longer. The frenetic pace that events unfold in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is so uncanny that it demands repeat viewings and exploratory conversations. In fact I have seen the movie three times and actually hope to see it again before it leaves theaters. I left with questions such as 'Is that it, but what about..... and why did this.....?'My interest is peaked for events that have already been played out in the first three movies.",9,0,1,28 May 1999
Match Point," I enjoyed this movie
","I enjoyed this movie. I liked the performances. I liked that the audience stays with the protagonist right up through all of his decisions. I liked the fact that he made a choice that most of us would not make yet I believe that at the same time some in the audience would rationalize a way into making a similar choice to Chris. Whether or not the director chose the right backdrops or scenes to show of London, I couldn't tell you. This wasn't Before Sunset people. This movie was different and worth seeing and I am surprised that some thought it was terrible. Its always refreshing to see a movie where none of the characters are stupid.",8,1,4,22 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This movie is a great addition to the series without a doubt.
","For fans of the original trilogy of films Attack of the Clones is made for you in mind. On that level it is immensely enjoyable. Those that are not interested would find it harded to get involved or wrapped up in because this movie will leave you asking a lot of question while it answers questions for fans. I personally liked this movie and I found the acting to be just fine. Hayden Christensen does a great job playing Anakin. The whole purpose of his character is to show how such a good kid could be swayed to do evil, to commit evil. Those that critizize the prequels do so because they expect it to be very dark and full of mayhem. Those looking for faults will find it because that's what they are looking for. If there is a criticism that I could levy it is these: 1. this movie is not made for those who know little to nothing about Star Wars. 2. the love story did not have to be so thin. As it stands it seems as if Amidala's affections are in response to her and Anakin's dire circumstances. I am a guy and I still thought some scenes should have been left in order to show some of Amidala's passion giving in to Anakin, a tad more teasing from Amidala to Anakin and vice versa. 3. Show a bit more of Anakin's vengence on the Tusken raiders camp. George Lucas intends for this movie to be darker but I believe he shyed away from this key point to Anakin's psyche here. Another theory I have as to why some are thrilled with AotC and some aren't is who you as the viewer identified with as a child watching the movies. As a child I saw the classic triology through the eyes of Luke Skywalker. Those of you who idetified with Han Solo would be hard pressed to find him in these prequels and for you the saga doesn't live up to what you remembered. There is really no skeptic of the 'Force' in these prequels. In these prequels I identify with Anakin and I wonder how he becomes Darth Vader? That to me is the whole point of the prequels and to me I really do want to see how that innocent little boy becomes so supremely evil. In Episode II there are hints to these machinations in Anakin's head. There is still so much ground to cover for George Lucas in the next installment and as a fan of great movies I can't wait to see it.",10,8,12,30 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Aching to see this movie again.
","I saw this movie twice when it was first released. I really thought I would have seen it more times already. I enjoyed my overall experience. Criticisms include; 1. Their should have been more obvious signs of flirting and courtship between Anakin and Padme i.e the scene were Anakin and Padme are discussing what Jedi are allowed to do and she asks him 'Are you allowed to love?' and less scenes of her refusing his advances, 2. Lucas not being camera shy towards Anakin's anger - this is suppose to be a darker trilogy, 3. Darth Sidious/Senator Palpatine should be made more obvious to the audience, because he isn't so obvious this movie doesn't stand so well alone as an independent movie, 4. for me personally I would have liked Anakin's hand in the end to have been completely covered by a black glove that would have been sweet I think. Despite these criticisms I still enjoyed this movie and I want to see it again before it leaves theaters this summer. As it stands I actually feel very sorry for Anakin and Padme. Anakin because he inherently is good but I know who and what is to become of him and for Padme because she is an innocent who tries to do the right thing and I believe she will pay a hefty price for it. The way George has set this thing up so far it seems like there can be little to nothing uplifting for Episode III.",10,0,0,11 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Disappointed utterly....
","I saw this movie with great expectations and with an open mind. To be truthful there were some delightful moments in this movie. Namely I enjoyed the camera trick that allowed Ian Mckellen to tower over the Hobbits. I enjoyed Ganondorf entertaining the Hobbits, and I liked the unique angles that Peter Jackson used to show off his near three hour long spectacle. Before I get bemoanings that this is suppose to be the first part of a triology let me state clearly that I already knew that this is supppose to be the first part of a trilogy. Yet with all of my intentions of being an unbiased movie viewer I was truly disappointed by this experience. Firstly, I found this movie to be no better than the generic sci/fi, fantasy movie. Sorry to say it but I am never merely blown away by special effects. Effects should be part of the kinetics of an already well filmed story. Too many times in effects movies today the effects are used to wow audiences and to me are empty calories for my movie appetite. I found Fellowship of the Rings to be heavy in these effects. There were so many great actors in this movie. What really was the purpose of Cate Blanchet's character. I really thought she would be the movies' salvation towards the end but alas the actress who so marvelously portrayed Elizabeth was wasted as another piece of eye candy. Ganandorf who I believe to be the films best character found his uses depleted to that of the 'look out' warning the Fellowship every step of the way. I really dislike when a movie puts arbitrary bad guys in only to be the fall guys for our heroes. This movie never took it to the next level and does not live up to the benchmarks of the movies it seeks company with in the imagination arena such as Aliens, The Matrix, The Terminator series, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and yes The Star Wars saga. Ultimately I do think I will see the remaining movies in this series. I would like to see if the series could redeem itself. I think the Academy embarrassed themselves{ with me at least} by nominating this movie for best picture.",7,1,2,20 February 2002
