Marie Antoinette," Marie Antionette
","My husband and I just finished watching Marie Antoinette. To be honest we didn't know what to expect after reading all the negative criticism It certainly was different in a wonderful way. I loved the modern music played. throughout the movie.. There is little dialogue in this visualize stunning movie. I don't think I have ever seen a story unfold as nicely as a visual not a verbal story. I think the critics would have liked it better if Marie Antoinette had been portrayed in the historic stereotypical manner  the high spending queen that brought France down. (When in doubt blame the woman.) It could have then been followed by lots of mob action scenes and a good, dramatic beheading  after all, blood and guts sells!. Besides we were not prejudiced because the assistant editor is our daughter.",8,0,1,16 February 2007
