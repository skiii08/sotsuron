Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Excellent!
","Obviously, when watching vol. 2 you expect the bloodspree from vol. 1 to continue but in many ways the two films are very different - and that is not a bad thing, although I love them both!Where as vol. 1 is concentrated mostly about sheer fighting and blood squrting, vol. 2 provides a much deeper depth to the characters. There is so many references I cannot begin to list them down, typical thing for Tarantino ofcourse. So many shifts in style, yet it works beautifully. Many surprises, some leaves you giggling, others makes your spine chill..These two films suffered a lot of harsh critisism from the 'real' Tarantino fans (whoever they are - I consider myself one and I LOVE Kill Bill!)....but don't judge until you've seen vol. 2 cause that in many ways IS Tarantino-back-to-basics, if you can call it that.9/10, absolutely, positively, without a shred (pond intended!) of doubt!",Null,1,2,28 April 2004
Requiem for a Dream," A straight 10 pointer!!!!!!
","This is probably the most depressing, dark and utterly beautiful film I have ever seen. The moral is pretty simple: Don't do drugs, be that coke or died pills, that s**t will kill you.This is definately a flick that will stick with me forever - haven't seen anything this horrid since the german 1982 flick 'Christiane F.', which is about the same topic, kids going drugs (well, this one also has an elderly women going nuts over diet pills - but in general, she definately had some issues from the beginning..)And another thing about this movie - I'm in love now! I've seen Jen Connelly several times before in several films, but I never realized how beautiful she was until this moment.. *sigh*Anyway, don't miss this film - it would be a crime against yourself. It's sad, granted, and you'll probably be wheaping when the credits starts rolling - but this is ONE movie that makes you feel!!!",10,0,1,4 July 2003
Monster," Breathless
","Just finished watching this film and first off I wanna say to anyone who argued that Charlize Theron did not deserve her oscar for this role probably never saw real acting before. I was stunned - she is amazing in this role. I always saw her as the pretty girl who just spiced up the pictures with average talent but this film sure proves me wrong.It's a very nihilistic picture, granted. And not one with a very bright and shiny feel-good message, but such is life at times - brutal and unfair. Obviously she lost her mind and you can always argue if she is allowed to do what she did, and ofcourse she was NOT. ***SPOILERS*** Self defence is one thing, but it is obvious that she is not without confidence. She actually has human feelings - see, she kills out of love (and frustration but that is due to her background), but she actually feels sorry for the big guy she at first believes wants to 'ruff' her up. Then what I don't get is the old man killing by the end - but maybe it is all to show that she has now totally lost it, who can tell....small points there, but still an amazing film..Seems also to be a trend among Hollywood beauties to put 'ugly-face' make up and then win oscars, it's been going like that for quite a few years now, but as long as it is deserved, fine - and in the case of 'Monster', Charlize Theron definately deserves her oscar, no doubt!8/10",10,1,1,9 March 2004
Underworld," Started off awesome, buuuuut...
","Watched this flick a few weeks back since I love vampire and horror films, and with people saying this would be a such in Matrix style, you cannot go wrong, right?Hm...well, it started off totally great! A very cool action shoot out action scene, which must be what brough on the Matrix factor. However, with that scene ending, it all just goes downhill. There's no real plot, to little action and too much yada yada...*MILD SPOILERS* What really sturred me was a chase scene that looks almost as ripped out of T2... A lead vampire runs after the car, jumps on the back of it, smashes the roof with a clawthingie, they pull the breaks, he stumbles off, rolls across the pavement, they drive on, he gets up in the rolling move and continues the pursue...ok, it's a short scene, however, bit by bit, very...inspired... by Terminator 2, undoubtfully..Well...it was an ok film, but it started off very action filled and the tempo falls very rapidly during the film, which makes you care very little around what's it really about..6/10",Null,0,1,24 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Is this truly a remake???
","I watched this film yesterday, enjoyed it absolutely, but I was several times thinking if this was really a remake. I watched the 1978-original a few years ago and not much in this flick reminded me of the original...nevertheless, good entertainment, I recommend it....only I wonder why a high roller like Ving Rhames agreed to do this film, anyone else in it is virtually unknown...However, I still prefer zombies walking slowly instead of running...adds more to the suspense...cudos on their frowning at the mouth though *G*7/10",Null,0,0,26 May 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Absolutely brilliant!
","Now THIS was a nice surprise! Finally a decent film, and this is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in a long, long time! Granted, to like this movie it DOES require that you like films such as Braindead and Bad Taste both by Peter Jackson - who by the way warmly recommends it as well - but the humour alone is worth it.Nice acting as well, sure sometimes it may seem overacted but it fits the style of film perfectly, and the very vivid expressions of the actors only makes it all the more funny..*SPOILERS* The title is totally fitting, the leading character Shaun IS living a zombie like existence - not in the accurate sense of the word but you know what I mean - and the fact alone that he is walking amongst zombies and hours without noticing something is wrong is just hilarious. I was rolling around the floor, nearly splitting my sides from laughing.THIS is a film I truly recommend!9/10",Null,1,2,3 September 2004
Coffee and Cigarettes," Quite entertaining
","I watched this recently having had it recommended by several friends and people I work with. I was uplifted in a strange way, cause it was very entertaining.The film in itself contains on 8 or 9 short films with people just talking, and while that may sound kind of boring, it actually is far from just that. Some bits are clearly better than others, but my favorite is especially Iggy Pop talking to Tom Waits - THAT is so funny seeing these two legendary musicians not really being able to communicate and misunderstand each other all the time.Other bits vary, some are directly boring, others are quite amusing as well and even though this is about 90 minutes of pure talk person to person about the topic - coffee and cigarettes - I recommend it. It's quite amusing, but probably not for the kids, cause they will find it boring.7/10",7,1,2,14 May 2005
Spider-Man 2," A good sequel..
","I know the opinions about this film are many, but it occurs to me that surprisingly few apparently know the original storyline of Spiderman, and if anything, Sam Raimi follows this story line..The film picks up about two years after the first film - the Osbourne son is still heavily and sickly set on revenge on Spiderman for the killing of his father, Osbourne Sr., or The Green Goblin as it were..On the side a wellknown Doctor Octavius is finished up his life work, but something goes horribly wrong as he is to introduce it to his investors...Spiderman II is, like Spiderman I, a thrillride of a roller-coaster trip, incredible pictures, amazing scenery and action packed from start to end. The line are a little cheesy though, however it is in true spirit of the original storyline so you of course forgive that.Can't wait for Spiderman III...8/10",Null,0,0,7 July 2004
Final Destination 2," A typical sequal..
","Ever heard the expression that a sequel fails every time - and while that unfortunately is true in 99.5% of all cases, this one is no exception..It's tacky, nothing new - it has a great scene of a huge carcrash in the beginning, though - very well carried out, kept me on the edge of my seat...too bad for the rest for the film I kept sliding more and more down in my seat almost falling asleep by the end..It's a typical horror movie, following up on an already average first movie..",Null,0,0,14 July 2003
The Village," Pretencious and predictable
","Contains Spoiler It's very easy to follow the directors stream of surprises now. First was The Sixth Sense which was an incredible film, then came Unbreakable which was also very good, then Signs that gave what could have been an interesting story a tedious and predictable look, and now The Village which is even more predictable than Signs.It has a nice story, somehow I like it, very nice cast, good story, nice atmosphere....BUT - you already guessed the ending after watching for five minutes....***SPOILERS*** My thoughts were: 'Either this story is set in the 19th century, or it is set in the 21st century, only it is a village far away from the world as the rest of us know it'....and what do you know; I was right..BUT - nevertheless, an OK story, worth seeing, but don't make the same mistake I did and expect, or even dare HOPE, for a film as original as The Sixth Sense...6/10",Null,0,0,8 September 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Absolutely brilliant
","First thing about this film I wanna point out is how difficult it must be to follow up on two already perfect films. It must be a task that can keep any script writer and any director awake at night.This film is brilliant! Alone it stands out as totally brilliant, but seen in the aspect of it's two processors it has more than a little bit of a hard time following up and keeping appearances.The choice of casting Nick Stahl was John Connor is not a very bright choice - sure could do a lot worse, but also a lot better. Casting a female model(?) to play the evil Terminator looks a little lame. I would much rather have gone with Juliette Lewis or someone else of her character. She is too clean cut and too faceless, somehow.Anyway, STILL a way above average film. I'd give it 8.5/10 still, but then again I might be biased caused I was raised with these films and in my eyes they can NEVER be bad",Null,0,0,14 July 2003
BASEketball," Indecently hilarious!
","I once watched Baseketball, got hooked and since then I watched it like 50 times. It is one of the films I cannot ever seem to grow tried of. I don't know what it is about it, but it is somehow so complete in its rough form.Obviously, it doesn't hurt that there is plenty of nude (and amazingly gorgeous) women in the film (Victoria Silvstedt; WOW! is the only word that springs to mind!!!), but also because it is so delightedly respect-less towards just about anyone or anything.All I can say to this flick is, if you like South Park, you'll LOVE this one! In fact, anyone with a sense of humour should enjoy this one!7/10",Null,56,72,1 June 2004
Van Helsing," What's with those accents?
","Oh brother...being a huge fan through my entire life of vampire and monster flicks I had to catch this one and I have to say it was kinda entertaining, although not that well carried out.THIS I have to say, though - HORRIBLE ACTING! Kate Beckinsale, gorgeous as she may be, should really take acting lessons! Hugh Jackman is just doing his usual 'I wanna be Clint Eastwood' routine...and those accents - it is SO getting at my nerves that they both make up some phony accent but doesn't even have the common decency to stick to it. Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to brush his accent away in his recent movies, these two 'actors' are having a quite hard time remembering to USE their phony accents all the time - not very believable when ordinary American accents (Jackman) or English accents (Beckinsale) slips through...very amateurish indeed!Still an entertaining movie though, but many things does that this is just average in the end..5/10",Null,0,1,18 May 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Don't know what to think..
","Uhm I don't know if I'm disappointed or not - I love the Aliens and Predator flicks, but this entry seems kinda pointless. I did my best to keep up with it, but it just made no sense. It was very confusing. ***SPOILERS INCLUDED***The film has a lot of awesome fighting sequences, though.. But honestly, the Predator turning good to fight the vicious Aliens? That's kinda lame...but then I hope I misunderstood something..The acting is kinda lame as well - especially the female lead is horrific. And when she in the end imitates Arnie's old 'You are one ugly motherf...' line I honest felt like walking away from my seat..As I old and devoted fan of both Predator and Aliens, I honestly think this film is the very worst of the tribe - however, for the fighting sequences, still worth a look..The end again, ticked me off...nothing could be more obvious, they actually use the good old 'See you on the sequel' trick in the very last scene.....please stop here and show the two series some respect.Still, for the sheer entertainment, 5/10",Null,0,0,27 August 2004
Hellboy," Quite entertaining..
","I know this film suffered an enourmous amount of slaying from the original fans, as they call themselves. Granted, for myself, I never heard of the comics until I heard of the film, and so far I have yet to read the comics, so I cannot judge on whether or not the film is true to the comic..BUT - this I must say, I sat through the film, and was enourmously entertained. A lot of cheesy dialogue, this is true - but it is not done without a winking eye. The effects are pretty cool and well carried out and in many ways it was easy to see that this was the same director who did 'Blade II'....and that meant in a positive way as I rather liked that flick aswell - opposite of many, I'm told, but reluctant to understand why.I love Spawn aswell, and the universe in particular, which might be why I was driven to this film. I didn't expect Brando-like acting or art in the way and I didn't get it - what I expected was violent action, and I definately got my share of that.7/10",Null,0,0,20 April 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not as bad as people say..
","..well, it's hard to sit down with a good feel watching a film, when all the criticism you've heard has been hammering it to the ground..I think this film is not at all as bad as many say it is, sure it has it's flaws and mishaps, but it's an action flick, it's made to entertain and it does does.....However - talking about a failure in the cast, check out Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine - she ruined the entire film for me, I thought her so called 'acting' was the worst I've seen in a long time; stumbles across her lines, absolutely no believability (and notice how I say 'lines' cause she more or less reads them), and...wow, I know Hollywood has gone downhill, but using this poor excuse for an actress really does it for me...I truly hope I'll never see her in another film!Anyway, the third part is in it's way and let's hope that's it, they're already milking the franchise as it is..5/10",Null,0,3,23 September 2004
Shrek 2," A truly worthy sequel!
","You know how it is, you love a film, a sequel comes out, you're both eager and reluctant to see it, cause how much you loved the original films, usually that is how much you will be disappointed by the sequel..HOWEVER, with that said, I must say that Shrek 2 was an exception. It made me laugh almost more than the original - and that's saying a lot! - and the story was hilarious... Starting to wonder about the rumoured part 3 now, hope they won't pull a Matrix on it now that even the sequel has been well responded to.Loved the trick of putting John Cleese to voice the father...thumbs up!8/10",Null,0,0,10 June 2004
Big Fish," Amazing film, Burton rules
","I must say I was reluctant as I always am when everybody tells me to see a movie - you know, high expections and they almost never gets full filled...HOWEVER - Big Fish is an amazing film; touching, well (if not even perfectly!) acted, geniously told, and a very nice twist in the end that still leaves a little doubt in my mind what it is actually all about...the kind of film that makes you leave the cinema thinking and not easily forgotten...wonderful...Tim Burton has always been a genius but to my mind this film tops it!9/10",Null,0,0,26 May 2004
The Descent," So very claustrophobic!
","Man, it is so rare I am affected by a movie I see, but this one truly gave me the chills. It gave me an all-around feeling of total and utter claustrophobia and that was even before the main plot of the films takes over.A bunch of female friends challenge themselves to descent into a mountain, very deep and narrow. They crawl through narrow holes they can barely fit into, holes so narrow the only way if forward, there is no turning back......but that is only the 'fun' beginning, deeper without the mountain they stumble across something much, much worse.I'm much into horror films but I'm also very critical...this one however kept me in total suspense...I'll give it a 9 of out 10...easy as that!",9,0,1,7 August 2005
War of the Worlds," So mediocre...
","To be honest, I'm very disappointed..I mean, the film is well made, when it comes to the special effects, everything looks overwhelming. The acting is brilliant, I think Tom Cruise is better than the last many years. Dakota Fanning is definitely going places, she has a huge talent - although I several times got the urge to strangle her because of all the mindless screaming...but then again, given the situation, how would one self react?What disturbs me are the GIANT plot holes....without wanting to spoil anything, I can say that they are embarrassingly obvious.....you definitely don't even need to be a movie-buff to spot them, even my girlfriend who usually swallows all sorts of film excitement raw shook her head in awe....Spielberg, what were you thinking?This is a solid 5/10, the plot holes drags it down from what could have been 8 or 9, if Spielberg would have had any respect left for his audience...",1,1,1,20 August 2005
Downfall," Bruno Ganz is my god!
","Oh my god, this movie is easily one of the three best I've ever seen. It is a true masterpiece. Very hard to watch, especially when you know all of it happened in reality. Deciding to base the film just as much on the experiences of Adolf Hitler's secretary and the things she witnessed is brilliant.And Bruno Ganz - my god, if this performance of his is not worth an Oscar, the Hollywood incarnates truly show what lousy stuff they're made of. This film could never have been made anywhere but Germany, making it into an English speaking film would be a disaster (but of course, with their tendency to remake anything over there I wouldn't be surprised! ha ha)..Go and see this film, sure it's a hard thing to watch, but it's an experience for life! 10/10 - no question in my mind!",10,4,8,14 May 2005
Bruce Almighty," Nice surprise..
","Now, for a long time I've been disappointed by new films, but this one is different. Carrey and Syadiac always makes me laugh when working together and this is no expection. Carrey plays a reporter who feels left by god and therefore challenges him. God gives him his powers for a while with hilarious consequences. The film is not particulary deep - not at all - it's a light comedy and I recommend it as a such.And I wanna add, that Jim Carrey - although I'm no devoted fan - deserved an oscar for his play in 'Man on the Moon' - nothing to do with this film, but it just felt like the time to get that off my chest ;-)",Null,0,1,29 June 2003
Identity," Slasher movie...with an edge...but WHERE?
","OK, to start off...when you see a horror movie with such prominent names as Ray Liotta and John Cusack it MUST be something special, right?Not really..This is a typical slasher movie, boring, predictable....but I have to point out what annoyed me the most: two of the female characters were both so obnoxiously annoying, but actually ROOT for them to be slaughtered as quickly as possible just so you won't have to look at them. Rebecca DeMorney playing a washed up actress is tremendously annoying, but in her case it is ok, cause it's in the character and she is intended like that..BUT..GINNY...oh my god, you just wanna kill her yourself to get things done with! Hysterical, childish, annoying, even her looks are annoying... She ruins the entire movie... I'm sorry, but she's not a very good actress - being related to Robert Duvall or not (??? I don't know for sure..) she should for damn sure have taken some acting lesssons from him!Anyway....I don't understand what all the fuzz was about, why so many people loves this movie cause it is nothing more than average. I liked the start, with a serial killer having been interviewed on tape and the psyciatrist listening, but from there it's all down hill,damn, film makers - have a little decency, some of us movie goers ARE able to tell crap from good stuff....obviously, YOU are not yourselves...",Null,0,0,24 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Amazing!! And ALMOST perfect!
","Wow, like the two earlier films I was stunned - mind you, I never read the book, and always wondered about this wild fascination so many have gotten with this series....and eventhough films taking place outside our own time never really appeal much to me, I understand that fascination now, cause these films are incredibly catchy, no doubt..My only quarrel with this particular film, Return of the King, is the fact that the ending is SO damn long! After the final battle which hardly allows you to blink once cause you would be affraid of missing anything, it ends off with about a 20 minutes long afterplay, showing whatever happens to the leading characters in the story. It is fine, and ofcourse you want closure, but 20 minuters of slow speed almost makes you fall asleep after 3 intense hours. This afterplay could easily have been a lot shorter and you would still get the same out of it......however, that is the ONLY quarrel I have with this film, and I'll give it 9.5/10, but as that is not possible, I'm afraid I have to round it down to 9/10 although the film is much better than that.",Null,2,4,18 January 2004
