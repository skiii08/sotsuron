Vertigo," hitchcock's best? i beg to differ
","to this day, i still don't understand why when the name hitchcock is mentioned in a sentence, that vertigo is quickly referred to in a matter of seconds.  maybe it's me, but although i found this to be an interesting film, it is in no means close to one of hitchcock's best works. not to say that any film was not above average, because after all, he was, is, and will always be the master, but i think that true film buffs will appreciate such works as shadow of a doubt, lifeboat, rebecca, and north by northwest much more.",Null,1,4,6 January 1999
Fargo," you've got to be kidding!
","upon viewing this film for the umpteenth time with various people, i still don't find it a masterpiece. in fact, i don't find it anything at all, just a waste of film. although the one scene involving a foot was clever and amusing, it's not worth putting up with the rest of the film to get to it. i have to wonder what the movie world is coming to when i see so many people voting for this movie. i think it is unoriginal, boring and absurd. the characters are stupid and shallow, and if i were from minnesota, i'd be angered at how they were portrayed. overall, a piece of complete trash.",Null,0,1,6 January 1999
