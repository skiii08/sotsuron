Alien 3," Absolutely, totally horrid idea for a movie
","After the first and second films in this series, I was amazed at Alien 3, a film with a plot so totally banal that one is just left without speech. Here we have a monster loose on a prison colony killing off a bunch of murderers and rapidsts condemned to life imprisonment. Who is the audience supposed to root for, the killers or the monster, and which is the monster, the alien or the murderers it is killing off? And why would anybody care? As good as Aliens was, this is just as completely horrid. Not the worst movie ever made, but it is a waste of time to watch. Instead of sitting through this dreadful bomb, go watch the original or Aliens again.",2,651,848,19 April 2005
