Skyfall," Home Alone Bond Style
","The movie was fantastic about 3/4 of the way through the movie. The last quarter its like the writers gave up. Seriously the head of MI6 and a top agent need to go and isolate themselves in a house out in the middle of nowhere in order to avoid a small terrorist group?! They're MI6 they have the full force of NATO behind them! Even if they do decide to use themselves as bait MI6 was aware of their location THE ENTIRE TIME. They couldn't have dropped some troops or supplies off; maybe have them wait in the tunnel to ambush Silva's troops?! Furthermore the antagonist Silva became extremely inconsistent in the last quarter. He could have killed M at any time in the beginning and when he went to the courthouse he intended to kill only her. Then he decides he wants to kill himself with her... what the hell? You know what would have made the movie fantastic? Have Silva kill M at the courthouse, creating a very dramatic low point for Bond believing he is washed up, then MI6 bands together to kill Silva before he unleashes some terrible plot against the country that turned its back on him.",4,14,28,26 November 2012
