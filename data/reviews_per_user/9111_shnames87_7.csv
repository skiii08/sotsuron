Ford v Ferrari," Not bad
","The movie was pretty good, there is not a ton to really say about it. Lots of fast paced race scenes and a pretty great story about a friendship between two men trying to make one of the fastest race cars of the time.The story kind of dragged at some times but was over all pretty riveting and enjoyable to watch. The acting from all parties was great and I could not ask for a better cast for the film.Something about it just did not grab me and it was not the best movie about race cars I have ever seen but enjoyable enough. Its definitely worth checking out though.",7,1,5,26 December 2019
Knives Out," Excellent mystery
","This was a very entertaining murder mystery movie. Really make you think of the game and movie Clue but much better. I was a little unsure of it going in but was pleasantly surprised.The acting was amazing, helped in large part to its outstanding cast. One glance at the cast list is enough to convince most to give this movie a shot.Its biggest downside is that once you have seen it once there really isn't much incentive to see it again as the surprise is over with. Its definitely worth watching though and I recommend it to everyone.",8,1,2,26 December 2019
The Fifth Element," One of the Best
",This movie is not only a great action science fiction piece but it is shockingly funny as well. It combines great acting with a fresh original concept. I've loved this movie from the first time I saw it and still love it when ever I re-watch it. It holds up over time and is a generally beautifully shot film as well. Everyone should see this movie.,9,1,1,26 December 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," Amazing
",This was an amazing movie that i very much enjoyed. If you get the chance to see it in theaters make sure you do so. the movie is extremely long though but thankfully there is an intermission in the film.The film is from the 60s so there is a high degree of white washing that people will just have to get over. The acting was amazing though and I just don't feel like we get this same caliber in most films these days.There are some amazing visuals in the film made even more so by the fact that CGI was not a thing and all of it was done with practical effects. The scenery and grand epic shots that were done are breath taking and made more so by seeing it on a big screen.,9,0,0,26 December 2019
The King," Pretty good
",Another fine addition to the Netflix originals that are vast and many are wonderful. It is certainly very slow paced at times as most of these middle ages epics tend to be. Much of the cast were people I had not heard of. There were a few though that I definitely recognized.The battle scenes were well done and the action was gritty and believable. I don't know how historically accurate it was as I know little about King Henry.There are definitely better movies based in the same era but this one is still worth looking at. Assuming you have Netflix there isn't much reason to not check it out. If you like movies with medieval knights and honor stuff then it should definitely be checked out and I would watch it again for sure,7,2,3,26 December 2019
Midway," Just don't bother
","Oof this movie had a lot of potential and was a bigger disappointment than I was expecting. It had so much going for it too that it should have been much better than it ended up being.The movie had its good points along with its draw backs though. The cast of this film was outstanding and I was pleasantly surprised every time a new big name actor popped up on screen, I was really not expecting that. But even with all that star power the movie fell short, the overwhelming cast is really the only big positive for this film and the general historical story that it told.The movie does cover much much more than just the battle of Midway and jumps around quite a bit. That wasn't bad necessarily but it left you trying to follow lots of major events that happened during World War 2. This could be perfectly fine if done a little better but over all was not the end of the world.The two biggest things that were the downfall of this movie were the main character and the general look of the film. Ed Skrein is absolutely abysmal in this movie, his acting was bad, the depiction of a historical figure was terrible and the fake accent he was trying to do was just grating in all regards. He was such a bad choice for this film and brought down the stellar performances of all the much more seasoned and proven actors who were in this.The movie is almost all done CGI which was to be expected after all but it looks so cartoonish and bad. The entire time I was watching it I was wondering how this new film could make this all look so bad when it had been done in the past and looked so much better. The best example would be Pearl Harbor from 2001. That film used CGI as well but it looked so much better. I wish who ever had been in charge of visuals for that movie had done this one too. It took you out of the epic events that they were showing.If you are in the mood for a good World War 2 movie look else where. I have no intention of ever seeing this again and viewed it as more a wast of time than anything else.",3,102,170,26 December 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," It was entertaining enough
",Though parts of the film were over the top and much of the military maneuverings were just a joke. The movie was over all very entertaining. There was good pacing so that it flowed well and did not go to slow or to fast at times. Some of the home life stuff could have been shorted up a bit I thought though. I thought the acting was good from all parties and everyone seemed to be honestly trying to make this a good flick. It wasn't the best war film i've seen but its far from the worst and I would watch it again.,7,2,2,5 January 2020
