Miracle," Everything a hockey movie should be!
","Miracle had everything a good hockey movie needed. Realism, intense action...everything just came together perfectly. I have seen every hockey movie ever made, and this one seriously takes the cake. My hat goes off to Kurt Russell, he shined through as Herb Brooks. I could think of no better salute to one of hockeys most influential guys. Thanks Disney, for creating a winner that will surely go down as one of the few great sports movies of my generation.",10,0,0,6 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Breathtaking view into Science Fiction
","This film is one of those landmark films that will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the most thrilling and spectacular films. The fact that they had amazing effects, but that it did not take away from the magical story which they so beautifully brought to life. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
