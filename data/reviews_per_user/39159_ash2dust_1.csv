The Blair Witch Project," trash movie
",pretty stoopid movie - where was scary part ?? the camera shakes so much (just to show that it is in the hands of amateurs) that it gives you a head ache .. i think it's another of the media hyped movies or the only other reason that people are lining up to see it is that people are so sick of big budget movies that they dig a simple low budget plot for a change - other than that i wouldn't advise any body to waste their time and money to see this movie ..,1,0,1,7 August 1999
