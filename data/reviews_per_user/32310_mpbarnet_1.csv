Mission: Impossible III," I actually liked it, except for.....
","Every stinking scene with Cruise's wife, Jules. I mean, really, was there a single scene with her that just was not painful? And *SPOILER*, as far as the ending goes, how anti-climatic is it for a nurse, who should be rather disoriented, after getting a pretty difficult Cliff's Notes version of 'How to handle a handgun,'; that she ends up taking out the true protagonist and one of his henchmen to end the film.Anyone else worried about the abilities of our CIA and Sped Ops agents that a nurse with no training or skill at all can do that? Cut the movie on DVD without her in it at all, and you've got my $19.99.Michael",6,0,1,7 May 2006
