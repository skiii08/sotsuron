Blade Runner 2049," An incredible follow up to the original Blade Runner
","Off the bat 'Blade Runner 2049' begins with some truly breathtaking cinematography that continues throughout the whole film. The choice of colour for scenes is extremely attention grabbing. Ryan Gosling nails the role of the replicant 'K' with his performance during his investigations. Ryan Gosling also has a very fluent relationship with the love interest 'Joi' played by Ana Des Armas. As well Harrison Ford reprises his role as 'Rick Deckard' and delivers a great performance as he is very energetic and engaging in all of his scenes. Without discussing the actors or plot, this film brilliant incorporates the themes of its predecessor as well as aiming to introduce new ideas to stand on its own as a fantastic mystery/sci-fi film. As the original Blade Runner influenced a whole generation of sci-fi films, I believe this newer installment will influence other movie sequels to visit their own original movie and then improve.Definitely worth a watch for any kind of viewer 9/10.",10,1,7,27 January 2018
Dunkirk," A Terrific War Piece For the Ages
","Dunkirk is a masterfully shot film with brilliant stunts and superb acting. The only possible aspect lacking in the film was the characters and their development, however this film didn't choose to focus mainly on the characters but rather to focus on the events that they went through. The dogfights and ship scenes fully immersed the audience into the action. Throughout the film, Christopher Nolan, decided to intersperse the three perspectives to then be able to link all of the events together. The inclusion of each perspective including 'The Mole', 'The Sea' and 'The Air' added to the suspense as we can see how the struggles through one section may affect the other perspectives.Christopher Nolan, once again, produced an outstanding film, that details the events of Dunkirk. 9/10",9,5,12,22 July 2017
Donnie Darko," A brilliant story of a deranged teen
","Donnie Darko masterfully presents a thought provoking plot that is laced with themes and messages. Once again Jake Gyllenhaal provides a superb portrayal of the troubled, Donnie Darko. Jake provides a certain addition of emotions into the character that would have been hard to find in other actors. The ensemble of supporting actors, as well, support Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. With the troublesome family, love interest and the manipulative frank, a full on story is brought out. The story arch of the end of the world keeps the attention span of the audience on the film. The ending is left fairly ambiguous which adds to the story as the audience is then able to form their own understanding of the film. A truly stunning picture from, Richard Kelly, which is worth your time. 9/10",9,0,0,17 July 2017
