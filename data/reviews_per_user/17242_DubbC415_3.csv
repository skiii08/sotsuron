Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," way underrated!
","Okay, first of all, people people please! This is a star wars movie! Remember the seventies and how people just absolutely loved star wars. Okay man! This movie is way underrated. Okay I must admit that the story is a little bad and so is the acting, but the action and the fun is so cool! I never saw it in theaters. It was all of you who had to pay for tickets which became part of the 920,000,000$ that it made world wide. I think that this is a great movie and one of the best sci-fi movies ever. It is way better than the matrix and should have totally won best visual effects and best sound and sound effects editing way over the matrix. So, therefore I think that Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is one of the best sci-fi movies ever or at least I think it is.",10,0,1,16 October 2006
The Patriot," Much more than an action movie as to what you've been hearing. One of the greatest war movies ever and the greatest of 2000.
","I do not get it. Why does everybody hate this movie? Maybe because it is just an action movie and not historically accurate. So what? This is a great movie! I love how well the story is. It seems so classic and unique at the same time. I think that Mel Gibson did a great job in this movie. At the final battle, I love the part where he goes 'Hold the line! Hold the line! Hold! Hold!' That quote will be in my memory forever. I will also always remember the scene when he is riding on his horse and holding the flag and you can see the sunset right behind the flag. I love how he is haunted by his past from the French and Indian war. I also love how the dad on grounded for life approves of slavery and doesn't like blacks but the black soldier in the militia eventually become good friends. This is not just an action film. This is a great war film! This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It may not be historically accurate, but it is still a great entertaining movie that should have been nominated for all Oscars. Especially best actor, best original screenplay, best director, and best picture.",10,2,6,20 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," My favorite movie of all time!
","I first saw this movie when I was 3. I loved it because I didn't know what to think. It is a great movie. It totally deserved to win best picture over Annie hall and best director! I have seen this Star Wars at least 100 times. Now, to some of you, that is not a very big number. I am a big star wars fan. I absolutely love John Williams' score. It has the best music ever. This is way better than the 11th best movie of all time. It is totally the best movie over The Godfather. George Lucas is a genius. He is the best director of all time. But I don't get why everybody at IMDb likes Empire Strikes Back better. I think that it is the worst. It is totally worthy of all Oscars. A New Hope that is. So, if you don't like my comment, suck it. I am only 13. But, I hope you like this movie as much as I did.",10,0,1,2 October 2006
