First Man," Finally, Space films done right
","What more can I say than the fact that this was written really well. It's not your typical cliche space film. Great work from the choreography to the score. Damien's shots were pratique as well, however the fact of claustrophobia is taken in account through the shots Damien insisted. If you get motion sickness, try to skip this one. Good space film.",6,1,3,26 January 2019
The Revenant," Original and Magnificent
","Hands down this movie was done so well. From the acting to the picture, everything fit so well. I can't describe to you the appreciation I have towards the cinematography in this film and the effort it took to make the natural light fit. Alejandro did such an amazing job on the shots and the story was just so original. The life of these men was difficult and Alejandro portrays it so well. Definitely go see this movie and look above the entertainment aspect and appreciate it for everything. The CGI in this film was great as well but what really made me admire this film a lot was the lack of using CGI. The landscapes were all real from the mountains to the forest. You do not see that a lot in movies these days so it was amazing to see this was REAL life shooting. Just thinking how they filmed in parts of Canada and Argentina with a crew of 100+ is amazing. Great film, I hope to see Alejandro continue with this sort of taste to cinema.",9,0,0,6 April 2018
A Quiet Place," Fun Film
","Anxiety building film which causes you at some point in the film to decide if you should leave because of all the harsh breathing you are doing. Jump scares were magnificent and did not scare the individual but did terrify them. The plot is origninal and Krasinski did an amazing job of portraying his vision. The cast was great, especially the older daughter. My only downfall to his is the lack of horror. The creature we see throughout the film did not terrify me to the extreme of horror. The sound effects did terrify me but not so much the monster. I feel as the monster should be more horrifying, it reminded me of a dinosaur that went bad. Overall, original script, good picture, good shots, and good cast. The only downfall is the CGI of the creature. Go watch this film...",6,9,16,19 April 2018
