Ali," 4/10
","This movie desperately needed a script doctor, it was extremely disappointing. It is not entertaining at all, the timelines are a mess/hard to keep up with, the boxing scenes drag (but are also the best part of the movie). The movie is more like teaching Ali's history and not being a film, it's a disaster",4,0,0,21 June 2020
The Babadook," 3.5/10
","I really don't get why this movie has the praise it got. People saying its one of the scariest horror films? That really confuses me, the book or Mr. Babadook doesn't really do anything scary or more does things that are overdone to death in other horror flicks. The movie kinda reminds me of The Shining, with the kid being Danny and the mother being a mixture of Jack and Wendy. Speaking of the kid, he is really annoying throughout the film. Overall, the film is not scary AT ALL, it's kinda bland and it's not anything worth watching again",4,4,7,12 May 2020
The Hateful Eight," 5.5/10
","I LOVE Tarantino's work, he is a genius in filmmaking. However, The Hateful Eight was a little too slow, very talky compared to his others, maybe more than Death Proof, and did not deserve the almost 3 hour length. the score is also really good and fits the movie's theme. In terms of the plot, I like the idea, being stuck at a cabin during a blizzard, classic idea, but you gotta have something going on to make it interesting, rather than just them chit-chatting, but when the movie does get into more entertaining/actiony parts, it gets WEIRD, like the vomiting blood scene. I also had no clue what the point of the movie was until almost the end, and even then, I had to also look it up online. Compared to his other films though, this is nowhere near as good as his others, it would definitely benefit being cut down and maybe restructured.",5,0,1,22 June 2020
BlacKkKlansman," 6.5/10
","I've never been fan of Spike Lee, but this was fairly good, however, it's got some slow parts that don't mesh with the rhythm of the movie. The movie also doesn't feel translated well from the book is based on, but overall, it's not bad and it has it's moment. I do feel the movie is a bit overrated, especially today.",6,0,1,1 July 2020
American Psycho," 8.5/10
","By far, probably one of the best character study films ever. It's suspenseful, it keeps you guessing, and you can't take your eyes off of it. The movie is really really good, my only problem is I wasn't a fan of the gratuitous sex throughout it, it was just a little too weird. But overall, great film.",8,0,0,24 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 9.5/10
","Tarantino's films are pretty hit or miss but this one is so good. Some might think it's a little long or just a little weird, but that's part of it's charm, all the characters are incredible, the ending is great, though it could've been true to the real story where Sharon Tate was murdered. Overall, great love letter to people love films",10,12,17,7 May 2020
Titanic," 10/10
","A perfect movie to me, loved the romance, loved the tension, loved the soundtrack, everything is amazing. My only problems with the movie are the fact that Billy Zane's character is way over the top to Leo's character for no good reason, also Kate's character could have saved Leo's by moving over at the very end. Otherwise, everything else is perfect, has lots of rewatch value.",10,2,2,22 June 2020
