Requiem for a Dream," Superb
","Darren aronofsky directs Jared Leto, Ellen burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans in this disturbing spiral of a film.The story centerers around four 'drug addicts' the characters played by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans are all teenagers who start off dabbling in heroin, until it stars to dominate their life and starts to get out of control, the two boys start to get into very dangerous situations and Jennifer Connelly starts to get into prostitution. The key character however is Ellen burstyn, mother of Jared Leto who lives by herself sat in her armchair all day watching a day time television show. She receives a letter one day claiming that she has won a competition to be on television, of course she is over the moon but unfortunately she can't fit in to her old red dress. she comes to the conclusion that diet pills are the way forward but to her peril, she soon finds out that the pills are addictive and unhealthy. Her life starts to go the same way as her sons life.This film is one of the best examples if not the best of modern society and culture. Aronofsky will get a Lot of stick from some people about this film but he doesn't pull any punches and why should he? There is such a deep meaning here, even if it isn't finding nemo (great film) but aronofsky is saying that don't have a go at kids for drugs, because it is ingrained in our society he shows this by using Ellen burstyn, she is an innocent old lady and she becomes a drug addict, burstyn portrays her sweet innocence well but also the characters deranged side. What is very clever is for most of the film we know that the younger three are on heroin but we don't see them use it exactly until Jared Leto uses it in his infected arm. Perhaps the most chilling scene is where Jennifer Connelly 'performs' in front of a crowd, just for some drugs, Jared Leto her boyfriend encourages her to do this but she doesn't seem to even hesitate with it. I'm not surprised that this film didn't win any Oscars etc this isn't a film that the 'higher powers' would vote for but that doesn't take anything away from it.This film is a huge statement about our culture and one that some people won't like but as a teenager myself I would find requiem for a dream as a greater warning, as opposed to the kind of films they show you at school about drugs, this is nowhere near government propaganda as some of the others are but a realism story about how harmful drugs really are.",10,2,3,13 October 2014
The Great Gatsby," disappointing
","The newest adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's vastly well known novel, is directed by Baz Luhrmann, staring Leonardo DI Caprio as Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as daisy and Tobey Maguire as nick caraway.Most people will know the plot but for those that don't.....Nick caraway moves to new york trying to become a stockbroker in the mid 1920's but instead of working finds himself caught up alcohol fueled parties that were rife in the city. He moves into his modest apartment next to a huge mansion, who he is told belongs to the mysterious Gatsby. Gatsby throws huge parties often for the general public to enjoy, Nick attends one of these parties and ends up befriending Gatsby. As their friendship grows, Gatsby becomes more trusting in Nick and asks if he can invite his cousin daisy Buchanan round for tea, so he can 'bump'into her. It turns out that the married Daisy and the the rather unknown Gatsby fell in love when they were young and have held a candle for each other ever since. The question is does it do justice to the book?The answer unfortunately is a resounding no! i have seen this film 4 or 5 times and each time my dislike of it has grown. It's hard to know where to start with this film, there are so many negative views i have on it. The film is made with huge house, big parties and fancy clothing, in true baz Luhrmann style that is all the substance you get. Carey mulligan is mind numbingly boring as daisy and not interesting at all. However the performance i have the biggest problem with is Tobey Maguire who narrates the story and it is seen through his eyes, i spent the entire film wanting to knock him out as i felt he was nothing more than a 'scrape' and a bit annoying. There is no sense of the time period at all, with a bizarre modern day soundtrack booms out, which are good songs but not for The Great Gatsby, this makes the film feel like it is set in a club in the 21st century. Luhrmann goes for deeply emotional scenes and completely fails in my opinion. The one very dimly light shining light is Di Caprio in his Disney themed mansion, who gives a performance far better than anyone elseThis fantastic piece of American literature has been attempted as a film many times and success has not really been found as of yet. This is an extremely hard book to make into a good film you can give Luhrmann that but not much else. This isn't the worst film i have seen but because of how well known it is and expected it was, this bad piece of filmaking will never be forgotten!",3,7,10,18 October 2014
