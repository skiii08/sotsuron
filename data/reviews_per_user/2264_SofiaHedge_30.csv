The Little Mermaid," An interesting story that's worth a watch
","The Little Mermaid is considered to be a classic by many people, and that may be true, but this story doesn't have a female protagonist who can stand up for herself. Now before you say anything, let me say that Ariel, our main protagonist, is still quite spunky and actually has a sense of adventure, but she actually gives up her beautiful, lovely voice for a prince she barely knows! If I were her, I'd listen to my father some of the time, and I wouldn't so dangerously naive. I'd still tell my father that all humans aren't bad, and even if he doesn't listen, I won't care. I'd still run away, but I would not be fooled by Ursula. I'd just roam the seas, and I'd be able to get resources on my own. Ursula is still a good villain. I'm just thankful that there are more strong Disney female protagonists nowadays.",7,0,0,23 May 2020

","I think this movie is amusing and entertaining. It was emotional and had meaning. It's the story of Dory finding her parents, who she can't quite remember because of her short term memory. Dory, as a protagonist, was very interesting and amusing. So were the other characters, especially Marlin and Nemo. The animation was terrific.
