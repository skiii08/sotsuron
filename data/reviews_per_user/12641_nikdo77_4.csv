Men in Black 3," Men in Black III best MIB movie with great actors: enjoyed it a lot!
","Men in Black III is by far the best Men in Black Movie. Men in Black I was bringing the concept and the story about the 2 'Men in Black'. Men in Black II more like a follow-up movie without a big blast. Men in Black III is great and I would say a nice surprise! My wife and I went to the cinema with the intention to go the movie 'The Avengers' but that one was not at the time we arrived so we went to Men in Black III. Men in Black III was great: the characters, actors, special effects, aliens and the overall storyline were splendid.I don't want to tell you much about the story because It contains some nice surprises I appreciated a lot and I don't want to ruin your joy of watching this movie. The review who is on top right now contains spoilers according to my opinion: I wouldn't like to know the things he has written in advance.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both great actors. Josh Brolin as the 'young Tomme Lee Jones' was also great. As usual you know Will Smith will control the movie. Will Smith remains to be the best actor who gives you positive energy. You can clearly see Tommy Lee Jones has aged and his grumpy face is great: I love him! His character remains to be the one of sarcastic grumpy man with a good sense of reality: he thinks before acting. Will Smth remains to be the humoristic positive man with a bad sense of reality: he doesn't think before acting. I really like these personalities.Storyline, characters and especially the originality of all of the aliens: a big 8! Jemaine Clement as 'Boris The Animal', the bad guy was great: he must be the best bad guy I have seen in ages because you really feel this guy is a big troublemaker.What's bad? I think there could have been more 3D special effects in this movie or do I expect to much from 3D? At the end I pay more to see a 3D movie but I was disappointed on the amount of 3D scenes.It was clearly a movie where both the actors as well as the director and his crew were trying hard to make this movie a enjoyable movie: it was not 'the best of the best' but a very nice movie with great actors, storyline, aliens.. you will certainly enjoy it.... Have fun watching Men in Black III",8,2,8,24 May 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Worst Star Trek movie ever: went into the Darkness
","I have seen all the Star Trek movies and I was very very disappointed about the fact this Star Trek movie went into the Darkness for me. Where was the Light at the end of the tunnel to get out the Darkness? It felt like going into a really great opening scene on a foreign planet and ending the movie with one of the worst cliffhangers ever. I would not recommend Star Trek to anybody. Why would you go to a movie in which you will find the worst ... no really the very worst Star Trek storyline ever! And by the way: I have paid extra for the 3D but where was the 3D effect in this movie? 3D should give you the feeling about some extra futuristic effects on a futuristic movie but there was nothing 3D! Really nothing, no starship flying on to you, etc. This movie was really boring.As I am a really Trekkie I would give it a solid 1: nice try but please, don't do this ever again. This movie is really horrible.",1,25,43,9 June 2013
Sinister," Sinister is very scary! I can't sleep now!
","Turn of your lights. Turn up your volume. Close all your curtains. And enjoy that you can't sleep that night. Sinister is a great movie. Take a blanket and when it is scary put it over your eyes :-) I don't want to tell anything about this horror movie because anything you tell will spoil the fun, you should not know anything about the story in advance I think to keep the excitement 100%. I have read some reviews and I have to say it contains too much information however they don't contain spoilers I would suggest not to read them :-) The acting was great and I really loved the horror scenes, they were amazing. Have a great horror night!",10,7,8,31 March 2013
Prometheus," Wow, can't stop thinking about this movie
","Just saw the movie Prometheus and I have to say: I am blown away! Ridley Scot is a very talented man to come up with a total new story. Well here and there you will find some familiarities with the alien concept, like the way how the alien forms impregnates their victims, but overall it's a new concept.The actors were very well casted. I would have personally casted Charlize Theron as the main character rather than Noomi Rapace. Noomi doesn't come across as strong as Charlize. The robot reminded me off Data from Star Strek, but he showed more human characteristics, like deception, regret, etc. I loved the special effects in this movie. There's a lot of blowing up going on, so you won't be bored for one bit. On the other hand the music is perfect. It's very unique and shilling at the some time. The 3D is also great. The movie makes you think about our origins. Questions like Where are we form, who made us, will haunt through your head. The movie tries to explain this, but you will be surprised with the answer. And for all of you Alien fans out there, well you are in for a treat. Enjoy the movie!",9,4,9,7 June 2012
