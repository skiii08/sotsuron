Casablanca," The best ever
","Not much can be said about one of the most glorious accidental triumphs in movie history. The right stars, the right supporting cast, the right director and particularly the right script came together magically for the best movie in Hollywood history.I often say that this movie is like Stairway to Heaven - it has been ripped off so many times, that to watch it now for the first time can make it seem full of cliches - as long as you were aware that it was this creation that started all the cliches.Briefly, the plot concerns the coming together of half-a-dozen main players in Casablanca during the middle of the second World War. Humphrey Bogart is the archetypical softie with the hard, cynical shell, Paul Heinreid is a wonderfully noble leader of men, Ingrid Bergman truly makes you believe that a man could obsess about her for years.  Claude Rains is wonderfully devillish as the corrupt prefect of police, Sidney Greenstreet positively Machiavellian as a business rival and Peter Lorre incredible as a cheap hood.Watch this movie, and for the love of all that's holy, make sure it is in the original black and white!",10,2,2,10 October 2002
Armageddon," Laughable
","This movie is pretty bad, particularly for the amount of money that was positively thrown at the screen.  The plot about space shuttles being sent to space to blow up and asteroid is ridiculous (the idea being that it is easier to teach oil drillers to be astronauts than it is to teach astronauts to drill a hole), and the romantic sub-plot including Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler frankly nauseating.At a pinch, the performances of Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi aren't bad, and a sub-plot involving a divorced father and his estranged child has a smidgen of emotional resonance, but overall, its your classic Jerry Bruckheimer pic, and you should know what you're getting when you play your video rental fee.",3,0,2,10 October 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Brilliant
","My friend and I have agreed that any man between the ages of 20-40 will have one or more of the following as being in their top 3 movies of all time : Star Wars, Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption.A fantastic source novella, skilful direction, career performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman....the list goes on.The plot can't be summarised easily - suffice to say that there are no car chases, no gunfights, and no actors from Dawson's Creek.
This movie is one of only three I can recall where I specifically noticed EVERY person leaving the cinema with a HUGE smile on their face.",10,0,0,9 October 2002
