Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't waste your time on this...
","Only my second review... But this is not really a review, more like a comment... I don't know what these Westeners think about the rest of the world... Humiliating and disrepecting and making fun of the beliefs and cultures other than Christian in nature just bcoz they don't understand it or maybe thinking them inferior and not human?? Shame on these guys... In this film, they talk a lot of about prostitutes, but none of them male... But there's an shameful male prostitute in Sacha Baron Cohen, in my own opinion, from start to the end of this film... Disgusting is what i would say about this movie... Why go waste ur money and time and effort to make such Sh**ty movies, eh?",1,1,5,17 December 2011
Oldboy," Distubring
","Disturbing... U watch this and your perspective of life will change forever... Life won't be the same again...In a sense, it's a masterpiece, but the moral dilemma, it'll continue to be debated for years to come...Keep all of this in mind if u gonna watch this movie... This certainly is not a movie for the weak n gentle hearted... I don't wanna rate this movie...But one gotta admit that if u consider this genre of movies, this has gotta be one of the best ever...Again, this will f**k your moral self for sure...",6,0,3,6 March 2014
Up," Warning!! This movie could make you cry as much as u'd laugh...
","I'm not gonna go much into how great the animation was and how catchy the storytelling was and stuff... I just have one little thing to say... And btw, this is the first time I'm commenting on some movie in IMDb though i've been following it for quite a while...U know, wen i first saw the trailer of this movie, i saw this bein an old man's dream and stuff and kinda knew there would be something sad behind bein old and lonely... The character of Ellie was certainly a bright spot in the story... Lively, mischievous, energetic and wow, i liked her very much... And the voice was a perfect match too...Kk, i don't wanna deviate away from my point... From the point when Ellie leaves Carl's bedroom as a kid and they growin up, fallin in love, marriage and they way they rebuild (well, rearrange the interiors i could say) their house as per their childhood dreams of movin to Paradise Falls and they getting old together and finally when she dies due to aging and the guy sitting alone in grief... Man, i was really moved... There wasn't even a single dialog involved with the whole bit... To me, it's poetry... Tears just rolled out spontaneously from my eyes... Now, i know animation movies are made for fun and humor mostly, but this bit was exceptional... Thank you!",10,0,1,8 November 2009
