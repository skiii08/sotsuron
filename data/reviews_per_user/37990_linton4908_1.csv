Source Code," This a great start
","I loved this Movie it was a good start for a series I hope it makes it through all the reviews as a tool for it,s next feature But I personally liked that there was no real bad scenes with unnecessary sex scenes and foul language every other sentence. My wife and I are Christians and we do like the movies that don't flaunt this behavior. It is hard to find a writer or Director that can do this with taste but I think it has potential to be a great movie series from this point. If this review actually gets read I would add by saying that if it does get a break to make more Please bring your Business to the Portland Oregon area for filming I do work here on other movies at this time and we can use more of these kind of films..thank you for your time everyone.",Null,0,1,31 July 2011
