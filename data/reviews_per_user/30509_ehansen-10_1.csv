Walk the Line," awesome movie
","Quickly became one of my favorites. Even if you do not like country music, the story itself between June and Johnny is enough to tug at any heart string. In this movie Joaquin and Reese do a wonderful job portraying this story of star crossed lovers.The music is wonderful, considering they sang the songs themselves. You would be amazed at the absolutely beautiful voice Reese has.This movie was condoned by the Cash family, and you can see why. It shows the good times and the bad, the happy and the sad, and leaves you knowing the pain on his face when he wasn't with the one he loved was real...Don't want to ruin it, but they did a great job portraying the story of not only two legendary country musicians, but two lovers who came together to be a wonderful couple after standing by each other through so much...If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do. You will not regret it, Cash fan or not.",10,1,2,20 October 2006
