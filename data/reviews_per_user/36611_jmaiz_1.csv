The Devil's Advocate," Great acting by Al Pacino but not much more
","As another review said, Al Pacino was born for this rÃ´le. His portrayal of the devil is probably the most realistic I have seen in a film, to the point of being quite unsettling. However, the movie itself is not as good as Pacino's performance. The plot has several flaws and contradictions and Keanu Reeves' acting is poor. 6/10.",7,0,1,26 August 2002
