The King's Speech," Firth V Rush
","This film is basically a two actor piece with Firth playing the prince who is horror struck at the sense of duty to millions and history in the making which is bearing down upon him, and Rush as the kind yet damaged first world war veteran and failed actor whose initial concern in speech therapy was to help those fellow veterans whose speech had been affected by the stress of war. Both are defined by their voices with Rush being overlooked for acting roles because of his Australian accent ('only RP here old boy') and Firth forced to engage in public speaking out of duty to office despite everyone knowing and dreading his terrible stammer. The scenes with both of them bouncing off each other are riveting. The other characters and scenes seem only there to facilitate this face off between the two. How Colin Firth can be considered the lead actor and Geoffrey Rush a supporting actor is surely a profound injustice to the latter: it must be a close run thing as to which is on the screen most.",8,0,0,2 March 2011
Black Swan," Aaronovsky histrionic campfest
","Gasp as she breaks a nail! Thrill as she stubs her toe! Rush to the bathroom as she gets a scratch on her back! Portman's character is unbearable. Can it really be possible that someone this insular ever went to an audition, let alone performed in front of an audience in any capacity? I cannot think so. There are many nice moments in this film, like the scenes with Winowna Ryder in them, and I have no complaints about the acting, yet why make a psychological thriller about a character with no psychology to speak of? I found it impossible to care about this insufferable twit of a woman. It seems to me that Aaronovsy's histrionic characters, like the dancer/ wrestler/ drug addict/ maths genius who goes out in a blaze of glory, are merely there to compensate for an inability to tell a story well enough to keep us interested.",5,6,10,2 March 2011
Departures," Death And Intimacy
","Death is only a vague looming fear for most of us but for Daibo Kobayashi it becomes an everyday fact of life after he replies to a newspaper advertisement for staff in 'Departures'. His education is often hilarious if sometimes grotesque as he learns from his boss how to prepare a corpse for cremation, a job in days gone by done by the family of the bereaved, but these days performed by contracted professionals in the family home and in front of them and their guests with great ceremony and dignity. The job is not highly regarded, however, and he is seen as rather ghoulish by others (including his own wife!) but this only reflects their anxiety of saying a final farewell, movingly brought home when he is repeatedly given heartfelt thanks on leaving after having completed the job, and the relief of his clients becomes apparent. In a full 2 hours that never becomes dull his personal life, his artistic life and his professional life are kept in a dynamic and entertaining tension before the preparation of the corpse of his estranged father becomes a synthesis of all three in the last act of intimacy possible between father and son.",9,0,0,1 April 2011
