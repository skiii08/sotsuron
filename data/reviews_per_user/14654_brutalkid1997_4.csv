The Adventures of Tintin," Absolution amazing --- *Contains spoilers!
","Now this is one hell of a movie, Amazing animations and graphics, well directed and perfect yet a tiny bit slow, i'll get to that later on.Now this movie is ambitious and miles smarter than your average 3-D family film, why, because of the plot the plot was very well done, and the voice acting was superb.This is the plot so yeah Tintin (Jamie Bell), a young journalist, and his dog Snowy are browsing in an outdoor market in a European town. Tintin buys a model of a three-masted sailing ship, the Unicorn, but is then immediately accosted by the sinister Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig), and the mysterious figure of Barnaby (Joe Starr), who both try to buy the model from Tintin, without success. Tintin takes the ship home, but it is broken during a fight between Snowy and a neighbor's cat. As it breaks, a parchment scroll slips out of the ship's mast. Snowy spots it but is unable to alert Tintin. Now the cat got in from the window and the animation for tintin were a little off as he fell on the couch or chair, either way both leather. So apart from this little mistake, it was greatly done Next!Tintin visits Sakharine in Marlinspike Hall, where he learns that there are two model ships. Tintin puts the scroll in his wallet, only to have his wallet stolen by Silk. (A wallet thief) Later, Tintin is shot at, then abducted by accomplices of Sakharine, and imprisoned on the SS Karaboudjan. On board, Tintin escapes and meets the ship's nominal captain, Haddock (Andy Serkis). Haddock has been supplied with whiskey by first mate Allan (Daniel Mays), who is working for Sakharine, and thus is permanently drunk, and unaware of the happenings on board his ship. Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy eventually escape from the Karaboudjan in a lifeboat. Sakharine sends a seaplane to find them, which the trio seize and use to fly towards the (fictitious) Moroccan port of Bagghar, but they crash in the desert.Now in this part things get weird on the plane but they were all accurate, for comedy anyway. This movie only gets better as you'd think, its a kids movie, no guns no blood, nope a guy gets shot up then writes a message to tintin with his blood on a newspaper.Dehydrated in the heat, and suffering from a sudden lack of alcohol, Haddock hallucinates, and starts to remember stories about his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Andy Serkis), who was captain of the Unicorn during the 17th century. Sir Francis' treasure-laden ship was attacked by a pirate ship, led by the masked Red Rackham (Daniel Craig), and, after a fierce battle and eventual surrender, Sir Francis chose to sink the Unicorn, and most of the treasure, rather than allow it to fall into Rackham's hands. It transpires that there were three models of the Unicorn, each containing a scroll. Together, the scrolls will reveal the location of the sunken Unicorn, and its treasure.Yea he loses it but for a good cause, and the action sequence on the ship was awesome. Realistic and amazingly done. Next!The third model ship is in Bagghar, in the possession of the wealthy Omar Ben Salaad (Gad Elmaleh), but it is encased in a bullet-proof glass display case. Sakharine's plan is to stage a concert involving famous diva Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel), the 'Milanese nightingale', whose penetrating singing voice will be able to shatter the glass case, allowing Sakharine's trained hawk to fly down and steal the third scrollShe really was very high pitched, unforgivably i know nothing of opera as i can not stand it, so she so high pitched she shattered all the glass, including bulletproof glass. Other then that haddock wanted another beer, great message for the kids, and then screws up, great message for kids, they then have an amazing fight sequence.After a chase down to the harbor, pursued by Tintin and Haddock, Sakharine finally escapes with all three scrolls. Tintin chases him back to Europe and arranges a police reception for him on the dockside. Haddock and Sakharine, who is revealed to be the descendant of Red Rackham, replay their ancestors' swashbuckling sword fight, using dockside cranes, swords, and even bottles of whiskey. Haddock is eventually victorious and Sakharine is promptly arrested by Thomson and ThompsonThis fight scene was long, well animated and well performed.With the three scrolls in their possession, Tintin and Haddock find that the indicated location is Marlinspike Hall, and that the hall had been built originally by Sir Francis Haddock. There, in the cellar, they find some of the treasure, and a clue to the location of the sunken Unicorn. Both men agree to continue the adventure.So the plot is great, the animations are amazing and this was overall 10/10- it was slow in places yet it fitted well. Recommended.",10,1,3,1 January 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Yes a good comedy
","This movie was so funny my rib cage was fighting for survival. this is by far one of the greatest movies of all time. i love the jokes in this. in this one part the guys got a cam plugged to the TV's in the shop and just before he puts it at his penis his friend runs in and stops him so so funny.This is by far amazing, i love this movie so, so much.it's so good you have to see it to believe it. don't be put off watch it 9/10this movie has a few mistakes one fairly obvious too any gamer. one actor uses a remote for a gaming system that street fight or mortal combat was not released on.",9,0,1,22 August 2012
Despicable Me," Over Rated
","Anit no one got time for that rubbish. I hate this movie is so simple a 4 year old gave the blue prints for this movie. This was less entertaining then 'Hop'. the plot, the 3D and the overall cinematic's were such Poor quality.the part on the roller coaster unfunny. the little yellow creepy things were also unfunny. i laughed very little. from the start to end. I can't see how this movie made so much money.Out of all the movies I've seen this has got to be in the bottom 5. Overall this movie is poorly made, poorly acted and just a massive mess. this movie Kills comedy.",1,2,14,29 May 2012
