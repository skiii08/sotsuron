The Equalizer," Fuqua's Best Work in Some Time
","I have an on-again/off-again relationship with Fuqua films. I've grown increasingly disenchanted with his post-'Training Day' films, and I've been waiting for one to rekindle my interest. Despite really liking the TV spots/trailers for 'The Equalizer,' I still had my reservations about seeing 'The Equalizer.' But I'm glad that I did, because it's the Fuqua film I've been waiting for.SYNOPSIS - Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, an ex- government/CIA agent (it's never explicitly specified what he did; only implied). Now living an ostensibly honest life in Boston, Massachusetts, he's been able to successfully distance himself from his past life all the while helping and assisting those who he is friends with. After getting to know a young aspiring singer—Alina (played by Moretz)—who hangs out at a diner that McCall frequents, he realizes that she's involved with some shady people. McCall decides to help her next, but doing so not only makes him confront his past... it begins to unravel a thread that he may come to regret ever tugging in the first place.REVIEW - Directing & Cinematography, 10/10: Surprisingly deft behind the camera, Fuqua shifts his directing style in 'The Equalizer,' clearly taking inspiration from '300' and 'Watchmen' director Zack Snyder at times. The film itself looks fantastic, each shot is crisp and sharp; Mauro Fiore worked with Fuqua on 'Training Day' and 'Tears of the Sun,' but also with Peter Berg on his film 'The Kingdom.' I may have had gripes with some of Fuqua's past few films, but I've always admired his cinematography, and this notion still holds with 'The Equalizer.' Fiore does a great job, as familiar Boston settings almost act as complimentary characters in each scene.Writing, 9/10: I had watched this film a week after seeing Liam Neeson's kinda-sort-similar 'A Walk Among the Tombstones' which was a massive disappointment to me solely because the of the writing. I'm glad to say that 'The Equalizer' doesn't suffer from this problem. Richard Wenk does a commendable job of introducing us to McCall and revealing his quirks to the audience. Every character in the film is flawed—even McCall—yet Fuqua and Wenk are able to translate them to the screen with both delicacy and intrigue. I have only two gripes with the writing. First, as some other reviews have astutely noted, Moretz's character is unfortunately relegated to a massive supporting role. I found this to be an utter shame, as she portrayed Alina with such a tenderness and vulnerability—I was really disappointed that she had probably less than 10 minutes of screen time. My other writing- related issue stems from what I've dubbed 'End of Watch' syndrome. For anyone who has seen David Ayer's film 'End of Watch,' you'll know that, while a good movie, it's highly far-fetched simply because so much happens to the two protagonists in so little time. This happens a little bit in 'The Equalizer,' as McCall—who had apparently lived a 'normal' life since his retirement from the CIA up until the beginning of this film— suddenly has a string of nearly-unbelievable action-packed encounters in about a 48-hour span, none of which are actually related to each other! But I can suspend my disbelief; this is a film, after all, and that is the agreement we make as an audience. It was just a little TOO unbelievable, but hardly a deal-breaker. Although if extra- terrestrials some how wound up in the film, then that would be a different story!Musical Score, 10/10: I'm a bit of an audiophile, and I contend that a fantastic soundtrack is one of the biggest assets any film can boast. Literally from the opening scene of 'The Equalizer,' I knew that the film was in great hands musically. It wasn't until the credits that I realized why: they were able to nab the great Harry Gregson-Williams (the first two 'Narnia' films and 'Kingdom of Heaven,' among many many others). Oddly enough, he's also scored a number of Denzel films: 'Man on Fire,' 'Deja Vu,' 'Pelham 123,' 'Unstoppable.' For some films, the music is just 'there'; it's really nothing more than filler. But 'The Equalizer' benefits greatly from Gregson-Williams' subtle touches: uplifting at times and dramatic when needed, the score for this film is one of the better ones I can remember for big Hollywood films this year, probably right behind Tyler Bates' work on 'Guardians of the Galaxy.'FINAL THOUGHTS - Denzel is great as always, but I also want to give proper credit to Marton Csokas who plays the main antagonist. His chemistry with Denzel Washington is just a pleasure to witness. It's a shame he's always some twisted villain in the majority of his roles! In the end, 'The Equalizer' has something for everyone: attention- grabbing music, great characters, an aesthetically awesome look, fantastic acting, interesting story, and pulse-pounding action. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone, especially anyone who lives in the Boston area (it can be great fun to see landmarks and areas on film that you see every day). And another plus is that it's only in 2D so that you don't have to get suckered into the inflated 3D prices these days! To be honest, you don't really need to read a review about the film to know what it's about. It's Denzel being a badass. We've all seen this before, haven't we? Especially given that Denzel's done 'Man on Fire!' But if you STILL have doubts, let me put it this way: I can think of a thousand things that would be a much bigger waste of $10, even if you end up not liking the film.",10,4,13,28 September 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," 'Walter Mitty': A Triumph in Every Possible Way
","I've had my IMDb account for over 8 years, but I've never written a review before; that is, I've never felt compelled to, until now.I gave the film a 10, but here's a little caveat about my grading: I don't 'kinda' like films. I either do, or don't—so it's a 1, or a 10. A flawed system, perhaps, but there are a lot of redeeming qualities that I can find in a film: directing, cinematography, acting, writing, story, music... in fact, it's difficult for me not to like a film in some respect. Clearly, I like 'Walter Mitty' but don't let my pass/fail grading criteria fool you. This film is clever, touching, and—most surprisingly—authentic, and it accomplishes this in a multitude of ways.I'm not going to summarize the plot of the story; surely, you know it by now and are simply wondering whether it's worth a viewing or not. The short answer is: yes. But if you want to know /why/, continue reading. I will, instead, examine the movie based on what I perceive to be its artistic merits.First, the cinematography is splendid. The film possesses a very clean, sharp look. The colors are quite vibrant, and nearly leap off the screen (helped immensely by the truly awe-inspiring locations the film takes place in, from the busy streets of NYC to the solitary landscapes of Greenland and Iceland). 'Walter Mitty' is pleasing to the eye, which is always a plus.Ben Stiller's directing is smart and inspired, and surprisingly high- octane when needed (the first daydream sequence comes to mind, as Stiller's vision caught me quite off guard, in a very good way). Visually speaking, I knew the film was in good hands from the opening scene—it's a simple sequence of Walter sitting in his apartment pining away on his laptop, and yet Stiller's framing is careful and deliberate, conveying Walter's sense of isolation and loneliness. Indeed, Stiller's directing throughout the film is always thoughtful, and never lazy. There are some directors who maintain the same style of filming throughout their careers, but there is a very clear and traceable evolution throughout Stiller's filmography, and 'Walter Mitty' is his best yet.The screenplay overachieves to a great degree. Ostensibly a film about an awkward, stagnating introvert (in conjunction with what was revealed in trailers and television spots), the audience will surprisingly find themselves on an international adventure. My biggest fear—as a writer myself—was Walter's goal: of course, he wants the girl but what will separate this film from others of the same genre? Or is it just another clone? Fortunately, there are indeed two conflicts (including wooing Cheryl, played by Kristen Wiig) that propel the story on its improbable course. And the two main characters themselves are thoroughly fleshed- out as the story goes along. We accompany them on this grand journey and truly witness a transformation occur in both of them, and you can't help but feel happy. In the end, the story is crafted with the utmost cleverness and care (the dialogue is especially rich if one pays attention), and with just enough over-the-top sequences, it manages to find glimmers of humor, action, and humanity in every little nook possible.I often feel bad for composers for comedy/romantic comedy films because they never really get to show off their chops or introduce complex melodies when all they're scoring is dialogue- and humor-based scenes; there's just not that much opportunity to really shine. With that being said, however, composer Theodore Shapiro does a commendable job. The music that accompanies 'Walter Mitty' is often whimsical, with a slight air of hope, and touching when it needs to be. There were indeed two or three scenes where the music was rather noticeable and really bolstered the emotional punch, and that was a very pleasant and welcomed surprise.Just a few words before I end: I'm not a very big fan of comedy films. In fact, the last comedy film that I voluntarily watched was probably 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin.' With that being said, however, I don't consider 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' to be a comedy. Rather, it comes across as a drama/adventure film with humorous moments sprinkled throughout. To be quite frank: I didn't actually laugh at all during this film—but I enjoyed it immensely, and can say with all honesty that it is on my shortlist of favorite films for 2013.Strangely enough, I've always been a fan of Ben Stiller's work. I just find his characters and acting to be relatable and authentic. I have a few friends that scoff at his films and the fact that I like them, perhaps the way some scoff at Adam Sandler for seemingly losing his touch after 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Billy Madison.' But there's just something about Stiller's movies that are borderline outlandish (if not outright), and yet, I find them to be extremely honest to the human condition—and his latest directorial work is no exception. All in all, 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is an excellent character study and a touching coming-of-middle-age story. It bubbles with vitality in every scene and conveys a fun carpe diem message. In fact, I enjoyed this film so much that I re-watched it immediately after my first viewing. Simply put, you will not regret watching 'Walter Mitty.' Instead, you will find yourself filled with a poignant sense of hope and—for lack of a better word—happy.",10,0,0,8 April 2014
