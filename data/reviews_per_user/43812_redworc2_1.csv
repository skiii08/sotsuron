The Blair Witch Project," Horrible - the worst hour & 20 minutes ever
","Could you hold the camera still please?!  All that moving around will give you a headache.  This movie was such a waste of time and money.  It's a wonder it ever made it to the cinema in the first place.  Don't go see this. It's not scary, creative, or entertaining.  The home video of my grandfather's birthday is 100 times better.",1,1,2,6 August 1999
