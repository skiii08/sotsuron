Iron Man 3," I am really disappointed with this movie.
","Iron Man 3 was a total disaster for me. I am a big fan of Iron Man but the movie has nothing to do with the comics. Stop using so must these computers - visual effects and create a movie base purely in a comic story.It was also unacceptable Mandarin character to be distorted like that. Mandarin is a powerful genius villain, one of the most dangerous Ironman foe and his primary sources of power are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and is worn on a specific finger (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_%28comics%29). In the movie Mandarin appears as a stupid actor, a puppet. Come on, give us a break. How Stan Lee gave his approve? I really don't know.The film director ruined it completely; it was almost garbage.... I was laughing while I was watching the movie and I couldn't believe that this was Iron Man...I am really disappointed with this movie.",5,2,5,20 August 2013
