50 First Dates," the best movie ever
","Drew Barrymore alone makes it a great movie, but with adam sandler the movie exceeds great. adam sandler is a good actor. Drew is the best actress. this movie is the best movie of all time. screw the matrix and the lord of the rings. this movie beats them all.
