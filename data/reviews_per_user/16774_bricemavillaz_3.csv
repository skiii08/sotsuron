Hereditary," A great quality watch but a bit overrated
","After hearing much ravings about this one, I gave it a go. Unfortunately and as always, it doesn't live up to its hype (so never believe it). Awesome actors (Byrne and Collett were oustanding as always), though Alex Wollf delivers a very flat and dull performance. It fits his character but it does a disservice to the actor. Hereditary's main stand out point is it doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares to work, it knows how to build tension and mood in a mature and smart way, using slow shots and a truly remarkable soundtrack. However, the movie could have been 10 to 20mns shorter, I think it would have helped the rhythm, which feels kinda slow and dragging in some points. I also thought the ending was kind of underwhelming, you see it coming from three miles away (though the movie delivers what's expected, it doesn't 'pretend' it's going to surprise you with a twist ending). Clues are peppered throughout the movie starting at the very beginning, but in my opinion they're way too obvious and literal...kinda feels like the director thinks you're a very thick person that doesn't get subtle clues. The other thing I disliked about the ending is that it's too explicit...I wish the director would have gone for a less 'in your face' approach for the finale, and maintained a kind of 'did this really happen?' vibe. As it is, I feel the ending (the 5 final minutes) is redundant and hammers in what has been established throughout the movie. Great film, solid horror movie, definitely worth a watch, but in my opinion the director lacks maturity and has a tendency to hammer in what should have been better left implied and suggested. It would have been a really great film if the director, talented as he his, wouldn't have treated the audience like 12 year olds that need explicit scenes to understand the underlying message. Really good horror movie, but not nearly as awesome as everyone says it is. This speaks volumes how low the public's standards have fallen, thanks to useless and exploitative garbage like paranormal activity, people now seeing a decent horror movie call it a masterpiece. It's good, but nowhere near the gem it's heralded as. And the director, although lacking in maturity, is definitely someone to watch out for. A good 6.5/10.",6,3,5,13 June 2019
It Follows," Slow, boring, with a stupid premise
","I guess you have to be american and under 16 to feel invested in this movie.
Being european, i don't have the point of view americans have on underage sex.
Unmarried sex before marriage being a big no-no is not a thing that really exists in europe.
However I can get the metaphore for STD's. My point is, europeans don't really have this 'taboo' thing going on with sex...for us there's just no big deal around sex.
That pretty much invalidates the stakes in this film. Furthermore when you think about it the premises can't really work, and the film takes a lot of liberties with its own rules (eg sometimes the 'thing' can interract with objects, sometimes it can't...most of the time appart form its target no one can see signs of its presence...but sometimes they can)
The characters lack personnality, are flat and really unappealing. Cardboard cutout american teens we've all seen a million times before with no real characteristics or character traits that sets them appart or makes them sympathetic.
The threat is...well, not very threatning throughout the movie. Any threat that can be countered by just running is pretty much a non-threat.
The movie's supposed to be tense throughout but again, if the threat isn't really threatning...the tension is just not there (furthermore, if you don't really care what happens to the protagonists because you can't identify with them...that ruins the tension even more). A retiree wearing a flower dress, wether their eyesockets are dark or not, slowly walking towards you, is not something you run away from.
Obviously I didn't really 'get' this movie, to me the message 'no underage sex kids, it's bad' just doesn't work when you've been done with puberty for a while. If you already had sexual intercourse with more than one member of the opposite sex : this film just doesn't speak to you.
So yeah I'll go ahead and say it : unless you're a teenage WASP american who never had sex before, this movie has nothing going for it.
Much too specific of a target audience to be appealing to a global audience.
This is just an over-rated teen slasher flick. You have to actually be a teenager to find it appealing...if you're over twenty it just feels really immature and prudish, but most of all really, really boring. The pace is FAR too slow and the threat just doesn't exist. So you're just left watching moronic and unapealing teen clich√©s running around for the whole movie, which isn't really interresting to watch.
Yet another mediocre run of the mill movie over rated just because it's premise dares to somewhat step out of the ordinary redundance we're used to seeing in horror movies. And once again, if the premise only works for a small portion of the population...well you're just left with your average 'teen has sex and gets chased throughout the movie by a paranormal thing that wants to punish them for it'. Eg : your typical boring and unoriginal b movie teen slasher trope.",2,22,70,5 June 2015
Annihilation," Pretty good !
","When I heard that this movie was deemed 'too smart for audiences', I said to myself that oughta be good. Turns out it IS pretty good...but not that smart.
This isn't 2001 folks, and isn't mind-melting to understand, it's pretty straightforward.
This movie's more abstract and contemplative than smart. I guess this is why they thought the audience wouldn't get it.
It feels a LOT like Tarkovski's STALKER, you can't help but think the movie had a major influence on Annihilation. But apparently not. I'm suspicious. There's one shot in particular that really rings a bell (shot of an electric pole in the wilderness). Whatever, if you liked Stalker you'll clearly like this one.
The visuals are superbly done, and a weird, oniric, dreamlike feel permeates throughout the movie. The music and sound also also particularly good and perfectly match what you see on screen, and make the whole thing a trippy experience.
This movie is kindofa mood piece first and foremost, the pace is pretty slow (not lethargic-10mn-long shots-slow), but it is hard to classify : it's got horror parts, a lot of sci-fi, but the whole thing is wrapped in soft and poetic visuals. The 'zone' (shimmer') the film takes place in is really beautifully rendered, calm, full of vibrant colors and seldom feels threatening.
That's one of the best aspect of this movie : never is it made clear if the 'thing' is hostile or not, or if 'it' even knows about good or evil.
The story is solid (although the narration is not straightforward and skips in time, which contributes to the 'dream' feeling) and so is the acting. Isaac plays it REALLY low this time and it's always great to see him on screen, I usually find nataly portman emotionless and cold but I finally enjoyed her a little more in this one. Nice seeing Jennifer Jason Leigh again (i felt really old tho!) and the three other leads are decent and convincing.
I'm not too sure about the 'team mate snaps' subplot, they had to find a way to get rid of the characters I guess, but it still feels a little gratuitous and unnecessary. Apart from that, there's not much to complain about.
All the science seems to add up (no tech jumbo here tho, or the bare minimum to understand what's happening), and there where no improbable nonsense situations that pull you out of the film for being too unrealistic and leave you cursing at the director in your seat for thinking you're an idiot. None of that here, and that really felt good. More films like these please !
Really good movie I can't recommend enough for people who don't mind slow paced plot development, and very atmospheric, visual and 'moody' movies.
There's not much of it but it's pretty brutal on the gore so be warned about that. And weirdly that doesn't snap you out of the cozy feeling you feel throughout the film. This film was clearly shot with a dream state in mind and not as a nightmare. That's one of its weird charms. And the whole 'dream vibe' really serves the metaphysical and 'mystic' aspects of the script, overall it kinda feels like a weird spiritual experience. And I have to say, that's one of the best alien being rendition I've seen on screen so far : clearly living but yet completely abstract and indescribable. That's the closest thing I imagine aliens could look like : absolutely not like us and way beyond what we can understand.
Again i get the movie's not really for everyone, but if you like subtlety, maturity, great visuals and a engaging atmosphere for a change, treat yourself with this one. Really good! Alex Garland is clearly a guy to watch out for.",8,1,2,26 April 2020
