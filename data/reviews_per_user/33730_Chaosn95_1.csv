Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Best Of The Prequel Series
","Star Wars The Phantom Menace came out in 1999, and I was only 9. I did not know of what it had been like when the original Star Wars films came out and what it was like to see them on the big screen. But when I was 12 I went back and watched all of the Star Wars movies. Of course I had seen all of the originals before(if you're 12 and you haven't, then your living under a serious rock)and had seen the phantom menace in theaters when it came out. And I must say, The Phantom Menace is probably the strongest of the Prequel Trilogy. I am writing this review after Episode 2 and 3 came out and to me, they were crap. The entire love interludes between Anikan and Padme were just stupid. It was not like Star Wars. Of course there had been love in Star Wars before, it had never been that much. And it was ALWAYS well done and important to the storyline. This was not. Anyway, The Phantom Menace was Star Wars dumbed down a bit. It was made for the new generation, so of course the humor was different, and some of the elements, but it was still Star Wars. There was a huge epic battle at the end including one of the best lightsaber battles in the series. Overall, it was a fun, exciting movie that all ages could enjoy, and was Definitely BETTER THEN EPISODES 2 AND 3!",6,1,2,22 June 2008
