Scarface," a chilling study of the way power corrupts
","Scarface is a landmark in all Hollywood gangster movies simply because it uses the ethnic minority of the rise and fall of an American gangster. The films plot is totally origonal, it is about 125,000 cubans who are allowed to cross the border into the US to join any relatives that they may have. The president of Cuba Fiedel Castro however decides to take advantage of this opportunity by clearing the dregs of his jails. Of the 125,000 Cubans that arrive in the US an estimated 25,000 had criminal records. Antonio Montana is the one Cuba out of the lot who is hungry enough for the American dream, which is to have the world at your feet. Montana goes beyond the limit and becomes too greedy until he loses it all including his life.This movie was an inspiration not only for other film makers but for people in the music industry such as P.Diddy,Method Man and many more. There where lots of points that I loved about the film, points like the performances from the cast in particular Al Pacino. This was one of the best performances in his illustrious career and how he did not win an Oscar for it I do not know. Other notable performances where from Steven Baeur who plays Pacinos right hand man and his best friend, Michelle Pfiffer who plays Elvira Tonys wife who is subjected to a life of coke snorting and boredom. Another interesting point to why I like this movie is the great ending. The ending is totally unexpected and it shocks the audience. It shows the physical ability and the determination of this larger than life character.Finally I think that this film has just one weak point which is the use of language but otherwise in my opinion I think it is up there with likes of the Godfather and Goodfellas!",Null,0,1,26 November 2004
