Sucker Punch," visually stunning and vapid
","I found this film completely unwatchable. The lack of centralized plot, the fetishization of young women through costuming and clich√©s, and the hollowness of the visuals, though dazzling, all left me cold and insulted as a female viewer. It's not enough to acknowledge that these tropes in movies (and video games) exist and make a movie that supposedly satirizes these tropes. 'Ironic' sexism is still sexism. Humor does not excuse reprehensibly shallow representations of women in the media, and giving women guns and placing them in a traditionally macho male fighting role does not make them 'strong female characters'.I am highly disappointed that Snyder is directing Wonder Woman, as he will certainly bring his peculiar skill of living in complete and utter denial of his blatant sexism to the table in the latest DC installment.",1,7,15,6 December 2013
