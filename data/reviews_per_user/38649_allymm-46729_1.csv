Saturday Night Fever," If you are a movie lover, worth watching
","The movie Saturday Night Fever is one that I think every movie lover has to watch. If you are not much of a movie person it is probably not for you. I personally really liked the film. However, I did find some of the commentary slightly offensive. Specifically comments made about African Americans and gay people. There is also a rape scene towards the end. The lack of P.C.ness in this movie strongly reflects the time from which the movie came (1977). Regardless of some of the offensive terminology it is an enjoyable movie! Highly recommend.",8,1,3,23 May 2017
