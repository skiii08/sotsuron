Mission: Impossible III," Could have been so much better so easily
","I loved the old Mission Impossible TV series, and was so disappointed in the first two movies that I probably would not have seen this one if my partner hadn't wanted to go. Action movies are okay, but I prefer them to have plot and humor (True Lies, The Rock, etc).My biggest complaint about this movie is the first 5 minutes. Before the opening credits, we see Ethan handcuffed to a chair while the bad guy (played wonderfully by Philip Seymour Hoffman) threatens to kill a woman who clearly matters to Ethan. He gets to 10 and shoots her in the head. Okay, now we can jump back in time and tell the story.I found myself thinking repeatedly throughout the movie that I'd be a lot more engaged if I didn't know that we were working toward that scene. We know Ethan's not going to drop Davian out of the plane -- he has to survive for that later scene. There's no suspense when Ethan tries to get to Julia before she's kidnapped -- we *know* they're going to succeed in picking her up.If you're a fan of big action sequences, by all means go to see this film. But if you like your action to come with actual character development, intelligence, and a bit of real suspense, don't bother.",6,0,0,9 July 2006
