The Avengers," Surprisingly entertaining but overrated tripe
","Solid movie? Yes. By the numbers? Absolutely. Not daring, original, or unique story wise in any way. This is not a classic but glad 80% of people think it's the new Godfather apparently. Good for them but not for the future of film making which is now more about CGI wowing & explosions behind CGI superheroes.Acting is solid, characters are interesting enough, but they did not bring anything NEW to this franchise that we already know so well from previous films. Generic bad guys who all die at the same time like it's Star Wars Episode I? Are you kidding me? And a bunch of hardcore superheroes and...a woman with a pistol and a guy with a bow-&-arrow who wears a leotard? This is laughable but apparently our current audiences take this s h i t seriously. Whatever, seriously.",1,10,38,6 September 2013
The Monuments Men," If Disney Made A World War II Film
","This film is definitely not terrible but missed a big opportunity at making something memorable. And needless to say it unfortunately has a lot of problems that do it (and its intriguing story) a huge disservice. Before listing the problems I will note its positives: The acting, cast, direction and visuals are all good. OK...And now the problems:1) The quips and zingers every few minutes: Is this a sit-com or a drama about Nazis stealing art? It was hard enough to believe any of these characters are allowed to simply meander around Europe without strict supervision but even less believable that these men snap out witty one- liners back and forth after every few minutes. And the problem is that these one-liners are often during times of implied danger or tension, which gets broken immediately with the comedy relief.2) The musical score/tone is absolutely bizarre and out-of-place in many areas: When taking on a subject as serious as WW2, it's not a great idea to constantly have happy-go-lucky comedy relief music going on in the background. It really is tonally all over the place and is out of place when considering the message trying to be sent about the importance of human art/culture, etc. Half the time I was expecting either a Broadway musical dance-line to jump out and start kicking their legs in front of the screen or at least see the Rocketeer fly past a Nazi blimp.3) The one dimensional characters. We learn very little about the actual personalities of the main characters so there is little to invest in, especially between the characters and their relationships. It's hard to feel bad for characters who you don't know and are acting really stupid in very dangerous circumstances. I also felt there were many scenes missing from the film because we never see the main characters even bond or have much meaningful dialog within the first hour of the film, and are expected to cry for characters we do not know and expected to care about relationships we have not established.4) The villains (are even worse:) The bad guys (Nazis of course) might as well have been twirling around their mustaches and laughing maniacally. Are we to believe that even the 'bad guys' in a real historical situation did not have other emotions besides crazy and evil? And as if if the Nazis were not bad enough villains, the writers needed to include a sub-plot with the big bad Russians, who although helped us beat the Nazis, are apparently evil for wanting to take art for themselves, I guess.5) Missed opportunities: Many scenes have a lot of potential to lead up to something interesting, intense, or memorable. They never deliver in any way, however. Every single moment where there is action,drama, or a threat of danger/death, it is resolved with some type of comic relief or very random exposition designed to move to the next scene as quickly as possible. Very sad to say because every scene starts out with promise, then fails.6) The heroes/the Title: Not even sure about the accuracy of this film: But if true, the heroes are not even the Monuments Men, but the ONE German-speaking member (hired on a fluke) who figured out where the art was being hidden and the same guy also finds hidden Nazi gold. It should have been named after this one character, the other members are idiots. Any man who steps out of a vehicle in war-torn France to offer a cigarette to a horse, deserves to be shot.7) The WW2 tropes cliché festival: Yet again another movie showing the 'greatest hits' of WW2, relying on its audience to be a bunch of stupid simpletons who only respond to iconic images or names they know from grade school text books. 'OH, OMAHA BEACH! OH, BATTLE OF THE BULGE! OH, SCOWLING Hitler! OH PICASSO! THIS ALL MEANS SOMETHING!' .. No, it's time to stop going for the low hanging fruit and bring something unique.8) 'If it weren't for us you'd be speaking German' ... This is an actual line from the movie, directed at a French woman from an American soldier. The problem is that only a few scenes before we see a German Nazi soldier speaking English to that very French woman. So apparently she would have been speaking neither German or French, she'd be speaking English so that the English-speaking audience wouldn't have to read subtitles. Ridiculous jingoistic quips would work fine in a more clever WW2 film, but definitely not this one.9) Last but not least: George Clooney as Danny Ocean/Prince Charming/Hero Astronaut:I cannot take him seriously in a WW2 film when he does the whole 'I'm not just a pretty face' smooth talking nonsense. In an Ocean's 11 film, yes. He's a good actor, why did he choose to play it like this AGAIN? It's annoying and takes us out of the movie, especially when trying to believe him as a humble hero who cares about art and not just how cool he is.",3,149,189,9 February 2014
Gravity," 'Half of North America lost their Facebook'
","The great: Amazing visuals, visually stunning, amazing direction, the type of movie 3D was made for, well acted overall.The good: Short and sweet, does not overstay its welcome.The bad: Very bad dialogue (for this type of film), especially from George Clooney's character. And seriously, what Nasa astronaut would say to themselves: 'I hate space' or 'sunny with a chance of satellite debris'?? The badder: A lot of Hollywood cliché exposition aimed directly at the audience & terrible stereotypes subtlety interwoven (Chinese play ping pong and have Budha statues, Russians drink vodka...yeah yeah yeah)The worst: The over-hype of this film & an actual line of script mentioning the similarly over-hyped Facebook. It is a sin to use trendy flavor of the week pop culture lingo in films, especially in one this good.Come on now, do you really think people will remember facebook in 20 years while watching this film? I think when that line comes up in 20 years, the kids will kids say 'what the hell is facebook'???? Visuals = Timeless. Dialogue? Not so much. It's like mentioning social networking site 'Friendster' a decade ago...a NO NO.And the character development was a bit weak and wasted time with some meaningless quips that never paid off. This would have been just as good a movie as a silent film.Overall a solid flick but not anything I could imagine watching in its entirety a second time. 6/10",6,4,9,6 October 2013
Ted," So much potential, so much of the same. What a shock.
","Story and plot had a lot of potential, and although I am not a big Family Guy fan I have found Seth Mcfarlane to have some bright spots that are really funny in his writing. Not sure what his obsession is with oldtyme show-tunes but I digress.This film shows everything that is wrong with the Hollywood hype machine & the poison of writers/directors thinking something is funny just because of the premise or their brand of shtick that's become popular. This movie is not that funny, it's just the same old jokes that try too hard to push the envelope with material we have simply just seen WAY too much, especially from Mcfarlane & his barrage of cartoons, etc.Had some funny moments but instead of taking any chances with making a unique story it ends up doing the same Adam Sandler nonsense of copying every other trashy Rom-Com formula cliché in the book.The special effects were good, some of the jokes were clever, but if they wasted a great opportunity to make something different here. Not sure why this movie is as overrated as Avengers but I guess this is what we settle for these days. Only acting worth mentioning was the female lead...other than that it is the typical & expected cookie-cutter performances by non-funny male leads.Blah Hollywood, blah.",1,10,16,26 September 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Most overrated film since the Avengers
","Are you f u c k i n g kidding me? I guess this got positive reviews because compared to the other installments in the franchise, this one is like a masterpiece. But still absolutely ridiculously stupid & can barely be called a film.Not sure what we are supposed to take less seriously: Paul Walker's acting, Vin Deisel's monotone delivery, or that this is the 6th one of these pieces of garbage. Is this all Hollywood has to offer us these days? Reboots, remakes, and sequels? May as well continue the theme of making board games into major motion pictures because this is just absolutely horrendous. Fast and Furious is slowly becoming the Police Academy of our time. See you all again at Fast Fingered 14",1,6,12,8 September 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Encompasses everything wrong with Hollywood's arrogant attitude towards its audience
","Dear Hollywood: It's time for something new.Firstly, this film is entertaining enough and has a great director/cast/performances, blah blah blah -- However we should expect more after this many years of the same tripe from indeed talented people who have done better before. And seriously, how many times can we be entertained by basically the same thing over and over and over, just repackaged? People snorting cocaine. People having sex. Hookers. Bad behavior. Shocking male genitalia in an R-Rated movie when we usually only see bush and knockers. Give me a break. Hate to tell you, although the audience may be comprised of giddy man-children who laugh at dick jokes: Shock value does not equal brilliance. The film started out good and held my attention but the lack of depth written for any character besides Leonardo was awful. Everyone is a caricature of characters we have seen in countless other movies. And I learned less about Jordan Belfort from this three hour film than a three line bio on wikipedia. And: What was the point of this movie? I honestly still have no idea and the ending was especially disappointing and anti-climatic.Bravo for Di Caprio in the role but that is honestly about it. Why was John Favreu even in this film? Why was Mathew McNaughahay wasted for 5 minutes of screen time? It could have challenged the audience by not giving us the stereotypical black and white character development and extra predictable plotting.Scorcese has done a good job of making mob figures and murderers seem charismatic and cool, but this film teaches neither the character or the audience anything at all.I'm rich, so this resort style jail is not that bad. Time to get an inspirational speaking gig and make a Hollywood movie officially validating me as legit. Enough is enough, we need to ask for more out of these 'based on true story' indulgences. Between Belfort and Hollywood, I would say the latter has ripped off average people the most.",2,142,263,6 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Good for a Sci-Fi Channel StarTrek Knockoff
","I thoroughly enjoyed the first Thor. It was better than expected and was not an entirely by the numbers hero movie. This one, on the other hand, is not only a cliché soap opera movie, but confused as what it wants to be. Half the beginning forces rom-com background music on us & the other half is full of ironic quips & other shenanigans that belong in a Jim Carrey film. The story, villain, and connectivity to The Avengers is laughable and the cliché humanoid 60's Star Trek aliens take you out of the movie. This should have been a home run but it's quite disappointing if looking at it objectively and not as a drooling Avengers fanboy. I admit some plot twist had me excited for moments and the acting was solid. Too much Whiny sidekick girl & black swan chick but 4/10 is being generous either way.",4,4,7,23 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The CGI Games
","This film was nearly 3 hours of an emo Cabbage Patch Doll delivering monotone monologues to other angst-ridden emo teens in strange outfits.But seriously, I was just hoping for the film to exceed its predecessor and it did on some levels but was just flat out SLOW & full of unnecessary and random scenes. They could have cut out several of the pointless character-intros and had a much more powerful film. I mean, do we really need to see a tedious action sequence of people fixing up a man's whipped body? I guess that was for the ladies.Now, I do like how they are going for the 1984-feel, and I realize this is based on a book (I did not read) ... But this film's universe DOES NOT feel lived in whatsoever. Not only is it too reliant on CGI spectacle, but it does not challenge the viewers to any serious moral questions. It has chances to do so but follows the movie cliché of thinking the audience is too dumb to swallow anything besides Black Vs. White, bad guys are bad, good guys are completely innocent in every way, paradigm.And maybe they describe this world better in the book but it is absolutely ridiculous to think that the only thing this society ever talks about 24/7 is the HUNGER GAMES. Really? This prospering government with endless resources and military power spends their every living moments talking about the annual hunger games? Where are the factories or businesses that profit on the war toys or the amazing fashion technology, architecture, transportation, etc? They absolutely push the limits of dumb by pretending this world would be so obsessed with the hunger games instead of other issues in their very vast infrastructure. Just not sure how any society could thrive over anyone when their only concern in the world is the stupid annual game where emo teens kill each other. Okay, the have 'sponsors' which are not really discussed in this film but they could have at least explained why the only thing on TV is talk about these stupid games. Just saying, it is a paper thin reality, unlike a more detailed universe like Harry Potter or LOTR.5/10 because it had some intriguing action, interesting twists, and funny CGI monkeys. Me like CGI.",5,48,101,25 November 2013
The Social Network," The movie this generation deserves
","In a Frank Zappa interview, he once discussed the changing music industry & how it slowly went downhill due to executives not taking any real risks while thinking they 'knew' what was cool or what the kids wanted in order to meet their bottom line. He goes on to basically say that the current (at that time) decline in music quality/originality is what our society deserves; Since the masses obviously keep buying into the MTV culture where 'good' art is more about looks, money, & style than actual content.I think Zappa's idea applies to this film and our declining society as a whole (in terms of film, music, and the entertainment industry in general). We deserve this type of tripe, shallow, & superficial 'pop culture' fad praising art that we throw gobs of money at each year. This film is a cookie-cutter 'what's cool now' made-for-TV special with apparently a wild squirrel randomly jumping on piano keys for the soundtrack. There are some solid performances here but overall it is too panderous to the contemporaries who will remember the rising popularity of Myspace 2. What is worse is that they didn't even make a Steve Jobs film until after he passed & Jobs (and company) did a lot more to change the way we interact in all aspects of life. Why did Facebook/Zuckerberg need a 2 hour film about him even as the site's popularity was rising? I guess because it's 'hip' & so 'IN' right now.They may as well start making films about eBay's rise to power & the evolution of YouTube starring Justin Bieber as Chad Hurley. Our watered down, over hyping society is sadly continuing into a dangerous trend of accepting essentially superficial and empty products that all look the same but with a slightly different package. Everyone wants to be a star or know something about stars; Both desires, just like this film, do not result in anything worthwhile. I give it 10-15 years max before Facebook becomes as relevant as Pet Rocks & Gangnam Style. If critics and audiences keep buying into this garbage, it is certainly what they deserve more of.",1,29,50,6 September 2013
