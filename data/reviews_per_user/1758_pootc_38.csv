Blade Runner 2049," This was special
","It's amazing after repeated viewings the lack of patience or inability moviegoers have to simply follow a plot. The lack of concentration throughout the cinema, the talking throughout and some of the comments I have read is downright disturbing. This movie is high art and some people need it spoon-feed to them. If you're not invested from the get-go, just go home.Blade Runner 2049 is not your typical movie and it was never meant to be. There are no superheroes or giant robots. Explosions are scarce and it's not funny either. It's about emotion and memories and like the original Blade Runner (1982). It poses the same Philip K Dick inspired questions about humanity - what does it mean to be human and are we just the sum of our memories? It now raises questions about artificial intelligence and real love.It is a sequel 35 years in the making to one of the most thoughtful and provocative movies ever. The original movie was a box office flop which later developed a cult following and and has since been hailed a masterpiece. Ridley Scott created a multilayered world which seduces you into a nostalgic like trance for a place which never really existed and a sequel to a film held in such high regard is rarely ever a good idea but Blade Runner 2049 is a rare exception. Think The Godfather Part II, Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgment Day before it.No spoilers. We follow Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a new character and a new breed of Blade Runner on the trail of an old model replicant but what he uncovers along the way is so much bigger and threatens to shift the balance of what is left of humanity.Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) and his crew have crafted a beautiful looking film which pays homage to the original without trying to copy it at all. The same rain-soaked, neon-lit streets are present in L.A, only the Eco-system is even more shattered. Sustenance is scarce with protein farming a way of life and while there are obvious nods to the first movie 2049 relishes the opportunity to avoid the familiar and takes us outside the city limits.The cast in 2049 is excellent. Ryan Gosling carries the main story with ease, playing his detective character with an ice-cold calm until...Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, the original Blade Runner delivers a highly emotional and raw performance which I found very surprising. Not because Ford is not capable as an actor but Deckard was played so dryly in the original, especially next to Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty. Clearly time and circumstance have clearly changed him here and it's a refreshing approach.The casting choices of side characters in limited roles such as Dave Bautista, Robin Wright and Ana De Armas in her very unique role were fantastic. Jared Leto gets only a few scenes as villainous creeper Niander Wallace, the corporate tycoon with a god complex but his best 'angel', Luv (Sylvia Hoek) gets plenty and rightfully so because she's excellent.If I I had to choose any negatives from 2049 it would be need to spoon-feed the audience in scenes by adding a small flashback here and there which I thought was unnecessary. The score was clearly not Vangelis who did the first movie and made up so much of the nostalgic atmosphere in it. While good I did miss the sadness, the piano keys and blues of Vangelis for a time but could tell the score was aiming for something different, more urgent, a sense of dread which was probably more appropriate anyway with 2049 being much larger. That's not to say there aren't hints of Vangelis because there most definitely is.It has been 35 years and the need for a sequel can be debated forever. Was it necessary? No. But was it good. Yes, really good. Is it a masterpiece? I would say that it's an extremely satisfying conclusion to Deckard's story and having seen it it's made the original even better.A movie like this does not come around very often. The world needs more movies like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Ex Machina... and Blade Runner 2049. High praise.Best movie of the year!",10,17,34,4 October 2017
Mission: Impossible III," Easily the best in the trilogy, I was very impressed
","After the disgrace that was John Woo's MI: 2 I thought this franchise was finished but along comes Mission Impossible III. A film, which not only delivers but also, exceeded all my expectations. From the opening scene this film kept me enthralled, it kept me on the edge of my seat. It was intense, it was fast - it was action packed and it is easily the best in the trilogy. Tom Cruise is on his A-game, his character Ethan Hunt has been given another dimension in this instalment and the rest of the cast is enjoyable too. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the films villain was a bizarre but effective choice. He really is an unfeeling bastard, a creep that really gets under your skin.The plot is nicely crafted, with some neat twists and turns and the actions scenes are excellent which is everything you want out of a film like this. You won't catch me making any snide remarks about Cruise or this movie because it really was good. Dare say the creative minds in Hollywood are going to be hard-pressed to top this, because this is the best action movie of the year thus far. I was very impressed.",8,0,1,5 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It should have been better.
","Every generation has a legend, every journey has a first step -- whether good or bad and I guess and Phantom Menace falls somewhere in between. If anything it introduces some of the characters we know and love but beyond that the story is pretty tame for such a supposed epic return to the greatest franchise of all. The performances aren't fantastic, the characters aren't very drawn out and it offers few heart-warming moments or characters as the original trilogy. What this film does offer however are great fights, special effects and chase scenes, most notably the Pod Race and the climactic duel which is sure to please the kids and fans alike.Critics have mercilessly bashed this film for a number of reasons with the number one complaint being Jar Jar Binks and I have to agree that this film would've been much better without the over the top silliness character. Another complaint is midichlorians. Why, oh why take the mystique out of the force and reduce it to simple science? That really bothers me, because it's just pointless.While the hype for this movie was amazing, the film surely was not and failed to live up to expectations, this is by no means a terrible film that a lot of people would have you believe. In the scheme of things, watching all six episodes back to back, it's definitely in the bottom two of the series, but that's not to say its awful. It could have been better.",6,0,1,22 January 2006
Casablanca," A timeless classic, charming.
","Charming, Casablanca is a pure joy to watch from beginning to end and like a fine wine it only gets better with age. Humphrey Bogart's performance, as the disillusioned and witty Rick Baine is something to be marvelled while the screenplay provides some of the greatest scenes ever caught on film.Casablanca has so many feel-good moments to be remembered. Perhaps none more so than the uplifting finale, between Bogart and Berman in which personal sacrifices are made for an ever greater cause than the their love. This film is eternal bliss, it's timeless. No wonder they're still calling it the greatest film of all, they don't make them like they used too. Heres looking at you kid~!",10,1,2,26 December 2005
Chinatown," 'Chinatown, masterfully crafted and directed'
","'Chinatown' - Ebert called it a 'Tour De Force' and he's absolutely right. Director, Roman Polanski has absolutely nailed it. Chinatown dares to take its time to establish its story and while it may test the patience of some, those engrossed by the films atmospheric ambiguity and mystery it is definitely worth the wait. A dark, brooding detective story, entwined in a wicked conspiracy. It has all the traits of film noir, but ignores many of the clichés.Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' is masterfully crafted and directed from beginning to end. From its score, editing, dialogue and its flawless performances by both the major and minor characters Chinatown is an epic that shouldn't be missed.",10,2,4,29 December 2005
12 Monkeys," Hypnotic
","An outstanding screenplay by David and Janet Peoples comes to life in Terry Gilliam's hypnotic masterwork 12 Monkeys, which was based on a short film a 1962 short film 'La Jetée'.12 Monkeys stars Bruce Willis in his greatest performance as time traveler and mental patient, James Cole who claims he has been sent back in time to gather information on a deadly virus which has wiped out the human race in the year 1997.Along for the ride is Madeline Stowe, his doctor and Brad Pitt before stardom, whose role as an out-of-control mental patient with daddy issues got him a best supporting actor nomination.12 Monkeys is captivating, once you understand it. A movie which necessitates repeated viewings to appreciate its intricacies. Science Fiction at its best!",10,5,6,21 March 2020
Terminator Salvation," The visuals are stunning, the action breath-taking, and the drama heavy ...
","Set in 2018 after the bombs have dropped, the machines have risen and humanity is on the brink and John Connor (Christian Bale) is our only hope. Or is he? Terminator Salvation follows the horrendous Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) with McG (Charlie's Angels) at the helm. But unlike the previous instalment a concentrated effort has been made by McG to take care of the core audience by respecting and acknowledging the source material/ mythology that series creator James Cameron created in the first two films.Gone are the inflatable breasts, the soft-porn lighting, the cheesy one-liners and the cringe-worthy humour that buried Terminator 3. In fact it's almost like that T3 never happened - almost. 'Judgement Day happened', explains a young Kyle Reese in Salvation and that is all that matters.As for the story, it's simple. The original was about saving Sarah Connor, the second was about saving John Connor and Salvation is about saving a young Kyle Reese. Christian Bale is John Connor, the man fated to lead humanity to victory against Skynet and its army of machines. He plays the part with a lot of grunt, reminiscent of Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and while critics loathe the performance citing he lacked charisma, I enjoyed it. This is how Connor should be portrayed, a no holds barred soldier, rising the ranks with the weight of the world on his shoulders. But surprisingly its the addition of Sam Worthington and his portrayal of Marcus Wright - a prisoner on death row who donates his body to science only to awaken 15 years later as frankenstein so to speak is the most compelling part of Salvations plot, striking a petite emotional chord between the explosions.The other minor characters serve their purpose but Anton Yelchin absolutely nails it as a young Kyle Reese - and obviously did his homework replicating Michael Biehn's mannerisms in the original film. One of many nice touches in Salvation.With all these positives, thats not to say the film didn't have its share of problems. The editing was choppy in parts and felt incomplete, or rushed. The score by Danny Elfman was adequate but not what I'd call memorable one like Brad Fidel's and the character development was again adequate but there just could've been more of those quiet moments to pull us in. That's the difference between a good movie and a great one.Salvation is indeed a slice Salvation for this franchise, and although it doesn't quite pack the same emotional punch as Cameron's work - the world is gritty, the visuals stunning, the action breath-taking, and the drama heavy setting it back in the right direction.",7,4,7,4 June 2009
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman Lite
","Homecoming brings Spider-Man into the Marvel Universe to hang out with Iron Man and the Avengers and while it succeeds in being fun and action-packed it lacks in any kind of drama or consequence which came before in the previous standalone movies.Tom Holland plays Peter Parker with a childhood enthusiasm and high energy which makes for fun times but his character never gets serious or really feels like he is ever in any true danger.Michael Keaton plays the villain and without him I think this rendition would be in some serious trouble because the side characters are all very weak here and don't have much to do beside be funny.Marissa Tomei is completely miscasts as Parker's Aunt May and just another point of humor for hot-jokes while Ironman (Robert Downey) pops in and out and there are some nice cameos here to keep the tongue and cheek going but his involvement diminishes Spider-man's journey.I guess with there being so many Spiderman movies now the problem is we have seen it before in the previous movies and Uncle Ben dying in his arms and telling Peter how great his responsibility is has been done so the writers have shied away from telling a story with any real emotion or consequence but to me it's always been about Parker's relationships whether it's his aunt or his partners are crucial to the Spider-Man arc.Homecoming is very light on drama, but high on action and humor and sure to please the Marvel masses who want to see him team up with the Avengers in another computer generated spectacle but as one of of my favorite Marvel characters I can't help but think they should have continued with a more grounded story with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone at least for one more round because they had chemistry.I hope it gets better and they give Spider-man more depth.6/10",6,4,5,2 December 2017
Lost in Translation," Spontaneous, true to life and beautiful!
","Lost in Translation is warm, atmospheric and character driven film that provides so many tender and true to life moments that it makes you smile. The performances of Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansen are flawless. The atmosphere and isolation created serve well as the backdrop for two strangers, in a foreign land searching for meaning in their lives -- and ultimately finding it in one another. This film is a thought provoking one; it's an adult film with no clear three-act structure, it's spontaneous just like life and it's beautiful on so many different levels. Sometimes the briefest encounters are the one's that stay with you for the rest of your lives. The tagline for this film reads, 'Everybody wants to be found', and that is so, so true.",9,1,2,18 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Hard to watch
","After the disappointment that was the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones does nothing to rejuvenate the new wave of Star Wars installments, as poorly executed scenes, clumsy dialogue make and an over-reliance on computer generated imagery make this film hard to watch.While it's technically sound Clones comes off like an experimental video-game more than a film with far too many silly and irritating moments but alas there is hope. His name is Ewan McGregor, his role Obi Wan Kenobi - and unlike Phantom Menace he gets the spotlight he deserves leaving newcomer Hayden Christensen with little more to do but whinge and whine in his role as the adolescent Anakin Skywalker.Natalie Portman returns as Padme, and together with Hayden Christensen provide many of the worst moments of the movie as their love scenes are unpersuasive, corny and stilted with wooden dialogue which is a real shame, considering the success and innovation of Han's and Leia's love in the Empire Strikes Back.The action scenes in Attack of the Clones are very good, but the third act is dragged down with one of the most ludicrous scenes ever assembled involving a characters head - and its just plain bad. I'm all for humour, even Ewok's but this was terrible.Luckily Yoda saves the day, literally delivering a brief, yet memorable moment to savor. If it wasn't for the score, Ewan McGregor, the action and a sense of nostalgia this wouldn't even be passable. 6/10",4,0,1,27 December 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," Best action movie of 2007!
","Matt Damon returns in the third and most likely final instalment of the Bourne franchise as Jason Bourne. A man trying to unravel his past hunted by his enemies and pursued across the globe he is searching for answers and this time he may just find what he's looking for.With two suspenseful and action-packed blockbusters behind it (The Bourne Identity and the Bourne Supremacy) The Bourne Ultimatum wastes no time upping the anti with plenty of intense, pulse-pounding action.Picking up right after the second film (Supremacy) it quickly delves into the story, flashing back and forth between locations and never slows down however unlike previous action romps (including this year's Die Hard 4.0) the action scenes and sheer suspense in Ultimatum serve to move the story forward, and are mindless by no means - which is the great thing about this franchise. It doesn't over-do anything, keeping it believable but unbelievable at the same time if that makes any sense.Paul Greengrass directs with precision while the quick-cuts and flash cinematography only enhance the intensity of the car chases and fist fights, Matt Damon is excellent in the role and the supporting cast plays there part to a tee.If this is the last of the Bourne Franchise they went out on top because this is not only the best of the trilogy, it's the best action movie of 2007 period.",8,1,2,10 August 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I like it, but I don't love it
","Lord of the Rings is spectacular in most respects, a great adaptation from the novels --critical acclaim all round, and effects are simply astonishing throughout all three parts, it's good, I can be honest. Peter Jackson is amazingly talented should be very proud, for bringing this to screen in the manner he did, an amazing technical achievement. But that's not to say I thoroughly enjoyed it or rank it in my top ten. To be honest, I could never really get into the story, as much as I tried too, as much as my friends were. The stage was epic, everything I want in a film but I found myself reluctant to go along for the ride in this case. As emotional as they were I never felt a real connection with the characters, maybe thats my fault, I don't know but in any case I was practically dragged to the cinema to see it's sequels, because I'd seen the first one. Don't get me wrong, I like these films, all three but I didn't love them as much as others.",7,0,1,10 February 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Lacks direction, humanity and complex characters.
","After over a decade of waiting, wondering what came next in the masterful Terminator franchise starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his most famous and iconic role - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines made it's premiere in 2003 but this time without James Cameron at the helm. In his place a competent action director in Jonathan Mostow (U571 and Breakdown) to continue the legendary mythology spelled out so meaningfully in the previous classics. No pity, no remorse - no fate but what we make, right? Wrong.Terminator 3 works as a stand-alone action film or straight up popcorn flicks for teenage multiplex hoards but as part of the acclaimed Terminator franchise it's an insulting, unintelligent and insignificant re-tread lacking direction, humanity and complex characters. If anything this devalues the franchise beyond recognition essentially back-tracking, rewriting and corrupting the mythology painstakingly established by James Cameron before trying to compensate for its lack of creativity with explosions and poorly placed slapstick humour.Its one thing to unnecessarily build upon another movie's story, but to rewrite the entire meaning behind another movie is just cheap and nasty. The story itself offered nothing besides the beginning of Judgment Day which was already the way we knew the series was headed and instead of moving the logical way, which is forward, the writers tried to implement bogus twists and instead took some rather pointless and dull steps backwards essentially reversing the entire mythology of the series.The notion desperately put forth in Terminator 3 is ridiculous, not to mention a complete repudiation of the themes and ideals spelled out so eloquently in Terminator's one and two. This is bad writing, tailored to suit an uninspired little story. How the writers felt adequate about avoiding the questions everybody has been asking for over a decade but more importantly how is it they live with themselves after re-writing the entire meaning behind such a classic mythology? 'Judgement Day is inevitable' is not an explanation. This one line shows how little talent, vision or depth the writers really had when put up to the take of writing such a large-scale film on their own.Now to character development and relationships. Terminator 3 missed so many opportunities to establish it's characters and established no atmosphere whatsoever. The score is as dry as a bone lacking little to no emotion like Brad Fidel's and if anything, anything at all the film should have emphasized even more on the character of John Connor. You know the saviour of mankind, the leader of the human resistance like Sarah in Terminator 2 but failed to because there simply wasn't any time to between the breaking of key scenes with slapstick humour by clown Arnold or more pointless action. The opening voice over with Connor was the only real development throughout the movie but can you really call that development? I'd call it an easy explanation. The opening voice over is all the insight you really get into the mind of John Connor (who gets his age wrong) and unfortunately its not enough to warrant a great character like Sarah Connor, though Stahl's performance was firm.How we went from the Terminator in 1984 to this is beyond me and while they may have the rights to the franchise but you'd think in having the rights to create such a high calibre film they'd first take the time to understand it and its importance. The writers (Brancato, Ferris) were completely void of any real new ideas and basically had re-tread old information with one original idea in mind for the movie, the oh so 'shocking' conclusion which was just another tool for yet another 'inevitable' sequel by these hacks who forgot to hold dear what Cameron's films made so memorable. 1/10",1,7,13,25 December 2005
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This is why we go to the movies
","X-Men Days of Future Past is an epic, and emotional adventure filmed with drama and with memorable performances all around, and from so many characters too. When hearing about the scope of the plot I was a little hesitant, because the introduction of mutant after mutant didn't work so well in cases such as X-Men 3: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine which were jam-packed with action but little to no character development or weight behind it, it felt rushed and artificial.But the returning director of X-Men and X2, Bryan Singer doesn't overdo it at all. The characters all have a role to play with the leads going to Wolverine (Jackman) and Xavier (McAvoy). This is not an action movie by any means. But when there is action it's really heavy just like the drama - everything in this movie is heavy and epic. The end of the world, both mutant and humankind is what's at stake here and the future is a horrible, horrible nightmare that could very well become reality if a grief-stricken, young Professor Xavier cannot find hope and pull himself together in time.Xavier having to find himself, with the help of his older-self (Stewart) as seen in the trailers was a touch of brilliance. An epic scene which sent chills up my body. This is why we go to the movies for this kind of roller-coaster experience. 10/10",9,2,3,27 May 2014
Die Hard 2," A worthy and fun sequel to an action classic.
","It's Christmas Eve again and John McClane returns in Die Hard 2: Die Harder, the first sequel to the untouchable classic Die Hard and the role that made Bruce Willis a household name. He's LAPD now and has patched things up with his wife Holly is who is about to land at Dulles International Airport in Washington but things don't go to plan – they never do. 'How can the same sh#t happen to the same guy twice?' McClane quips as he's back in the thick of things with a terrorist madman taking over the airport to rescue an international drug kingpin who's being escorted home.The action is bigger, louder and the kills meaner which will satisfy any action fan while Bruce Willis is on top of his game in this Renny Harlin directed sequel that delivers more of the same which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the original Die Hard is a classic which takes something special and probably more original to top. The supporting cast of the first is back (in part) and play their parts to a tee while William Sadler's villain isn't as charismatic as Hans Gruber, rather he's the opposite, a brutal mercenary who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal and we get this point loud and very clear in a disturbing crash scene which works very well in making us root for the good guy.Die Harder ups the ante, in kills, fore and action but McClane loses a step here and becomes a bit of a parody of himself but it's all in good fun, because really 'how could the same sh#t happen to the same guy twice?'. It's so ridiculous it's great, just sit back and enjoy because more of the same this time around is fine by me. Overall Die Hard 2 is a worthy and fun sequel to an action classic. Seven (and a half) out of ten.",7,0,1,28 February 2013
Alien vs. Predator," This film is as pathetic as it is insulting
","This film is as pathetic as it is insulting. Way to kill two franchises at once, huh? This was to put it bluntly a waste of a time. I wasn't even mildly entertained. No atmosphere, no tension, and no intelligence -- just dumb (And I do mean dumb) half-assed action that plays more like a video game and doesn't deserve the title Alien vs. Predator. I know this is a popular thing to do bashing this director and all but in this case he deserves it. Paul W. S Andersen, why is this film so bad? Why can't you for once in your career make a meaningful movie, with say meaningful characters? I challenge you Paul, a decent film is all I want. For someone who claims to be such a huge fan he sure has no second thoughts about disregarding and disrespecting the most obvious traits of the two franchises. We came from Alien to this?",1,2,7,28 December 2005
Batman Begins," Bale makes a good Batman, but he makes an even better Bruce Wayne
","Batman Begins is a great character story, and a great beginning to a new line of Batman features after the franchise had hit rock bottom with the awful Joel Schumacher disaster, Batman and Robin. The script is very tight, and creative while the characters three dimensional and uncharacteristically drawn out for a comic book adaptation. We learn a lot about Bruce Wayne and what drives the man into becoming the icon we all know and love. Christian Bale makes a good Batman, but he makes an even better Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins. It is an origin story after all and Bale delivers an excellent performance as do the supporting cast, bar one.What I didn't like was Katie Holmes character - I thought she was definitely the weakest link of the story. The set design and look of the film didn't appeal to me at all either. After seeing Tim Burtons vision of Batman and having been a fan of the comics and character, there is no going back. I found the look to be too tamed and basic for Batman film which bothered me somewhat.The story is what drives Batman Begins and thanks to a great script and character development it delivers - but I'd still rather watch Burton's original.",7,0,1,27 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not the finale we all wanted
","Watching X- Men: The Last Stand there is certainly a sense of finality to it all, unfortunately though, it's just not the finale we all wanted. Brett Ratner did a great job - direction wise and the third act really heats up. The problem lies in the other two. There are some very cool scenes, and moments and this is the most epic and darkest of all three but something is missing in this instalment, it felt numb, void of any real emotion or consequential characters.It felt as if not all the pieces were there, characters just seemed to drop in and out all the time and even the deaths of the characters, especially the first one were all kind of humdrum. Basically, the film never really took off until the end and that was it's biggest letdown, it grew tired too early and did it's best to redeem in it's finale.Ian McKellen as usual excels as Magneto and as expected, finally snaps while Halle Berry does what she does well, nobody really cares about Storm. She's a secondary character at best and yet, in this she basically runs the show in X3. Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, although sorry to say it, he's lost his edge and just falls in line like the rest.Overall, the X-Men trilogy is suffice. This instalment didn't really hurt it, but then again it didn't do it any favours. Each instalment is decent in its own right, even good (I believe X-Men 2 edges them both) but if this does turn out to be the last stand then this series will never achieve greatness because so far we've had three above average movies - nothing more, nothing less.",6,0,1,11 June 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The best rendition of Spiderman yet!
","The relationship between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) has infinitely more chemistry than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst which is why The Amazing Spiderman series is superior to the previous Sam Raimi helmed version of Spiderman. The supporting cast notably Jamie Foxx as Max/ Electro, Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborne and also Sally Field and Aunt May are excellent in their respective roles – and also much more fleshed out then usual. Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to slow down the pace and tell a human story while leaving plenty of time for action. While the first Amazing Spiderman was an origin story and more grounded in action scenes Amazing Spiderman 2 pulls out all the stops and looks absolutely fantastic. The strength and chemistry of the lead two characters is the real gem here though striking an emotional chord while the action climaxes in an epic and unforgettable finale. Amazing Spiderman 2 is a rousing success, topping the first in this series and leaving us wanting more. The best rendition of Spiderman yet!",8,6,17,19 April 2014

1917," One of the best movies of 2019
","The cinematography is absolutely amazing with the movie appearing to be one continuous shot while the action is well choreographed and realistic. The movie is never excessive and while it has its fair share of action, it takes its time to not rush the quiet and more human moments amidst the carnage. It is a gritty depiction of war and all its horrors, not for spectacle's sake but to tell the story of two men given a mission to deliver a message. It's a race against time to save 1,600 men from a surprise attack during the World War I.I found myself immersed in this and felt like I was with the two mains on the battlefield. A fantastic technical achievement in cinematography and one of the best movies of 2019.",8,5,7,14 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Porgs are cool. The Last Jedi is not.
","Be aware - spoilers ahead.Porgs are cool. The Last Jedi is not. It is very disappointing movie for somebody looking for answers to really anything Star Wars lore. It has some good moments but after The Force Awakens left viewers such a high-note with the return of the Luke Skywalker - I left feeling empty and wondering if they just should have left it all alone.The legend of the rebellion and childhood hero for so many Luke Skywalker is a broken man who unfortunately has not learned too much in his time in exile. Something that really puzzles me here is that there are no new revelations about the force as one would expect, especially by somebody in exile with unlimited time, power and the potential to learn.We're treated to a great performance by Mark Hamill but I wanted Luke Skywalker to be great. He is the hero of the Original Trilogy, by far the most revered and loved and he gets a moment, sure, but it merely serves as an opportunity to 'pass the torch' to the younger cast and it seems so contrived and obvious.This is all made worse by the real-life passing of Carrie Fisher who plays Princess Leia who seems much more comfortable in her role than in The Force Awakens. I must admit I had really high hopes for this film, for nostalgic reasons and as much as I really liked the characters in The Force Awakens it's the original characters who we all fell in love with and seeing them treated like this is - as means to simply pass the torch to younger actors is really disappointing. The Force Awakens did it right with Han Solo because it elevated Kylo Ren's villain status enormously. The problem is that the Rey and Luke dynamic needed to be fleshed out way more. We needed more revelations about the true nature of the force, how it began, something new and we got nothing even though Luke has his hands on the first ever Jedi texts and scrolls, it seems like he hasn't read them because we get absolutely no real insight into what they say. How disappointing is that considering he is in exile? What else has he got to do? I found this totally, utterly frustrating beyond belief.More wasted opportunities lie with some of the characters. Supreme Leader Snoke's characters 'moment' was a shocking but empty. We got no backstory and nothing clever to bind the saga together. He is literally just a 'bad guy' that just appears out of nowhere and corrupts young Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren.Captain Phasma is another throwaway character with nothing to do at all as is General Hux, who just provides comic relief and then there is Rey's parentage which becomes the ultimate disappointment in this story. Another aspect that just left me feeling empty and unsatisfied. Oscar Isaac's ace pilot Poe Dameron is back and joined by Laura Dern playing newcomer Admiral Holdo. Their story is one of the best side stories that completely pays off. I loved Poe Dameron's energy and enthusiasm in this just like I loved Finn's in The Force Awakens. Unfortunately Finn's journey is far less compelling now. He is joined by actress Kelly Marie Tran who plays Rose Tico and a friendship, possible romance ensues but it's all very cliche and nothing to write home about nor is the much hyped Canto Bight scenes which resemble something more out of a Harry Potter movie than Star Wars.The other dynamic is Rey and Kylo Ren's relationship which does manage to keep you guessing for a time. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are again, really good in their respective roles but it's not enough to save the story from feeling like a lost opportunity to tie the Skywalker story (the Star Wars story we all fell in love with) together in a satisfying package.
 
I think Disney have tried to throw one too many curve balls and they're way off. I remember leaving The Force Awakens with so much optimism and I wish it were different but essentially I feel that there is nowhere else to go.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Nothing left
","Be aware - spoilers ahead.Porgs are cool but The Last Jedi is not particularly good. It's better than say Attack of the Clones because it doesn't look like a video game but I don't get the reviews dubbing this as an intelligent movie because it managers to avoid any answers to any meaningful questions.It is really disappointing movie for somebody looking for answers to really anything Star Wars lore. It has some good fan moments but after The Force Awakens left viewers such a high-note with the return of Luke Skywalker - I left feeling empty and wondering if they just should have left it all alone.The legend of the rebellion and childhood hero for so many Luke Skywalker is a broken man who unfortunately has not learned too much in his time in exile despite tracking down the original Jedi temple, texts and scrolls he apparently hasn't read them or learned too much which I find completely puzzling and frustrating. He has no new revelations, we learn nothing new about the force from Master Skywalker who doesn't seem to be all that wise at all. I wanted something new, some new revelations about the nature of the force, the Jedi and how it began. Unfortunately we learn nothing here from the ultimate Jedi and its so frustrating. Don't get me wrong, we're treated to a great performance by Mark Hamill but I wanted Luke Skywalker to be great and wise and in the Last Jedi he just isn't. I mean at all. I'm all for the broken lone samurai type loner who is shamed but this is the hero of the original trilogy which is by far the moat revered and while Luke gets his redemptive moment, it merely serves to 'pass the torch' to the younger cast which is so contrived and obvious.I must admit I had really high hopes for this film. For nostalgic reasons and as much as I really liked the characters in The Force Awakens it's the original characters who we all fell in love with and seeing them treated like this is. A means to simply pass the torch to younger actors is really disappointing. The Force Awakens did it right with Han Solo because it elevated Kylo Ren's villain status enormously while this was just a generational hand-off for the sake of it.
This is all made worse by the real-life and very tragic passing of Carrie Fisher who is back in her final performance. Just knowing she won't be there for the next episode stings even more so now after this one. The problem with this story is Rey and Luke are at it's center and the dynamic needed to be fleshed out way more to make her a worthy successor to Luke Skywalker and the question of her parentage is one of the most disappointing parts of this whole entire story. It is just such an unsatisfying answer and a massive wasted opportunity.More wasted opportunities lie with some of the characters. Supreme Leader Snoke's characters 'moment' was a shocking but ultimately empty. We got no backstory and nothing clever to bind the saga together. He is literally just a 'bad guy' that just appears out of nowhere and corrupts young Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren. Captain Phasma is another throwaway character with nothing to do at all as is General Hux, who just provides comic relief. Are Disney doing this in purpose? The other twists and turns lie in the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey which does manage to keep you guessing for a time as to where their allegiances will end up. Again both are really good in their roles but its not enough to save a lackluster story.Bright points are Carrie Fishers last performance. Oscar Isaac's ace pilot Poe Dameron is back and joined by Laura Dern playing newcomer Admiral Holdo. Their story and their interaction is one of the best side stories that completely pays off in a very Star Wars way. I loved Poe Dameron's energy and enthusiasm in this just like I loved Finn's in The Force Awakens. Unfortunately Finn's journey is far less compelling now. He is joined by actress Kelly Marie Tran who plays Rose Tico and a friendship/ possible romance ensues but it's all very cliche and nothing to write home about nor is the much-hyped Canto Bight scenes which resemble something more out of a Harry Potter movie than Star Wars. Though Benecio Del Toro's is good in his little role.Ultimately The Last Jedi is a lost opportunity to tie in the Skywalker story (aka the Star Wars story we all fell in love with) together in a satisfying package. I think Disney have tried to throw one too many curve balls this time around for curve ball sake and they're way off. Shocking twists are one thing but I remember leaving The Force Awakens with so much optimism and hope. I wish this were different but I feel robbed.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Nothing Left
","Be aware - spoilers ahead.'This is not going to go the way you think' - Luke Skywalker
'Let the past die' - Kylo RenOh I get it, The Last Jedi certainly shocked us but it's not a good thing in this case.Porgs are actually cool but The Last Jedi is not particularly good. The best movie since Empire Strikes Back some critics are claiming. So better than A New Hope? Not even close. It might be better than say Attack of the Clones because it doesn't look like a bad video game, the dialogue, acting and special effects are much better as they should be but I don't get the reviews citing this as an intelligent Star Wars movie because it manages to avoid any answers to any meaningful questions and when it does -- the answers are just so disappointing. I feel like J.J Abrams set it all up and Rian Johnson came in and completely messed it up.If his mandate was to turn the series upside down in response to the criticism of The Force Awakens being too much like the original Star Wars Rian Johnson has succeeded but at what cost? The Last Jedi is a really disappointing movie for somebody looking any connection or backstory anything Star Wars lore. It has some good action moments but after The Force Awakens left viewers such a high-note with the return of Luke Skywalker - I left feeling so empty and wondering if they just should have left it all alone.The legend of the rebellion and childhood hero for so many Luke Skywalker is a broken man who unfortunately has not learned too much in his time in exile despite tracking down the original Jedi temple, texts and scrolls he apparently hasn't read them or learned too much after all these years which I find completely puzzling and frustrating.

Just knowing she won't be there for the next episode stings even more so now after this one. 
But the problem with this story is Rey and Luke are at it's center and the dynamic needed to be fleshed out way more to make her a worthy successor to Luke Skywalker and the question of her parentage, one of the biggest hooks in Force Awakens is one of the most disappointing parts of this whole entire story. It is just such an unsatisfying answer and a massive wasted opportunity. Basically Rey gets a light sabre and she is the most powerful Jedi, no backstory, no anything she just is. She did not earn anything, she has not learned anything. She just is... More wasted opportunities lie with some of the characters. Supreme Leader Snoke's character 'moment' was a shocking but ultimately empty. We got no backstory and nothing clever to bind the saga together at all. He is literally just a pop-up 'bad guy' that just appears out of nowhere and corrupts young Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren.Captain Phasma is another throwaway character with nothing to do at all as is General Hux, who just provides comic relief which is overdone here anyway.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Nothing overtly memorable here with the exception of the 80's soundtrack
","Call me old fashioned but I just didn't get the hype surrounding Guardians of the Galaxy. It took me several times to actually get through it and while I appreciate a good space adventure and fantasy movie it just didn't grab me like it grabbed a lot of people. Praise to the artists who brought it to life and judging by the credits there were a lot of them but either it's the wrong time for me or I am just CGI'd out at this point. It took me out of the movie and with all the superhero movies hitting screens, this one just seemed pretty standard to me.Some good action scenes, some funny characters and moments but nothing overtly memorable here with the exception of the 80's soundtrack. It's a popcorn movie - the cast did a good job with everything they had and that's all you can ask for. I just wasn't feeling it through Guardians of the Galaxy.",6,2,6,21 January 2017
The Hurricane," A complete fabrication of the truth
","The Hurricane as emotionally gripping as the 'film' is, is an outright a lie and a complete fabrication of the real events and occurrences that took place on that fateful night in Patterson, New Jersey. First off, I believe it is the job of a responsible filmmaker and a storyteller to educate the public, not mislead them and purposely cover up the true facts and evidence as Norman Jewison has in his film. I too was caught up in the Rubin Carter hysteria upon seeing this film, in fact I loved this film, but I dug a little deeper and what I found was both shocking and disgraceful. Dramatic license is one thing but to falsify and ignore so many details pertaining to this case is unforgivable and deceptive. Here are some true facts of the Rubin Carter case, which somehow didn't make the final cut of the film. (I wonder why) for those who are interested here are just some of the many facts.<ul><li>Racist pig cop never existed. - Both Bello and Patty Valentine identified Carters car less than an hour after the crime. - The Police did not stop Carter and Artis because they were black, as the film would have you believe. They were rounded up because their car matched the description of the killer's getaway car. At first, just 14 blocks from the murder scene the cops let them go. When the same two cops got a description of the getaway car, they immediately recognized it as Carters car and were in pursuit. - When police searched Carter's car shortly after the murders, they found a live shotgun shell and a live .32 caliber bullet rolling around inside. The live rounds are significant because they fit the murder weapons and were found long before the caliber of the handgun used in the crime was determined. - No conspiracy was needed to frame Carter. On the day of the murders Bello told a friend 'Rubin Carter shot up the whole bar'. Months later he voluntarily (and reluctantly) names Carter as one of the two killers in two police interviews. Three days after Bello talked Bradley was interviewed, confirming Bello's story while he was incarcerated in a reformatory 75 miles away. Bello names Carter again in a tape-recorded interview, falsely depicted in the film. In actual fact Bello had already talked and didn't know he was being taped while Bradley was nowhere near the place. - In jail awaiting his first trial, Rubin Carter writes to his main alibi witness and tells her the story 'I want you to remember.' He runs through the alibi story point by point. - Contrary to the film, Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter failed a lie detector test just hours after the Lafayette Grill triple murder in 1966, according to the man who gave him the test, John J. McGuire, a former police polygraph examiner. McGuire said the results showed that Carter lied when he denied being involved in the crime. He refused to take a second test. Artis also failed his lie detector test. - On the 8/3/76 the Prosecutor told Carter, 'Pass a lie test and go free'. Carter refused. - There was never any attempt to falsify the time of the murders and no evidence to claim it. - Hurricane Carter and his co-accused, John Artis, have never been found 'not guilty' of the Lafayette Grill Murders. They were twice convicted, and twice the convictions were set-aside on the grounds that they didn't get a fair trial. The State of New Jersey decided not to re-try them a third time because so much time had passed, and withdrew the indictments against them.</li></ul>What a disgrace of a film. What an outright lie, I can't believe they got away with this propaganda.",1,36,64,11 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," See it for yourself and decide for yourself
","The Da Vinci Code reminded me that cinema audience's today there have the intelligence of gnats. This is a good movie, despite what the critics say - I haven't read the book but I do know the basics and to my knowledge was an intelligent and thought provoking outing at the cinemas, for once. It's a clever film that raises a lot of questions. It was epic adventure and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.Whether or not any of it is true is really irrelevant. This is fiction, it's a film and the controversy that surrounds it is ridiculous. For anybody to turn their backs on their faith after viewing this film means one thing. Obviously their faith wasn't that strong to begin with.This was not the greatest story ever told, nor did it claim to be yet the expectations for this film were out of the ballpark and it was destined to disappoint after the success of Dan Brown's best-selling novel. Keep in mind everybody has an opinion and in this film's case, everybody has his or her own agenda because the subject matter is deemed so 'controversial'.See it for yourself and decide for yourself. Whether you believe or you don't, neither version of the 'truth' can truly be approved or disproved and that's the beauty of this film, it's got everyone talking.",8,1,6,19 May 2006
Die Hard," 'Welcome to the party, pal!'
","When people think action - they remember Die Hard. They remember Bruce Willis in his star-making role as that guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. They remember John McClane, they remember Han's Gruber, Holly Generro and Ellis, alright not really Ellis... but everybody will always remember those immortal words, 'Yippee-Ki-Ay Motherf*&ker' Die Hard is the ultimate action film, packed with all the firepower you can handle and enough C4 to level a building. It's and a genuine no-holds-barred roller coaster ride from beginning to end.With a relatable everyman John McClane, (Bruce Willis in his iconic role - brilliant)and a sinister villain in Han's Gruber (Alan Rickman)Die Hard has the action-genre by the balls and sets a standard in this genre that has never been equaled. 'Welcome to the party, pal!'",9,19,29,25 June 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Think fast, look alive and Yippee-Kay-Yay!
","Die Hard with a Vengeance starts out with a bang and never lets up. Its a fantastic, original and suspenseful action thriller pitting a suspended and very hung-over Detective John McLane with marital issues against an elusive enemy calling himself Simon. McClane is about to have a very bad day and Simon wants McClane to play a game, 'Simon Says' or he is going to set off another bomb in a very public place. Racing through New York City, leaping onto subway trains, dodging gunfire, and jumping through hoops for a psychopath McCLane unwittingly picks up Zeus Carver, a racist shop-owner played masterfully by Samuel L Jackson who is drawn into the action.Vengeance in essence is a direct sequel to the first Die Hard only totally different. Its not Christmas, and its not confined to a building but John McTiernan is back to direct and its like he never left because the grit, intensity, and attitude of the original Die Hard is ever present and though Hans Gruber is long dead Jeremy Irons does more than enough to carry the weight of a worthy advisory to McClane whose one step shy of becoming a full-blown alcoholic. The quips are there, the one-liners, the German bad guys, the foul language and non-stop action.The supporting cast and many extras of Vengeance are also great. Vengeance is an ode to New York and there are long periods without any McClane, Jackson or Irons which only serve to make the movie stronger and setup the explosive finale. But the real winner here is truly the banter and chemistry between the two leads and the sidekick formula completely works here and is a welcome break from the McClane being alone in a confined place scenario. Overall this is my favourite rendition of John McClane who hasn't missed a beat and it's a great performance from Bruce Willis in a role he knows so well. The ending doesn't quite live up to the rest of the movie but there's enough here to warrant a true classic in my opinion as Vengeance's re-watch value is very high. I loved it.Nine out of ten.",9,0,0,8 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas finds form...finally.
","After two average prequels George Lucas finally finds his form with Revenge of the Sith delivering probably the third best episode of the saga behind A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Gone is the embarrassing and dim-witted Jar Jar Binks as well as the kiddie play, this is the darkest, most action packed episode of all, and at long last Anakin Skywalker discovers his destiny.Having been seduced by the dark side with the promise of unlimited power, and the ability to save his love from 'certain' death he becomes Darth Vader and aids the evil Sith Lord, Darth Sidious in bringing an end to the Jedi Order and forming the first Galactic Empire. Truths unravel, loyalties are betrayed, and lives are lost in this solemn chapter of the Star Wars saga.This is without a doubt, what fans of the saga were hoping for, it has all the elements of a Shakespearian play, and the drama and emotion of it all really comes to head in its finale linking the two trilogies together nicely.Watching it for the first time I sat there truly in shock, because this film delivered, exceeding expectations - but ultimately making me wonder why Lucas didn't find form earlier. I really feel like the first two prequels were missed opportunities that if anything hurt the Star Wars franchise while Sith was the only episode to expand it.Revenge of the Sith is by no means perfect, some of the dialogue is still a little flat, but it's a vast improvement over Attack of the Clones. Anakin and Padme's relationship just isn't as natural as Han and Leia's in the original trilogy and still seems a little forced but overall the scenes seem to gel, setting up the brilliantly conceived third act.While I am sorry to see Star Wars come to an end, it makes me happy that it Star Wars went out on such a high note and that George Lucas has finally redeemed himself. Revenge of the Sith is not only the final piece of the puzzle. It's redemption, restoring some of the dignity of possibly the greatest franchise in cinema",7,0,0,2 March 2006
Taken 2," Predictable and hum-drum sequel
","Warning: SpoilersTaken 2 is a predictable, by the numbers sequel which unfortunately plays everything too safe and lacks the excitement of the first movie. What made the first movie work was Bryan Mill's (Liam Neeson) drive to find and recue his daughter from those evil traffickers and it worked because we felt his anger and wanted everyone of those responsible to get dead. Taken 2's villains are out for revenge, it's a continuation from the first story and while look mean they're far less intimidating because they haven't done anything too sinister on-screen for us to see. What this flick needed was a jump-start and to make it work somebody needed to die and they had ample opportunity. Lenore (Famke Janssen) is a stupid character there to be screamed and rescued much like Maggie Grace in the first but her roles been updated here, she plays Neeson's sidekick and does a surprisingly good job but back to Lenore. She was wasted in this movie and offing her would have created an emotional chord which would have made Taken 2 that much more impactful because like the first we would've felt the anguish, we would have felt the anger and we would have wanted everyone responsible to pay but the opportunity after being teased was wasted here and the result is a very average and predictable follow-up to a movie that had merit. The stakes should have been higher, the fight faster and more brutal but somehow it was a generic romp. The kills less exciting, the cutting of the action was questionable and confusing especially the scene with the metal bars what's more and there was absolutely no 'bloody' impact to any of the violence including the very tame climax which felt like it came out of nowhere. It's watchable but just not very good. 5/10",5,1,2,11 October 2012
Blade Runner," A Masterpiece
","Ridley Scott's signature film Blade Runner is a film so profound in its mythology and history it strikes an indelible chord with those who see through its relatively straight-forward narrative. It's a mature film with unique undertones designed to evoke emotion and thought and for some it's a daunting and depressive ride while for others it's a revelation both intellectually and emotionally.Blade Runner is film that needs to be watched more than once. It's an atmospheric film, both science-fiction and art - a study of dehumanization and environment which reaches a higher plain than most, asking the question what it is to be human and where are we going. The film is striking on so many different levels from its heartfelt performances and characters - and their desperate plight for life. It's ambient and evocative score by Italian composer Vangelis, its amazing set design and nostalgia inducing atmosphere.Plagued by production troubles since its inception, and a box office failure Blade Runner would be rediscovered on the video market over the years after a chance screening of a work-print cut in Colorado and evolve into a cult hit, and one of the most influential science-fiction film of all-time. The resurrection as also sparked with the release of the 1992 'Director's Cut' which was by all accounts a 'rush job'. The version omitted the drowsy voice-over narration by Harrison Ford and the out-of-place, and studio enforced happy ending.In 2007, The Final Cut arrived and with it closure to the classic film's troubled history as Director, Ridley Scott's vision has finally been realized twenty-five years after the film's initial theatrical release. Whichever version you choose whether it be the Theatrical, Directors Cut, Work-print, European, or the Final Cut Blade Runner is a science fiction masterpiece.On a personal level it makes me feel lost and long for something more, it makes me long for 'time and place that never really was' and no other film has stayed with me quite like Blade Runner.",10,2,4,26 December 2005
Midway," A cartoon war movie
","Forgive me. I made the mistake of watching Midway after watching 1917 and here are my takeaways. 1917 is high art from its camerawork, set design and action. Midway is not. It's a poor depiction of war which plays and looks more like a video game. Complete with over the top computer generated effects and unrealistic characters being superheroes.The special effects are terrible here, laughable even and the characters are even worse. I could have sworn I was watching a parody. This is a cartoon war movie compared to 1917 void of any emotional weight. Shame because the real story is so compelling.I am surprised the ratings are as high as they are. This was a big disappointment.",4,2,6,15 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Awakens
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a long anticipated sequel and return to a galaxy far, far away. Return of the Jedi (1983) being the last installment, J.J Abrams takes the reigns as director and services the fans well with a generous dose of nostalgia. There are some cliché or corn-ball moments but there is plenty of new here to be mixed in with the old and it pays off greatly and only left me wanting more.Oscaar Isaac plays Poe Dameron, the Resistance's star pilot who is sent on a secret mission while newcomer Daisy Ridley plays Rey - a lonely, self-sufficient scavenger living on the planet, Jakku. She encounters a disillusioned storm-trooper Finn, who has 'nothing to fight for'. Together, along with a mysterious new droid BB-8 embarks on a 'classified' mission to return the droid to the Resistance in the fight against the second coming of the Galactic Empire - The First Order and their new face of evil Kylo-Ren, played by Adam Driver.A strong script from Empire scribe Laurence Kasdan, J.J Abrams (and Michael Arndt) with an interesting premise concerning our beloved hero Luke Skywalker. The film lets the new cast carry the load early on and happy to say the new cast of heroes and villains does an outstanding job carrying the first act. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Isaac and Driver are all interesting characters in their own right who make them their own. The dynamic and energy between Rey and Finn is kinetic with great dialogue and banter while the atmosphere, sets and locations and craft which has obviously gone into this film is paramount. A far cry from the much-maligned sequels, the realism and grit really shows on screen making everything just that much more authentic in this used galaxy. Blood, sweat, and rust – it's back!The action scenes are top-notch, the dogfights pitting old favorites X-Wing verses Tie Fighters are some of the the best in the franchise yet and the score by legendary John Williams probably isn't his finest work but never fails to amp you up and get the blood pumping though it was the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca which got me feeling emotional. Harrison Ford hasn't missed a step and absolutely owns it. Carrie Fisher returns as Leia, Hamill as Luke, the droids are back in their respective roles and for some moments it's just like old times, only not quite.Balancing between new and old is tough and there is just no pleasing some expectations while others just have a negative agenda, especially when it comes to the massive juggernaut that is Star Wars. If I had one nit-pick it was the seeming ease of formulating a plan of attack on the First Order in the final act but it's all very minor in the scheme of things. If you weren't into this movie I feel sorry for you.I see the haters posting their 1/10 ratings which have been hardly objective or fair. J.J Abrams has an impossible task living up to the original classics but he managed to tick all the right boxes for me - and by the sounds of it lots of others in this resounding success of a movie. He has brought the spirit, emotion and feeling back to the galaxy which had been sorely missing in the prequels. The argument that The Force Awakens is a blatant rehash of A New Hope is weak. You don't have to be a genius to figure out that there are obvious parallels, beats and similarities. A message in a droid. A desert planet character about to embark on their greatest adventure ala Anakin and Luke. A cantina or bar with a band, a 'death star' type weapon with a trench, a villain in a black mask. The same repetition can be said for James Cameron's Aliens (1986) which is considered one of the greatest sequels of all-time - and rightfully so. Let's take a quick look at Aliens – spoilers ahead for that movie. We revisit the downed derelict ship from the first movie and a colonist gets attacked by a face-hugger to open things just like the first movie when a crewmember does. We have another artificial human character/ corporate crony working for the evil company with questionable motives. The crew from the first is replaced by marines who are introduced all waking up from a cryogenic sleep just like the first movie. There is a detonation finale against the clock with the same voiced countdown, complete with the rescue of a 'smaller' character. The Alien eventually stows away on the ship again and is subsequently blown out of an airlock by the main character (again) and the movie ends the same way, with the main character going into a cryogenic sleep.The Force Awakens was an ode to the fans who grew up with the originals, it's a story for a new generation and as promised in the opening line is going to 'begin to make things right'. This was a big win for Disney and Star Wars fans. The new characters are truly memorable and likable. They give it their all and the story itself is an emotional roller-coaster, full of laughs and tears too for those whole hold dear the originals. The climax of the film left me with chills, especially the final shot. It was probably the most powerful moment for me being such a fan of the original trilogy and only serves the anticipation of what lies ahead.",10,16,50,16 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Makes me smile
","It has all been said before, possibly the greatest movie ever made and a film that not only changed the world of cinema but the world itself. Not enough can be said about this film, it's timing or it's undeniable brilliance. Star Wars is simply enchanting from the opening crawl, its mythology is so profound and universal, it has etched itself in both our minds and our hearts. From its warm, cordial and unforgettable characters like Obi Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, its maniacal and ruthless villains like Darth Vader. Not to mention the action, the special effects, the fantastic score (By John Williams) and general 'feel good' moments throughout the duration, this movie really makes me smile.",10,0,0,11 February 2006

It's nowhere near that level so maybe the disappointment is of my own making because I had high expectations going into this.Unfortunately its an average film with some good, some bad and nothing great. The cast was good but the dialogue was too on the nose. Some real cringe-worthy moments that don't work and some shocking deaths in the battle scenes which worked well.Overall it's just watchable. Good to kill two hours but far from Spike Lee's best.",6,0,2,16 June 2020
Sin City," A hypnotic masterwork!
","Frank Miller's Sin City plays more like a comic than a film, but in this case it really gels together providing a hypnotic masterwork. Every frame in this film is art, it's violent, it's nasty and it's beautiful! Robert Rodriguez should be commended for his dedication to the original source material - as notorious as it may be.Sin City is not for everyone, it's very violent and not for the kiddies. It's a berserk noir amped thriller, packed with hard-boiled tough guys and seductive dames in a world where nothing, and I mean nothing is sacred. The film is also packed with many stars, including Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke  whose portrayal as the merciless Marv steals the show.

","This could have been a sci-fi masterpiece. It starts off great, with a seemingly compelling narrative, interesting characters, and thought provoking ideas but as Michael Bay movies go, it soon degenerates into a run of the mill action film, void of any consequential events or meaning.This film was marketed wrong from day one - it gave it all away in the trailers, which was a mistake. There was no mystery to it beyond what we saw in the previews and when it's all said and done, all we're left with is a slick looking action flick, as expected from Michael Bay - with chase scene after chase scene, explosion after explosion and while fun to some, it's been done before and it's been overdone by Michael Bay.I expected better. I'd recommend watching the first act and forgetting the rest but then again if you did that, you wouldn't get to see Scarlett Johansen run in tight suits.",6,0,0,29 April 2006
