Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The western half.
","Firstly, If Kill Bill was supposed to run as a whole film, I think Tarantino would have re ordered the chapters so that the Oren fight comes towards the end - rather than make two identical movies with a linear plot he decided to make two diffeent ones.The first one is a full on kung fu fightfest with spurting blood etc. (it even has the old shaw brothers logo on the front). The second one is not. Not at all. The different presentation should have set that up, at least. No Shaw logo on the front of this one. Hence; it's a completely diffent movie. The difference is a great as that between say, (excuse the simplification) 'Enter the dragon' and 'Once upon a time in the west'. Actually this film's pacing and long shots would be a dead ringer for Leone's masterpiece, except I think it'll be a cold day in hell before Tarantino uses only a halfhour of dialogue in a three hour movie!
So, they're two completely different movies but, when it comes down to it, who cares? Surely, we all know what happens at the end of this movie, so why not appreciate the movie as it is rather then trying to fit it into some mould to make it easier to describe? I preferred the fact it's not more of the same, and despite being a claustrophobe to some extent, enjoyed it all the way through. Especially the training sequences, that were so out of left field you had to love them, and were the only real eastern influence in this (america-set) movie. I would probably have swopped the training here with the Vernita Green section in the first one to keep with the east/west divide, but that's nitpicking.So, what's my point? Dunno, maybe we should view these films as more separate than most people seem to have done. They are completely different and as such, maybe this pair of movies are the most wildly differing original and sequel since the highlander series (though nowhere near as crap as highlander 2. So basically, don't know Vol 2 because it's different. There's nothing more boring than genre sequels (see Speed 2, Under Siege 2, even Die Hard 2 in parts) so enjoy this cross-genre masterpiece while you can. It really needs to be seen in the cinema to really appreciate how uncomfortable everyone gets when a woman is buried alive in front of them, and they're in the coffin.Alec",Null,0,1,29 April 2004
Shaun of the Dead," It's a horror with jokes, not a joke horror.
","The British film industry has been crying out for a decent movie for ages - Curtis is past it, The Office should never be on the big screen... so where on earth are our good movies going to come from?Well, I would cite this movie as the beginning of the a new era of British film - the one where we're original and do action as well; most British films recently have shied away from any action at all above a kind of gangland torture cliche that seems to crop up every five minutes. There is so much about Shaun of the Dead that excels: the comedy is top notch (especially if you, like Shaun, feel you're going nowhere), the zombies are well made up (the only problem with the original Dawn of the Dead was their stupid green make up) and the acting superb.Most importantly though, the actual violence is done so well, it's almost unbelievable this is a British scripted and directed movie. Obviously there's not a lot of pitched gun battles, but it's very refreshing to see a film be this daring this well! Also, I think it's great to see a film so British in nature; not cod cockney gangster rubbish or anything, just genuinely lazy british.If the industry is brave enough, this (along with the slightly less excellent, though very good Dog Soldiers) represents a new wave of British horror. As for the director himself, I'd like him to remember how multiple award winning director Peter Jackson started out: a low budget horror comedy flick called 'Bad Taste' (and then Braindead). Maybe we'll be seeing a lot more of him in the future. I hope so.Finally, talking to people about this movie, I've realised that many people wanted it to be funny all the way through and didn't like the darkness of the last 45 minutes. I disagree wholeheartedly. A horror spoof, with zombies having blunt false teeth or whatever, would be on a par with total vacuous tripe like 'Dracula: Dead and loving it'. A movie like this needs its dark heart to be more than a silly Mel Brooks film! I would say that we should view this film as a horror film with added comedy, not a comedy film with zombies in.In short (and I know I go on forever); this is the best British Film for ten years (American money notwithstanding). Go see it as part of your patriotic duty at least. You won't be disappointed.Remember: It's not what Shaun did, it's that he did anything at all that's important.P.S. It is possible to see this film as a allegorical tale of a man having to grow up and say goodbye to the trappings of childhood (mum, best freind, etc.) to grow up and commit to the woman he loves. But why bother analysing it when it's this much fun?",9,0,1,16 April 2004
The Last Samurai," No, the last samurai is NOT Tom Cruise!!!
","In The Last Samurai, we are treated to a glimpse of the effect that modernisation had on the 'old ways' of the world. We are given just enough of a taste of what things were like that we begin to dread their eventual, inevitable demise. Stealing the show is Ken Watanabe's Samurai general, who starts the movie with a vision of a white tiger fighting for his life - a motif that comes back during his later attempts to sum it up in poetry. This white tiger is revealed to be the deeply damaged American Captain, Nathan Algren. Captain Algren, despite all that you may hear, a wonderful character, and very well played by Tom Cruise (one of the nicest actors I have ever heard of). He is, in my opinion, representative of the conscience of the film; and it's destiny. He is cursed to live on while others may die around him, he is atoning for the sins of his time. He even puts this into words: 'I should have died so many times'. The unlikely escapes throughout the film (yes, there are many) as well as his unerring ability to pick up the ancient art of swordfighting over two seasons are merely, as far as I am concerned, the forces of his destiny at work - he does meet his destiny, but it is not through a death on the battlefield; he achieves it through standing up at last for what he believes in above all else - honour, and acts as a saviour for the honour of the Samurai. As I have said, this is my reading of this film's point - of course he is an unlikely hero, but it not Cruise who is the last samurai; it is Watanabe. Algren is an act of fate - the catalyst for the samurai's salvation and adherence to their code of honour. He is prepared to die but does not fear death, he is told. I believe it is this key issue of Captain Algren's >secondary< role in the events that occur (he sets nothing in motion, remember, until the rescue of the general, so that the general can lead his samurai), that makes the effect of this movie more profound than you would have thought.Having said all that (and there was a lot of it) this is in the end a blockbuster vehicle for it's star. He has so much screen time it's scary, but this is due to the fact that the plot is seen through his eyes and hence we are taken on the same journey he experiences towards his own redemption. That having been said, the casting is entirely wonderful; especially in the samurai camp, though arch 'baddie' Omura is excellent too. I was especially pleased also, to see 'that guy out of ring; you know, the psychic ex husband' in a completely different role as the (sadly) hilariously named 'yujio' - I have worked in computer game sales for a while, so I hope you'll forgive this slur on a perfectly reasonable name. Not a weak acting performance to be found, as far as I'm concerned!It is beautifully, if not particularly innovatively shot, too - a couple of shots smacking (maybe too much) of composition.I do, however, have several complaints to make (hey, what else is the internet for, huh?)I) Too much 'meaningful' dialogue. In a complex movie like this I can't help feeling that some of the dialogue could have done with a once over by the thousands of ghost writers there must be in Hollywood.II) The ending would, I feel, have benefitted greatly from not showing Cruise at all, but fading out the way it came in, on Japan's gorgeous horizon.III) I don't like narration as a means of showing internal dialogue, but I can't suggest a better way of doing it. Maybe I should shut up?IV) The scale of the battle scenes was all messed up (that didn't look like 4000 troops to me coming round the hill!)V) (the big one) WE DON'T NEED A LOVE INTEREST, FOR GOD'S SAKE! I didn't buy this at all. Just unnecessary.I hope you've found my views interesting, I'm always open to discussion. Give us a mail. In conclusion, I would say that it is really worth seeing this film, it won't change your life, or reveal some secrets about the universe to you, but that isn't what going to the movies is all about. You want spectacle, a well shot and acted film, and to share in one man's journey to redemption I would recommend this film with the utmost pleasure.See you later.Algo.P.S. Remember - the use of machine guns at the end foreshadows the changing of warfare forever - no more cavalry charges!",8,0,1,13 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Simply Excellent Movie.
","I have given this movie 10 stars. I never give movies 10 stars.Here's why:Star Wars top 6:1. Empire Strikes Back 2. A New Hope 3. Revenge of the Sith 4. Return of the Jedi 5. Attack of the Clones 6. The Phantom MenaceYes. I preferred it to 'Jedi'. Why? It's braver, no ewoks (though my heart stopped when I heard the wookiees were around), It's real spectacle from start to finish, just like the original trilogy, and it finally gives us what we want; acres of lightsaber action.There are problems, especially in the speed Anakin makes up his mind to follow the emperor (that's not a spoiler; you DO know what happens in episode IV, right?) rather than the Jedi path. But the implication of selflessness in his initial motive hints at his future possible redemption; as with Bilbo Baggins and the One Ring. Plus it's great to see Jimmy Smits getting a paid job.It's Ian McDiarmud who steals the show however, and brings an originally one dimensional character to life.I've just seen it, I'm happier than I've been since the special editions came out in the cinema, maybe I'm overreacting, but if you're worried before seeing this that it might be disappointing. Don't be.However, watch out for one of the laziest and most moment spoiling pieces of dialogue ever. All together now;'NOOOOOOOOO!!!'This one stupid, stupid moment almost ruined the movie!!!!!Good work George, you had me thinking you could write dialogue for a moment with all your emperor and anakin scenes. How wrong I was.I'm off for a calm down after this. Go see it - You'll enjoy it!",10,1,8,19 May 2005
