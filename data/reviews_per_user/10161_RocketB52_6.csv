Saturday Night Fever," A Cultural Dino
","I just watched this again on some channel. . Bravo, maybe.When it first came out I was very young, and actually went under duress because all my other friends wanted to go.Then I had to sit through it again on a flight to Europe. I didn't get it then--I wasn't part of the whole disco culture--and now when I watch it I'm hypnotized, because it's so screamingly dated. The only way I can really view it is as a cultural artifact, which I guess, is exactly what it has become. Since everyone knows the plot by this time, my only observation is that the only really sympathetic character in the story is Tony's brother, who quit the priesthood. Tony's friends are clods, except for the one who's the whiner, Tony's family is repellent, and the only woman in the story that *seems* to have anything resembling self-esteem is a delusional, stuck-up pain in the butt. As for Tony, yeh, he has his likable moments, but for the most part he treats women like crap. One thing that always puzzled me was the casting of Karen Gorney as the girl Tony fixates on. Nothing against the actress, but she's utterly ordinary, and, as the character, totally obnoxious. Tony is a genuine hunk, all right, so why not cast someone as the unattainable girl who really can stop some traffic on the street? I mean, there WERE pretty women in Brooklyn in the 1970s.I've noticed in some of the reviews that the lack of political correctness in the movie seems to be refreshing to a lot of people, so I'll say something that may be politically incorrect: As I watched the camera pan lovingly over the prone figure of John Travolta lying in bed on his stomach, wearing nothing but black briefs, I thought 'Wow, this is gay.' Not that there's anything wrong with that. I understand why this flick appeals to guys on another level. Tony is the ultimate six foot strutting, prancing rooster, a man who knows that any girl he singles out will probably fall on her back and open her legs. And yet he has this streak of sensitivity. But not TOO much sensitivity.As for the music, you either love the Bee Gees and disco or you hate 'em. But I will say I understand why the soundtrack became one of the biggest selling soundtracks of all time.Anyhow, it's worth watching if only for the sheer culture shock.",5,9,16,22 June 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant
","Drug addiction: no frills, no pretty people, no accents to make it seem somehow exotic to us Americans, just unremitting, unvarnished reality, and three hapless souls sinking to oblivion. That's all, folks! And to say it's hard to watch is an understatement. It's like being beaten with a rubber hose on the inside.There are thousands of reviews, so I'll skip the particulars. The cast is superb. How Ellen Bursten did not walk away with an Oscar, I don't know. Maybe it was just too little of a film. What a completely fearless, harrowing performance. You'll never look at a refrigerator the same way again.",10,2,4,10 September 2010
Hostel," Maybe take that next vacation in Palm Springs.
","Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson play Paxton and Josh, two collage grads who are going on a last sex and drug binge through Europe before going back to the US and going into law school and getting trapped in a life of privilege and excess that most people in the world can only dream about. Poor Lads! Who can blame them for wanting to get down with their decadent selves? These two are the classic Ugly Americans.With their brash ways and million $$ mega watt smiles, they stand out among the inhabitants of Eastern Europe like. . .Americans.So, these fellows are assholes.For the first half of the story, it's all fun and games.While back packing it through Europe they encounter a wild and crazy guy named Ole from Iceland, (played by Eythor Gudjonsson, who surely must have studied Steve Martin) and they all embark on an adventure in New Amsterdam. While there, some Euro-trash type points them to a town in Slovakia where when women hear American accents, they fall over on their backs and beg for sex. Sound too good to be true? It is, because this is a horror film, where trips gone horribly wrong rule. Huzzah! We're off on the road to. . well, SOMETHING-vania. And like any country ending in 'vania,' you can bet it's got some nasty pitfalls.At first, it's great. The Hostel, far from being some dirty, dingy little flea trap, is in a gorgeous, building reeking of old European charm, where you MUST have roommates, but it so happens they're female with large breasts who are constantly changing their clothes and urging you to join them in the coed spa downstairs where men and woman can sit around and sweat au natural. Before you know it, they're all in bed together and it seems the boys have found Nirvana. Sound too good to be true? It is, because this is a horror movie, and if someone is having great sex, can a grisly death be far behind? Pretty soon though, they wake up after making the sign of the Two-backed Beast all night long with their sexy (if slightly off girlfriends) minus Ole, and that's when things start to go seriously wrong. Our boys aren't without a conscience or feelings of affection for Ole, so there follows a fruitless search during which Paxton and Josh are drugged by the girls one night at a club. Paxton wakes up on the floor of the bathroom in the club, but the hapless Josh (the more 'sensitive' of the two, on the rebound after a broken love affair) wakes up handcuffed to a chair in what seems to be a filthy dungeon, naked except for his briefs. A man dressed as a surgeon enters the room, says he's always wanted to perform surgery, and you can imagine the rest.In the mean time, Paxton twigs to the fact something is terribly wrong and becomes obsessed with finding his friend. He goes to the police, who of course, do nothing except take note of the missing American and then he reluctantly enlists the aid of the two women, because he simply knows no one else to turn to.Girlfriend leads him directly into the Belly of the Beast, laughingly telling him as he's being dragged away that she'll get great money for him.He is dragged through the dungeon, where he gets (along with with us) subliminal glimpses of people in different rooms being horribly mutilated. He is chained to a chair, in a room, and we know he is destined to get the same treatment as his friend.But no--what follows is an immensely satisfying turning of the tables by Paxton, an exhilarating escape, and The Revalation: It wasn't all just pointless torture. It was an outfit run by an organization called Elite Hunting. For many thousands of dollars you can slowly or quickly kill a person of the nationality of your choice. Americans are the biggest prizes and the most costly of all victims: $25,000.Paxton's escape is damned exciting. . .I was cheering so hard for him I was having trouble staying in my seat.All the reviews of this movie I've read say you can't root for Paxton and Josh, but I disagree totally. Yes, they're assholes, but lots of people are assholes at 21 years of age. And I disagree that they're unredeemable assholes. Josh has a sort of sweet, forlorn quality, and Paxton actually ends up doing a heroic turn at the end of the story. When he could have escaped, free and clear, he hears the screams of an Asian girl being tortured. He goes back down into the slaughter house, kills he tormentor, and brings her out. YES!! That's our boy!. . .although not before performing some interesting eye surgery.I've also read that the movie is misogynistic. I disagree again.This movie takes a dim view of everyone: men, women AND children. Wait until you meet the darling little gang of street kids.The production values are very nice, the cast is unknown (at least to me) and very good, and there's a nice feeling of paranoia throughout. Almost everyone the Americans meet is in on the plot to process people through the killing machine.Oh..and I think the hype is over done. I actually went in nervous, thinking I was going to see things I'd not seen before. It didn't happen, even though I was highly entertained.Also, there is a disturbing political subtext in the flick. You can read into it or not, it may or may not have been intended, but it is most definitely there. You can't help leaving the theater thinking, 'Holy crap--are we THAT disliked by the world now?' Make of it what you may. . .and check it out.",8,2,3,16 January 2006
Mamma Mia!," The cinematic equivalent of water boarding
","Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut to the chase.Forced frivolity. Miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep gives it a great try. Pierce Brosnan just plain embarrassing. Inexplicably set on a Greek Island. Lots of squealing, shrieking women. Lots.It was a silly juke box musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen juke box musical. If you like ABBA, so-so. If not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight? Ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have GREAT night out on the town? That's the feeling of this whole project. It just felt so good when it stopped.",2,110,186,24 July 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Not a Feel Good Movie But Worth Every Moment
","The predominant theme of this fable is the impermanence of life and the loss we suffer because of it. If you've read anything about Eastern religion, you will be very familiar with the ideas of impermanence and the futility of trying to hang on to anything, but as Westerners, some of us may be unprepared for the way this theme slowly creeps over us during this story. After thirty minutes in, I realized I was in for a hard ride emotionally.This is one of the most lovely and melancholy movies I have ever sat through. The story is narrated by both Benjamin and the love of his life, Daisey, while she is on her death bed in a New Orleans hospital, with the help of Ben's diary. And a very bad storm is on the way.I have heard comparisons of this movie to Forrest Gump. No, no, no and no. I'm not denying Hanks was good in the film, but it was totally contrived. Ben isn't present at a dozen history making events. In fact, the beauty of Ben's life is its simplicity.Ever since I first heard of the premise of Benjamin Button, I wondered this: What happens to him in the end? Sure, aging backwards sounds great at first, and it is. 80. . . 70. . .60. . .50. . .40. . .30. . .20. . .then what? The human brain becomes fully mature at 20 or so, and at its peak at around 21 or 25. Beyond that, what happens to Ben? At some point he will start to lose his life memories, not because his brain is degenerating, but because it is devolving, along with the rest of him. In stead of being able to accumulate more and more knowledge, or even hang onto it, that knowledge, along with all those memories, will just . . .go. They'll evaporate. Just who will he be at ten? At five? Will he devolve into a infant, a fetus, then. . .what, pop out of existence? What a horrible fate. More horrible than old age, really, because my grandfather died at 94, with all his faculties and memories intact. He could add a column of numbers faster than I could enter them into a calculator and used gloat over this. He died quickly, of a stroke, one day. And so it is. Ben simply regresses into childhood, with no memory of his great love, his encounter with a German submarine, his adopted mother, his friends, his own daughter, or anything at all. And it's not a blissful forgetting. Ben is frightened and confused as a child, sometimes hostile, full of behavioral problems arising from the strange shadows in his consciousness. Somewhere in the corner of his brain is the phantom of an entire existence, but what was it? He doesn't know. He can never know. He experiences a kind dementia, then devolves to a toddler. As an infant his little body simply fails, and he mercifully dies in the arms of his devoted ex-wife, then an old woman. 'He opened his eyes at the end, and looked at me. And I knew he knew *who* I was.'Technically, the movie is a marvel, and Brad Pitt turns in a very understated and heartfelt performance. But you won't be marveling at the backwards aging Brad Pitt, you'll be immersed in the unfolding of Ben's life, the wonderful fable of the backwards running clock supposedly installed in New York's Grand Central Station, and the final image of Huricane Katrina's rising water, washing away the artifacts of a life.",9,1,3,5 February 2009
Into the Wild," Angry Young Man Goes to Alaska
","Maybe the older I get, the less patience I have with people who do  willfully, stupid things.  Having said that, I can't fault the acting or direction of this film.  The cast is very good, Penn obviously knows how to direct his actors,  the vistas are magnificent.  The problem for me is, the central character is someone who is smart  enough to know better, but goes ahead and does the stupid thing anyway.  I try to chalk it up to youth, but the scope of the lead character's  stupidity is so great, I find myself unable to do it. OK, I think.  Maybe when I was 21, I would have done something like that, given his  family life. But the answer always comes back, 'Hell, no. I wasn't even  that stupid at twelve.'   Christopher McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch ) has a mommy and daddy  (played by Marcia Gay Hardon & William Hurt) who fought a lot while he  was growing up. That's unfortunate. He graduates college and decides  most people lead empty lives. Hey, what a concept. And because he must  have a tremendous amount of rage towards mom and dad, he decides to  hell with it all, tears up his credit card and money or gives it away (  OK, that's kind of cool ) , and thinks, screw it! He's going on the  road! A free spirit! What is his ultimate goal? Alaska! Why? Who knows?  Maybe it's because that's as far away as he can get from mom and dad,  who despite the fact they fought like cats and dogs, are totally  anguished over the disappearance of their son. Who never, never tells  them where he went, or communicates with them once. He never even tells  his sister, the person he supposedly loves, what he intends to do. So  he's not just stupid, he's unforgiving. Yay.  So this over privileged, clueless 21 year old with a liking for Thoreau  & Byron (who probably wouldn't have been caught dead in Alaska, at  least, not THAT unprepared) sets off on his trek for a very cold place,  and on the way, behold, he encounters a bunch of colorful eccentrics,  whose lives he touches, briefly and magically, and then he flits away,  because he is, after all . .a free spirit. Evidently, someone has  neglected to tell Chris the 1960s are over, because he even gives  himself a wifty, 1960s name: Super Tramp.   Eventually, Chris gets to Alaska, and the guy who drops him off as far  into the wilderness as he'll dare to go says to him, 'I'll see you in  the spring, if you're still alive.' Does that faze Chris? No, because  someone kind of, SORT of told him how to smoke moose meat. The wonders  of nature await! Besides, all he has to do is cross that little creek.  Of course, during the spring melt, the thing becomes a raging river,  trapping him on the what turns out to be the wrong side of where he  should be. Oops.  He finds an abandoned bus to live in, and botches smoking his moose  meat, because maggots take over VERY quickly. Not to worry! He's got  his little 'Local Flora and Fauna' book, so he can live off fruits and  roots and plants that aren't poisonous. Except he really sucks at using  the book and he DOES end up eating a highly toxic plant, and in his  starved condition, he doesn't last too much longer after that. He is so  sick at the end even a grizzly bear turns his nose up at him.  I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy? He was just as self indulgent  and selfish as the world he choose to reject, and being clueless,  nature culled him from the herd. End of story.",3,10,19,9 May 2009
