Black Swan," Natalie Portman deserved the Oscar for this movie. Movie=5stars. Female version of Psycho.
","I think that Natalie Hershlag (I prefer her original name) reached almost the perfection on the recitation of the character assigned to her. The recitation of all actors is excellent on this movie. The plot is good, directing is good, the narration and story line are a bit weak.***spoiler***The main character interpreted by Natalie has hallucinations, her obsession to be perfect for an IMPERFECT ROLE killed her by herself. That's the spirit of the movie. The message is that goodness doesn't match technical perfection. The goodness or evilness are independent from perfection. So the character obsessed to play the perfection about the other evil role decides to kill the good part of her killing herself because of the fear to be not able to play the bad role. The fear she feels, generates hallucinations where both environment and people can represent menaces to her aim although the real enemy is herself.... so killing her opponent she kills herself. End of the movie and end of the white swan.",Null,0,0,27 June 2017
Lone Survivor," pathetic & absurd
",Imagine people roll down from a mountain surviving to the continuously hurts on the hard rocks. It's an insult to the people who tragically died on the mountains. Peter Berg wants to make this movie realistic by big exaggerations which make it so stupid in order to provide that heroism which plagues idiots to the absurdity. That's not navy seals but stupidity.,1,1,8,12 March 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," the best on this movie is Darth Vader
","This movie wants to appear plausible but in vain.
Problems are the structure of the movie in general, and the usual succession of events too fast to make the characters reliable, furthermore there are too much apparent stupid choices, such as:
1) the imperial pilot traitor has long hair and beard;
2) the protagonist becomes the lead of resistance since the second meeting of rebellion;
3) the imperial regime could finish the Death Star but needs the help of a rebel scientist who makes the death star faulty. It's obvious;
4) the appearance of the rebel soldiers infiltrated is not plausible (they appear as rebels): 'cutting both beard and the hair so to appear as an imperial soldier'. As I said too fast events to make the movie plausible.
5) the movie is too much linked to the past narrative structure to be original - the viewer recognize this weakness so to be annoyed from it.
Another big flaw regards the possibility to introduce the original deleted scenes during the capture of the rebel cargo by the Imperial star destroyer when Luke observes the light in the sky of the fight as well as the dialogue between Luke and Biggs (you can see it on youtube) which would have enhanced the past events matching well between the Rogue One and A New Hope episodes in a wonder way.
I save only the final battle in the space although the absurd believer-fighter of rebellion who is not shot by imperial soldiers just because he repeats a stupid litany.
These reasons make both the storytelling and the directing mediocre as well, persuading me that by now Star Wars franchise is able only to give nausea to an illusory hope.",1,0,6,7 October 2018
Creed," One of the best movie since last 30 years
","I've just seen this movie and I can say that is one of the best movie ever made. It is a great movie because it tales about a great story which is much more human than just of boxing. People hurting this movie like stupid shooter movie just to get easy emotional drug. As far as me, the best of Balboa franchise probably equally to the first one of the whole series.",10,0,0,10 May 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," the usual story of 8 hours reduced because of deadline
","When too much events are summarized in short time, the movie is penalized. So that, many good plots suffer of this bad habit. The reason is simple: no respect for the viewer, just profit. The solution is to divide the movie in episodes as the comics do. However hollywoodian CEOs are too dumb to understand this solution, in order to avoid to scam viewers with the misrepresentation of good plots reduced in a mediocrity way. The other solution is to make extended releases of the movies via blu-ray, and or an extended releases for the cinemas.",3,4,7,14 July 2019
BlacKkKlansman," too many flaws for a good idea.
","The idea is good but the movie shows too many flaws since the beginning. Some example.
The policeman infiltrates a Black Panther group without any information about them. The policeman casually infiltrates the KKK after reading on a paper an announcement in clear words. During the first encounter, the KKK ask for not calling the organization as ku klux klan for reasonable reservedness reasons (on the paper this denomination was clearly highlighted). On the first meeting with some of the KKK members, one of them suspects the new member is an infiltrated but he doesn't control him to verify his suspects. After these last contradictions I decided for ending the movie avoiding to waste my time as well.",4,1,6,15 May 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," First half 10 stars second half 5/6 stars
","The first half of the movie is perfect in plot, relationship between characters, characters developments and their psychology, it's a very smart and natural story. The second half of the movie begins to appear fragmented and less coherent omitting some phases; seems that Captain is forced to survive otherwise the story cannot happy ends. Ending is too much obvious and sometimes the movie seems to loose all the intelligence of first half: example (SPOILER): the evil boss has the possibility to defeat all opponents but he waits allowing black widow to spread secret informations. Evil boss easy eliminates some secondary opponents but gives enough time the heroes to react. It's so stupid. I wonder as directors don't understand how much is stupid villains stop to act allowing heroes to prevail... Reality should give the hero a small opportunity, so to make a movie REALISTIC and credible. Other HUGE error: the combat areas lack of MILITARY FORCES... there are only CAPTAIN, Black Widow and Falcon... a great battle, huge destructions, but none knows what is happening (this is so stupid!). The first half a director, second half a different director and story maker.",6,0,1,2 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," stupid movie to scam idiots.
","This movie is made just for easy money. I really think that Abrams as person be a cretin. Probably to attract other cretins some other cretins are necessary. Now imagine some proud heroes ride horses on a Star Destroyer into the space. Imagine, you can. If a viewer can justify this idiocy, it means that idiots are always happy to be defrauded by scammers. Aren't you tired to be used as useful idiots!?",1,13,21,30 December 2019
Captain America: Civil War," probably the best marvel movie I have ever seen till now.
","This movie has amazing me. It is full of good never exaggerated action, based on plan, cooperation, execution and consequences on people, relationship and soul deepening the humanity of the protagonists. The plot is the real winner of the movie for its involvement due to the relationship between the several characters, their stories and their mysteries. A really smart movie directed by the duo brothers which have almost realize their best movie since 'Captain America: the winter soldier', movie that I reviewed distinguishing the first perfect part from the second half of it which appears to be less coherent. However this specific movie worth to be watched because it is a rare masterwork in the usual stupidity which affects holliwood standards. Surely, I will see it again also if I'm sure that some parts of the movie has been deleted because of runtime and I would like they were integrated in an extended cut though. I suggest everyone to see Avengers: Civil War.",10,0,2,5 April 2018
Independence Day," the worst movie ever to scam viewers

It's so stupid, illogical, mediocre, poor, senseless, that it makes a simple cartoon the best thing to see as substitute.I saw it to make a favor to my friend, ever regret to make this mistake, so great that today I must yet regret it....I only remember that people in the cinema after 10 minutes of this movie laughed because of the high stupidity of it.This movie is only a scam against public which circumvents by the ignorance besides taking advantage of naive people...The power of marketing... so I have decided to never see any movie of this director: once I can be circumvented, twice no...

Batman Begins," REALISTIC, BATMAN (flying wings)
","The best Batman movie ever made! The story is amazing and dynamic with a very articulated plot like a sort of puzzle well composed (it's the art of director!!). The interpretation of actor is skillful, above all that one of Christian Bale, so softly deep, and that one of Cillian Murphy (he appears to me a real crazy megalomaniac ; )). There is a good choice of not killing super-criminal (the Scarecrow) in the same episode, allowing a continuity with future stories (good very good). This is realistic, human, psychological, introspective movie with a particular attention about little feelings: a masterpiece!!! Because of this circumstances, it's complete work! I hope for other similar!PS: Christopher Nolan is a great director! note: there is only 3 little logical neglected particular!!!",9,2,2,31 July 2006

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Human vs Human evolution
","Good interpretation of the actors: 9;Good special effects: 9;Good story: 9;Best human character: Cesar;Action: not prevail as importance (good).This movie shows that apes in their evolution became more human than human beings have regressed. Important is the phase between oppression and rebellion: the awareness acquired through intelligence of their state of slaves. It's an excellent movie which contains a meaning very deep for all people of earth: when people wake up from darkness imposed by unscrupulous and greedy individuals, they will emanate the LIGHT OF REVOLUTION.The only negative note I feel to observe is the easier way apes destroy scientific centre's windows... it would be impossible to break down a bulletproof door or window ( I prefer realism to exaggeration).",9,4,8,26 September 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," Excellent but....
","This movie is very good about the general epic story matching the several characters together so to get the confrontation of the two factions. The most intriguing aspect concerns with the plan Thanos want to realize whose psychology is the most prominent. Thanos is a strategic powerful character leaded by the aim he consider good for univers' population, that is to deliver death so to get the balance. The event begins after the Asgardian defeat from Thanos army and then the facts follows each others rapidly until the mysterious end towards whom the disappear of Nick Fury represents the epilogue. Now all in this movie seems good and addictive and it seems to evoke the Lord of Rings, it only seems evoke without realize the same greatness because of deadline: the run-time. When too much situations have to be narrated in 2 and a half hours the result is not so great as it would be possible to get. Here where the 10 stars are reduced to 9 stars restored by the whole plot which acts as fix. The directors are one of the best choice in the whole directing options and probably they deserve the real tribute which would make this movie great but their work would deserve better outcome, if they could have developed the movie taking benefit of much more time so to get the same result of The Lord of The Rings. I hope that a 4 hours release can be commercialized in the market.",9,1,4,1 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 8 stars just because this movie appears to have cut scenes and because of the stupid portrait of Bruce.
","Good movie, excellent recitation. It's a pity that Nicholas Hammond has not get an Oscar for his extraordinary performance. Another problem on this movie. Many of the characters Tarantino describes are stereotyped. So Bruce Lee doesn't appear as Bruce Lee is, but as many of Chinese Bruce Lee's characters he played in his movies before the Enter the Dragon character which is a bit different from its predecessors. So it seems that Tarantino ridicules Bruce Lee which deserves a lot of respect as a person rather than just as a martial artist. A severe error Tarantino made on Bruce that I hope he will fix with a movie about Bruce Lee.",8,0,1,8 May 2020
Black Hawk Down," soldiers make stupid jokes during the battle, stopping themselves under attack to ask: 'how are you'?
","Scott tries to match a blockbuster to a real event making the movie a misrepresentation of the facts getting them ridiculous. The positive of the movie is that it shows the wrong way military center managed an easy operation making it a mess. In that context, the prisoners have to be evacuated by helicopters which are much quicker and can overtake enemies at high altitude avoiding to expose ground troops to the attack of overwhelming forces. If you want a quick operation you have to use quick means. The US troops were unable to face the close in fighting because they were exposed to the fire of unnumbered enemies so to be highly vulnerable during the operation inside the hostile territory.",2,2,10,19 August 2019
Joker," This smart movie proves that Hollywood parameters to make stupid movies in order to get big profit is wrong.
","This is a psychological movie with a bit of action which lasts over 3 hours that is able to entertain the viewers with a good story, few exaggerations, a strong character and well done realism. So Joker doesn't match the typical parameters Hollywood issues movies to get a lot of money. Among the several weaknesses in the movie there is above all the monopolization of the main character of the whole narration, so the other characters appear to be just extras, beside the stupid way the police try to get the criminal of some homicides to the arrest. Also the final epilogue appears to be a bit stupid forcing the character to the ability of the killing: a dangerous criminal doesn't stay alone with another person which risks because of his savagery. People want smart movies because smart movies are much more entertaining and interesting. If smart and meaningful movies don't get money the main cause is a marketing responsibility.",7,0,2,8 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," the happy ending of the movie is pathetic and absurd
",The happy ending of the movie is pathetic and absurd wasting the whole story. The classic hero dies but absorbing the vital fluid of the enemy returns an happy period where the army is prepping the attack when the enemy is already defeated. What stupid and absurd ending!,3,1,3,28 March 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Just one 'big' mistake: too short. This movie should have been last 240 minutes to be perfect.
","This movie is too short in order to appreciate the whole beauty of its direction, environment, recitation, film script, choreography. Branagh has sacrificed the storytelling to the pace of the movie which only a careful beholder can guess.This movie is based on details and every detail is important so to understand the relationship of cause and aftermath. A mistake that was not made in Joker movie with Phoenix. So, there is an extended release of this movie I hope that will be issued in the market which would offer the right tribute that this masterpiece deserves to be complete. I hope that this mistake will be avoided in the next episode. There is just another error in the movie: some characters dress light clothes to be in a snowy iced mountain. Branagh has found its perfect tuning with the cinema by this character and the environment he plays. He offers a representation of Hercules Poirot astonishing almost metaphysical in its concreteness.",9,0,9,24 March 2020
Prometheus," easy MONEY: this movie is stupid it's a SCAM.
","This movie follows Hollywood criteria: made only to steal easy money. Plot is simple: may a terrestrial engineer kills an alien engineer by an ax? No. The sci-fi terrestrial engineer needs to give birth to an anti-alien engineer before. stupid psychodrama devoid of consistency. The movie has not (real) clues, but only tricks to distract and scam viewers from the STUPID plot. 'We create gods or gods create us?' There are no gods only killer-dogs and victims. This movie is ridiculous assuming viewers are IDIOTS. direction: 0; plot: 0; acting: 1; coherence: 0; ....: 0.'Lost' in space.Hollywood ruins directors (Scott, Cameron)... I hope in Christoper Nolan (also if latest 2 Dark Knight episodes followed Hollywood criteria).",1,4,8,7 July 2014
Wonder Woman," bad script. Cliché story.
","It is not about Wonder Woman but Supergirl. This hero appears to be strong as Superman. The usual script where Germans are evil and Americans and British are goods. The super trained and strong Amazon risks to be killed because of distraction making killed her trainee so easily that the viewer could ask itself how she can be so strong against the super villain. By the way, bad acting. Germans talk English and the military team which infiltrate the enemy camp is ridiculous to be acceptable. A trick to make funny a movie.",3,4,8,5 April 2020

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," the problem: Loise Lane character.
","Imagine the most ingenious character in the Superman universe defeated because of Loise Lane underestimation on the impact of her revelations, after having planned a huge superb intrigue unveiled to the famous journalist (why?). You can. The movie is excellent until Batman is going to kill Superman, since then it becomes so pathetic in its predictable events to make me unsatisfied. The variation of my plot considers that Batman actually provides the Superman elimination because of Luthor's plan, but once he understands his evil idea and the severe aftermath, he tries to repair his mistake removing the spear from Superman body which he controls into a sarcophagus with minimal sign of life, so to fight Doomsday together Superman once he recovers his strength in order to sacrifice his life to save the world from the dangerous menace. Loise Lane character has really ruined the whole DC franchise in my opinion. As it is possible to see, she will be fundamental to calm a revived Clark Kent in the sequel.
What is wrong in my opinion: she acts as a Fate. She is already great as journalist, it is not necessary made her as Zeus. Another issue to note in each movie about Superman. Clark Kent has the face of Superman, no director has imagined he could change the color of his hair and eyes so to mask himself using his powers. So the viewer of this movie sees Batman able to recognize Diana Prince as Wonder Woman but unable to recognize superman as Clark Kent.",5,2,6,16 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," finally FANsmoney defrauded have DESTROYED STARWARS.
",A MOVIE SO STUPID BASED ON STUPIDITY. 'For idiots only': should have been the advertisement. 'We WANT ONLY YOUR MONEY thanks to your stupidity' Greedy makes people idiots... so Lucas began to ruin Star wars since the Return of the Jedi with little furry puppets able to face imperial army by arrows and spears. Then Lucas followed with a little child able to destroy a whole separatist frigate with a never managed tiny fighter and a simple shot (note that the 'heroes' are always invulnerable and luckiest despite of enemies described always as imbeciles). All made to make easy money by marketing which takes advantage from emotional suggestions to sell stupid illusions considering viewer as IDIOTS. Finally Abrams arrived completing the dark plane of the Sith lord: the complete destruction of Star Wars icon so to make easy money selling a fascinating charming absolutely VOID to the dummies.The way to scam people strikes again.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," overrated: the only good part of the movie is the severus memories
","This story appears to be without any inspiration: a story forced to end.
Issues:
1) Voldemort has enough power to destroy all but he prefers to talk waiting to be destroyed;
2) Potter has to die to kill Voldemort but survive. Forced happy end;
3) Neville survives all attacks because of fortune so to kill the nasty monster: ridiculous;
5) the movie has too much negative aspects.The story should have been good if Severus had faced Voldemort to defeat him so to avoid Harry Potter's death. This choice would have been very surprising.The positive: a reason to avoid to see the previous episodes and to avoid to read the books.",2,2,5,11 December 2018
Alien: Covenant," The latest 20 minutes of INSANE STUPIDITY destroy the whole good movie.
","Ridley Scott was going to realize one of his best movie but at the end he followed the stupid Hollywood criteria making it absolutely STUPID. I don't know if Ridley Scott be an idiot or some other management producer be idiot but Scott has been able to kill its own movie with STUPID CHOICES. This movie starts much more smart than its bad, ugly, stupid predecessor, from which Scott chose to consider viewers in the usual idiotic manner because marketing system scam people to get easy money. After negative criticisms to the Prometheus stupid movie, he decides to rectify its venal choice at least until the latest 20 minutes of Aliens covenant. The scientists appear to be more realistic, more human, more introspective, there is much more philosophy in this movie so to explain the reason of the evil plan of David: the droid wants to be as GOD is. Initially the only unreal event concerns with the cargo meets the Paradise Planet in the whole UNIVERSE for a pure coincidence: they casually coast that precise Planet ('OK IT'S A MOVIE' and I assume Scott considers viewers as idiots from which to get easy money'). The story evolves and the crew decides to visit the Planet also because of the mystic feelings of a sort of priest (it's not easy to accept this unreasonable motivation since science is based on verifiable data, however the viewer can accept this fideistich anomaly which differs from not only with science but also with Faith). So the tragedy begins.... the crew on the planet is decimated because of terrible events up to the glorification of David's plan through which he generates the famous Alien of 1979.... this Alien is very lethal so that the viewer imagines that this creature can eat all those weak humans if not the good Walter would be able to save them both from the evil David brother and from his terrible beast. That's not the case: wonder woman appears after many tears and insecurities armed by an ax flying between the space and the rescue spaceship so nimbly. She has no longer tears and insecurities for the beast but she has THE AX.... After this situation the viewers can think: 'f...k the ax, I hope the alien eats the ax and its owner'. Unfortunately No: the AX WINS because it is the best weapon in the entire sci-fi universe, so the beast succumbs being grabbed by a mechanical vise. Almost the whole crew has been 'deleted', only 2 survivors are able to reach the main cargo where two other pilot members were inside on board the mother ship; these last members think that it is a good idea to make a shower having sex, indeed, they are so placid after all those terrible events happened on the inhospitable planet (the viewers could think during this unreal scene: «now Jason or Freddy Kruger appears so to kill the two members of the space cargo in the shower using the cleaver or the knives glove»)... obviously they have lost all their friends, so they want to have a shower and above all they desire to have sex due to happiness, isolating themselves from the 2 survivors without asking them what happened on the planet terror, without asking for their friends showing their sadness for the terrible departure of those dear persons. 'Incredibly 'JASON' REALLY APPEARS behind the shower and kill both of them.... until WONDER WOMAN intervenes again pushing out the spaceship the most terrible beast a human being could meet'. How these last 20 minutes may have ruined a good movie, only Ridley Scott can know ('Hollywood criteria') unveiling the reason of these stupid choices in the sequel of this bad episode. The real mediocre fact of Alien covenant is not the movie, but it is the decision to make unreal what initially was credible and good. This movie is better than Prometheus but the final is the worst shame a viewer could bear to see.",1,45,91,14 May 2017
V for Vendetta," Dangerous... for politicians and their tyranny: REAL DEMOCRACY
","This movie is very dangerous because reveals a secret to people about what DEMOCRACY means and implies. First of all the movie investigates about a person, a strange individual with a mask... and people can ask: who is he? and why his mask? the answer is what realized 'V'... the evil of power and corruption of tyranny. Tyranny uses the propaganda to mask itself differently in confront of the community by which has legitimized itself. And that's the DECEPTION. What is the DECEPTION!? Some greedy individuals abuse of the power that own to PEOPLE. PEOPLE IS THE REAL POWER. So 'V' will use the TV to remember the people what power really is, giving an appointment at V of November. Who is 'V' really? 'V' represents the power of people... he is not a terrorist at all, but he unveils the REAL TERRORIST which owns THE POWER ('because every terrorist is against DEMOCRACY and against people'). The female protagonist will reveal to attendances who 'V' really is at the the end of the movie. The truth is that the power cannot be demanded to be Democracy, because DEMOCRACY IS THE POWER OF PEOPLE and without direct responsibility about this power, people cannot be FREE. This is 'V'. 'V' is the IMPERIUM POTESTAS, the real power of humankind community. The truth is that without RESPONSIBILITY human beings cannot be free, every tyrant will mystify his imperium with the delegation replacing the will of people with its own will. This movie is very dangerous because unveils what politicians really are (greedy unscrupulous businessmen of life) telling a bad truth: you live a lie until few individuals will make choices instead of you.",10,0,2,5 September 2011
