Requiem for a Dream," Drugs and Depression
","Requiem for a Dream is about a man, with his two friends and his mother. It shows that drugs are very bad.It is made in 2000. It is a Drama/Psychological thriller. It runs for 1h 50m. It stars Jared Leto.The plot of the movie is fluid and the things that happen in the movie are regularly sudden. The scene where the main character and his friends take drugs is regularly repeated and is a very visually appealing scene. It has 3 separate stories about the main characters mother, him and his best friend and his girlfriend.The acting in the movie is great. The main characters are talented and make the movie more depressing. You can see the despair in the movie, and there is a lot of it.I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a depressing film with drugs in it.",9,0,0,25 June 2020

Akira," A complicated Film
","It is hard to understand what is going on and it could have been good as a mini series - rather than a film.
It has a loose plot and random things happen in it that are unexplained.
It is fun to watch and interesting.",6,1,1,12 April 2020
Hot Fuzz," Hot Fuzz is good
","Hot fuzz is about a police officer who moves to a town in the countryside. Weird murders happen in the town, disguised as accidents and no one thinks they are suspecious.Hot Fuzz is an Action, Comedy, Mystery Thriller. It is written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. It stars Simon Pegg (Nicholas Angel) and Nick Frost ( PC Danny Butterman) it came out in 2007.The plot is fine. It is a bit slow and cautious. The camera angles are not too extreme and are practical.The acting is fluid and goofy. The Simon Pegg plays a likable and serious man. Nick Frost is funny and goofy, so they contrast well. The main character feels often shocked when something usually happens in the town and his fellow police officers don't so this shows that he is not used to the town. The dialogue is choppy and crisp. It is also quick. This movie makes a lot of references to Action/Thriller movies.The problem that is unresolved in this move is that the main character still can't balance his home/work life, by the end of it.",8,0,0,25 June 2020

Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Funny and Heartwarming
","This movie is about a former boy band member, trying to make it solo. It is a Mockumentary.It stars, the writer of the film Andy Samberg.The movie is entertaining and very funny. Andy Samberg does very well in his roll. The jokes are great and a bit silly. The music in the film is quite funny as well.
