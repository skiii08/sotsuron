Skyfall," Skyfall OK Bond outing but not as great as its predecessors
","Craig - AMAZING as always and GREAT. The best 'Bond' ever. Dench - GREAT. The little lady has balls. That's a compliment. Bardem - ALMOST GREAT but a bit too much like Heath Ledger's Joker. Fiennes - GREAT. Best I've seen him in years. Harris - AMAZING and GREAT. She should be a superstar. Whishaw - Not sold on him. Young computer genius is a bit clich√©d.Purvis/Wade/Logan - Turned out a script that plays like a Fleming novel.Mendes - Tighten it up, man! Not bad, but a bit slow and plodding! This is a BOND film!Skyfall - An OK Bond outing, but not as good as either of Craig's previous outings as 007. CASINO ROYALE remains the best of the three.QUESTION - Why confuse the series timeline with the DB5? Bond won the DB5 from Dimitrios in a poker game featured in CASINO ROYALE. Now, in SKYFALL, an exact DB5, same year and color, but with gadgets, is featured as a ha-ha tip of the hat to Connery's Bond and his films like THUNDERBALL and GOLDFINGER.Is the viewer to assume that two DB5's exist in this Bond's universe? Or is the viewer to ignore Bond acquiring the car in Craig's first Bond movie?ANOTHER QUESTION - The climax takes place in Scotland, but there's no way that M is smart enough or Bond is not Bondian enough to get help from MI6 even on home soil? I found that to be a stretch--too much of a stretch that spoiled my suspension of disbelief.We needed a scene showing help on the way, with maybe Moneypenny, Q, Tanner, and/or Mallory watching the events at Skyfall via satellite, knowing that the helo with the troops will not arrive on time. Therefore, Bond and M are forced to MacGyver it up at the estate. Help arrives as M dies, of course.My Opinion: CASINO ROYALE - 5 stars - One of the best films ever made. QUANTUM OF SOLACE - 4 stars - A very good Bond film. SKYFALL - 3 stars - A good Bond film with some disappointing aspects.",Null,3,9,9 November 2012
