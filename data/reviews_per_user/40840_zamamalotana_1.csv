Hereditary," Absolutely stunning movie!
","A very interesting movie that captures the feeling of anxiety and fear. An expected creation from A24 - Studios. To some it wouldn't be considered a Horror flick, well that is in, what could be considered horror in current - times? 'Gorey & bloody?'. No this is more of a captivating drama a classic horror flick if you may. Clean picture and straight forward setting. Tony Collette's acting is just sublime and I believe she was deserving of an Oscar. Good movie solid 9/10.",9,2,4,26 December 2019
