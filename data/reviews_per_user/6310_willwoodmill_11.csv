Vertigo," Alfred Hitchcock's magnum opus
","Alfred Hitchcock was a creative genius, he was able to play his audience like a piano. Few people have done so much developing the cinematic language as Alfred Hitchcock, he had so many experimental and original ideas, like shooting one film in one long uncut shot, (Rope) or having the whole film take place in one room. (Rear Window) But his greatest contribution to film is easily Vertigo, and Vertigo is one of the best films ever made. Vertigo is about a retired detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson (played by Hitchcock favorite, Jimmy Stewart in probably his second best performance), who has a crippling fear of heights after a near death experience. One day Scottie is contacted by an old friend of his, this friend is the head of a major shipping company, and hires Scottie to follow his wife. Not because he suspects her of cheating, he makes that very clear to Scottie, but because she has been acting strange going out on long drives and then not being able to tell him were she went. Scotties friends wife, Madeleine Elster, is played by Kim Novak, who does on excellent job as a classic Hitchcock blonde. As Scottie continues to investigate this strange case, he discovers an unsettling story as he falls in love with her.Vertigo is based of a French novel called, D'Entre Les Mortes, or The Living and the Dead, written by Boileau-Narcejac the French writing collaboration, that wrote the book that the film Les Diaboliques, and wrote the screen play for the film Eyes Without A Face, both of which are fantastic films that I highly recommend you check out, but neither of those are as mind-blowing as Vertigo. The story structure is very similar, but what gives Vertigo its edge is Hitchcock's flawless direction, he knows how to perfectly direct the cast, and control what the audience is seeing. But Hitchcock is not the only one who knocks it out of the park in Vertigo, Vertigo is a tour de force, every single member of the cast and crew is giving the best they got, the cinematography done by Robert Burks (who collaborated with Hitchcock several times) is mind-blowing and even invented the famous 'Vertigo shot.' The score done by Bernard Hermann (who scored some of the best films of all time like Citizen Kane, and Taxi Driver) may just be the greatest film score ever, I highly recommend you listen to it separate from the film some time because it can stand on its own, but even with how great the score is, Hitchcock was smart enough to not use it in certain scenes, like climax, it would just be an unneeded edition. As the film progresses the audience begins to learn about why Madeleine Elster acts the way she does, the more disturbing the film becomes, I won't spoil what's going on, but it is incredibly creepy and executed in such a way that it is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine. Probably the scariest part in the film is a montage, dream sequence that takes place 2/3s of the way through the film, this dream sequence gave me nightmares the first time I saw it, and still does every time I re-watch Vertigo. When you talk about 'the greatest films of all time' Vertigo is often mentioned in that conversation. And in the 2012 sight & sound poll (the best film poll in my opinion) Vertigo kicked Citizen Kane out of the first place spot, this is the first time this has happened in the 60 years that the poll has been taking place. And while I don't think it's better than Citizen Kane it's hard to get mad when it's replaced with such a great, influential, important film. This whole review I've been struggling to put just how good Vertigo is, into words. But I don't think anyone ever could. It's a film that is so very deep, complex, and original that you would need to go through the whole film shot by shot, frame by frame, (Roger Ebert actually did this) before you could really describe it. No matte how many times you watch you will always discover something new about it. It is a film that feels like you're watching it for the first time, every time you re-watch it. Vertigo is one of those films that I wish I could give an 11/10, but unfortunately IMDb doesn't give me that option, so I guess I won't.10/10",10,4,6,16 February 2016
The Babadook," A flawed but scary modern horror film
","The Babadook is a 2014 horror film directed by Jennifer Kent. (It's actually the feature length debut for Kent) The Babadook tells the story of Amelia, (played by Essie Davis.) a single mother struggling to raise her constantly disobeying child, Samuel. (played by Noah Wiseman.) One day when Amelia is putting Samuel to sleep, he finds a mysterious book on the book shelf titled 'The Babadook,' and asks his mother to read to him as a bed time story. The book ends up being utterly terrifying, resulting in Amelia getting rid of it. But strange things begin to happen and Amelia slowly becomes paranoid that something is after her and Samuel.The Babadook is the film that gets a lot of stuff right, and a lot of stuff wrong. But first lets focus on the positive. Probably the best thing I can say about The Babadook is that it really, really tries to impress and frighten its audience. In a day when horror movies are all generic copies of each-other with predictable and cheap scares, it's a nice treat to see one that actually takes its time setting up a mood and atmosphere, and one that never relies on overused jump-scares to try and frighten the audience. But not only does the film actually try to be original and creative with its scares. It is actually scary. The Babadook is one of the only films I can think off that actually caused me to lose sleep over how scared I was by it. The scenes involving the book are executed perfectly, and I would be amazed if anyone wasn't completely terrified of them. Another positive is that all the actors do really solid jobs in their roles, especially Esse Davis. (Though the kid is incredibly annoying throughout the first half of the film.) But I think it's time we started talking about where the film messes up. For one the film is a little obvious and heavy-handed with its symbolism and message. I'm not against a horror film having either of these things, in fact I'm completely for it. But a little subtlety would be nice. If you somehow haven't heard what the film is metaphor I won't spoil it, but let's just say there's no way you're gonna miss it. Another much larger problem is the third act, it is just way, way, way too overblown. They spend the first hour with some great set-up, and than they completely blow it in the last half-hour. They shove way to much in the later part of the film and you end up with a lot of unnecessarily parts, and eventually it just feels like the film is trying to artificially stretch its length to 90 mins. I really think they could have had a much better film if they just cut 15-20 mins off it. Another major problem I have with the film is the ending, it really ham-fisted and it seems like it console tell goes against the whole idea of the film.In short The Babadook has some really good stuff, and some not so good stuff. But I would still definitely recommend it. Even though it has its problems because it's so nice to see a modern horror film, actually try to be good and original, and even better to see one that's legitimately scary. 6.4/10",6,4,7,11 April 2016
Alien," Defining moment in sci-fi horror history
","Alien is one indisputably one of the best science fiction, and horror films ever made. And easily one of the most influential ever. As it basically invented and defined the science- fiction horror genre, paving the way for films like the thing, and predator. One of Alien's best aspects is its amazing cinematography and creature/set design. All of see work together to give the film a visual style that was unlike anything scene at the time and Ridley Scott would re-use in Blade Runner. Alien's magnificent visuals can be strangely credited to Alejandro Jodorowsky, who found and assembled all the different artists used in Alien for his adaptation of the novel dune, which was unfortunately canned before shooting started, but every cloud has a silver lining, and Jodorowsky's Dune's silver lining was Alien. Another one of Alien's best aspects is its pacing and atmosphere, though some people today may call Alien 'boring,' these people know nothing about film and are not to be trusted. Alien opens with a slow footage of space, as the eerie score plays, open credits come up, and the title is slowly spelled out, this is then followed by a slow montage of the empty ship Nostromo, followed by the crew slowly waking up from cryospleep. In fact we don't see any sign of an alien until 1/3 of the way through the film, and we don't see the main alien until halfway through the film. And this is why some call it 'boring,' but these people came to see the wrong film, they expected something like predator, a straight forward action film where the hero tries to kill the creature, instead what they got was something more like Halloween or Psycho, a subtle unnerving film that builds tension and doesn't blow its load all at once.The characters in Alien are also far above the average horror movie, they aren't annoying teenagers, or people that we just want to see die. They're relatable diverse logical characters, that have really natural chemistry, as can be seen in some of the films earlier scenes. And another interesting thing about the characters is, we have to figure out which one the protagonist is, it isn't revealed immediately and makes all lot of scenes much more tense because we don't know which characters are going to die. Though Alien begins slow, the final scenes of Alien are some of the most 'on the edge of your seat' scenes ever, I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who somehow hasn't scene alien yet, but you will most likely be on the verge of a heart attack while watching.One final note, I recommend you watch the original version first, and then you most definitely should watch the directors cut.9.6/10",9,6,8,14 February 2016
Taxi Driver," Martin Scorsese's New Hollywood masterpiece about loneliness and redemption
","In the early 70s Martin Scorsese was quickly gaining popularity, he had become a part of the New Hollywood movement. Films like Who's That Knocking At My Door? And Mean Streets perfectly encapsulate what the movement was all about. Yes Scorsese was on the rise to the top. And he finally reached the top with his 1976 film Taxi Driver.Taxi Driver tells the story of the depressed insomniac Vietnam war vet Travis Bickle, played by arguably the greatest actor of all time Robert De Niro, who gets a job as a graveyard shift taxi driver. Travis spends his off hours in porn theaters and stalking a woman called Betsy, played by Cybill Shepard, who works for senator/presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Eventually Bickle convinces Betsy to go on a date with him, which ends horribly after he takes her to a porno. After Betsy's rejection, Bickle spirals down a hole of hatred contempt and isolation, he rambles on madly about wanting to clean the filth of the streets. But Bickle finds new purpose after he meats the underage prostitute Iris, (played by Jodie Foster who was only 13 when the film was being made.) Bickle decides that his life's purpose is to protect Iris no matter the cost. Taxi Diver is a story of loneliness, the story of a man who was overlooked by a society that he now hates. Robert De Niro perfectly captures that essence. To prepare for the role De Niro lost 35 pounds, got a job as a New York cabbie, and even listened to the tapes of Arthur Bremer, who attempted to assassinate U.S. Presidential candidate George Wallace. Everything about De Niro's performance is flawless, from the way he stumbles over his words and his thoughts come out like a distorted broken stream of insanity. Or his dead stare of complete contempt when he sees small-time hoods walking on the street. Or the famous ad-libbed 'You talking to me?' scene. Or that haunting smile he has on his face in the climax of the film. De Niro definitely gave us a performance for the history books.Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all-time, and he shines through in Taxi Driver. Scorsese is able to capture the audience and force them into the world of the crazed Travis Bickle, by keeping the film in a constant quick descent into his madness. In order to achieve this flow Scorsese will often have the camera move even if just slightly, especially in the first half of the film before we our fully immersed in his dark film. This flow of camera movement and sharp editing allows him to better control his audience. Scorsese also traps us in the world of Travis Bickle by paying close attention to background detail, throughout the film there we are constantly surrounded by propaganda for Palantine, and yet his opponent is never even mentioned, or when Travis mentions to Betsy that he's going to get a sign that says, 'one of these days I'm gonna get organiz- ized' and then latter in the film when he is organized that sign is hanging in his crappy apartment. Or how Scorsese focuses on all of the 'scum' that Travis talks about. (Whores fighting in the streets, pimps sitting in Restaurants.) Oh and also pay close attention to how pills are used throughout the film. All of this attention to detail really makes the audience feel like their stuck in the terrible world of Bickle.Paul Schrader, who worked with Scorsese several times, wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver. And the Screenplay is a work of pure genius. Well most of it is, there is one flaw with the screenplay that is actually the only flaw I have with the entire film. In a later scene in the film, Iris is talking to her pimp, (played by Martin Scorsese regular Harvey Keitel.) who she calls sport. The scene itself is great, both actors are fantastic and it gives context to Iris's situation. But the problem with the scene is that it cuts away from Travis Bickle. It's the only scene in the whole film to do that and it really breaks the films flow, because it means we have to exit the mind of Bickle. The scene just temporally derails the film, in would be much better without it. But going back to Jodie Foster, she is just amazing in the film. It's really hard to believe she was only 13 when they made it. She was nominated for best supporting actress but she really should have won. Bernard Hermann, one of the greatest film composers of all time, scored Taxi Driver (the final film he scored.) and needless to say, it's flawless. The way it moves from a quick loud jazz drum kit, to a smooth saxophone is just perfect. The soundtrack fully captures the feel of the gritty underbelly of New York. Taxi Driver was only nominated for four Oscars when it was first released and won none, but it did win the Palme d'Or. As time went on it slowly began to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, it made it onto Roger Ebert's Great Movie's, placed 31st on Sight and Sounds critic poll, and 5th on their directors poll. It was also added to the United States National Film Registry in 1994. Taxi Driver legacy has not been all good. In 1981 John Hinckley shaved his hair into a Mohawk, and tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan in order to impress Jodi Foster. But even with that unfortunate incident Taxi Driver became a perfect example of American filmmaking, showing how in-genius and dark it could be.9.9/10",9,0,2,13 March 2016
The Grapes of Wrath," The definitive Great Depression film
","Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions, typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting, fake 'Hollywood' dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clichés. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.As I'm sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century, and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad, (played by Henry Fonda, who collaborated with John Ford several times.) who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison, but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison, the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers, so of course the bank repossessed there home and land, and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting, so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments, but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating, you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography (done by the legendary Gregg Toland, who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane.) is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma, the wide open road on highway 66, and the overcrowded filthy slums of California, all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. Every single actor in the film gives it his/her all, Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad, and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect, every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. (well, except for some minor child-actor roles.) John Ford is an excellent actor director though, so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director, this was his second Oscar (his first was for The Informer.) and it is well deserved, each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscar-bait movie would, Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles, there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100% genuine.John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath, because he was politically conservative and the book/film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. (see what I did there.) Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union,it was only allowed because it supported pro-communist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirt-poor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry, alongside films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there, Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film, and should be viewed by everyone.9.5/10",9,8,8,26 February 2016
The Shining," A stunning example of atmosphere, horror, and filmmaking
","Some films are able to create a world separate from ours, create a place that has its very own feel, it can be wonderful, awe-inspiring, adventurous, etc. Studio Ghibli are masters of this, as nearly all there films (even the ones grounded in reality) feel fresh and they always make you want to enter there special place, except for maybe Grave of the Fireflies. Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is one of those very special films, but while Studio Ghibli's films were magical and fun, The Shining is terrifying and disturbing.Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time, he was a perfectionist in every sense of the word. In one scene a tennis ball is rolled down a hall, Stanley Kubrick shot this scene over fifty times, and The Shining also holds the record for the most times a single shot in a film has been re-shot. (but some of the crew members say the number was exaggerated) Stanley Kubrick was also vicious on his actors, even sometimes mistreating them to get the performance he wanted.The Shining is an adaptation of a Stephen King novel, and is about Jack Torrance a struggling writer, who is also a recovering alcoholic, who is hired as a winter caretaker of the summer hotel 'The Overlook' in Colorado. (the manger says its to difficult to keep the hotel open with the heavy snow fall in the winter.) So Jack Torrance spends the winter alone with his family in The Overlook, but as can be expected of all horror movies, strange things begin to happen, and Jack Torrance slowly loses his mind. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, and many contemporary audiences have criticized Kubrick for this choice, saying that Jack Nicolson was a bad choice for the role, because he always plays crazy people so the transformation of his character would be non existent, this criticism is incredibly out of context. When The Shining was released Jack Nicholson would have been known for playing 'free spirit' characters, like in One Flew Over The Cuckoos nest, or Easy Riders, sure nowadays he is known for psychopathic roles, but he wasn't known for them back in 1980. Another thing these critics seem to forget is that there isn't even the slightest hint of Jack losing his mind until 40 minutes into the film, and by that point we have already been exposed to several other horrors, that audiences that haven't ever been exposed to anything about the film wouldn't even expect him to go crazy, but there will never probably be an audience who hasn't been exposed to film in some sort of way, so many of the films scariest and most unnerving scenes, have been referenced and parodied so many times, that it causes them to lose their impact. This is probably The Shining's biggest flaw, and it's not even the films fault. I will not mention any of theses scenes here, so if you haven't seen the film yet, don't look up anything more about the it and watch it as soon as possible. But enough about how other people have ruined the film, let's talk about what makes it so great. I've already talked about Jack Nicholson's performance, but all of the performances in the film are prefect for the characters, Danny Lloyd deserves a special mention, because he was only 6 at the time and was under the impression that he was shooting a drama, not a horror film. You'd never be able to tell if you watched it. The soundtrack is also one of the best in any horror film ever, from the very first shot of the opening credits we are completely immersed in it, it's slow, creeping, subtle, and can match things like the Halloween score or the Vertigo score. The cinematography (done by John Alcott, who did many of Kubrick's other films) is also some of the best that you will ever find in a horror movie. The Shining is also often criticized today for being boring, much in the same way Alien is, and just like Alien these criticisms are completely unwarranted and make no sense. Some may have expected The Shining to jump right into the action, but it takes its time and slowly buries us in the vicious, creepy atmosphere of The Overlook Hotel, and there are several eerie scenes at the very beginning. So I don't really understand why people would think The Shining is 'boring.' One final thing, if you're an avid Stephen King fan, you will probably be disappointed, as Stanley Kubrick takes several 'artistic liberties,' while adapting Stephen Kings work. But please look at the film on its own, because it really is one of the greatest films ever made.10/10",10,3,5,15 February 2016
The Intouchables," A cheap, manipulative, film that seeks to exploit its audience
","One of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it. Now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy, sad, scared, etc. I know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry. And I think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events.Unfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry, and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact. They will make films that are filled with overdone clichés and over dramatized acting/dialogue in hopes of making the audience cry, because if you can get someone to cry at your film it's very unlikely that they will forget it, and they will probably like it. This is exactly the sort of film the Intouchables is, a cheap, insincere, artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional. These cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention, are in my opinion some of the worst films out there. They represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking, and deserve to be called out for what they are, and they are detestable piles of complete s***. I'm entering my third paragraph and I haven't even mentioned the acting, plot, cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet, and that's because regardless of whether you've seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film. The plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a text-book. The cinematography is at best dull, and at other times so bad I actually can not believe it was in a film with a 9.5 million euro budget. (which comes out to roughly 10.8 million dollars.) All of the actors give exactly what you'd expect from a movie like The Intouchables, and honestly I can't even remember a thing about any of there performances. Which is a compliment for a movie like The Intouchables. The Intouchables received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated for best foreign language films by the Golden Globes. Even though critics were split on the films quality, general audiences loved it. At the time of writing this review it is the 38th highest rated movie on IMDb, coming ahead of films like Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Vertigo, and even Citizen Kane. And I won't lie this upsets me, at least more than it should. The idea of a film as terrible as The Intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned, (not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top 250, and hundreds out of it.) just really destroys my faith in the film industry. I can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever. But even though I've been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema. There are things out there that are much worse than it, so I won't give it the lowest rating possible.2.1/10",2,16,36,19 April 2016
Spirited Away," One the most beautiful and imaginative films ever.
","Every once in a while, someone with a great talent, and a beautiful vision gets the tools and funding they need to realize their vision, Spirited Away was one of those few, times. Hayao Miyazaki needs no introduction, he is the main director and co-founder of the best animation studio in the world, studio Ghibli. He made 10 films at studio Ghibli, nearly all of them masterpieces, Spirited Away was his 7th film, and his best. Spirited Away is one of the most original and creative films, scene after scene, there is nothing but new strand creatures, locations, and adventures, each scene is completely unforgettable and would be the high point in almost any other film. Spirited Away is about a 10 year old girl, Chihiro, who, after moving to a new town, finds herself lost in the spirit world, and has to find her way out. Chihiro is one of the most likable protagonists of any film ever, and she has one of the most well done character arcs ever. As the film goes on ever about slowly changes, from her attitude, speech, and even little things like her stance and facial expressions. She goes from being a weak willed child, to a strong, intelligent, hero. The animation in Spirited Away is probably some of, if not they best in any movie ever, with some of the best creature designs, and locations ever, not to mention the vivid background animation, and character movement, that flows so naturally during the more exciting scenes. Also apparently Hayao Miyazaki animated the film without a finished script and sort of made it up as he went along. Spirited Away was insanely well received every where around the world, it became the highest grossing film in Japan, beating movies like titanic, and in America it became the first non American film to ever win the Academy Award best animated feature, made it onto Roger Ebert's 'great movies.' And is often listed as one of the best animated films of all time, rightfully so. In my opinion the Best scenes in Spirited Away are the quiet ones where Chihiro just sits and takes in the amazing surroundings, like when she rides the train, and when she sits on the balcony of the bath-house during the night, these scenes have such a subtle beauty that can never be described in words. 10/10",10,1,2,14 February 2016
Schindler's List," Steven Spielberg's greatest cinematic achievement
","In the early 90s Steven Spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like E.T., Jaws, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Hook, the list just goes on and on. Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making. Even if you are among the more 'experienced' film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did.Schindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events. Steven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was 'mature' enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust. Earlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.) Schindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars. I'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles.Steven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.)9.4/10",9,9,13,17 February 2016
Downfall," Interesting concept, flawed execution
","Downfall tells the story of the last days of Hitler (played in the film by Bruno Ganz) in the bunker as Berlin was being attacked by the Russians. Which is an interesting idea for a film, and like most interesting ideas it's also a touchy one. The film follows Hitler and the remaining members of the Third Reich as they try to hold back the Germans, destroy all records of what they were doing, and come to terms with the fact that the Nazi party is over. At the beginning of the film Hitler seems sure that they can still win this, but as time goes on he becomes less and less sure, as the battle moves closer his home. Which makes for a great character study.Downfall, as I said earlier, is an interesting idea for a film. It's nice to see that a film has has the courage to try and tackle such a difficult subject. The film doesn't try to portray the Nazi's as heroes or villains it just try's to show them as people. Which some people might take issue with, but then again if film is going to grow as an art form then we need to push boundaries and make some people uncomfortable in the process. But even though Downfall has a great premise, it struggles with bringing its vision to the screen. Before we get into the issues I'd like to begin with what the film gets right, and if there's one thing Oliver Hirschbiegel, the director of Downfall, gets right, it's casting Bruno Ganz to play Adolf Hitler. He steals every single scene he's in, and this might be a backhanded compliment to Bruno Ganz, but it feels like he was born to play Hitler. I mean his performance in Wings of Desire was great, but this is the one that they'll remember him for, and it's a shame he wasn't nominated for best lead actor. Another thing that Downfall does really well, is that it is able to get you to sympathize with Nazis. At one part in the film I felt legitimate sorrow for some of the characters and then I realized, I was sad because bad things were happening to Nazis. Something I never though I would ever feel in my whole life, and since Downfall made me feel that, I would say it deserves to be commended.But even though Downfall was able to get you to sympathize with Nazis, it still messed some other things up. The biggest problem with Downfall is that it isn't focused. The films main plot is on Hitler in the bunker, all the things he's dealing with, and how he faces his inevitable destruction. And with that center plot, the film tries to build all these different stories and characters that are tied to what's going on with Hitler in the Bunker, and a lot of these are unnecessary and distracting. Another problem I have with all the side characters is a good chunk of the supporting cast is pretty weak. None are terrible but I mean they were unnecessary some were annoying, and I just really didn't care about a whole lot of them. This might seem strange but at some parts Downfall feels like it's trying to imitate Schindler's List. The way in which the horrors of the war are portrayed in Downfall are very similar to way in which the horrors of the holocaust were portrayed in Schindler's List. Maybe it's just me that thinks this, but the way they would have horribly violent actions shot like they were just part of everyday life, felt identical to some parts of Schindler's List. Downfall also has a serious problem with using CGI in some of their battle scenes, it only happens a few times but when it does it ruins the whole scene.Downfall was well received by audiences and critics alike, and was even nominated for best foreign language film by The Academy Awards. And I had have to say that I recommend Downfall, it's worth seeing just based of the concept of the film alone, even if the execution is lackluster.6.6/10",6,0,3,25 April 2016
The Nice Guys," Shane black gives us an incredibly average neo-noir buddy cop comedy
","Shane Black, the writer/director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, returns with another neo-noir, buddy cop comedy called The Nice Guys. The Nice Guys takes place in 1977 Los Angeles, and after a bizarre opening scene that will only fully make sense until the end of the film, the film introduces us to one of the main protagonists, Jackson Healy. (played by Russell Crowe) Who is just low-level muscle for hire, who one day is hired by a shy paranoid girl called Amelia, (played by Margaret Qualley) to beat up a bumbling private investigator, Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) that is on her tail. Later on Healy is attacked by two thugs that demand to know Amelia's whereabouts, which Healy does not know. After Healy escapes the thugs he goes and tries to find Holland March in order that they can team up and find Amelia and figure out what's going on.The Nice Guys is a mixture of a neo-noir mystery and a buddy cop comedy, but the film is works much better as a comedy then as a mystery, a lot of the jokes are really good with great deliveries on the punch-lines and some solid physical humor to boot. But even though the jokes on a hole are pretty good some of them do fall flat, and the film doesn't do a very good job of keeping the comedy going in a continuous flow, it sort of just comes in these short bursts. But the comedy on a hole as I said earlier is really good, so there's no real reason to get nitpick it, especially when there are so many big problems I have with the film mainly the plot. The plot itself is pretty generic, if you've seen any neo-noir film you've basically seem The Nice Guys, but not only is it generic, it's lazy. The majority of the time the way the plot is furthered is by the characters accidentally stumbling across the thing they needed, or some random character coming over and telling the protagonists the information they needed to know, very little goes on in the way of actual detective work, which makes for a very obnoxious and dull movie.But the biggest problem I have with the Nice Guys is that it's not immersive. While I was watching the film I never felt like I was actually in 70s. Compare this to Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, (which is a film set in a similar time period) when you're watching Inherent Vice you feel like you're in the actual era its placing you in. All of the characters mannerisms and the smallest things in the background help contribute to this feeling, and it makes the film so much better and enjoyable. I never got that from The Nice Guys. Which was a serious let done, the lack of immersion makes the film feel tedious and just fake. Overall I'm split on The Nice Guys, on one hand there are some funny jokes and solid performances and on the other the plot is unoriginal and weak, and the film is not immersive. I guess it's worth looking into if it looks like something you'd be into, but you wouldn't really be missing anything if you didn't see The Nice Guys.",5,5,12,31 May 2016
