10 Cloverfield Lane," Weird....
","This was a weird experience....the first three quarters of the movie were quite riveting, the scenes in the bunker were claustrophobic and dark, creating a real tension and sense of mystery...at that point, I was really wondering where the story was going, it made me want to know more.... But then, all of a sudden, the storyline changes: we are thrown out of the bunker, in the outside world, where clearly something bad has happened and still is happening. Just we are not allowed to know exactly what...zombies? martians? space invaders? it was like being thrown into another movie, but then we ask ourself why they kept us locked into the bunker all that time... On top of all that, I found that the director made an exaggerated use of music, as if he wanted to use it not only to underline the tension but rather to create it; I thought this was over the top. The ending then - without spoiling it for other viewers - is like that of a TV series, where you need to wait the next episode to know what will happen; except that we won't know (unless they are planning a sequel....but not for me, I opt out...)",3,0,4,22 March 2016
The Irishman," Many ups but as many downs....
","Whoa...this was a looong ride! The Irishman is a mammoth movie trying to do many things, perhaps too many to succeed in all of them.
Let's start from the goodies: undoubtedly the movie is sustained by extraordinary acting performances, especially remarkable those by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. What De Niro (and CGI) does with his facial expressions all along the movie is just in itself worth the money of the ticket. On top of that, the dialogues are incredibly juicy and the movie overall is extremely well crafted.
On the less positive side, The Irishman struggles to keep the story focused, with some outstanding peaks and some moments of lull - understandably so given its length; I mean, even masterworks like the Odyssey and the Iliad (just slightly longer than The Irishman) have inevitably many highs and as many lows, so Scorsese's ambitious work does not escape this everlasting law. Moreover, he introduces so many characters that he makes it very difficult for the viewer to keep track of them and of their relationships.
All in all, I had very high expectations for this movie and they were not all kept.",7,9,18,27 November 2019
Interstellar," Worth a place in the firmament of the top fiction movies ever
","This is the story of Cooper and his daughter Murphy. Cooper is a space pilot, at a time when the world needs farmers more than pilots, as the Earth is dyeing and people starve. Cooper is a dreamer, dreaming of the times when 'we used to look up wondering about our space in the stars as opposed to looking at our place in the dirt'. Cooper thinks os being chosen by some mysterious entity to undertake a journey beyond human capabilities, a response to a call to save mankind. This journey will force him to abandon his family and especially his daughter Murph, and will take him along an incredible ride across space and time. The adventure is in itself epic, but what makes it even more engrossing is that the three main themes of the movie (the interstellar trip, the relationship between a father and his daughter and the underlying theme of time) are merged into a story with a wide breadth and with many human touches which make the story highly emotional. Nolan plays very creatively with the theme of time: he bends it, he makes it work like the famous Escher drawing (two hands drawing each other): Cooper is allowed to experience time as a physical dimension, where the past is a mountain to climb and the past is a canyon; but, unlike what he thought, he was not the one that was chosen, Murph was the one chosen to save mankind, and he was just the 'bridge'. All this makes of Interstellar much more than 'just' a sci-fi movie, though it remains a great example of its genre. Clearly it taps into some some of the iconic all-time sci-fi movies, specifically 2001, but it deserves a space on its own in the firmament of the great fiction movies. Personally, this is one of the movies I have put right at the top, in the Olympus of my most loved movies ever.",10,0,2,3 March 2016
The Revenant," A National Geographic documentary interrupted by scenes of the most extreme brutality...
","OK, well, this was like watching a National Geographic documentary with breathtakingly beautiful nature shots interrupted by scenes of the most extreme and crude brutality I think I have ever seen. Undoubtedly hyoerealistic, at the limit of believeabioity (I know, it is based on a real story, but this does not make its cinematographic representation realistic...); the story is weak, the dialogues almost absent apart the conitnued grunting of LdC - Tom Hardy, in his fake Texan accent, is virtually ununderstandable. LdC won the Academy Award (long overdue...) but it seems to me more an Oscar to his career (he performed equal if not better in another half dozen movies). Overall not a bad movie, just oberrated.",7,0,3,3 March 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Heavy Indigestion
","Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.
Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...
So I'll go now, I have some work to do tonight to try and digest this nuclear pizza....",2,429,1068,2 May 2018
Call Me by Your Name," The worst movie of the last coup,e of years
","Here are the headlines explaining why I think this is a bad, highly over-rated movie:
1) the acting is very bad, excluding Thimot√©e Chamalet; Arnie Hammer seems to have available one and one only expression (a rather dense smiling face), the two parents offer a rather wooden performance
2) the setting and context are so far-fetched, so unrealistic to prevent the viewer to associate with the story; an ethereal bunch of people speaking to each other in unlikely fashion in three languages (with the paradox that Italian, supposed to be the maother tongue of most of the characters, is spoken in a ridiculous way), reacting to the various events (?) in highly unrealistic fashion. One example above all, the father-son dialogue towards the end is just not real
3) the style is so manneristic and pretentious to be highly irritating
Last, it is just, simply plain boring....",1,10,44,17 March 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," The sci-fi movie by definition
","This is for me THE sci-fi movie by definition, and I support my pitch with the following facts: # the movie has the ambition to tell the story of human kind from its very remote beginning four million years ago up to its far future; a huge ambition, an almost unbearable burden, but 2001 succeeds: the movie is at the same time highly epic and iconic... # epic: the story is a fantastic journey: four million years ago, a mysterious, superior entity has come on earth to chose the best among all pre-human beings (actually an ape, Moonwatch) to transition his species into its future, i.e. mankind as we know it. Four million years later, the same mysterious entity appears again and again it comes to select the best among all men (Dave Bowman) to do what his precursor had done millions of years before, i.e. to carry his species to the next level. The final amazing journey across time and space, culminating in the birth of the new species, symbolised by the huge phoetus- egg that Bowman has turned in, is a unique filmic experience # iconic: 2001 has changed sci-fi cinema for ever, sci-fi movie have never been the same since. The cinematographic solutions that Scott and his crew have created for 2001 have set new standards for any future sci-fi movie: just think of the way of portraying spaceships, moving very slowly against the infinite background of the deep space instead of being bullet-like objects as they had been shown up to then. Other visuals have been adopted by movies like the fantastic Interstellar (which I loved a lot!): think of the spinning space station, the docking scenes, and even the key visuals of the journey across the wormhole (is this Cooper or David Bowman...?). I watched 2001 back in 1969, and I keep watching it every now and then; another amazing thing of this movie is how watchable still is nearly 50 years after its production, even more so for a sci-fi movie, most of which become obsolete",10,4,7,23 February 2016
It Chapter Two," Thus movie is a disgrace...
","...it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book. IT - the book - is a psychological thriller about friendship, about relationships, it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults; it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears.
IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.
Shame on this movie!",1,161,212,26 September 2019
Prometheus," Copy-pasting past successes does not make up a new success....
","I am a big fan of Ridley Scott and I adore sci-fi; so I went to see Prometheus with huge expectations. I cannot state enough my disappointment when I walked out...this movie is a bum, it is a collage of previous director's cult movies, a lot from Alien up to some touches of Blade Runner. Leaving aside the fact that 'quoting' himself is not a very elegant thing to do, it seems as if Scott thinks that pulling together visual and sound references from his past successes will make up another one now. Well, it does not.... I smelled this could be the case from the very beginning of the movie: the way the title appears on screen is the same visual device used in Alien, up to the very end (Dr Show's breathing is a shameless copy-paste of Ripley's). Well, one could say, these are licenses that a director like Ridley Scott can allow himself...yeah, well, maybe if the script would be so strong to stand out as a piece of great and original filmography; which it does not, the plot is so evanescent, so predictable to be unbearably boring.",5,2,4,23 February 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," What a huge waste!
","What a bum! How to waste a $250M budget and a stellar cast...why did the director needed all this if his intent was to throw the viewer into an orgy of overwhelming visual and audio effects? This is cinema on steroids, where any attempt of storytelling abdicates to gigantic, kaleidoscopic flashes of images and sounds which turn any supposedly heroic action into ridiculous. But the sense of ridiculous never seemed to be touching the director, which never stops to take himself very seriously...any shy attempt of humor fails miserably. As a result, you just hope the end will come soon, except that it won't....the movie is like a zombie, when you think it's over, it comes back and keeps going....what a waste!",2,1,9,25 March 2016
Midway," Enjoyed today, forgotten tomorrow....
","I quite enjoyed Midway: it is actually a solid, very watchable movie, professionally crafted, rich with spectacular scenes.
Point is, it also is a very, very conventional movie; Midway is not able to propose one single fresh, surprising scene - let alone concept - apart from the usual orgy of CGI. The movie proposes such an unlikely quantity of incredible heroic acts to make heroism a commodity. The actors performances are also quite professional, but they are terribly retro, vintage...Midway actually could have been a phenomenal 'colossal movie' of the 50' or 60's.
So, I enjoyed it today and I am sure I will have forgotten it tomorrow...",5,27,77,6 November 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Maybe just not be rated...
","Whoa....this was a hell of a ride!
Now, if you are expecting Da 5 Bloods to be a movie in the sense of a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, it might not work for you.
I am not sure myself it worked for me but I didn't feel like I could just ignore it either.
This is like a pile of political, emotional and historical statements not necessarily linked in one single bundle. At times it ends up being a Tarantino-like mess, but with relevance.
It is surely timely, it is heavily politically loaded, it is emotional and intense, angered but also ironical and lighthearted at moments.
Maybe not to be judged, let alone rated, but just to be absorbed.",Null,108,177,12 June 2020
