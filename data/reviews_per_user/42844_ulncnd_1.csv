Sucker Punch," Did anyone not see the same movie?
","This movie was terrible in my opinion. I don't know how this movie has a 6 out of 10 rating on IMDb. Reasons why this movie was terrible:Acting: the main character (Babydoll) was pretty bad. She had the same look on her face for 90% of the film and delivered her lines badly. The two girls that played the sisters (Rocket and Sweet Pea) were really good and so was the guy who played the villain (Blue). Everyone else was just bad. Action: I usually am not bothered by over-the-top too much but the fight scenes didn't make any sense. For example, in the second scene, the girls take on a horde of steam-powered, Nazi zombies (omg) and, despite the fact that all the Nazis had guns, they all charged them and tried to hit them with their guns or bayonets. And died of course. None of the action scenes made sense. (Spoilers Warning: If you haven't seen the movie, don't read my explanation about the plot)Plot: Dumb. If you don't know what's happening, let me explain. Babydoll and her sister live with their mother and evil step-dad. When mom dies (poison?) evil step-dad reveals he is only there for the money in the Will. For some reason, he never bothered to read it before he started poisoning mom and now discovers all the money goes to the girls. In a stupid scene, Babydoll accidentally kills her sister (for which she mostly shows no remorse throughout the film) and gets committed. Now she starts to fantasize. Sometimes she's in an institution. Sometimes she is in a whorehouse where she has to dance for customers and the pimp. (here's where it gets really bad) Whenever she dances, she gets transported away in her mind to these action scenes where she fights various creatures and when she comes back to reality, everyone is like 'that was the hottest dance ever!' (but you never get to see it). Then she comes up with the brilliant escape plan to dance for people, and while they are mesmerized by her moves, the other girls will steal things they need to escape (lighters, maps, keys etc). I wont bore you with the rest of the plot, but it doesn't get any better. Music: Too much, too often. The songs usually play over the whole action scene and are not that good and last 3 or 4 minutes each time.CGI: not that good. I really was kind of let down by how mediocre a lot of it looked. Costumes: the costuming for the non-CGI monsters was pretty bad. Then there was a scene with knights vs goblins and you could tell they were all old masks from Lord of the Rings. And I don't mean copies. They were the exact same goblins and orcs from LOTR. Exactly. And as much as I like girls in short shorts, they wore them all the time and after an hour you're like 'do they have jeans?'. It starts to not make sense. Dialogue: overall, it was incredibly poorly written. There were scenes where the people were talking and you have to ask yourself why this conversation sounds like anything but babble and then, at the end of that conversation, someone says 'This could work' referring to the dumbest plans in history. I hate this movie. I really do. I hope to never see it again and I am glad it didn't make the #1 spot this weekend. I felt robbed.",1,70,149,29 March 2011
