Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie of last 20 years.
","How can anybody get away with this? This film makes fun of everything I could think of. Borat makes Animal House look like a child's movie. I can't stop laughing when I think of this film. Cohen plays a bigot immigrant better than anyone could do in real life. This movie, plain and simple, is just crazy. If all of the people knew that this was a comedy movie, I'm sure it would have been less funny. The police were called in 91 times in this movie, showing how insulting Cohen was in this movie. One last note, if you have a weak stomach or are a fan of the singer Huey Lewis, I highly suggest you do not go see this movie.To end, I will sing the the Kazakhi national anthem: Kazakstan is the greatest country in the world, all other countries are run by little girls. Kazakhstan is number one exporter of potassium, Other Central Asian countries have inferior potassium. (Sorry I don't know any more, the crowd booed out Borat at the end of that last line.)",10,3,15,26 November 2006
Final Destination 2," ummmmmm, OK?
","I believe I may have to quote Derek Zoolander for this one: 'What is this?' This is a horrendous concept. The concept is if you escape death, you will die. I know people who have 'escaped death' and, trust me, they are fine. Nothing is believable. The most realistic thing is the man in the elevator with the hook for a hand.Why was this movie even made? I mean, The Butterfly Effect was horrendous, can't Brees learn from his mistake? I mean seriously, who likes to see people get a ladder shoved through their eye because they were making dinner? This movie made me want to gouge my eyes out after what I saw. I was insulted by what theater has become and now, I feel like a new person for all the wrong reasons.",2,1,2,20 November 2006
American History X," The Greatest Movie Ever, by far.
","I have to admit, when my friend Mike asked me if I had seen American History X, I said no. However, when I went on the internet and saw how good people said it was, I had to see it. I was memorized the entire movie.I have seen my share of Edward Norton movies, but not only was this one the best, but I have never seen one actor put so much emotion and care into one film. Edward Furlong also showed the best change in a performance that I have ever seen. This movie is fantastic, but I will admit, it is hard to watch at some times. How nobody won an Oscar for this film is beyond me. See this movie, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. I guarantee if you see this film, which is the greatest movie ever in my opinion, you'll say the same things I am saying. It doesn't matter if you are young or old, black or white, male or female, this is the best drama you will ever see. And coming from a 14 year old from Jersey who loves The Godfather, that is a big statement.",10,1,4,11 September 2006
The Butterfly Effect," Bring your pillows, you'll want a nap.
","If you go see The Butterfly Effect, you either A. Watch Punk'd and That 70s Show WAY too much or B. You really want a nap.There is no way this movie is believable. Ashton Kutcher is absolutely horrible. I will admit, he may be good in future roles as a crazy psychotic killer (he looks the part). People are constantly changing and its almost impossible to keep up. The movie is constantly, in my mind, pushes things like killing animals, kiddie porn and bombing people's mailboxes. This movie would be good if they had Ashton Kutcher turn into a psychopath at one point and maybe if they KEPT THE SAME STORY FOR 5 MINUTES!!!!! This movie is a disgrace to cinema. Don't waste your money, unless you need a nap, then go rent this cinematic disgrace.",1,5,17,20 November 2006
World Trade Center," The Film that America needed to see.
","Listen. Everyone is putting this movie down because September 11th is still a soft spot for all American people. However, we needed to see this movie. If this movie was in the eyes of John Doe, I wouldn't blame everyone for what they say. In fact, if it weren't in the eyes of Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, it should have been in the bottom 100. However, the emotion you had during this movie was maybe only surpassed by Forrest Gump. The emotions of the families probably made you feel like you were a McLoughlin or a Jimeno. I remember crying like a baby when they were saved in the end. This film is indeed a guilty pleasure. Everybody says they hated this movie. However, catch them alone at your local Blockbuster, and they will be renting this film. We needed to see this film so everyone could know what happened in the eyes of two of the bravest men in American history and so we can be sure that good came out of the darkest day any American remembers.",10,1,4,1 November 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Makes all other comedies obsolete.
","Imagine you are watching a movie with Robin Williams. Is your favorite thing the story, or his amazing goofiness that seems only a man of his pedigree can pull off? If it is the goofiness, you need to see Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This was the building block of all comedies, it is as goofy as Billy Madison, as clever as Airplane, and as fun as Animal House. Add the six smartest minds in comedy not named John Landis and you have Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I am a smart light bulb, but after I watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it felt like my IQ dropped at least 5 points. If I could watch one comedy for the rest of my years, it would be Holy Grail. If you see this movie, you will never see a movie funnier than it. It deserves all the credit it gets.NI!!!!!",10,0,1,30 October 2006
V for Vendetta," Be humble about your government, they're better than this V's.
","Many Americans are mad about the administration that George Bush is running. People are mad about the war in Iraq, the high gas prices, and the lack of common sense he uses. Now imagine if you said that and at 11 that night, 25 men dressed in all black come to your house and club you and anyone that was there. That is the concept of V for Vendetta. In V for Vendetta, if anything negative was said about the government you were beaten to a bloody pulp. This film expresses a flicker of light in a time of darkness, hope during negativity. I saw this movie and I must admit, I am forever changed. I now love my government out of humility and feel privileged that of the rights my government gives me. Watch V for Vendetta, be changed forever, and Remember, Remember the 5th of November.",10,1,3,31 October 2006
