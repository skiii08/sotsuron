Requiem for a Dream," i was completely blown away by this film
","there is not much to say about this film that has not been said before. this film is probably the only movie that has left me with a gaping mouth, completely stunned and blown away. superb acting by the whole cast, wonderful directing, brain-crushing mind-blowing editing. everything- the whole package. i had not really heard about this movie before, since i sort of go off into my own world sometimes, and just happened to never had heard of it. but a few weeks ago, i asked one of my friends which movie would be good to rent, since it had been awhile since i rented something. and i have been told on more than a few ocasions that i am too critical of films and cannot stand a horrible movie, especially crummy acting or screenplay. but my friend told me to rent this movie, he practically scolded me for never seeing it. so i rented it and was completely stunned. i lay on the couch with my eyes transfixed on the tv screen and completely immersed myself in the movie. by far the best performance was by ellen burstyn. her slow descent into madness is one of most impacting aspects of the movie. i almost felt like we were going mad together. jared leto was marvelous. just completely believable. two words: 'the arm'.... oooohh, arghhh! naaaaasty. but completely believable.i could keep on, but it's much better to experience the film personally.this movie is on the top list of my recommendations to everyone, at least people that can stomach reality. for the weak of heart, leave them to the sugar-coated fantasies of hollywood feel-good movies.",10,0,1,13 September 2003
