The Blair Witch Project," What's with all the derison? WARNING SPOILERS!
","If ever there is a perfect example of backlash it is the later reaction to this movie.  After the initial buzz this film was blasted continually. To me it is a testement to the phonemonm of jumping on the berating bandwagon because this is, simply, a damn good movie and a scary one too. Yes you have to put aside the unlikely choice that the terrified trio would continue to film in such a situation, but it is a small suspension of reality to capitulate to considering that the premise of the film ('reality' horror, caught on video tape) is a brillant one.  Add to the concept the fact that the filmakers understood that we are more scared by what we don't see and you have an unforgetable experience in horror.",Null,0,1,1 October 2001
Vertigo," Classic Hitchcock and Stewart
","An interesting psychological piece that richly displays Hitchcock's talents.  It is unfair to compare this film to the suspense thrillers of today which are subjected to more realism in sex and violence.  Hitchcock had to be more subtle in 1958, where I'm sure a work like this, that seems tame by today's standards, appeared bizarre and risqu√©.  Also the acting here seems histrionic; not that people actually spoke like that in the 50s but the audiences liked such dictionally refined dialogue back then as opposed to the lines of modern-day scripts that more accurately portray the way individuals speak.
	James Stewart and Kim Novak are appealing on numerous levels, the former mainly because he doesn't wander far from the amiable joe we have come to expect (even though he does weird-out near the conclusion) and the latter because she maintains a veneer of vulnerability that we can relate to.
	This is not a film I especially like (I couldn't watch it again and again) but I respect for its strong filmmaking.",Null,7,7,2 August 2001
The Sound of Music," A truly great movie
","Probably the only musical that can come close to rivaling 'The Wizard Of Oz'.  And just like that classic, this used to be an experience that families would look forward to with an annual network showing (of course they are not any longer with the advent of video and multiple cable channels).  Ah, the beautiful scenery, the memorable songs, and the great story.  A very pleasing motion picture.",Null,0,5,24 February 2002
The Ring," Ummmm..
","SPOILERS.Good premise but the film is unrefined.  Here is how to fix it:1.) The opening scene is awkward.  The girl had expectations of being wacked (her & day anniversary was coming up) and she's acting silly.  And if all these kids who watched the video are aware of what's going to happen (or have suspicions) why are they all seperated.  A scene with them all together as time runs out, where some believe and some don't would have been much better.2.) Don't make the first victim the cousin of the main character.  Since she is a journalist the oddity of the kids' deaths (as well as the rumors) her looking into it would have been justified.  Maybe later on have a close relative of her's get killed.3.) Their should have been more victims that she ran across in her investigation to build up tension.4.) The relationship between her son and the girl was okay but it needed to be fully explained.  As it is it's weak.  The kid could be presented as the strange young lad that he is with an imaginary friend.  Then as the plot thickens we find out who the friend really is.  Need some reason for the boy to be picked though.",Null,0,1,19 March 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," If only more 'action/adventure' movies were this good
","Warning Spoilers!	A stupendous movie that is much more than an `action and adventure' flick. Sure there's a lot going on with all the impressive stunts and exciting fight sequences, but the mix of humor, sly serendipity, crafted dialogue and the heroic resilience of Indiana Jones all add up to a fun and smart film that more than meets its terminus ad quem---to entertain.
	I remember seeing this for the first time and enjoying it from beginning to end.  The opening scene in the cave was exhilarating, the hero was refreshingly flawed, the leading lady was sexy, the villains were classic, the ending was fateful; the whole thing was just so damn good.  It also had clever side moments like the student who wrote `I love you' on her eyelids and Marion's drinking contest in Nepal.  Not to mention the famous shooting of the flashy swordsman scene, which is still, after repeated viewings, a fresh and spontaneous vignette.
	Now for the one thing that REALLY bugs me about this film.  I am more than willing to suspend reality for the pure enjoyment of a movie, and I know that such a position is virtually required for a movie like this, but what the hell is the deal with the U-boat?  I mean I can buy the multitude of snakes living in a mass (snakes would never do this), I'll ignore the big stones, entrenched for thousands of years that Indy moves with ease, and I'll simply appreciate the numerous, highly improbable stunts.  The reason is because they all ADD to the film's allure.  I have no problem suspending belief if it enhances.  But the U-boat scene doesn't make sense.  Indy jumps on board (on the outside of the craft) and rides for hundreds of miles and the submarine NEVER SUBMERGES?  WHAT??????  The reason it irritates me is that there was no reason that it had to be a U-boat.  It need only be a German battleship.  Then Indy could have latched on, hid somewhere and enjoyed the ride no problem. 	By the way Spielberg shines here as a director.  His use of shadows and innovative camera cuts add much to the film.  He was without a doubt the man for the job.",Null,0,0,20 June 2001
Spartacus," A seminal epic
","This epic film was obviously the provenance for later historic-dramas such as Braveheart and Gladiator (in fact the similarities to the former are numerous in both style and content right down to the torturous death scene, alleviated by emotional fulfillment, that ends the movie).  But the makers of both those flicks were prescient in using this Stanley Kubrick classic as an archetypal base. A strong cast consisting of Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis and the enjoyable Peter Ustinov impels the vision of Kubrick, resulting in a magniloquent saga of the slave who fights the good fight.  Of course it's not Spartacus' self-solicitousness that endears us to his plight, it is his struggle for the manumission of all his brothers in bondage.  His dedication to his comrades is reciprocated in a cinematic highlight that swells the soul as his defeated soldiers defy the power of mighty Rome by unifying in impending death (`I am Spartacus' they all shout) rather than condemn their leader to a lonely demise.
Kubrick would go on to make more important films, but none as august as this work.  Spartacus stands as a salient film be it for its precursory effluence or its own sublime qualities.",Null,0,1,9 June 2001
Casablanca," Here's looking at a classic
",This film has such a sheen of classic cinema that it is a joy to watch. That's good because it overcomes two ridiculous aspects in this film: 1.) The Nazi's had vitual impunity and could have arrested Victor Laslo at any time and 2.) Letters of transit that are known by the authorities to be stolen are worthless.  Anyway Bogart and Bergman are grand.,Null,0,0,24 August 2001
Se7en," Freeman is the impetus in this modern film noir masterwork
","Like `The Silence of the Lambs', `Seven' is a film that uses intense characters and psychological intrigue to move beyond the limitations of gore and decadence in serial killer flicks.  It is, after all, easy to make a film drenched in the depravation of a society approaching anomie, but it is not a simple matter to make it smart and fresh.  Truth be told though, for all the well-exhibited talents of Pitt, Paltrow and Spacey it is Freeman who saves this film from trapping itself into a sordid mess.  He provides just the right edge as one of the most interesting cops ever on the big screen.  His profundity makes him a pariah to his peers, as he is azygous to the point of being incongruous among lesser thinkers.  This is juxtaposed nicely in the scenes where he goes to the library to construe John Doe's literary inspirations, while Mills (Pitt) snags some Cliff's Notes.  We quickly note that while Somerset (Freeman) is a bete noire in the police department (probably feared as many smart people are) he is the only person with the intellect required to defeat John Doe.It is Somerset's contrast that provides suitable pauses in the tumult and allows for Pitt's intensity and Paltrow's tenderness to have convincing voices.  It is his erudite manner of investigating the grizzly murders that makes them more than psychopathic folderol in the long book of inhumane criminality.  If violence is truly an atavistic impulse, then Somerset reminds us that compassion probably is also.A very disturbing, yet worthy effort that pays attention to numerous details.  A well made film that is highly recommended.",Null,0,0,4 February 2002
Unbreakable," Problems abound:
","SPOILER ALERT!!!
1.) I don't mind filmakers working what they do best, but the atmosphere was isomorphic 'Sixth Sense' to the point of being parody.2.) He fakes an injury so that he doesn't have to play football, because his wife 'can't have violence like that' in her life, but yet she has no problem with his profession as stadium security (in which he is armed with a gun)? There must be a hundred better reasons to justify his giving up football (he was hurting too many other players) or even better a different reason why he feigned the injury.  This is just plain silly.3.) All of the sudden he notices his preternatural strength (he obviously lifted weights before--the bench pressing scene with his son is ridiculously histrionic) and ability as an augur?  I assume we are intended to associate this with the train accident and his newfound relationship with Jackson's character, but if so it could have been developed much more effectively.Overall another idea with great potential that misses the mark.",Null,0,0,6 September 2001
Citizen Kane," A film for study, but not for entertainment
","Watching `Citizen Kane' is analogous to reading `Moby Dick'.  Both are seminal, American masterpieces that lend themselves well as preceptive works for analysis.  They are both respected for their innovativeness and influence. You can appreciate literary technique in the later just as you can the masterly camera angles and lighting in the former.
But in the end reading Melville is interesting and engenders discussion, but I'd rather sit back and indulge in `Wise Blood' or `Portnoy's Complaint'. And given a free evening to throw in a video I'd take `The Godfather' or `Fargo' over Kane any day. The direction is flawless of course.  Wells deserves all accolades that fomented from this film. A movie that should be studied by students of film but left on the shelf when entertaining on a Friday night.",Null,0,2,8 August 2001
Memento," Surreal film noir
","A crafty, well constructed work that is truly sui generis.  Because suspense films are a dime a dozen (most try to overcome the derivativeness of their genre with extraneous violence) and because we have become too cynical and ironic, it is often hard to admit when we actually like something.  Though I'm sure when I read the comments to this film someone will shoot down my fancy that this is an original idea (actually I am sure the wrtier/director--sorry his name escapes me and I am too lazy to go back and look it up--has seen Amateur) I am impressed with what he did, which is make a smart movie and apply some hard work into it.",Null,0,1,19 September 2001

12 Monkeys," Very interesting work
","A smart and well-directed movie that draws together what was good about `Cuckoo's Nest' and `The Terminator'.

Unfortunately, I found that the Army is actually filled with the Frank Burns and Captain Stillmans of the world.Anyway it's a funny flick with numerous classic one-liners: 'We're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn', 'I wanna party with you cowboy', 'Were Americans...you know what that means? Our ancestors were kicked out of every decent country in the world', 'See, if we were in Germany I'd have to make your bed', 'Aunt Jemimah treatment', 'Arrrrmy training sir', and of course 'That's the fact, Jack!'.Sometimes you forget how funny Bill Murray really is, then you watch this or 'Ground Hog Day' and you are nicely reminded.

The Terminator," A great sci-fi flick. WARNING: SPOILERS
","Simply put, the trouble with most sci-fi flicks is that they are not very good.  This James Cameron tour de force is an exception.  The dark atmosphere, surreal tension (achieved by interspersing glimpses of a dystopic future and by proportional revelations of the characters' places in the scheme of things) and frenetic violence make for a brooding and at the same time tumultuous affair.
	All of the actors from Schwarzenegger to Biehn to Hamilton shine, but the real star is the plot itself, which is clever, intricate and sinisterly plays on our dichotomous love/hate relationship with technology.  The dialogue is similarly well-crafted and of course produced one of movie histories most oft-quoted lines, `I'll be back'.
	One priggish minus however: The scene where the police are staking out Sara Connor's home and leave to take another call just as the terminator arrives was unrealistic.  In such a sensationally developing case, they would have never left.  It would have been better to show the killing-machine walking up to the front door with a shot of the cops he just killed in the background.",Null,1,1,14 July 2001

","SPOILERS.A cliched and maudlin effort that is is apodictic is showing that Gibon's only piece de resistance is/and will be 'Braveheart'.  Obviously the creators were trying to mix 1940s war-movie sentimentality with the quotidian sanguinary tumult that is needed to 'authenticate' combat pictures today.  Maybe in a black comedy such a farrago would have worked, but here is is simply banal.Watch this film if you want to see how to make an endless battle scene boring.  Maybe they could have cut a few shots of bullet-ridden bodies and spent some time explaining why they left these infantrymen with their asses in the wind when it was evident that all they needed to do was call in air strikes (copters/planes) to smoke the enemy.",Null,0,0,30 March 2002

This movie has it all: a great story, superb acting, wonderful comedic moments, clever dialogue and fantastic character development.    Also timeless scenes pervade such as `no rules in a knife fight', the undressing scene when Katherine Ross's character is first introduced, the cliff jump and of course the fabulous ending in which director George Roy Hill stops the film but lets the sound continue thus revealing the pair's fate, but saving the audience the sadness of seeing it.

It perfectly captures both the madness of the Cold War and the essence of the film.  This is the defenitive black comedy with quirky dialouge, bizaree characters, and classic characters.

Alien," Not so much sci-fi, as curiously realistic
","WARNING SPOILERS!Though I had already seen this movie several times I was happy to watch it again during a film class in college called `Film and the American Hero'. The professor's goal obviously was to present a female protagonist for the course and he couldn't have done any better than the stirring character Ripley, played so dexterously by Sigourney Weaver. 	Though this would have been a great film without her, Weaver is outstanding as the confident ship officer turned termagant in order to battle the redoubtable, invidious foe that is the alien.  There is something indefinable about the expressions on her face that impel her character. Some sort of inner turmoil that surfaces in her countenance and mien.  She is also so subtlety sexy!  And if I may take a puerile moment; to see her scampering about in her underwear (obiter dictum--what a lithe, beautiful stomach) is a great amenity.
 	But it is more than the sylph that is Weaver that drives this motion picture.  For me it is the `reality' of the show.  So much so that I don't even categorize it as science-fiction.   Even though it is set in the future in an unknown section of the universe you don't have to suspend disbelief because of the verisimilitude that director Ridley Scott creates.   First he establishes characters that, even though they are placed in a time years from our own, they are still very authentic, complete with foibles and idiosyncrasies.  They gripe, laugh, misjudge, and most of all fear.  They show us that man as man has survived he also brings the concomitant social problems, in this case class struggle. They also remind us that no matter what technological advances mankind discovers, we will always be human.  Not that the machines are perfect. Scott creates an industrial background that is grimy and foreboding.  It is purposely done so as to not give an illusion of a glossed-over future. Scott wants you to know that this version of the future will not be spotless.  His machines are dirty, and function haphazardly from the granular video screens to malfunctioning motion-detectors.  They are noisy and require repairs.  The machines are not, shall we say, exactly simpatico. In fact they are in two exigent instances (the insidious android and the self-destructing vessel) they are arrantly malevolent.  It is against this mise en scene that Scott adroitly makes us take into account the periphery of his camera shots while dangling cords and industrial works meld darkly into a baleful background.  This is culminated in the shocking revelation that the creature has hidden itself on the shuttle among the machinery. What ultimately gives this film a noumenal aspect is the monster itself.  Of all the characters the monster is perhaps the most `real'.  This fierce beast is a quasi spider/wasp mixture and if we look at the horror of the everyday insect world (where blood is viciously drained from weaker life forms, and victims are implanted with eggs that survive like parasites on their tissue) we see how a creature sharing these characteristics, enhanced by size can be particularly virulent.  It is how one would expect such an animal be (the acid-for-blood thing is a little far out but even so, it is one of the monster's most interesting features and nicely increases the tension by complicating how the crew has to handle destroying it).
The underlying symbolism of course is the feminine turmoil.  The tunnels of the planet as well as the workings of the ship (called `Mother') clearly are a physical representation of the inner reproductive system/vaginal wall of a woman.  The creature itself is a symbol or reproduction and evolution with its protean abilities.  It is a paradox of growth and destruction.  It represents the dichotomy of the life-giving femininity and the threat of male-dominated violence.  Scott exemplifies this symbolism with the coterminous forced-fellatio scene (with a porno mag as an ordure touch) and the part of the film when the woman is killed by the alien as it advances upon her not recklessly, but slowly, furtively (seductively?) reaching a limb behind, and then up, her leg.
Of course the irony is that a woman destroys the evil entity in the end engendering a conclusion that poses the theory that survival is epicene.  A very interesting concept.",Null,0,1,2 December 2001
Full Metal Jacket," Intense but discursive
","Like 'Saving Private Ryan' this war picture opens with a tumult of intensity that leaves the viewer stunned.  In 'Ryan' it is the frenetic combat on the beach, in FMJ it is on the hell that is Paris Island.  Both openings are so impressive that they make the rest of their respective films seem digressive and unfocused.  In this movie that was undoubtably Kubrick's intention.  At times surreal, at other times painfully awkward (mainly though the use of jejune and trite dialouge) FMJ fades from the total control of boot camp to the searing liberation of brutal combat.  It is in the latter mileau that we find an ending that is a profound anti-climax to the strident begining. Overall a strong work that has pacing problems, but is more than compensated by some great lines from one of the most terrifying drill instructors on film.",Null,0,0,5 November 2001
Forrest Gump," A good story
","The Germans have a word for events that appear to be the result of a joke played by fate or history.  It is called treppenwitz.  I don't know if the filmmakers were aware of this word, but they sure knew how to use the spirit of it.  Treppenwitz pervades the many vicissitudes of the title character as his naivet√É¬© impels him not only through his own life, but also through many critical moments in history.  But, where many quirky takes on history dissolve into a one-joke show, `Forrest Gump' endears us, because of the touching nature of its simple protagonist.  As the story slips in and out of historical tableaus we focus not on the famous persons, but on Forrest, because only one as credulous as he could examine these happening impartially.Forrest could have been annoying, with his inane likeability and sententiousness.  But we realize that while we condescend to the verities that Forrest espouses, he is uncynical enough to find the implicit truth within them.  His simple nature is easy to admire, and perhaps even envy. Though only anecdotal, I have noticed that people who are concerned with the simpler aspects of life seem generally happier than others.  His credulousness serves as a sort of aloofness over many of life's drearier aspects.The bottom line is that I simply like films like this; low-key epics with the right mix of comedy, drama, and bits of history thrown in.  I'm not a big special effects buff, but here they are relevant in putting Forrest in the past, so I appreciate the work, and once more sing the praises of the magic of Hollywood.",Null,1,2,1 February 2002

Fargo," 'I'm not going to debate you Jerry. I'm not going to debate'
","SPOILERS!  This modern classic brought to us by the creative Coen brothers is great for the following reasons:1.) The actors are brilliant, reveling in roles that are interesting to play.  Particularly notable are Macy as the feckless Jerry Lundergard, McDormand as the affable, partly pixilated, Chief of Police and of course Buchemi in his element in a role of delicious degeneracy.2.) Dialogue. Or perhaps it is better just to call it quirky conversation, because that's what it is really. You just have to keep smiling at the accents and nonchalant banter, intertwined with telling character development and smart irony.  From the cavalier `Ja' interview between McDormand and the two young women who showed the inept criminals a good time, to the priceless parking lot attendant/authority discourse we are treated to a stream of palaver that is amusing and at the same time insightful.  We are so entertained that we don't even find it strange that Buchemi's character uses phrases like force majeure.3.) The bizarre circumstances that intersperse the story that are resolved through violence.  From the slapstick-like kidnapping scene to the fortuitous highway massacre to the disgusting wood chipper finale, the violence that underlies the generally flat exterior of the characters, is seemingly incongruous. It is however, a reminder that even though the people in this world are somewhat stolid, tumult and depravity pervades beneath the persona.  This is driven home in McDormand's expostulation to the surviving criminal near the end.4.) Jerry Lundergard.  There are numerous nuances to the film but the most interesting surround Macy.  A cashier gives him an egregious simper in a diner, his inept dealings with his oppressive father-in-law lend him our sympathy and his reply to his son, `Just ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya!' makes us cringe.  Two scenes with him are very piquant and tell us much about him: the true-coat scam, and the part where he enters his father-in-laws office to discuss a business deal and there is nowhere for him to sit.  Simply brilliant!A great movie.",Null,0,0,3 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Oh, the fine line between spectacle and travesty!
","Minor spoilersHave you ever heard that song about Tolkien's trilogy by the rock group Styx?  In it they ebulliently intone, `All hail to the Lord of the Rings, to the wonder and mystery it brings'.  Nope I'm not kidding.  It stands as a perfect example of how rock musicians should not try to incorporate classic books about fantasy worlds into their music (at least Led Zepplin had enough sense to only dally in self-indulgence by inserting a pithy, enigmatic reference to the LOR in `Ramble On').  So how would Hollywood fare in the quest to apply the LOR saga to another medium?  Well√Ç‚Ä¶Ultimately it comes down to the dividing line between those who have read the book and those who have not.  Those who are acquainted with Tolkien's world will appreciate the attempt at faithfulness that the filmmakers have made.  They will be able to fill in the lacunas that are engendered by the time constraint involved in movies (though this a rather long one for weak bladders).  They will be familiar enough with the characters, locations and situations to become as enthralled as one can with a film, that for all its effort cannot perform the impossible; that is live up to the book(s). 
Unfortunately, those who have not read the novel(s) will be benighted of the intricacies of Middle Earth and become easily confused.  The lack of in-depth explanation, offered by the novel, will leave those audience members wondering about many aspects of the film such as why the Fellowship members should be scared of Ringwraiths and Orcs when  they are so adept at slaughtering their numerous, pullulating masses, ala Rambo and his respective commies.  If they can kick their evil butts so easily why sweat it?   But that's just one item among many that makes this seem much like numerous other `quest' adventure films, where the protagonists battle one baneful threat after another.Another note: I am not a big fan of special effects, but in this case the wonders of modern computer technology lend themselves well in creating a stunning visual landscape.",Null,0,0,20 January 2002
Cast Away," Better than expected
","MINOR SPOILERSI saw this movie literally because I had nothing else to do.  I wasn't expecting much, I mean come on, a guy lost on a deserted island?  I think that's been done a time or two, and since I read 'Robinson Corusoe' and 'The Swiss Family Robinson' and have watched every episode of 'Gilligan's Island' I didn't think this would be much more than a few wasted hours.  It just goes to show how low expectations can affect your viewing, and it also demonstrates how the 'lost on an island' fantasy still appeals to us (hey, why do you think they have all those deserted island Top Tens and such). 
Of course this had some added attractions, such as the thrilling plane crash and the extended ego that is Wilson.  I also liked the fact that they continue his story after being rescued in some depth.  His welcome back into civilization and ultimate meeting with his lost love were well portrayed.  I guess the bottom line here is that if you can relate to the guy, and put yourself in his shoes, you will probably enjoy this one.  If you don't you probably won't.Because so many have asked I will give my take on the unopened box.  He leaves it sealed simply because it provides the only sense of mystery he has left in his dull existence.  The reason he says it saved his life is that because the pondering of what was in it gave him reason to live.  And as far as the ending I think he's at the crossroads and thinking about the lady's advice.  It's up to you to decide which direction he takes.  Personally I hope he goes after the woman in the pickup.",Null,0,0,8 February 2002
American Beauty," A flawed film, that could have been a masterpiece
","WARNING SPOILERS!This stunning portrait of American malaise could have been so much more. As it stands it is a series of outstanding vignettes (the opening, Benning's character's attempt to sell the house, the reading of Spacy's character's letter to his employer, the ludicrious 'real-estate sex scene', the drive-thru confrontation and the toy car, 'I rule' exchange) within a discursive mess.  The homosexual and poetic/social outcast side-plots come across as gratutiious.  Especially ridiculous is the percieved gay oral sex scene, complete with a conviently placed window pane and contrived positions (something like this was funny in 'Something About Mary', but it doesn't work here, because it is not meant to be funny). If the objective of the homosexual incidents was to somehow juxtapose them with Lester Burnam's prurient escapades they fail miserably.  This film works best when it focuses on the theme of suburban ennui.  There are three stories here and infusing them all was a mistake.
Bottom line, some great scenes with an convoluted story.",Null,0,0,28 July 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A great, fun sci-fi flick

I'm also not the type to see a movie simply for the special effects, but when they are exceptional, as they are here, I enjoy them.  The story is really what is good here however, and doesn't detract from the outstanding original.
	The film does have a couple of debatable aspects, namely the maudlin ending and parts when the cyber-guys don't act like machines (facial expressions when alone and obviously meant to impress the audience since no humans are around on the screen---and why oh why I ask you doesn't the bad Terminator just run after the victims in the plant at the end instead of just ominously walking?).  But I am more than willing to forgive those detractors as they add to the allure of the movie.  Overall an enjoyable piece of sci-fi filmmaking.",Null,1,1,28 July 2001
Apocalypse Now," Coppla shows why is one of the best.
","WARNING SPOILER ALERT!  One might postulate that Francis Ford Coppols was inspired by Dante's INFERNO rather than Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS when he made this film.  A virtual maelstrom throughout, continually cacophonous and frenetic, the auteur that brought us the GODFATHER saga explores the darkness of man's soul as well as the tumult that was Vietnam. Coppola weaves the motifs of violence and dread between scenes that have become ingrained in movie history lore.  The fulminations of the Air Cav attack and Do Lung Bridge battle are set ominously against a surreal background and vagarious dialouge.  The only problem here is that such a cataclysmic backdrop desensitizes the viewer; a flat surface of violence leaves no peaks and valleys in which the audience can breathe.  The ending is much more ambigious than Coppola may have intended (see DVD Special Features--Destruction of Kurtz Compound).  Is Kurtz coming to terms with the one eternal truth: That horror (and therefore war) is the only pure thing in life?

Aliens," Don't be silly, of course it's not as good as the original, but great in it's own right
","Spoilers.I don't normally care for sequels, but the few exceptions I find are in the sci-fi genre.  Then again this is almost not a sequel.  Yes Cameron uses many of the invidious topos from the original, but they are desparate enough in approach to make the link between the two almost circumstantial.  Where 'Alien' was primarily a psychological horror film (complete with underlying mysogamy and rape symbolism), 'Aliens' is an action-packed, in your face, frenzy.  This inverse structure was very prescient on Cameron's part.  He took a good tale of terror, a vile, redoubtable villain and really shook up the mix.  And by adding more creatures he increases the horror expotentially.He did keep one aspect of the precursor in tact, as well he should have: Changes in technology are present with futuristic equipment, but the characters stay very human (the Marines talk like Marines, corporate greed subverts survival, etc).  Also there is some clever dialogue.  My two favorites: Newt ominously stating 'They mostly come out at night...mostly' and Bill Paxton (perfect in his comic relief assignment) telling Paul Reiser, 'Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked'.",Null,0,0,5 March 2002
The Exorcist," Return of that 'chill' down my spine.
","WARNING SPOILER ALERT THROUGHOUT!!!  I just purchased THE EXORCIST on DVD and watched it for the first time in years.  Once again I was reminded just how disturbing this movie is.  It is one of the few movies that actually makes it hard for me to sleep with the lights out. I've heard from those who claim not to be frightened by this horror masterwork, but they must be a.) lying b.) extremely pious c.) agnostic or d.) fatuous.  If you have any belief in God, Satan or evil spirits then this movie has to affect you. The most chilling aspect of this work is the nefarious comment by the demon to Father Karras that 'we've got your mother in here too.'  Can you imagine? What an invidious attack on the psyche.  This iconoclastic stab at our filial ethos should be studied in a sociology class. In addition the perversely piquant 'crucifix masturbation' tableau challenges our emotional endurance.  And while I believe that this scene is germaine, I can understand the calls to expurgate it.  I do find that Friedkin and Blatty walk a thin line with the ending by centering it around an underdeveloped character (the priest who is the common friend of Chris and Karras). It is odd because it seems that including him in one more scene would have solidified his character and added credibilty to his apperance in giving the last rights to Karras as well as being the last person shown before the credits roll. I think if he had been included in a scene with Karras and the demon in which he has to leave the room, because he is too weak.  This would add to his relevance and serve as a good lead in to bringing in Father Merrin.  I also agree with Blatty who thought the final scene should have been the one shot with the priest (Karras' friend) and Detective Kinderman, which is less ominous (see DVD special features- MISSING SCENES). Speaking of which, I must add that leaving the 'spiderwalk' scene on the cutting room floor was a good idea.",Null,1,3,4 February 2001

","The most interesting aspect of this film is the slip the filmmakers make at the end.  In trying to bring the story full circle they show a flashback where the character played by Norton is given advice by his father.  This is where they were trying to show how people learn prejudice from their parents (which is true to some extent, but not as prevalent as some would have us believe--many people actually become prejudice because of life experiences). The problem is that other than the injected racial slur, the father's advice is RIGHT ON TARGET!  Think for yourself, read a book but make up your own mind about it.  Don't let a teacher, book, media, whatever tell you what is absolute truth, take them all in and then see what passes the common sense test.

Flashdance," Great 80s movie. Warning Spoilers!
","So there I was an 18 year-old U.S. Army private newly stationed in Fulda Germany, still to afraid to wander outside the gate of the base into a foreign country.  So what was there to do but to go to the post theater and watch a movie called `Flashdance'?  (Later on after I ventured outside the base and became comfortable with my surroundings I also saw this flick in a German cinema).
	Well I've always had a predilection for dark haired, dark eyed women anyway, so when the preternatural pulchritude that is Jennifer Beals (and her dancing body double) filled the screen I was in elysium.   For that dreamy hour and a half, Jennifer filled the romantic void of a lonely, girlfriendless kid who was very far from home. 	This film has been too often dismissed as plotless; a charge that is not only unfair but also unobservant.  The story of a young girl struggling with the vicissitudes of her life (as well as her friends) and trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a renowned dancer is as much, or more, of a plot as many standard Hollywood projects.  And if one looks closely there is even occasional symbolism (though possibly not intended by the creators) such as the wayward friend falling in the gutter after her dirty money and the final scene where Alex (Beals) gets up after falling during her audition, unlike her ice-skating friend who gives up after a similar occurrence.
 	I know that the music and trendy aspects of the film (break dancing-MTV like music sequences) made the movie a target for `cash-in' critics.  But I think that a second look by these detractors would reveal a charming storyline, with strong (though not realistic) characters.  In fact one of the movies great plusses is the development of the folks that surround Alex (the elderly and dear Hanna who encourages her dreams, her problem-possessing friends that serve to enhance Alex's amiable self, the aging club dancer that profoundly affects her at the movie's close, the degenerate rival club owner, and even her homely dog) all of whom are presented in clear-cut (though predictable-which is what is called for) scenes that establish their purpose.  None of these characters are superfluous and all add to the story.
Add to this some extremely apropos music (the title track may be the most inspirational show tune since the theme from Rocky), a great sense of direction which adroitly goes from over the top to subtlety (such as the scene when Alex first tries to turn in an application to the conservatory which uses a shot of the shoes worn by the women in line, as well as inaudible whispers to drive the scene), a VERY funny punch in the stomach, and an ending that is uplifting and you have a great romantic movie.",Null,1,2,21 July 2001
Saving Private Ryan," A great film that has suffered from backlash (and pretentious reviews here)
","Warning spoiler alert!
	You can't fault one for claiming that every thing that occurs after the tumultuous D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan is anticlimactic.  True one supposes, but not really apposite.  The remainder of this Spielberg tour de force would have made an exceptional film, but the opening sequence must truly be judged sui generis.
	That particular maelstrom on the Omaha beach is as impressive a display of controlling disorder as any in filmmaking.  The obstreperous milieu, the frenetic panic (adroitly interspersed with slow motion to show the effect of the fulmination), and the recherch√© violence (to the point where many vets have claimed that the auteur went beyond the actual level of blood and gore) are all here in sobering collusion and detail.
	The rest of the film is still well worth viewing, it simply cannot carry the same weight in motion picture achievement that the D-Day beginning does. The plot and dialogue are good and the acting is well done (no standout performances, the historical background is the star).  Also several scenes are striking: General Marshall's eloquent reading of President Lincoln's letter, the mother losing her strength on the porch as she meets the announcers of her children's demise, the morphing of the young Ryan into the older man.

Patton," De nobis fibula narrabitur
","This incredible picture begins with one of the greatest openings in film history.  The image of General George S. Patton, standing like a giant with the American flag in the background, is an iconic masterwork of character development.  This scene truly sets the tone.  Patton was a definite student of history and this address to his men was reminiscent of motivational speeches that great ancient commanders like Hannibal and Scipo would deliver.  He knew the tactics of those classic warriors well and he parlayed his study of battle and his joie de combat into becoming one of the greatest American generals ever.Patton was a complex man and George C. Scott captures his essence brilliantly.  His dichotomous nature was vividly captured by Scott in the infamous hospital scene where he slaps the soldier.  The moments prior to that reveal much about the man as he knells before an unresponsive soldier, his face bandaged and covered by an oxygen mask, and whispers thoughtfully into his ear.  The look of pain on Scott's face as he contemplates the fate of one of his men is impressive.  He certainly was the right choice for this over the top role, just as Karl Malden was for the understated part of Omar Bradley. Thankfully this movie was made during the greatest era in American filmmaking, the late 60s/early 70s when other historical figures (Bonnie & Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, many of the characters form `Little Big Man', etc) were adopted into intriguing, epic works.  A movie like this would have fallen well short of the achievement made here, if it was attempted today.  Can you imagine a director like Oliver Stone doing this?  No offense to him, `Platoon' is one of my all time favorites, and I respect `Natural Born Killers', but he would have made a travesty of this story.General Patton is still widely revered in military culture today.

Black Hawk Down," A protracted firefight
","Here's the deal.  This movie is a recreation of a protracted firefight on the streets of Mogadishu Somalia.  It's not pro-war, it's not anti-war. It's not racist, it's not anti-muslim, it's not pro American (though it is from the U.S. GI's perspective).  It's not about big stars, like it could have been (Tom Crusie would have jumped at this).  It's a look at what happened on those two fateful days. That's it, no more no less.  If you want to see a drawn out battle scene, with much guts and gore, then see this.  If that's too much for you skip it.Additionaly:Re the maudlin 'tell so-and-so I love her, fought well' criticism.  It is my understanding that these are based on the comments heard by survivors.  If that is what the dying men said, why exclude it just because it may sound sappy?  Think about it, what would you say if you were dying and there was someone there to pass along the message?  Whether we have been programmed by Hollywood to be sentimental when we die (as in all the old war movies) or it's just a natural thing to do, people do say things like that in extremis (remember the teacher from the Columbine shooting?  All the students who were with him said he wanted them to tell his family he loved them).  We hear accounts like this all the time from witnesses to dying individual's final words.  I was not there so I can't tell you what was said, but since all we have is the information from those who talked to these soldiers right before they died, let's give them the benefit of the doubt.The racism charge:  Well first off, yes many black folks are killed because that's what really happened.  Let's all join together to keep the politically correct attack dogs away from that fact before they rewrite history once again. Now why more blacks weren't represented among the U.S. forces I'm not sure why.  I am in the Army and I can assure you that the proportion of blacks in the ranks is much higher than was shown.  I can only offer that it is my understanding that Scott wanted to be as factual as possible trying to represent the actual combatants, so maybe they were mainly white.  I can also offer the following antedotal items: Though there are many minorites in the U.S. Army I have noticed that amoung the Rangers and Special Forces, there are far fewer.  I don't know why (and by the way I am not a Ranger of Green Beret) this is, but it seems to be the case at least from my perspective; and I saw this film at a special showing in Korea at the Army post Theater and the audience was about 1/3 black and they didn't seem at all concerned with any racist overtones.  You could tell who they were supporting because you would hear a few muted cheers when a Somali was shot, and a groan or gasp when a white U.S. soldier was hit.  I guess some things transend race.I feel sad that so many did not realize this happened or don't remember it. The image of those soldiers bodies being dragged through the streets has stuck with me since the first time I saw it on TV.  Shugart and Gordon are true heroes going into that crash site, and all famous actors/actresses, musicains, sports stars, etc aren't even close to qualifying to being the role models that those two should be to every one.",Null,0,0,19 January 2002

","Life Is Beautiful	When I first heard of this film's concept, comedy against the backdrop of a Nazi concentration camp, I thought it was brilliant.  Upon seeing the movie I discovered that my initial impression was right.  Roberto Benigni has achieved a true masterpiece with this work, which will be remembered years from now for its greatness.
	Benigni's character is so endearing that he is able to make the contrived slapstick and serendipity that pervades the first half of the film consistently amusing.  It is only in the darkness of the concentration camp that we truly understand the necessity of establishing his comic character. Threaded within this comic/horrific juxtaposition are scenes of emotional power: his gentile wife's demand to get on the train with her Jewish husband and son, the dashing of hope over the realization that the potentially life-saving doctor is insane, Benigni's character's interpretation of the German guard's instructions all are indelible.  And finally the part where Guido (Benigni) walks to certain death as his son watches, still believing that they are playing a game for a prize and totally unaware of the evil surrounding him, is a vignette that is rivaled by few in film history.
	Ultimately, in the throes of inhumanity the potential of humanity shines. As the older son narrates at the conclusion this was his father's gift to him, as this film is a gift to the rest of us.

A Clockwork Orange," Deeply disturbing
","Minor spoilers.One of the few films that I have thought worthy after reading the book first.  It is undoubtably due to Kubrick's faithful adaption of the sui generis novel by Anthony Burgess.  Upon recently completing Dickens' Oliver Twist, I was struck by the many similarities between that work and Burgess' depraved book.  Separated by over 100 years, they both use the streets of London for their scrofulous settings.  Both authors use violence and clever street argot to enhance their stories.  Both use youth as a vehicle to study corruption.Kubrick keeps true to his inspiration's synchronic testament by avoiding the cause of profligacy, and instead dwelling on its effect. The dystopian world in Clockwork attempts to thwart immorality through science.  This method precludes the proclivity toward recidivism, but thrusts on society the transgression of dehumanizing part of its populace.The film's terminus ad quem leads us to an invidious reality that evil must co-exist with humanity.  This is presented ominously and darkly.  But it is a fitting ending to a disquieting story.WARNING!!!

","Warnig Spoliers.	A true gem of a movie, that I was very pleased with after the first viewing and has never disappointed since.  The concept of the film, reliving the same day again and again, is a solid one and the filmmakers make the most of it.  Director/writer Harold Ramis and co-writer Danny Rubin take the story of a curmudgeonly weather forecaster trapped perpetually in the same day from a cleverly set up beginning to a fitting terminus.  They intertwine the repetitions of the eternal day with the vicissitudes of our reluctant subject and produce a work that is both smart and filled with jeu d' esprit. Add the comic genius of Bill Murray and the strong support of Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot and you have a notable comedy. 	 Of course I must admit that the very idea of reliving a day is a reoccurring fantasy of mine, as I'm sure it is with many.  The old wish, `if I could just go back and redo that' is in essence I guess a way to deal with regret and reconsideration of moments passed.  That is why films such as this and `Family Man' and `Disney's The Kid' have such an appeal.  The difference between those films and this one is that I could not find any room for improvement here.

Rocky," Why I hate sequels
","The sequels (though at times entertaining) to this movie, along with the coterminous 'Rambo' series, almost made this crtitcally acclaimed, truly great film a joke.  They also nearly ruined the premise of this original, that of a middling fighter, albeit with voluminious heart, takes his one shot at glory and catches a much more talented man off gaurd.  In the subsequent movies Balboa becomes a 'great' boxer, and we lose one of the most endearing characters in film history.  This egregious example confirms that sequels are self-serving and spoil the imagination of viewers of the orginal work.The main reason that this work is so moving is the character development of the title character.  From his inept attempts at loanshark enforcement and romance, to his moments alone in his seedy apartment staring in the mirror, talking to his pets, to the advice given to the young girl, we find this man of violence very appealing. His development (and pari passu transformation of Adrian-played brilliantly by Shire) culminates in the poignant moment when he reveals to Adrain that though he knows he cannot win, if he can just go the distance he'll know that he wasn't 'just another bum from the neighborhood'.  And go the distance he does--in one of the greatest fight sequences ever made.Other plusses:  The inspiring theme song which swells perfectly as he accends the steps, the intersting love story, and the fabulous acting of Shire, Young, Weathers and Meredith.A great film.",Null,0,0,24 December 2001

What a film such as 'Vertigo' lacks that 'Psycho' has is edginess.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of the best
","SPOILERSThough this movie was released in 1975, and would therefore be termed mid-seventies, I still group it in the great late 60s/early 70s era of movies.  That is because the theme of the anti-hero, so prevalent in the plots of so many films from that time, is paramount here.  The character of Randle P. McMurphy epitomizes a heroic figure, without the normal qualities of a paladin, in an unheroic setting and circumstances (and in this case the most unlikely of places, a mental ward).  The acting is unbelievable not just by Fletcher (superb!) and Nicholson (who will never surpass his effort here) but the entire cast (featuring unknown at the time talents like Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd).The story is outstanding, the dialogue compelling and of course the memorable scenes.  Who could forget the `invisible' World Series', the boat trip in which McMurphy introduces the patients as `doctors' to a suspicious harbor master and as the camera shows each, we are given a vivid portrait of the fine line between sanity and insanity, and the dreadful confrontation between the newly empowered Billy and the insidious Nurse Ratched that ends so tragic. Two scenes stand out particularly, where Chief reveals that he can hear and speak and of course the great, great ending!  It is a paradoxical finale to say the least.  Who could not be saddened as the Chief bravely shows all the mercy he can in saving McMurphy from a living death and who could not be inspired as he tosses the fountain through the window.

The Green Mile," Not 'Shawshank Part II', much to my relief.
","Minor spoilers.I was skeptical when I heard about this movie.  I thought, like I'm sure many others did, that after the achievement of `Shawshank' that the same director (Frank Darabont) was making another prison movie based on the same author as the previously mentioned work.  To put it bluntly, this had the possibility of disaster via redundancy written all over it. 
Of course I loved it.  Probably because its use of a prison is more of a vehicle for its apologue, than the dominant presence that it was in `Shawshank'.  The numinous aspect of the story was also enjoyable, as it never seemed to overcome the humanistic portion of the tale.  And like all non-horror King films it has a certain, well¬ÖKingesque (for the lack of a better word) quality that pervades adaptations of his works (`Stand By Me', `Hearts in Atlantis', etc).   There is a kind of quaint, yet mystical element to these film versions that always seems to transplant you into their world for the duration of the film.How you ultimately feel about this movie probably comes down to how you feel about powerful manipulation in the guise of pure evil (Percy and Wild Bill) and pure good (John Coffey).  In fact Coffey is not only innocent he is a veritable saint, and inevitable martyr in a plot that is as old as¬Öwell as old as Jesus Christ.  The gray areas between the polarizing forces of morality are the rest of the prison guards and other death row inmates.  We learn much about one of the guards, Paul Edgecomb (Hanks), and a little about his co-workers, but what is significant is what we learn about two of the condemned.  Character development and themes of repentance pervade our dealings with Arlen and Del, and tug at our sympathy, while leaving almost no knowledge of their criminal acts to use in judging them.  This is probably best, because they are fictional characters, so the filmmakers can't be excused of glossing over anything heinous, and it precludes a probable mire in dichotomy, which would lengthen an already long motion picture.It is always an interesting phenomenon, in my opinion, how all the dramatics, sweeping music, appealing actors, and other blandishments of the big screen can engender affinity with characters we would normally excoriate.",Null,0,0,27 January 2002

","Sometimes it's not simply that a movie is great, it's also the memories that surround the first time you watched it.  For me one of those great reminisces is when my older brother Rick took me to see `Jaws' in the summer of 1975.  This was a big deal to an eleven-year-old kid.  I doubt if he remembers, but I always will.  Just like I'll remember how I wouldn't swim in the neighborhood pool for the rest of that summer after watching this Spielberg classic.
	I also recall the precedence that this film set in the horror genre by opening the movie with a scene in which the monster claims a victim.  This was such a revelation that I remember telling a friend about the movie and he was totally aghast at such an iconoclastic beginning.  `You can't do that' he exclaimed, `you have to have clues leading up to creature, then something happens!'  Even at that age I realized that this was shaking things up.  Soon a slew of nature vs. man flicks inundated the market and each had a creature (be it grizzly bear, piranha, etc) start the movie off with a violent episode.
	Of course this is a fantastic scare-flick, but the reason it has stood the test of time (and the shame of ersatz sequels) is that is more than a frightening movie.  The dialogue is smart and the characters are interesting and very well developed.  From the central troika of Brody, Hooper and Quint to lesser characters such as the chief's wife and the mayor the players satisfy and represent what we want them to.  Not to mention the clever nuances (during the scar-comparing badinage Brody slightly lifts his shirt and glances at a scar that you can tell he wants to mention, but obviously decides not to-and this leaves the moment more fulfilling by what is not said) and the side bars (the implied conflict between Brody and his wife and their current residence, the disparity between Hooper and Quint, etc) that add verisimilitude to the work.  Also adroitly included are adumbrations such as the `Welcome to Amity' sign, and Quint sailing by with a large grin as the fisherman hang the tiger shark up thinking they have caught the beast in question (we share this irony with Quint and it's very enjoyable) as well as quick scenes (the overweight lady heading into the water) that we like as we watch the movie but don't remember when later on we try to explain why we like this film so much.",Null,0,1,1 August 2001
Kingpin," Funny stuff
",The Farrlley Brothers Kingpin is a funny and impudent movie that you can watch at least yearly and find that it doesn't lose its risible qualities. The script is well crafted and the cast is felicitous.  Bill Murray is particularly unfettered in his abject role.  Among a myriad of humorous moments two stand out: Roy's (Woody Harrelson) toilet-hugging `after the loving' scene and Ishmael's (Randy Quaid) contretemps at the men's room urinal.  A good choice if you simply want to mentally disport.,Null,0,0,9 June 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," A tremendous story and well done film.
","This outstanding work is coterminous with films like `The Longest Yard' and `Cool Hand Luke' in that it touches upon our ambivalence about prison inmates.  It is indicative of the dichotomous view that our society has in regard to the penal system when we can clarion lex talions among our fellow citizens yet identify with and cheer on movie criminals in theatres.  Quite possibly it is the underlying threat of being immured ourselves, as we realize that it is really a fine line that keeps us free.
	Of course it takes more than a play on our hidden fears to produce a film this good.  It takes a good script, solid acting and characters that we can give a damn about, all of which are gathered here brilliantly.  Above all it takes a good story, and obviously Frank Darabont knew one when he adapted this Stephen King novella into a movie script (you never really can tell what you will end up with when you endeavor to bring one of King's books to the big screen).  He also knows how to use a camera to draw us into the prison world and how to exploit the power of narration (assisted nicely by the warm voice and splendid diction of Freeman).
	SPOLIER ALERT!!!  A truly great movie must have a truly great ending and this film actually has two.  They could have ended it right after revealing the circumstances surrounding the escape as Freeman explains that he just misses his friend and it would have been fitting, but they continued and finish with a fabulous moment on the beach as Freeman succinctly explains in a voice over, `I hope'.  For those of you who try to say that you could see the end coming a mile away---forget it; sell it to someone who's buying.",Null,0,0,19 August 2001
Platoon," 'Death? Whadda ya'll know about death?'
","SPOILERSThis sits right behind `The Godfather' as my all time favorite movie. Actually I have probably watched this film more times than any other.  A friend and I had seen this so many times that if one of us quoted a line from it the other would answer with the next part of the script and then we would go on for about 15 minutes verbatim from the dialogue (much to the annoyance of anyone around us).Though I've never been in combat, I have been in the Army for 17 years and I have a feeling (from knowing my fellow soldiers like I do) that this movie is accurate in portraying combat and the life of the grunt in Vietnam.  And if it is this verite that compels the film, it the acting that keeps it focused.  The supporting cast is tight and the three main players (Sheen, Berenger and Dafoe) are outstanding.  Stone really inspired these men and brought out indelible performances.The intensity of this work is severe.  It is commensurate with a good horror film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but in this case the horror is all too real.  Three scenes are particularly nonplusing: the playing of `Tracks of My Tears' in the middle of the film as a clear point in which to delineate the hopelessness of the soldiers; the fulminating village scene culminating in Barnes with the gun to the little girls head and the disconcerted face of Chris as he strains with emotion, wanting to say something; and the incomparable tableau of Elias' death, arms outstretched to the sky as the chopper flies by.  That scene has affected me like few scenes ever have, and it always takes me a few minutes to recover from it. It is one of the most powerful film moments I have ever seen. And Stone's choice of `Aidiago For Strings' for the background music was very perceptive.The only question I have about the movie is the ending.  I can't praise it or condemn it.  I suppose that it is realistic, but it seems to lessen the humanity of Chris especially considering his final words about going from this point to make a better world.  It just seems like such a great film deserved a better ending but, as I cannot come up with one myself, I'll keep my criticism low.  A quick side note: I met Corey Glover who played `Francis' (the guy who stabs himself in the leg at the end in order to go home) in Stuttgart Germany.  He was the lead singer for the band `Living Colour' (they had a hit with the song `Cult of Personality') and they were playing a club there. He was very cordial and talkative.  I didn't realize at the time that he had even been in the film until I watched it for a second time on video and noticed his name.",Null,0,1,10 January 2002
Paths of Glory," Compelling
","Though using the milieu and tumult of war for its setting this is really a morality play more than an anti-war movie. Frankly the term 'anti-war' has become trite, I guess it's defined as a film that shows war as less than glorious, and that's really not a hard thing to do.  This is a great film, but the one dimensional characters are create a manipulative emotional trail (personally I don't mind being manipulated and feeling passionate in films). And I think criticism that Kubrick took the easy way out here in regards to characterization may be justified.  In fact I was very surprised that he did nothing with the scar on the General's face--it was obvious the man had 'been there' as far as combat goes, so it would have been an interesting juxtaposition.",Null,0,0,23 January 2002

Vanilla Sky," I'm ambivilent
","Spoilers.Have you ever seen that skit on Letterman called `Is That Anything'?  What happens is the curtain rises to reveal someone doing something odd (like spinning giant balls with their feet while standing on their head) and Dave and Paul Schaffer discuss whether it was something of substance or mere bagatelle.  It is the ultimate in subjective self-awareness (even if it is ironic and a tad silly).  After viewing this film I feel like I just watched one of those skits and am ambivalent about my impressions.  I'm simply just not sure if this a surreal piece de resistance or turbid mess.I liked the opening dream sequence where Cruise is running through the deserted city streets and I liked the odd musical juxtapositions against the incongruous happenings on the screen.  I even liked Penelope Cruz and thought she was very sexy after being so annoyed by her in the last film in which I saw her (`Blow').  And I am eternally infatuated with Cameron Diaz. But the real reason I think I may like this flick is the concepts of athanasia and solipsism that it tackles.  It's only natural to want to live forever and I've long had a fantasy about technology creating a super virtual reality, where you are strapped in a bed, your mind accessed and a world of your choosing induced.  A kind of `living fa√É¬ßade' if you will.At this point I feel this is a good movie, but I'm not sure it is a great one (a great one being defined as one I would purchase for repeated viewings).

Signs," I want my $8.50 back!
","'The Sixth Sense' is in my Top 20 of all time, but I found 'Unbreakable' unbearable, and now 'Signs' to be a sign that good ol' M. Night is a one trick pony.  Now I have no problem suspending disbelief when warranted but this borders on the ridiculous. SPOILERS!!!! I could level a list of flaws but I don't want to be pedantic, so I'll just cover my top three: 1.) As rightly noted by so many others the inconsistancy of the aliens' powers is a huge problem 2.) The reason they choose to stay in the house (a vote? you've got to be kidding me) is weak--comon' how about their car doesn't work or they aliens are already outside, etc 3.) A total lack of verisimilitude in terror, the kids were way too cool and the adults barely pick up an object (any object-which would be a natural reaction) to defend themselves until the end.  Instead Mel picks up cooking utensils and makes dinner.  In fact that scene with Phoneix going up the stairs to see if the aliens were gone without grabbing an ax, hammer or anything was one of the most implausible moments I have seen on film.Well I did like the faith restored portion, and I thought the flashbacks (and coincidence/destiny) were well woven into the thick of things. Also the part when the Doctor tells Mel that one of them is in his pantry was really strong and showed potential, too bad I just wasn't able to overcome the fact that these aliens who can mask their ships in mid air can't get out of a pantry.  I think some type of terrestrial creatures would have been better suited here.",Null,2,3,17 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," A dark, yet intelligent mise en scene.
","SPOILERS!!! (Though if you don't know the deal with this one you've been living in a cave)
Director M. Night Shyamalan knows what scares us.  He knows that fear lies in our imagination and that imagination is strongest during childhood. That's why he uses a child to explain to us that the chills we sometimes get and items we misplace have an ominous explanation.  He understands why we are scared as we sit around the campfire listening to a good ghost story. He knows that though we may have become more cynical and sure in the world as we grow older, we maintain enough eidetic comprehension to think that there just might be ghosts.
Shyamalan also knows how to scare us.  He brings verisimilitude to the project by playing on our personal fears.  He makes us recall the long walk down a dark hallway to the bathroom when we were children after waking up and having to urinate.  He makes us remember the dilemma of trying to hold it versus stirring in the darkness of our room and feeling our way to the door.  By using a situation familiar to all and reprising our childhood bogeymen, the discomfort becomes intimate.
That's why this movie works from both the over the top foreboding, such as the disturbed Vincent muttering, `Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone? I do.' to the sine qua non subtleties that are handled with empressment.  Most notable among the latter is a crafty moment when the father of the poisoned girl watches in horror as the cause of her demise is revealed on video.  In the background we see the folded hands of an unknown viewer that nervously pull apart and tug at the clothing near the throat. What a recherch√© touch!
Shyamalan seems to have the knack for knowing when to show us something and when not to so.  Not revealing who opened all the drawers and cabinets, leaving the inmate in the attic unseen, and having Cole glance quickly away from a passing graveyard while on the bus add a numinous appeal.  Yet he astutely uses visual shocks to keep us on edge and remind us to be scared in a film that is so easy to admire for its visual beauty and detail: angry ghosts quickly stalk by, hanging bodies materialize, ghastly apparitions appear at car windows, all adding up to a m√©lange of the supernatural incarnate.
He treats the terrestrial characters with equal flair.  He is particularly adept at using body language to make a point as when we witness the hand of Cole's mother drop exasperated on the dinner table in an expression of anger that is far more emotive than revealing her face. Another satisfying moment is the humorous `jewelry sale' scene where the couple's faces, enclosed in a tight shot, make the most of human countenance, unfortunately leaving the incisive dialogue an afterthought. And while these brilliant physical nuances ingratiate our subconscious the work's efficacy may actually lie in the tour de force of timing and perspective as is demonstrated in the trenchant `step game' tableau.  In this scene camera shots break from Cole's footsteps (back and forth) to a commensurate movement to and from Malcom's face.  A simple idea? Yes.  A powerful image? Yes!
Of course many movies can produce scary moments, but the few that do maintain the pace in engaging the audience via character development.  It's become hard to commiserate with the quotidian teenage victims in slasher-flicks, but vis-√†-vis the dramatis personae assembled here our empathy is easier to reach.  Our cynicism is ablated and we care about these people.  We understand the special nature of the already-established relationship between Cole and his mother, evinced nicely by the `what did you do today' colloquy in which her fanciful exaggeration is juxtaposed with his sad dreams of just being accepted by his peers.  Conversely we also appreciate the glimpse into the developing friendship of Malcom and Cole as their emerging trust is shown as the former's confession of marital neurasthenia melds with the latter's sub rosa revelation, `I see dead people.'
Oh and to all those who claim that they could see the ending coming: give it up, we all know better.",Null,0,0,4 November 2001
The Truman Show," Big Brother meets reality TV
","SPOILERS.I've never been a fan of Jim Carey, but the idea behind this film intrigued me.  I'm glad I saw it because it is an incredible work.  In fact I am duly impressed with the completeness of the entire project.  The script, direction, performances and attention to detail all mix to create a veritable trompe l' oeil, much like the fictitious world of Truman.This innovative film appeals to so many compelling concepts: The ubiquitous dint of television, the inclination of people to live vicariously through others, the turbid line between reality and the illusory, and the paranoia that someone is always `watching us'.  At times I think that I must be some unwitting actor on a giant stage, being manipulated by some demiurgic force, because the world seems too ludicrous (not to mention the people that inhabit it) to be real.Of course the most piquant aspect of the movie is the exploration of the idea of a higher being.  Truman's quest for the truth of his specious world is analogous to man's search for the meaning of religion, and ultimately, God.  This is played out masterfully here.  When the transmission is cut a person from the barroom exclaims `Jesus, God In Heaven!'  As Truman nears his escape Sylvia (from outside of the fake world) ironically prays for his deliverance.  Christof (catch the name?), played by Ed Harris, sits in his control room as the eminence grise of Truman's world.  As the `creator' of the TV show that Carey's character dwells in, his position is plenary.  The trouble is that Truman has questions that his ostensible family and friends cannot answer.  Truman knows his life is a mendacious trap and he wants manumission.  Ultimately Truman and Christof collide at the boundary of the fa√É¬ßade as the former forces a theomachy.  The omnipotent entity tries to force his recalcitrant subject to repent and return to his existence, but he refuses and finally rejects his originator. Other moments in the film are as entertaining as the concepts are deep.  The technological glitches are amusing and the people trying to get on the set and warn him are great (esp. the guy jumping out of the Christmas present). The viewers are interesting too; the lady who ignores her crying child in order to see the show, the elderly women who watch so intently, and of course the security guards who provide the movie's prescient ending when they realize the show is finally over, `What else is on?'",Null,0,0,25 January 2002

The story here is tight and Deniro and Pesci are in their element, but Stone really drives the flick to it's depraved destination.  She was excellent.  And unlike many I loved the voiceovers and thought they provided a wry nexus to the work.I presume that most reading these reviews have already seen this movie, but a word of caution to those who have not: The violence is blatant and HARSH (though not gratutious) so be prepared to be somewhat disturbed by it.",Null,1,1,8 June 2002
Heat," 'just as every cop is criminal'--Stones, 'Sympathy for the Devil'
","One thing's for sure: Michael Mann knows how to write satisfying dialogue. Taking a cue from older movies that featured great words and sentences, that were of course unlikely to be spoken extemporaneously, he treats the audience to diction that is smart yet unpretentious.  Not that all the dialogue is unrealistic, there is plenty of middle brow conversation, he just knows that audiences don't always want to hear what they do everyday on the screen.  Case in point: the great exchange between Pacino and Venora after he comes home 3 hours late for dinner and doesn't want to discuss his day.
	Of course that's not the only instance of brilliance in this film.  The clever juxtapositions (relationships--both between men and women and friends-the separate dining out scenes; one with the cops one with the crooks and even a subtle touch such as Pacino and Deniro gouging the eyes of a combatant in different fight scenes), the enthralling scenes (the diner meeting between the tow main characters and the bank robbery-a rare demonstration of violence that is overt yet not gratuitous) and the simple intrigue that is police work all add to a spectacular work of film.

The Thin Red Line," A circumlocution that makes me wonder....
","Sometimes I believe in solipsism. You have to at least consider it after viewing a show such as this.  I don't mean solipsism as defined as total self-absorption, I'm referring to the somewhat uncomfortable feeling that one exists alone and the rest of world only lives in the mind.  And in a paranoid turn I may consider the fact that I am a sort of guinea pig being manipulated by some force majeure, a la `The Truman Show'.  How else can you explain such soi-disant `art' films, such as this and `Blue Velvet'?  It can only be some omnipotent being whose maniacal experiment is to test the reaction of a human who witnesses a film that is uncommonly bad, only to see it incongruously praised by strategically-placed chimeras (that would be the majority of the posters here). The `reality' of the matter is that the `Thin Red Line' is bad beyond the pale.  It is a discursive mess wrapped snuggly in sweeping camera work.  It is overwrought and ponderous.  Its attempt to achieve surrealism is forced and achromic.  And if I may be so priggish I should point out that the filmmakers fail to observe a simple rule in moviemaking by making the characters indistinguishable.  Here the dramatis personae look so much alike, and are so inconspicuous we are left with a turbid jumble.

Braveheart," A stirring epic
","A remarkable film in which I can watch several times without faltering.  I am as much a lover of history as I am of film and literature, so I must acknowledge that this film is loosely based on the life of Wallace and does fall short in numerous instances to historical verity.  That said it remains a stunning achievement in film work liberally reconstructions actual events in order to present a gripping modern epic.
	The entire movie is engaging but two scenes stand out: The `gift of the thistle' moment when the beautiful young Murron presents the young Wallace with a wildflower at his father's funeral.  Few tableaus in film history can match the power here as the music swells in harmony with touching scene. The tremendous Stirling battle scene (though vastly historically inaccurate) is also a piece de resistance, from Wallace's rousing speech to his contempt for the English commander, from the comic relief of the mooning and flashing of the recalcitrant Scots and finally the riveting battle itself (that may only possibly be rivaled by Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landing sequence for sheer power in a battle scene).  It's also notable that the script and Gibson's direction provide for a juxtaposition of this violence with the soothing powers of femininity; the bride who eases her husband's wrath sotto voce and gently pushes the adversaries blade from his throat, the lure of a life with Murron in which Wallace initially attempts to stay clear of war and the obvious benevolence of the princess.

Born on the Fourth of July," A powerful, engaging film.
","Ron Kovic, Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise form a creative triumvirate (as story source, director, and lead actor, respectively) in this moving Vietnam War saga.  Together they achieve a piece de resistance in filmmaking.  Cruise's performance is particularly scintillating in the role of crippled war veteran Kovic.  Under the aegis of Stone he efficaciously moves through the vicissitudes of Kovic's life and personal ethos.  Cruise's style lends itself well to a character that has one enduring passion that does not diminish in intensity, but does change focus (the strength of purpose is just as strong as he explains to his father why he must go to war as when he denounces the conflict to reporters at the Republican convention).
As for Stone he adroitly avoids trying to parlay the `period piece' aspect of the film, and instead concentrates on the bitter ironies (a friend gives the recently paralyzed Kovic some trite business advice `you've got to walk before you can run') and adumbrations (a man brags that his family has participated in all that nations wars and will continue to as the camera shows his grandson).  And by keeping the actual Vietnam combat footage in perspective with the whole of Kovic's experience he avoids making `Platoon II' (not an easy feat by the way considering that Tom Beringer and Willem Defoe play key roles in the movie, and some other  cast members of Stone's previous Vietnam epic sneak in and out of scenes)",Null,0,0,9 June 2001

The Godfather," My favorite movie
","Spoiler WARNINGTelevision takes a pretty bad rap.  It is often derided for its stultifying properties, engendering of abject values and overall ability to vitiate the masses.  Many even claim that it foments a sundering influence over families.  I suppose there is some merit to such an assertion, but I can tell you that when I was growing up the TV was the node in which our otherwise fragmented family coalesced.  I guess we would be referred to as `dysfunctional' today; my father didn't talk to us much and the dinner table was a surface in which to set the groceries until they were put away.  If my parents did ask about how school went, a laconic `alright' would satisfy. But when we sat in front of that glowing cynosure, with its exogenous felicity and fruition, our reticence faded into commentary.  Somehow the factitious world contained in that electronic box inspired us to notice each other.  We watched and we talked.
So when it was deemed that I was mature enough to watch the network premier of `The Godfather' I was not only anticipating a good movie, I was looking forward to family bonding. I positively loved to listen to my father and older brothers (I'm the baby) engage in dialogue and repartee in response to the TV.  Their insight brought more to light than my young mind could comprehend with just the presentation as is, and I felt edified as well as inclusive.  Hey some folks have the visits to Yellowstone, I have this.
Even though it was too much for an adolescent to fully appreciate, I knew then that this movie was something special.  And as I grew older I watched it every time it aired.  Of course after videos arrived this was the first movie I purchased.  It is the cr√®me de le cr√®me of films, of which I have watched at least 50 times.  It is a work of art that I can call a masterpiece without a bit of hyperbole.  It is my opinion the greatest picture ever made.
Though a substantial portion of the film takes place in Sicily, and many customs of that land (as well as cabala) are featured this is a very American story.  It is no less than a stunning examination of the dichotomy that is success in the land of opportunity.  It is a tale of the fine line between legitimacy and profligacy in the capitalist world, of the gray area that exists between transgression and ignominy.  And if the film is a treatise on the American way then the opening line, `I believe in America', is its exordium.  With those prefatory words Coppola sets the tone.
What follows is a congeries of dexterous camera shots, first-rate dialogue, incredible acting, untiring character development and one hell of a story. The juxtaposition of criminality and family honor/personal loyalty is achieved with utmost precision.  The motif of personal rectitude vis-√†-vis societal ethos pervades the film.  The main characters embody this paradox. They are vicious yet decorous, violent yet urbane, heartless yet not without code.
The actors are at their best.  Brando providing gravitas, Cann relishing his bellicose role, Keaton appearing to live her enduring conflict.  It is Pacino of course who must steer the course, as his permutation is unveiled before us.  Pacino achieves this vicissitude with a subtlety that resembles an insidious whisper, inaudible to those who underestimate him.
If you will allow me an indulgence I would like to comment on the outstanding ending to this work.   At times movies are often beloved for memorable scenes.  The finale of this tale is as piquant as they come. Coppola understands the power of the doorway, and the shot of Kay's face, overcome with the realization of her husband's duplicity, as the door closes, symbolically shutting her out of his life, is sheer pathos.  Did I mention that I love this ending?  In fact the par excellence of this conclusion has soured me on the sequels.  I have watched them and think they are great, but I do not possess them and never will.  Any extension of this saga is a reproach to this superb terminus ad quem.
`The Godfather' is a film that must be watched numerous times to absorb and appreciate the many names, nuances, and instances.  I highly recommend it.",Null,1,4,8 November 2001
