Catch Me If You Can," One of my favorite just pop-in movies
","There are some movies I just put in when I want to be entertained but not have to think too much. I love this movie for that purpose! Not to say that it doesn't cause some cerebral response, but it's just fun to watch! Frank just keeps slipping through all the nooses, and Tom Hanks' portrayal of Carl Hanratty is probably one of the most overlooked performances of his career while being one of his best (and he has some pretty good ones out there).One of my favorite things about this movie is the opening credits. It's unbelievable that anyone would like the opening credits, but it brings back memories of my early adolescence when I learned to love movies watching the late night showings of Martin and Lewis on Fridays and Saturdays on my local network affiliates. The 60's styling during the opening credits just creates a wave of nostalgia that causes me to really enjoy. And I love the score. It's perfect for this type of intrigue.The only negative thing that I saw in the movie is the stretch of age that DiCaprio has to pull off. I think he does so on an emotional level, but, physically, it's hard to believe him as a 14 year old at the beginning of the film.If you haven't seen this one, it's worth the purchase price of the special edition DVD. Grab it before it gets away!",9,1,3,22 September 2008
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Fun, but Hard to Watch With an Historical Eye
","When I first heard this title advertised, I had a VERY skeptical response. But as the film neared its premiere I began to get more and more curious. And once I found out that Tim Burton was producing, and I saw a few previews, I had to see it.As expected, the special effects were great. The 3-D was particularly good. The story was exciting and kept my attention. I also thought the make-up effects were very good (Mary Todd didn't age well, but Lincoln was awesome). But I found my mind wandering so much, that I had trouble just enjoying the movie.The problem I have is that I have always been critical of 'historical' films. They are NEVER accurate, and it drives me crazy. Now, I know that this is not a historical film, but I found myself thinking through my knowledge, as limited as it is, of the history around the story--and I was being critical! I kept having to remind myself that this was FICTION!!! Well, this was my loss--I was unable to enjoy this movie, even with the exciting action and story. I think it may have been a better story with a less recognizable historical personality--but then the story wouldn't have been the same at all. Catch 22.",7,7,13,27 June 2012
Minority Report," Disappointing
","Well, this film is entertaining.  It is well thought out.  It is well written.  It is well directed.  And it is well acted.  However, it did not come up to my expectations.  Maybe this is because I had really high expectations.  At any event, I was a little disappointed with the final outcome.  I think that one of the reasons is that there was so much time watching Detective Anderton going through the recorded images of the Pre-Cogs, waving his hands around with his fingers sticking out, or watching him jump from vehicle to vehicle on the magnetic car highway, or the wall projected images from the 'PC' in Anderton's home.  This seemed to me to be more about Spielberg's image of the future than about a very good crime drama.  I think that's where the film lost me.  I also thought the CGI images weren't very good.  I would have expected better.Maybe a second viewing will change my mind, but this one is worth seeing at a matinee, not at a full price showing.",6,0,0,26 June 2002
12 Angry Men," No bombs, no karate, no love story, no major scene changes, no color......GREAT MOVIE!!!!
","Can you believe that there is a successful movie that has none of the major Hollywood tried and true methods to create a lasting memory?  This film is a major triumph that still creates a stir in me every time I see it.  It's power is not in the visual images created, (although much of the cinematography is imaginative, especially the last shot from the coat closet, even with the challenge of one major room), but in the drama created by the tension of men coming together from all walks of lives to judge another human being.  They bring their prejudices, their fear, their life experiences, their lack of interest, and their anonymity into a room to make a decision--that's when the real story starts.We all think about the possibility of having to face that day--some relish the opportunity while others fear making a bad decision.  It's one reason this film resonates with so many people.  It's a common experience that brings out different emotions in different people.  The remake, although not as effective because of the lack of originality, is also good and brings in other points of view, including racial issues.  Both lack one thing--a female's point of view!  But that creates even more tension.  After all, men don't want to deal with their emotions the same way women do.  Besides, we would have to change the title!  :o)",10,0,1,30 April 2004
The Hustler," One of my favorites
","Fast Eddie Felson is one of the all-time great anti-heroes.  He is a drifter who is arrogant and has used many people in his life to get where he is. But when where he is is nowhere, he grows up.  He learns the value of lost opportunity, and he gains integrity at a high price.  It is worth a look for anyone who wants to see the redemption of a lovable curmudgeon.",9,8,9,26 June 2002
The Village," Suspenseful, but do not see with preconceived expectations
","Well, many have said this was an awful picture, but I have to totally disagree. I was absolutely entertained and intrigued with this picture. It was not as frightening as Night's other films, but the theme of the picture was something that we have all thought about--the good old days.Simpler times is something that in our over-active, over-worked and over-materialized world we have all wanted. But it may come with a price.That's all I better say without giving away too much, but I will leave you with one last thing--it is well worth the viewing.",9,0,0,30 October 2004
The Pianist," Unbelievably Good!
","I finally got to see this film. I thought I would be bored with it, and I am a little disgusted with Polanski as a person. I know, I shouldn't let my personal feelings about actors, directors, or Hollywood in general effect how I view a film, but it does sometimes. That didn't happen here.Not only is the acting amazing, but the cinematography, the realistic sets, the physical appearance of Brody, the cruelty and disregard by the Nazis--it all made me feel like I was actually there. I was especially impressed with the technique of allowing us to see through the eyes of Szpilman. At times, I felt like I could feel his heartbeat and fear. It was so palpable that my wife couldn't watch the entire film. She had to leave because of the overwhelming emotions she was feeling.It is so engaging. I highly recommend it.",10,2,4,8 January 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," 'Slumdog' must be amazing!
","I haven't seen 'Slumdog', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Benjamin Button', 'Milk', or 'The Reader' yet, but they must be amazing for this movie to not be nominated for Best Picture! When this film was over I just sat staring at the credits. I'm usually already looking for my next activity when a movie is over--food, email, sleep, whatever. This one left me numb. I couldn't get away from it. I started watching the special feature documentaries just to get more answers. I wanted to feel better about what had happened. The funny thing is I saw the outcome about 10 minutes before the end, but I still couldn't believe it ended that way. It was 'bound to happen,' but I didn't want it to be true. I kept thinking, 'Something will stop this,' but it didn't.The script, the research behind the story, the strength of the two young leads, the adult supporting actors, the paradox of joviality and cruelty in the same house... it all made for an amazing piece of film. I highly recommend this for any serious film junkie.",10,4,8,15 May 2009
The Happening," An M. Night Shyamalan Apologist No More
","I have been an M. Night Shyamalan apologist for a while now. Everyone loved 'The Sixth Sense.' Most people loved 'Unbreakable.' Then it starts to slip. I loved 'Signs' and really loved 'The Village' (that one's theme of 'the good old days' hit close to home for me), but some didn't. I didn't like 'Lady and in the Water,' but my wife did. I figured it just wasn't my cup of tea (the whole fairy tale thing), and I thought Night had too big a part (he's not a terribly good actor). But it had a good concept and some quality actors and some very good performances so there was some forgiveness from me. With this movie, I am no longer coming to his defense. OK. I know he doesn't need me to, but I'm looking for much better from him next time out.I was a little generous and gave this title a 5 out of 10 because the first half of the movie was actually pretty good! The first 30-45 minutes were tense and kept me on edge as any good suspense movie should. It built in some questions as to what was causing the 'happening,' and caused me to jump in my seat a few times. There were some okay performances from Wahlberg and Deschanel and a couple of great performances from Leguizamo and Buckley (she reminded me of Kathy Bates in Misery a little with her out-of-touch intensity). I was also very impressed by the performance from Jeremy Strong as Private Auster, and Spencer Breslin caused a disagreement between myself and my wife--it was hard to recognize him since he grew up some and did not overact as usual! But the second half of the movie just fizzled. There were very few tense moments since we knew what was coming every time the wind blew and someone stared into space and took 2 steps backwards. And the explanation for the cause came too early in the film so the questioning pretty much ended. There was no real climax in the story. Two people standing in a wind-blown field is not very exciting (and their romance was even more boring). It would have been acceptable for the pre-attack warning to be wind-blown grass for a low budget, independent film, but Night used ILM for his special effects. ILM!! And wind blowing through the trees was the best they could do? Then in the end it was just a long, 'green' environmentalist guilt trip. Now, maybe my right-leaning political viewpoint taints my feelings a little, but who wants to sit in a movie theater and be guilt-ed by a suspenseful thriller--especially when there was very little suspense or thrill? (By the way, it takes a lot of electrical energy, fuel, and petroleum-based film to make a movie, but that's an entry for a different type of website.) And the worst thing? I sometimes use my watch to time the actual running time (without credits) of a film. It felt like hours and it was only 86 minutes! Unbelievable from Night--I'm usually riveted throughout any of his movies.Night, you're my boy, but you really missed bad with this one!",5,2,6,16 June 2008
Vanilla Sky," Spooky and intriguing
","This one kept me on the edge wondering how it would all get tied together in the end.  It felt like it would leave me with a sense of awe at the solution to the puzzle.  And, BOY, it did not disappoint.  Although for me it tied together well, it is one of those films that allows the viewer the luxury of watching it again and seeing many more layers and possible solutions to the puzzle laid before you.  The acting was great, with the possible exception of Penelope Cruz in a few scenes. (I felt she played a little too much on her foreign intrigue rather than true acting skill in a couple of spots [Just a very few spots]).  One of the players that I feel may have gotten overlooked was Cameron Diaz. She was TOTALLY believable, even when she seemed to flip from playful to deadly serious in the blink of an eye--and she did evil very well.  Tom Cruise is one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood, in my opinion.  He is always solid and is much more than a pretty face.  Unfortunately, he is usually surrounded by bundles of talent (Jerry Maguire, Rainman) and oftens get overlooked.  This is probably his best delivery in his career as of yet. And Jason Lee holds his own.  He is not over-powered by the 'beautiful' people he is surrounded by.Cameron Crowe is a masterful storyteller, and I am glad he does not just go for the easy quick Hollywood fix.  Too many movies today are just predictable--entertaining the first time you watch, but nothing to go back for later.  Vanilla Sky definitely makes you want to go back for seconds.",9,0,0,11 June 2002
