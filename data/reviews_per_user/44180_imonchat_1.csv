Skyfall," A new bond legacy
","A touchy-feely James Bond with life coming to a full circle for the super agent as he returns to his not so humble origins complete with Batman's Alfredish housekeeper if you will. Don't go looking for swanky gadgets and death-defying stunts. This one's more for the soul and not for the eyes as was evident by the lack of a leading 'Bond Girl'. DH with his uncanny ability to name that one thing you can't put your finger on,compared it rightly to the 'Bourne' movies. No major punch lines. Nice subtle humor. Exotic locales for only part of the movie. You get the idea. Daniel Craig's best performance till date as he finally shakes off the 'love's labor lost' demeanor from the first two movies and becomes the gutsy lone hero. Also, as I always say , a super hero movie is only as good as the super villain. Watch out for the pseudo seduction scene between Bond and nemesis Silva played by none other than Javier Bardem. Silva too has a personal vendetta and it's not world domination this time. A cocky new Q, a fragile and poetry spouting M and a made over Miss Moneypenny completed the cast. Biggest disappointment for me, Lord Voldemort's return. No, not literally.I meant Ralph Fiennes, whose character sort of just lurked in the shadows and didn't really contribute. Instead an awe-inspiring title rendition of 'Skyfall' by Adelefor me, second only to Garbage's 'World Is Not Enough' original sound track.This is the end and I liked it.",8,1,10,11 November 2012
