Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More of the Same?
","I should realize that a Star Wars movie is going to be just that. There isn't going to be that much that's new or different in a series that lives off light saber fights, and ship battles.  So what did the movie offer? Great effects mostly.  The acting lacked energy.  The music didn't drive the movie like it did in the first two.  The set design was great in spots, dull in others.The computer animated creatures looked like muppets - I haven't figured that one out yet.  The best rendered creature was Jar-Jar.  To be honest, I liked and felt sorry for him.  He was treated badly when first encountered - 'What's that?' emphasize 'What' - Star Wars apparently doesn't have to be p.c. and treat all life as equal.  A few lines later, Jar Jar takes another shot - 'just because it can talk, doesn't mean it's intelligent'.  I guess Qui-Gonn won't be resigning his Jedi commitment anytime soon to join Star Fleet.  Apparently, respect for other life forms isn't in his book.
Having Anakin destroy the droid control ship by accident gave me the same feeling I had when Luke had to have help from Vader to beat the emperor in Return of the Jedi.  I was unfulfilled - not thrilled as I should be.  In short, I felt this movie fell short of the first two, and because it lacked the characters we grew to love in the  first three films, even fell short of ROTJ which I enjoyed least of the original trilogy.Tim B.",1,3,6,3 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Hoodwinked in the end.
","I remember coming out of the movie theater in 1983 and feeling disappointed with this movie.  I've seen it a number of times since on video and in the theater (Special Edition Version).  I was so pumped up after 'Empire', and at the time couldn't pinpoint what let me down.  Some of it was characterization. Solo wasn't Solo, Luke didn't really seem to live up to the title of 'Jedi' - he had to be helped by Vader to defeat the Emperor. Probably everyone has movies that they daydream about re-writing the ending to.  In my ending for the movie, Vader tries to throw the Emperor into the power core, gets slammed against a bulkhead, the Emperer comes back to finish Luke, and Luke finally figures out what Obi-Wan and Yoda were trying to teach him, and is able to deflect the energy bolts and push them back on the Emperor, destroying him. I thought the Emperor came off kind of like the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz - not as a powerful evil leader of the dark side.  He cackled a lot, and said things like 'well now, my young Jedi, watch your rebel fleet be destroyed, and your little dog Toto too!'. I kind of thought the Ewoks were cheesy, and yes, the battle scene in the forest asked that reality be suspended too much (two big logs coming together are going to smash an ATST and cause it to explode?).  I am looking forward to the three prequel movies, but now I hear what may be the unkindest cut of all. After all this, Lucas may not make episodes VII, VIII and IX because he says it would take too long, and he never had a story for those anyway.  So we'll get to see the prequels, though we know how those end up, but the finale to the series of movies will probably be the disappointing 'Jedi'. *Sigh*.",Null,1,2,19 February 1999
