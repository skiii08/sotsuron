Requiem for a Dream," The pain and real suffering crude in front of us.
","It's a hard and well expressed movie.No need message,the messages can be a lot.The characters makes mistakes driving their lives to the pain but it's very disturbing to realize(and this is one of the values of the film)that people surrounding them 'helps' very much to reach that pain.There are a lot of movies that treat the theme of the drug-addiction in many ways but this is one of the bests because it doesn't stop in describing the additions of typical drugs and it describes another type of no-return sort of additions and degradations giving us a quite complete vision of several different forms of falling down into dis-control in the lives of those unfortunate persons and takes the right elements that surround them in the story.May be nothing new is said but the way it is said is really convincing.THe personal at the hospital seem to be not treating with a human being,but with a thing. And this is unfortunately true in our world today.The style of description in the last minutes,when the final degeneration process is going on,the intercalation of suffering moments is brutal.The scenes does appear showing us the faces nearly,the elements like hand knocking a door nearly,the etc.and with the vibration some scenes have when we see the faces of the characters is a well done way to show the real pain;in fact,this is one of the most effective films ever in putting pain on the screen,in this final sequences.",8,1,2,27 July 2008
