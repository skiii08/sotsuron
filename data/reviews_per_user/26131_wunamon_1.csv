Resident Evil: Afterlife," Alice is back in glorious 3D
",This Resident Evil did for me what the previous versions didn't. Yes it did not truly stick to the video game story but it did offer some sort of fan service. Resident Evil 5 players will understand. We from the get go this movie jumps right into action with pacing I felt was up and down. I couldn't help but notice certain zombie movie clich√©'s here but they were laughable and I doubt anyone will hold the director for that. Alice is looking kick-ass and she does a lot of dead-ass kicking. With respect to the 3D i think they did a good job. This movie I will recommend to anyone who has been following the movie version of Biohazard/Resident evil. It is a great movie that will entertain you till the very end. Can't say much without actually spoiling the movie. Better go see for yourself.,8,12,27,12 September 2010
