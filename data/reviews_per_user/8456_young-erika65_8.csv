Deja Vu," It's 2019
","This movie is still the Greatest!! Even in 2019. We have all these Marvel Movies. Deja Vu would still be at the top of the list right with the Marvel Movies. Wonder Woman, Avengers:Infinity. Spider-Man , Aquaman, Black Panther. I know I missed a few. But thank God for Hulu and Netflix for never let us forget some of the Greatest movies of all time.",9,1,1,19 February 2019

","I heard Positive and negative views. But thank God I watched for myself. The Movie is very good and well written. Pure Genius. If this Movie Us Confused YOU!! Hahaha Good. It's about Self Growth! Empowerment and most of all Staying WOKE in this Society. Us Movie was definitely Creepy , Scary, unpredictable and will have you on edges. Sci-fi Thriller/Suspense/Action. And at the end of the movie. YOU are Drained. If You were able to hang in there not give up lol. Have to admit Us Movie totally messes up your Mind.

Aquaman," Please Don't make a Aquaman 2
",This has to be one of the worst movies ever. And it had to come to HBO. Disney you can have this one for sure. This was terrible! I hope No ones career gets blacklisted for this garbage. Every fan of DC marvel who purchased a ticket should sue for emotional damages . I truly thought people were over exaggerating when they said Aquaman was a horrible movie. I found out the hard way and the only good part was at the end with Beautiful and Gorgeous Nicole Kidman. That's why I gave Aquaman a 1 point. I give Nicole Kidman a Perfect 10. Nominations for Aquaman is a Joke! False advertising and lying to people who use their hard earn money to watch crap like this should be a federal crime. I said what I said.,1,4,7,11 August 2019
Aquaman," I will wait until this movie comes to blu-Ray
","I
Have read so many mixed reviews online from movie goers. It's terrible! It's a great movie! It's a black panther copy! Blah Blah Blah I will see and when I do. I will come back post my comments and reviews. Because right now my favorite Marvel movie is Wonder Woman, Justice League, Batman vs Superman . Avengers-Infinity and last but not least Black Panther.",1,1,1,19 January 2019
