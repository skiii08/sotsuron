Iron Man 3," Don't Bother Watching This
","The first Iron Man was great. The second was pretty good, this is in the dirt unless you like the cartoon humour. Personally, I don't like seeing people bounce around like they do in animation. It's a film with people, it needs to have ground rules.Also, the story line is very weak. It's like they tried to make a sequel but they didn't know what they were doing and improvised a half chewed script. There is no depth or complexities to the story. They had one goal and that was doing something with Iron and and his girlfriend. I won't spoil it for you, in case you still want to watch it. But I advise watch the trailer and you'll get the best parts.",2,2,4,13 August 2015
Inside Out," Thumbs Up to an Intelligently Hilarious Movie!
","I went to see it for my birthday and couldn't stop laughing! It's interesting, insightful, and absolutely hilarious. There are those intense moments where it's sad and touching, you need them in order to get the point across. It's really well written, and perhaps those of us who like movies that make you think a little and learn something, are going to appreciate this the most, but there is something for everyone. Kids might not get the most in-depth stuff, but will enjoy the rest of the fun and joyful ride.Bottom line, stop reading these comments and go see it! lol",10,6,40,12 August 2015
Wonder Woman," Great Movie - Will Try to Avoid Spoilers by Sticking to Comic Book Knowledge
","I'm reading some reviews and I see people complaining from her accent to the fact that she's too good looking to be an Amazon and what's an Amazon? Wow, people! Wonder woman is not only an Amazon, she is a Goddess created by other gods. So, being a superhero/goddess, she has to look like a top model. Not enough muscle? The actress went to the army and has more muscle than most underweight actresses out there on the big screen. Don't like her non-American accent? She's not American. Complaining about her wearing American symbols and colour? Beyond the movie's explanation for that, it's her comic book costume since her creation. They just made it more on-screen friendly.Still complaining? Have issues with the fact that she's a woman and this movie is like every other superhero movie? Sure it is, but it's like every other GOOD superhero movie out there. Don't like superhero movies? Don't go watch this one. Now, when was the last superhero movie with a woman? You're probably thinking Cat Woman, (no one remembers Electra), whose super villain was a beauty product queen with an evil product. I mean, common? Girls can't fight blood thirsty warlords or ladies that want to conquer and dominate the world? At least Wonder Woman's nemesis is the God of War, a worthy opponent.Perfect? No movie is perfect. You can always develop more this or that, but it would make the movie longer. You can argue you should've cast this or that character differently. These are normal struggles for any production. You can't please everyone at the end of the day. And making the movie longer with cause other issues such as keeping the audience with the movie. But I can't give any less that 10 here. After Batman vs Superman's disaster, this is amazing. This has raised the bar for DC movies. Hope they can keep it up and this must be encouraged, both for quality and women leads.",10,11,23,11 September 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Simply Awful - Spoilers
","It's not because you're in your 20s and still a virgin that you're a child in your head. She's so naive, an eight year old would understand more about sex and relationships today than her. Then, you expect some sensual light porn, thinking that might compensate for the lack of of everything else, but it never comes. You barely see anything in Grey's red room. It's just disappointing.",1,0,1,13 September 2017
