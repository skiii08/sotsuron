Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I've got a bad feeling about this...so did I.
","The Phantom Menace was a fun, engrossing film that truly brought to terms what so many grown men and women have tried to re-live throughout their lives: the Star Wars Universe and its inevitable affect on them.Many people will be disappointed by this movie. I was, because it could and never will live up to the lofty expectations that many, including myself, have placed upon it.However, it was a lavishly and meticulously crafted film made by auteur George Lucas and his creative teams. It features truly spectacular special effects and production values, incorporating stark and beautiful settings and incrediblly seamless computer generated images, including characters such as Jar Jar Binks, junk dealer Watto, and entire armies of Gungans and Battle Droids.There are great performances abounding throughout the picture, especially by Liam Neeson, as the rogue Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Pernilla August as the earnest and loving Shmi Skywalker, mother of the Darth Vader-to-be, and Ian McDiarmid as the charming, albeit scheming, Senator Palpatine. McDiarmid even delivers the line of the film to Jake Lloyd's Anakin Skywalker, telling the boy he looks foward to following his career. A true foreshadowing of the dark times to come.As for the above-mentioned Lloyd, as our young protagonist, he gives a worthwhile performance, with youthful exuberence and wide-eyed innocence. He is not wooden, as we were led to believe by the vile media, and surprisingly, gives the best performance of his short career. However, a negative aspect to the star-powered cast was Natalie Portman, whose great skill and talent are never once depicted in the perpetually stoic Queen Amidala. However, some of the best scenes of the film are between Portman and Lloyd, who will eventually marry and give the galaxy (as well as the movie-going public) the twins Luke and Leia.The Phantom Menace's best scenes are its stunningly choreographed lightsaber battles, including the Jedi's battles against the Battle Droids, and the climatic confrontation with the malign Darth Maul, physically and imposingly portrated by stuntman Ray Park. Sadly, we see little of Maul, or of a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi, well portrayed by Ewan MacGregor, in the movie. However, when both are on screen, the film's pace quickens, as does the audience's heartbeats.The Phantom Menace serves to set up the saga to be seen and the one already played out in the original trilogy. It is a good backstory for the drama to come, and gives us a great view of the main characters. While not the greatest Star Wars movie, it is still a technical achievement and an eventual box office gargantuan.All in all, was it worth waiting in line for a month, like so many have done? Of course not, no film is. Was it worth sitting in a cold, darkened theater on a hot Texas afternoon for about two and a half hours? Most definitely, yes. And really, that's the way movies should be.",Null,0,1,20 May 1999
Erin Brockovich," A Satisfying Cinematic Story
","Erin Brockovich is a terrific film depicting the true life story of a single mother turned law clerk's battle to gain respect and a better life for her children while toppling a power company's clandestine efforts to cover up the poisoning of a small California town.Julia Roberts portrays Erin Brockovich with incredible, realistic conviction, and this role proves to be her finest one yet.  Roberts is a master now, capable of pulling off diverse roles, and making characters her own in the mold of Meryl Streep.  She deserves an Oscar nod for this, and it can only lead to bigger and better parts.  Albert Finney is in top form as Brockovich's boss, attorney Ed Masry, who attempts to groom the rough, tightly wound (and clothed) Erin, as well as gamble everything he has built to bring about restitution for his long suffering clients.Erin Brockovich is a fully satisfying movie-going experience, and do not be put off by critics who call it formulaic or 'made for t.v.'  Why?  Because all films are formulaic and more people watch television than go to church! See it because it is a great movie and you will have a good time.Highly recommended!",Null,1,1,20 March 2000
Star Trek," Now, this is how to prequel...
","Not to impugn the work of Mr. Lucas and Co., but J.J. Abrams' 'Star Trek' should be the textbook definition of how to make a prequel film. How did Mr. Abrams and his fine crew do it? Well, to make mention of the notorious G.L. once again, they added just enough 'Star Wars' to 'Trek' to make it both palatable to the non-Trekker audience, and kept just enough Trekker-attuned stuff to make long-time 'Trek' fans like me happy, content, and excited once again for the future.Creating an alternate reality for this films and the inevitable ones to follow was a brilliant move by Abrams and the screen writers, Orci and Kurtzman. The latter two's love of 'Trek' was apparent in this film, as was their feelings to keep this film separate from the various television series and films, thus allowing them to peacefully co-exist together. Awesome move, fellas.And who da thunk it? 'Star Trek' on the big screen and 'Star Wars' on the tube...boy, the times, they are a-changin'.",10,1,13,2 June 2009
Iron Man 2," The Sequel That Did Nothing
","There are two saving graces in 'Iron Man 2.' The first is Gwyneth Paltrow's wondrous performance as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts. Paltrow is literally stunning as Pepper and brings a warmth and depth to this character in a beautiful way.The second is the 'Easter egg' scene after the end credits in which we see S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson discover the mighty Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, in a crater in New Mexico.That's pretty much it.'Iron Man 2' is boring, trite, and does nothing for the character or this franchise in any meaningful way. Even the battle scenes were not entertaining. Whereas 'Iron Man' was fun and exciting and interesting, '2' is the exact opposite and even borders on 'Batman & Robin' embarrassing at times, which is pretty terrible.I had low expectations for 'Iron Man 2' whenever I saw the first trailer for the film, and it's safe to say that it exceeded (or whatever the opposite of 'exceed' is) them in spades.I can only hope that the 'Captain America,' 'Thor,' and 'The Avengers' films are better. And a word of advice to the filmmakers, reign in Robert Downey, Jr. a little bit next time. Just say what's in the script, Robert...we didn't come to the theater to see a Second City improv performance.",3,4,8,10 June 2010
Spider-Man 2," A Cinematic Triumph for Sam Raimi and Co.
","Please take note that their are SPOILERS in this review, so beware before reading (that is, if you read this review, and you may not...)Well, I was worried.I had read some disturbing things about Spider-Man 2 in the months proceedings its 2 July 2004, then 30 June 2004, release. Tales of the title character (and one of my long-time comic book idols) unmasking in front of people, and other sundry scary scenarios had got me worried. Worrying about a movie, you ask. Well, I waited twenty-three years for a Spider-Man movie, and got a great one, so yeah, I was worried about the sequel!Well, how wrong I was to worry.Spider-Man 2 builds upon, expands upon, and almost eclipses its cinematic predecessor in so many ways, that I won't bore you with endless details. It was evident in the first film that director Sam Raimi admired Peter Parker and his crime-fighting alter ego, but with this film, we see that he truly loves and cherishes this character so much like the over forty million others throughout the world who have done the same for the last 42 years.Spider-Man 2 continues the woeful tale of Peter Parker, a young man who, despite being superhumanly powerful, not only cannot catch a break, but is in danger of forgetting what a 'break' is. Tobey Maguire returns (despite some off screen controversy) as Peter and his secret identity, and I must say that not since Christopher Reeve's Superman has an actor so fully brought to life a comic book hero on the silver screen. Maguire owns Peter and Spidey in an effortless, yet pitiful, way. You feel his pain, his torment, and you are overjoyed in his small victories and ultimate triumph.Returning players Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and Rosemary Harris give us once again Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn, and Peter's Aunt May in truly great performances. Dunst's look and attitude as MJ has improved dramatically and maturely. You finally see why Peter pines for her, besides her obvious physical attributes. Franco's fractured Harry Osborn, the embittered son of the first film's antagonist, the Green Goblin, strives to fill his father's shoes, all the while yearning for vengeance for the Spider-Man he believes murdered his father. Harris as Aunt May is a revelation. Her role is larger and more substantial, and we all come to the conclusion that May knows much more than she is saying, or in other words, that she is probably savvy to her beloved nephew's clandestine career as New York's unofficial protector.Alfred Molina is Dr. Otto Octavius, a genuinely good man and a man of science, who loves his wife and wants to bring the world out of its fossil fuel dependence. You feel for Octavius, thanks to Molina's portrayal, but you see his myopic view when he is unwilling to correct what may be a fatal flaw in his experimental fusion generator because it was his life's work. This flaw is indeed fatal, causing the death of his beloved Rosie, and permanently bonding him to the scariest set of tentacles since 20,000 Leagues Beneath the Sea. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin of the first film was over-the-top and a tad cartoonish, but Molina's tortured Dr. Octopus is frightening and sympathetic, and almost totally realistic (well, probably not the tentacles, but you get the idea).The action sequences, as well as the special effects, have been improved upon, including Spidey's displays of his powers. We finally get to see just how strong he is (but if anyone's ever read the Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe already knows, right?). We also see that the choices that Peter's made in his life not only affect him outside of his costume, but within, as well.One complaint you might hear about Spider-Man 2 is his frequent unmasking towards the climax of the film. No, it's not politically correct as far as the comic book goes, but it adds such dramatic depth to this film, that I was not only willing to forget it, but embrace it (and that is saying a lot for a comic book purist like me). Could the film have worked without the unmaskings? Absolutely. Would it have been as good? After much thought, I'd have to say no. If you don't like that, don't worry, you're not alone, and you, as film and/or comic book fans, have the right to that opinion, but don't let that ruin your enjoyment of this film. This is the sort of comic book-based film we've all been waiting for, and we've got enjoy it while it lasts.I want to thank Mr. Raimi and Mr. Maguire, and everyone who worked so hard to give us Spider-Man 2. You gave us something more than a film featuring our favorite wall-crawler...you made us believe in him for the second time, and that's something I'll be grateful for for a very long time.Needless to say, Spider-Man 2 is highly recommended!",Null,0,0,4 July 2004
Batman Returns," A Follow Up That Fails
","Batman Returns had all the makings of a great sequel to 1989's Batman.  Our returning hero, Michael Keaton, slim and trim, and in a much better made latex suit.  The diminutive Danny DeVito as the heinous Penguin, and the sultry Michelle Pfieffer as the luscious Catwoman.  However, once again, director Tim Burton's overzealousness for sets and villains dooms the Batman franchise.  Filled with a few great moments, Batman Returns is a darkly sinister and somewhat sexually brutal film not for children, or even die-hard Dark Knight fans.",Null,5,12,9 December 1998
Blade," You can't kill a vampire, it's already dead...
","Blade is a great adaptation and update of Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan's vampire hunter from Marvel Comics' Tomb of Dracula series in the 70s.  As a matter of fact, it's a lot better than even the comic!Blade features dead-on performances by Snipes and Dorff as the film's protagonist and antagonist, and a great turn by Kris Kristofferson as Whistler, who, incidentally, is based on a supporting character from Blade's appearances on Fox's Spider-Man animated series.Great special effects, and superb martial artistry by Snipes.  Not the best vampire film, per se, that title still belongs to Fright Night, but a great overall action/horror movie.  Good popcorn stuff, if you're not too queasy at the sight of blood, and lots of it!",Null,0,1,29 December 1998
The Mummy," A Pleasant Surprise!
","The Mummy was a terrific movie-going experience, purely popcorn fare, but always my favorite flavor.  The film features great performances from Fraser, Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo as the indomitable Imhotep.  The real reason to see The Mummy are its eye-popping special effects, including a sentient sandstorm and a herd of flesh-eating scarab beetles.  Very action-packed, fast-paced, and satisfying -- three things a movie should be.Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
X-Men," Lee and Kirby's Finest Creation Comes to Life...
","The film version of Stan Lee and Jack 'The King' Kirby's best-selling comic book creation, X-Men, has finally succeeded where more than twenty years of four-color, superhero movies have failed.  They have finally got it right...It is a stunning cinematic experience, faithfully adapting nearly 40 years of continuity into a stream-lined, fast-paced, wonderfully exciting trip into the legendary Marvel Universe.  X-Men features incredible portrayals of much of the classic mutant cast, especially virtual unknown (at least here in the States) Hugh Jackman as Logan, the Canadian wildman we all know and love as Wolverine.  Jackman seems born to play this coveted role with every bit of gruff and grim gusto; his Wolverine looks as if he simply stepped off one of Chris Claremont and John Byrne's exquisitely crafted pages.  The rest of the cast was also pleasantly well-casted and well-suited for their roles, including the handsomely chisled James Marsden as the stoic field commander Cyclops and the gorgeous Anna Paquin as the can-never-touch-but-wish-we-all-could Rogue.  Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are beautiful and bold as Jean Grey and Storm, respectively, not just appearing as fleeting shards of eye candy, but actually adding depth and strength to the flow of the film.  Patrick Stewart's excellent Professor Charles Xavier is in fine Stewart fashion, extrapolating on his Jean-Luc Picard character, and adding genuine compassion and warmth.Ian McKellan is superb as the tortured master of magnetism, Magneto, playing the part with malicious glee, tempered with an extreme form of jingoism for his cause of the militant uprising of mutants over 'normal' people.  His Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants is composed of Sabretooth, viciously and animalistically portrayed Tyler Mane, The Phanton Menace's Ray Park is the wickedly amusing Toad, and the stunning Rebecca Romaijn-Stamos is the shape-shifter Mystique.  Park actually had the most to say of Magneto's henchmen, but it was appropriate as these three comprise an awesomely evil team of muscle and not philosophy like their leader.The productions values were spectacular, as were the settings, taking us from a stark, malign concentration camp in Poland to the wilds of the Canadian north to the serenity of Westchester, New York to a mind-bending climax on Liberty Island.  The action sequences were well-paced and action-packed, and much more smoother and better choreographed than any of the Batman films.  The special effects, especially Wolverine's legendary adamantium claws, were truly awe-inspiring.X-Men was meticulously directed by Bryan Singer, who along with 20th Century Fox, actually listened to and cared about what X-Fans thought and wished to see on screen.  Although we would have all liked to have stayed in that theater for another 95 minutes, there are many more stories to tell, and God willing, Fox will let it happen.Most importantly, X-Men finally gives Marvel Entertainment Group a firm footing on film, a foundation that was never fully in its grasp until the surprise hit of two years ago, Blade.  Now that Marvel has discovered that it can succeed with its top-tier characters, the sky is truly the limit for its varied cast of great characters.  I hope that Warner Bros. will sit up and take notice at what X-Men has accomplished.  Maybe this will be a wake-up call to those studio executives in charge of Superman and Batman, and make them realize that the fans' input really does count in the end...Highest recommendation!",Null,43,58,17 July 2000
Spider-Man 3," No one's got a crush on Peter...
","Let me preface my review of 'Spider-Man 3' by saying that in the last few years Marvel Comics has ruined what they have deemed for more than forty years as their flagship character and fictional ambassador, Spider-Man.Spider-Man was used and abused by Marvel in their disastrous epic storyline known as 'Civil War,' where he was essentially forced by his creators (and characters in the story) to unmask himself publicly, ruining his reputation as Peter Parker, his crime-fighting career as Spider-Man, and most stupidly of all, risking the very lives of himself and every single person he cares for.Really, in the scheme of the Marvel Universe, there is no Spider-Man any more. Oh, yes, he still appears in any number of eponymous titles published in grind house-fashion from the House of Ideas, but Peter Parker really isn't Spider-Man any more.However, the Webslinger still exists, and oddly enough, he exists truly only on the silver screen. What Sam Raimi and Co. have done since 2002 has placed Spider-Man at the forefront of public consciousness in a way that Marvel never has, and now, never will.'Spider-Man 3' continues that strange phenomenon, and is an awe-inspiring addition to the two companion films that preceded it. Also, interestingly enough, due to its dense, multi-layered, and intricate plot lines, it is the most comic book-esquire film ever made in this re-emerging genre.So-called critics have complained that too much goes on 'Spider-Man 3,' and thus, it falls flat. Look, if the eight-year old children sitting around me in the theater could follow the plot(s), and still enjoy the film and themselves, then I really fail to see how middle aged, accomplished writers and journalists could not.'Spider-Man 3' was able to masterful weave Peter Parker, our lamented titular hero, and the very love of his life, Mary Jane Watson's burgeoning relationship's ups and down, along with MJ's own lagging stage career, Peter's growing ego now that his alter ego has become the city's most beloved citizen and resident protector, the origin story of the criminal Sandman, and the reality that he was actually the murderer of Peter's Uncle Ben Parker, the arrival of rival photographer Eddie Brock, the bonding of Peter with the alien 'symbiote' who affords him a new, black costume and a severe personality alteration, Harry Osborn's vendetta against Peter, whom he sees as the murderer of his father, and finally, the rise of Venom, his team-up with the Sandman, the climatic battle between heroes and villains, and culminating in deaths, forgiveness, and redemption. Yes, all that happens in 140 minutes, and somehow, it is done with such skill and enjoyment on the part of the audience, that I still wonder at how it was accomplished.Tobey Maguire returns as our hero, and hopefully, not for the last time. Maguire epitomizes what Spider-Man used to be, and wears the role with the sort of ease the late, great Christopher Reeve possessed during his reign as the screen's Superman. Kirsten Dunst is given a lot to do here, and portrays Mary Jane Watson with real dramatic gusto, although as the film progresses, I really began to loathe MJ in a way I never have before.The true highlights are James Franco's Harry Osborn/New Goblin and Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marko/The Sandman. Franco's character has evolved so much during the series, and in 'Spider-Man 3' his fall into darkness is well done, as his return to innocence following his disastrous attack on Peter. I have to admit that there were tears in my eyes when Harry, now knowing how his father really died (thanks, Bernard!), saves the life of Peter, not once, but twice in the climactic battle with the Sandman and Venom. Harry dies for his friends, and is truly redeemed in a Darth Vader-like way that is sad, but satisfying.Church fully fleshes out Flint Marko in such a way, that you can really see director Raimi's fondness for the popular Spidey villain. Church's Sandman is a tragic figure, not sure if he is good or bad, but ultimately willing to do anything to save the life of his daughter (incidentally, also the daughter of the Bride in Kill Bill Vol. 2). Church's Sandman not only survives this film, but actually is forgiven for the worst crime in the Spider-Man mythos, killing Uncle Ben, by Peter himself.Topher Grace somewhat channels his smarmy role as Carter Duryea in 'In Good Company' as the despicable Edward Brock, Jr. And frankly, as the symbiote-fueled Venom, is given little to do at the end. Venom is not seen on screen until the final battle, and does not survive the outcome. And I think for this fact alone, many fans of Spider-Man's comic book adventures from the late 80s and through the late 90s were turned off by this film. Venom rose from a one-trick pony. rip-off supervillain (see Superman's Bizarro No.1 and The Flash's Reverse-Flash) to a full-fledged anti-hero, and I guess, many fanboys expected this to be on full display in 'Spider-Man 3.' But, this wasn't Venom's story, or even the symbiote's story. It was the story of three friends, Peter, MJ, and Harry, who at last overcome the horrible things that have done to themselves and one another, and at last triumph over evil in a way that could never be done behind a mask or with super-powers.If this is the end of Spider-Man's cinematic adventures, then I am truly sad. There are still just too many damn stories to tell about the Wall-Crawler. If this is simply the next chapter in Peter Parker's tale, then it is a fitting one that opens the door to the future of still my favorite hard-luck hero...well, next to Batman.Highest recommendation!",9,2,5,7 May 2007
Sleepy Hollow," A Wonderful Re-Telling of Irving's Classic Story
","Sleepy Hollow is a terrific film, depicting a daring re-telling of Washington Irving's legendary short story.  This time, Johnny Depp portrays Ichabod Crane, not a schoolteacher, but a New York City constable sent into the valley of the Hudson River to investigate the grisly murders by decapitation in the Dutch village of Sleepy Hollow.  We, as Crane does, these crimes have been committed by the Headless Hessian, or Horseman, a phantasm who rides a huge black horse and beheads his victims with a large mercenary broadsword and single-edged axe.Depp gives his finest performance to date, and meshes so completely well into the fantastic, yet dark, universe of director Tim Burton's filmmaking. He has made Crane an amalgam of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes and many other famous screen detectives, with dashes of New Yankee sensibility and British squeamishness.  Christian Ricci heads a spectacular supporting cast that includes the immortal Christopher Lee, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, and Michael Gough, lately the big screen's Batman's aide de camp, Alfred.  Christopher Walken portrays the silent, but deadly, Hessian, still bearing his fanged cranium, while stuntman and martial artist, late as The Phantom Menace's Darth Maul, Ray Park, is physically imposing and blindingly frightening as the ghostly real Horseman, post death.Tim Burton displays his unique and vividly imaginative directorial return with Sleepy Hollow, showing how well he can put together a big budget film and make it work triumphantly.  Let's hope he continues to make movies in this same energetic way for years to come.Highly recommended!",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Fitting End to the Star Wars Triology
","It was a great run for Lucas' Star Wars trilogy, and ended quite well with Return of the Jedi.  A terrific film, with good performances by all involved, particularly that of Mark Hamill, who matured both physically and emotionally throughout these movies.  Some might say that this is the inferior Star Wars film, and they would be wrong.  It is technically superior to both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, and features a full circle in the characterizations of Luke, Han and Leia, and most especially Darth Vader. Return is my favorite Star Wars film, and that is mostly because of its sentimentalities.  Few devotees can say that their eyes didn't mist when that black mask came off.  I guess I'm just a sucker for a happy ending. But, as of May 21, 1999, it all starts over...?",Null,0,0,12 November 1998
Blade II," Blade II Slices Through The Bad Sequel Myth!
","Blade II is one of those rare films, like The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part II, that surpasses its predecessor in the most wonderful and satisfying ways.Blade II succeeds thanks to the efforts of Guillermo del Toro, a talented, underappreciated (not much longer, hopefully) director, and the writing skills of David S. Goyer, the writer of the original film.  Blade II has a stronger script and director and this shines through every action-packed, thrilling minute.The film builds upon the characters and mythos of the original and continues to expand them, weaving an intricate, interesting environment for Blade and his vampiric nemeses.Wesley Snipes wears the role of Blade as well as that leather jacket and sunglasses.  He is so comfortable at being this truly awe-inspiring superhero...it proves that Blade was the role he was born to play.  Kris Kristofferson returns as Blade's mentor Whistler in a terrific plot-twist led by the explosive opening.  While the supporting players and villains, like Luke Goss as the fearsome Nomak, are all well-cast and perform admirably, Blade II is Snipes' show, and we can all thank God for that!Blade II leads Marvel Comics and its film properties on a fantastic charge just as its predecessor did.  Finally, really good movies based on comic books!  I just hope Warner Bros. is listening!Highly recommended!",Null,0,3,1 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Two-Foot Tall Jedi Master!
","Attack of the Clones is auteur George Lucas' follow-up to the first of the Prequel Trilogy in his Star Wars saga, The Phantom Menace.It is a fine addition to the Star Wars cinematic legend, and a great step up from the eagerly anticipated and highly flawed The Phantom Menace.Attack of the Clones features fine performances from Ewan MacGregor as the older, wiser, and more frazzled Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who spends much of the film investigating an attempted assassination and chastising his apprentice, the enthusiastic and arrogant Darth Vader-in-training Anakin Skywalker.  Hayden Christensen is Anakin Skywalker, who rises above sometimes stilted dialogue to portray a tortured and tormented young man with the weight of the galaxy on his shoulders.  Christensen's performance takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster, leaving us with a feeling of cold dread and a grim vision of the future for this character.  Natalie Portman is back as Padme Amidala, now a Republic Senator.  Portman delivers a much more skilled performance than her stoic, frozen-faced queen in The Phantom Menace, but it is her awe-inspiring beauty and daring, form-fitting outfits that garner the most attention.Samuel L. Jackson, one of my all-time favorite actors, truly shines as Jedi Master Mace Windu.  He is a man of action in Attack of the Clones, and delivers the best line in the film, 'This party's over.'  Temuera Morrison is the bounty hunter/clone template Jango Fett, and while not allowed very much time, possesses a mysterious, deadly screen presence, like Ray Park's Darth Maul.  His clone-raised-as-a-son Boba Fett is portrayed by young Daniel Logan, whose devilish glee at the destruction and mayhem caused  by his 'father' makes us forget the wooden Jake Lloyd.  Attack of the Clones' main antagonist, besides Ian McDiarmid's Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious, is Count Dooku, a charasimatic former Jedi who is leading a separatist revolt on the Republic.  Christopher Lee portrays Dooku as he has in all of his villainous roles: brilliantly.Now back to my one line summary.  It is Yoda, our diminutive Jedi Master, who truly steals the show.  Yoda, now a completely computer generated character, is brought to life in a way that overshadows everything else while he is on screen.  Yoda is seen as the perennially wise master and as the caring, sweet teacher, but also as a tiny, voracious warrior.  To see Yoda draw his lightsaber and fly about like  green ball lightning brought a smile to my face and excitement to the audience.Attack of the Clones features ILM's best special effects work to date. They triumphed in the key action sequences, especially the battle scenes on Geonosis, but their real triumph is the digital Yoda.  While the first hour of the film might seem slow and dragging, don't fret, the last hour and a half is a maelstrom of action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Lucas has brought us a not perfect, but wonderfully exciting chapter to his saga, and here's hoping will finish out the Prequel Trilogy on a high note.Oh, and by the way, Jar Jar Binks is only on screen for about three and a half minutes, and not to give the plot away, aids in damning the galaxy to a totalitarian future.  You gotta love that!Highly recommended!",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
American Pie," The 90's 'Porky's'...and something much better
","American Pie is a funny and alarmingly clever film that became one of the sleeper hits of the summer of 1999.  It is a teenage T/A film, reminiscent of those produced during the eighties featuring such superstars as Phoebe Cates and that girl from 'Tomboy.'  However, American Pie is well made, well cast, and delivers exactly what it intended to do, while others of its mold, such as the Porky's series, simply lapse into derivative slapstick and un-funny scenes.I found American Pie to be very imaginative and incredibly witty, and it depicts the lives of teenagers in a sweet light that could have easily degenerated into some sort of 'Kids'-esque oversexed romp.  Young adult viewers will enjoy this film not because of its truthful story line or dead-on performances, but rather its non-complicated gross-out comedy.  In other words, parents don't faint when you decide to take a seat next to your son or daughter and watch it.Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,1 December 1999
Watchmen," Well, it was 'Watchmen,' but...
","I liked 'Watchmen.' It was a very authentic adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' seminal 1985 twelve-issue D.C. Comics maxi-series (not a graphic novel!), painstakingly put together by auteur Zack Snyder, but in the end, I feel like it was just a movie that didn't really need to be made.Warner Bros. spent in excess of $120 million to make 'Watchmen.' This could've been better spent on a sequel to Bryan Singer's 'Superman Returns,' or any of Warner's long-gestating D.C. Comics-based films like 'Wonder Woman' or next year's 'Green Lantern.' Warner Bros. will take a financial beating on 'Watchmen' when they could've made a 'real' superhero movie and captured a windfall like they did with last year's 'The Dark Knight.' But, enough financializing. 'Watchmen' features nice performances, particularly Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, most people's favorite character from the original comic's, and perhaps, the most psychologically damaged. Haley deserves at least an Oscar nod for this role, but won't get one. Patrick Wilson is also very good as Dan Dreiberg, the second Night Owl, as is the lovely Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter, the second Silk Spectre. However, Laurie's dramatic arc from the comic feels forced and put upon here in the film. But, that's really what happens when you compress a twelve-issue series down into a two-and-a-half movie.Jeffrey Dean Morgan is never quite believable as Edward Blake, the Comedian. He has the chops, but just really doesn't pull off being the real scumbag the Blake is. Matthew Goode is fairly forgettable as Ozymandias. He brings little to this, perhaps, the most pivotal role in the story. And the ending is a total cop-out, once again feeling forced and rushed. I like Carla Gugino as Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre, but I like seeing her in just about anything. She isn't given much to do here, and her old-age make-up is pretty atrocious.Billy Crudup makes a fine Doctor Manhattan, but his origin story depicted in the film slows the whole thing down considerably, as does Crudup's dead-pan, monotonic delivery of Osterman/Manhattan's lines. The SFX used to bring he blue, nude living atomic reactor to life is adequate, but not sufficient enough. The CGI Doctor's lips often do not match his lines, which is a bit off-putting.The SFX for the film as a whole was well-done, and the set direction was spot-on to Mister Gibbons' original artwork. Much has been said about the fast-moving, incredibly choreographed fight scenes. What can I say? I liked them. It shows that these people are well trained and thoroughly experienced enough to be costumed crime fighters. What more do you want? All in all, 'Watchmen' is a good movie, but ultimately forgettable.

Spider-Man," Sam Raimi's Vision is Our Vision...
","The long and tumultuous wait for Spider-Man's journey to the silver screen has paid off in the most satisfying way since perhaps Richard Donner's Superman in 1978.Peter Parker has always had a rough ride in both of his alter egos, and his path to cinematic success is no different.  But, as a lifelong Spidey fan from the 60s cartoons to the 80s Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends to over a decade of reading the Marvel Comics, I must say it was well worth the wait.Spider-Man is Sam Raimi's homage to a beloved childhood idol, and brings home the message that with the right talent, an actually good film based of comic book material can be made.Nearly a decade of Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, and John Romita, Sr.'s work is condensed into a taut, well-paced two hours of action, suspense, and a real romance.  Tobey Maguire, no one's first choice, IS Peter Parker and his web-slinging secret identity, and will no doubt, for good or bad, be forever defined and associated with Spider-Man.  He fleshes out an already realistic character in a wonderful, sometimes tearful, way.  We feel Peter's pain and are overjoyed by his triumphs in and out of Spidey's colorful costume.Willem Dafoe, of course, does a spectacular job as science mogul Norman Osborn, and his fractured, insane alter ego, the Green Goblin.  Dafoe brings a brutal physicality to the Goblin that makes him awesome and terrifying at the same time.  Dafoe's Green Goblin is a true super-villain, willing and pleased to do his own dirty work, and not hiding behind henchmen like Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor or Jack Nicholson's Joker.Kirsten Dunst is excellent as Mary Jane Watson, the object of Peter's affection, and while on display for her physical assets, brings a great deal of depth to another tortured character.  The supporting cast all perform remarkably despite miniscule screen time, particularly James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rosemary Harris as the frail but dutiful Aunt May, the legendary Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, and J.K. Simmons, who steals the show as Daily Bugle publisher, J. Jonah Jameson, Peter's boss and Spider-Man's constant pain in the neck.  Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben evokes Glenn Ford's Jonathan Kent in Superman, instilling in his pseudo-son the immortal lesson 'With great power comes great responsibility.'It was hard not to get misty when seeing Spidey finally swing across the skyline on the screen.  For many of Spider-Man's long time fans, this film is a triumph for a character long deserving of wider acclaim.  I can only say, Thank you Mr. Raimi, Sony, and Marvel Comics.  Keep 'em coming!Highest recommendation!",Null,0,0,4 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," A True Testament to America's Darkest Day
","Pearl Harbor was a surprise for me in terms of cinematic experience, and proved once again that it remains a mystery why film critics are allowed a venue to voice their opinions.This film was a pure joy to behold from beginning to end, and is one of the more entertaining movies to come along in a while.  I was apprehensive when I learned that the bulk of the film revolves around a love triangle, but this thematic device does not detract an ounce from the overall plot.  It is simply a backstory for a series of events that leads to one of America's most terrifying experiences.  The interspersing scenes of Jon Voigt's poignant President F.D. Roosevelt and the Nipponese battle plan under Admiral Yamamoto and General Genda gave us a fictionalized, yet strong, portrayal of these leaders.The 45-minute sequence of Nippon's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the greatest in film history.  Never have I been so emotionally touched by a movie sequence, and I doubt that I will ever again.  To see my country struck with such a blatant show of military aggression is disheartening and mind-blowing, but on screen, is truly captivating. A few tears came to my eye when I saw fellow Texan Doris 'Dorie' Miller go against his appointed station and at the near expense of his life to man a machine gun on the deck of the U.S.S. West Virginia.  Miller won the Navy Cross for his actions, and he deserved it.  Some would say that Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance and Miller's scenes in this film were not needed, but I disagree...Dorie Miller's story must be told for posterity's sake, and this was the perfect venue for it.Of all of the fine performances of the film, Alec Baldwin's portrayal of then Colonel James Doolittle was the immediate stand-out.  Baldwin showed a definite affinity for the pilot and commander, and his depiction of Doolittle shows this.I ask readers of this review who have not yet seen Pearl Harbor to do so. It is not as over long as many reviewers have stated, and its three-hour length moves along a brisk pace.  I think it's important for Americans to see this film and realize the sacrifices that our grandparents and elders made in order to keep our nation and the world safe from tyranny.  It's just too bad that it has to be a movie to finally put that point across.",Null,0,0,29 May 2001
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight Detective Is Back! And Thank God (and Christoper Nolan) For It!
","Batman Begins is the starting point for a new filmic franchise featuring the venerable and venerated Caped Crusader, and it is, most likely, and in this humble reviewer's opinion, the best depiction of Batman and his mythos ever put to celluloid.Director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer flesh out the origin and pathos of Bruce Wayne and his rise to the self-styled guardian of the grim and gritty metropolis of Gotham City. Finally, the audience is given a glimpse of Bruce's world travels and training in the fighting arts. We see when, how, and why Bruce Wayne chose to don the cape and cowl of the World's Greatest Detective.Batman Begins is a realistic, firmly-planted-on-the-ground depiction of the early career of Batman and his alter ego's recapture of the financial empire established by his murdered parents. It is a subtle, almost low-key film, with the obligatory fighting and explosions, but more of a character study why a man would chose to fight crime dressed as a bat.Christian Bale is Batman, just like Christopher Reeve was Superman and Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man. He embodies the triune role of the real Bruce Wayne, a tortured soul yearning for justice, the public Bruce Wayne, a foppish, slurred playboy, and the Batman, a frightening force of nature vowed to rid his city of evil and injustice. Bale brings all of those aspects to life, physically, mentally, and emotionally.Of the supporting cast, the true highlights are Michael Caine as the stalwart, fatherly Alfred the butler, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences Head turned steward of the family company, and the best of all, Gary Oldman as Police Sgt. James Gordon, Batman's staunchest, albeit originally reluctant, ally in his war on crime. Oldman looks and sounds just like all comics' fans' idea of what Gordon should look and sound like. Gordon is also given something to do this time in a Batman film, and in the end, helps to literally save the day. The creation of the unlikely partnership between the Dark Knight and Jim Gordon is a linchpin of this film, and is a moving and integral part to the movie.The villains are not over-the-top neon-colored weirdos. They are realistic people played by Cillian Murphy as the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane and Liam Neeson as the duplicitous Ducard/Ra's al Ghul. Murphy is very good as the slimy and creepy Crane/Scarecrow, and Neeson is as great as ever as the true 'Demon's Head.' The true villainous standout is Tom Wilkinson's turn as mobster Carmine Falcone, the last of Gotham's 'normal' bad guys before the city becomes plagued by Batman's unique and grotesque rogue's gallery.There are few things to complain about in Batman Begins. If I had one complaint it would be that we didn't see enough farther shots of Batman fighting hand-to-hand, making the action quick and hard to follow. As for Katie Holmes' Rachel Dawes, I think she did a good job with what she had, and you can't really fault her for that.The last scene of Batman Begins sets up not just a sequel but a true film series. Batman, summoned by the now Lt. Gordon and his Bat-Signal, and Gordon firmly establish their alliance, and we see that the 'theatricality' of the Batman's modus operandi has inadvertently brought forth a new crop of criminals, one who Gordon reveals leaves as a calling card, a Joker. As Batman gets to work, Gordon tells him, 'I never said thank you.' Batman's reply, 'And you'll never have to.'And that, my friends, pretty much says it all. Batman Begins is one the best comic book/superhero adaptations ever created, and those of you that have shied away, still smarting from the not-so-great Bat-films from '92 to '97, do not fear. Batman Begins is so much better and so much more.Highest Recommendation!",10,1,3,22 June 2005
The Princess Bride," Inconceivably Great!
","The Princess Bride is a terrific movie, great for those times when you're feeling down or unhappy.  It picks the spirits right up, and that's a wondrous thing for any film to do.  Excellent performances all around from Carey Elwes as our hero, a pre-Forrest Gump Robin Wright as the princess, and Fright Night's devilish Chris Sarandon as the malevolent Prince Humperdinck.  But, the standouts are definitely the late, great Andre the Giant as the thoughtful Fezzik, the wonderfully annoying Wallace Shawn as the 'evil' genius Vizzini, and the true scene-stealer, Mandy Patinkin as the avenging swordsman Inigo Montoya.  A great family film, a good date movie, and all around a terrific movie-going experience.Highly recommended!",Null,1,2,22 January 1999
Ghost Rider," Great Marvel-Fueled Fun With Just A Little Cheesy Aftertaste
","First off, let me preface this review by saying that I was never huge fan or aficionado of Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider. I liked the character somewhat, but found myself more attuned with Marvel's other heroes, like Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Hulk. Now, going into the cinematic version of the Spirit of Vengeance, I really had no preconceived notions. I enjoyed the very first theatrical trailer for the film that I saw with last year's disastrous X-Men: The Last Stand, but was sort of wary of the film after seeing the corny, humorous television commercials that were run endlessly before the movie's release on 16 February 2007.However, after actually seeing Ghost Rider, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the end product and had a great time watching it. Yet, the film is not without its problems. The story of a young motorcycle daredevil's bargain with the Devil for the life of his cancer-stricken father, Ghost Rider has a pretty good foundation to stand on. Then, of course, in the Marvel way, the story goes on a completely different, un-Faustian course, as that young daredevil, Johnny Blaze, now a grown up, world famous stunt cyclist, is forced to relive his horrible curse as the Ghost Rider, a flame-skulled demonic entity charged by Mephistopheles (not Mephisto as in the comics) to hunt down wayward demons, including Satan's own son, Blackheart, played with devilish, yet pale and gaunt, glee by Wes Bentley.The film boasts incredible special effects. Ghost Rider was another one of those fictional characters I thought could never be pulled off on screen without looking cheap or silly, but in this movie, it totally works. Ghost Rider is fully realized and is one scary dude. And that demonic chopper of his is totally indescribable. As for the rest of the characters, including the Rider's own alter ego, this where the film stops short.Peter Fonda is Mephistopheles, but not the red-skinned demonic creature from the comics. He is a leather-jacketed snake-oil salesman. Fonda is fine in the role, but what bothers me is that they pass this version of Mephisto off as the actual, biblical Satan, which was never the comics' intention. This could be a controversial point for some religious viewers, but I just felt that it betrayed the Marvel version somewhat. Eva Mendes portrays Johnny Blaze's lamented love, Roxanne Simpson, but she is given very little to do, but stand around in skin-tight, cleavage-magnifying outfits. Now, don't get me wrong, in that aspect, Ms. Mendes is incredible. She is incredibly beautiful and a treat to both stare at and watch move around, but her character really does little else, and she has little to no chemistry with Nicolas Cage's Johnny Blaze.And as for Cage's Johnny Blaze, I think the film ultimately does suffer from the wrong casting here. I don't really believe Cage as the daredevil Blaze or as Ms. Mendes' love interest and his motion-captured movements as Ghost Rider do not really seem heroic or larger than life. It seems that Cage was sort of phoning in this role, even though he is a huge fan of both comic books and Ghost Rider himself. I found myself just wishing someone else were playing this role.The story of Ghost Rider's hunt for Blackheart and his elemental minions is pedestrian and has be done time and time again, but it is still fun to watch and just cool to see on screen. Sam Elliot is, as always, terrific as the mysterious Caretaker, who guides Johnny on his journey as the latest incarnation of Ghost Rider. The big reveal at the end of Caretaker, as Carter Slade, the 19th Century Ghost Rider, is not all that shocking or surprising but does make for an interesting twist. And the scene of the two Ghost Riders, one astride a skeletal, fiery horse, and one traveling on a demon-fueled chopper, is just really amazing to see.I think that Ghost Rider could have been a great movie, maybe with another actor in the title role, or perhaps with the original R-rated screenplay of David Goyer, but in the end it was simply a good film that gave me a great ride, and that's really saying and accomplishing a lot.Recommended.",8,4,8,20 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Weak, Insipid Ending To a Fine Cinematic Saga
","This review contains massive spoilers and only mild ranting.X-Men: The Last Stand limped in, weakened and ailing, as the conclusion to Bryan Singer's filmic saga featuring Marvel Comics' venerable X-Men. I will not go into the specifics of how The Last Stand betrayed its characters' comic book origins, or will I speak of Fox Studios' flawed, fast-tracked, rushed, and sloppy attempt to spite Bryan Singer for leaving (temporarily) to direct this summer's 'Superman Returns.' No, that will not affect the normal movie-going public's opinion of this film.Instead I will just say that this really is a film to avoid, and was a disrespectful follow-up to what Bryan Singer and Co. tried to build in the first two films of this series.The Last Stand suffered from pacing problems and odd, frenetic editing. Much of the film is dialogue, and not particularly well-written dialogue. What action we do get is sporadic and anti-climatic. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, an awe-inspiring character of the last two films, is reduced to a whimpering simp in The Last Stand, who stands around whining, complaining, and avoiding doing anything until at the end of the movie when he realizes that he will not get his way. Halle Berry, who complained about Storm's lack of anything to do in the first films, once again has little to do in this one but talk and complain. Professor X, our stalwart leader, is made a villain, and Sir Ian McKellan's Magneto is turned into a total psychopath. All in all, most of our returning characters have been transformed into pale imitations of themselves, self-parodying their once fine performances into a bad episode of Seinfeld. I almost expected Wolverine, Storm, Professor X, and Magneto to all be sitting around at Monk's Coffee Shop bitching about their miserable lives.The film is not without its good points, though. Kelsey Grammar's Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy, the anthropoid Beast, is terrific, and his action sequences, albeit brief, are exciting and filled with more ape-fighting action that all of 'King Kong.' Yet, he has little screen time, and ultimately, little to do. Ben Foster's Warren Worthington III/Angel is nothing more than scenery. He has two scenes, which will good, give little else to the film.As for the plot: it's ham-fisted, trite, and downright boring. There is a cure for mutantcy, and Magneto wants to rally mutants against it. How does he go about it? By fighting other mutants. Really smart plan for Mr. Lensherr, isn't' it? And as for the 'Phoenix' saga played out with Famke Janssen's Jean Grey? They didn't even attempt to follow the original comic book story, or build something the least bit original or entertaining. Basically, in the film's big climax, Jean just stands there for twenty minutes doing nothing until Wolverine comes forward, kills a 'Class 5' mutant with his claws, and then cries over her body.The Last Stand ends with major, beloved characters dead, one cured (hint: it's Rogue), and not much else. Oh, and if you stay past the credits, you'll discover a nice scene that really does little to save this horrible excuse for a movie.The only thing I could think as I walked out into the Texas summer sunlight was 'God, I hope Superman Returns is good.' It's something I will continue to pray until the thirtieth of June.Not recommended.",2,15,24,29 May 2006
Hellboy," Great Adaptation of Mike Mignola's Comic Book Hero's Early Adventures
","Hellboy is a terrific action, science fiction, and horror-laced film, featuring amazing performances, incredible special effects, and masterly make-up work.Mike Mignola's signature character, the titular Hellboy, is brought to life as only Ron Perlman and as only monster make-up maestro Rick Baker can. Perlman and Baker's Hellboy looks as if he stepped right off one of Mignola's signature abstract-like comic art panels.  Perlman portrays Hellboy as an everyman who stomps out evil much like a plumber unclogs a drain.  Perlman's Hellboy is an awe-inspiring presence who gets as good as he gives, and always has a smart quip no matter what obstacle he faces.  I commend Perlman for his performance as Hellboy, because it appears incredibly difficult to play a part in such intricate make-up and costume, and still put forth a more than worthy perforamce.Doug Jones is Abraham Sapien, the aquatic telepath who appears to be an amalgam of man, salamander, and sundry fish parts.  His voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce, who is perfect in providing Sapien with intelligence, aloofness, and humanity.  Once again, Rick Baker does a perfect job with adapting Sapien's comic book appearance for the silver screen.Selma Blair is fine as pyrokinetic Liz Sherman, and gives a measured, yet tortured performance.  Her best scenes are with Perlman's Hellboy, and we see that these two are, literally, made for each other.John Hurt's Professor Trevor Bruttenholm is a sheer delight, and is a spot on homage to Mignola's character in appearance and performance.  His fatherly relationship to Hellboy is expanded upon and very touching.The villains of Hellboy are frightening, to say the least.  Karl Roden's seemingly immortal Rasputin is deliciously sinister, but reverent to the powers that he serves.  Biddy Hodson's Ilsa Haupstein is vile, yet sexy, but Ladislav Beran's Kroenen is a disturbing, violent creature that goes well beyond the appropriately stereotypical Nazi villain portrayal.Hellboy is a rare film that can please a wide variety of audiences and filmgoers.  It truly is a movie that has it all.  And I think that Mr. Mignola will be pleased how Guillermo del Toro's opus turned out.Highly recommended!",Null,0,0,9 April 2004
Transformers," Well Worth the 23-Year Wait...
","I've grown up loving 'The Transformers.' It was 1986 and everyday I'd come home from the third grade and sit in my school clothes and watch twenty-two minutes of every episode of third season of 'The Transformers.' Even without Optimus Prime that very last season, my all-time favorite Transformer and toy, I was enthralled and engrossed and loved every minute of it.'The Transformers' have stayed with me. Optimus Prime remains one my heroes, as well as Bumblebee and Jazz. They are still real to me. They always were.So, when I see some of my childhood heroes realized on the big screen, alive and well and in real life, to say I was floored would be an understatement. To say I didn't cry when I saw that semi-tractor trailer transform into a thirty-foot tall robot and hear Peter Cullen's baritone voice booming out of it would be nothing less than a lie.Filmmaker Michael Bay has made his masterpiece and it's called 'Transformers.' And that's whats so damn weird, because in reality, this film is an adaptation of a late animated series and a stalwart toy line. It's not an original idea, and maybe that made it easier for Bay. Whatever the case, he, along with two very talented screenwriters, and Industrial Light & Magic, gave me, and so many other fans, old and young, our Transformers.I'm really just too emotional to give a good, solid synopsis-filled review. Maybe I will someday, but after seeing 'Transformers' twice, I can't sit here and write, 'Well, this happened next, and then this actor portrayed his character well, and blah, blah, blah.' I can't do it.At the end the end of the day, I saw a live-action 'Transformers' movie. I saw Optimus Prime living and breathing (or the Cybertronian equivalent), I saw Starscream fail Megatron, and I saw Prime and Megatron fight to the death. I heard that glorious transforming noise, and well, I just can't say enough about Mr. Cullen's voice work. He's a god among men, especially men my age.His Optimus Prime, as it was twenty-plus years ago, is still the heart and soul of everything 'The Transformers' stood for then and now. As I've left the theater for the second of probably several more times, it hits me every time, 'Now I know why Optimus Prime is still my hero.' He just is...Now, many will not like this film, fans and non-fans alike. And that's fine, I don't expect everyone to like 'Transformers.' It may not be everybody's cup of tea. But, for me, it was pretty much exactly what I had hoped for...and leaves me wanting more, much, more than meets the eye. Sorry, had to do it.Highest recommendation!",10,4,7,6 July 2007
For Love of the Game," A Satisfying Baseball Film that Doubles as a Love Story...
","For Love of the Game is one of those rare gems that comes along once ever so often that leaves the audience fully satisfied, from a movie-going standpoint, and does exactly what it sets out to do.I was wary of another try at a comeback by Kevin Costner, but his tender and moving performance was a true and pleasant surprise.  Portraying fictional life-long Detroit Tiger pitcher, Billy Chapel, a not larger than life character, but just a normal man, despite his media-intensive career, is a great breath of fresh air.  There are great performances abounding in his film, including the two main supporting players, John C. Reilly, as Costner's pitcher's stalwart catcher, and Kelly Preston, as the conflict and caring love interest.The film moves a terrific pace, interweaving the five-year relationship of Costner's Chapel and Preston's Jane Aubrey with Chapel's possibly final and oh-so-perfect game in Yankee Stadium.  It works on numerous levels, and left me with a lot of on-screen memories.Unfortunately, there is a downside.  I fear too few people with see For Love of the Game, and most that did see it will soon forget it.  Will it revive Costner's sagging career?  Probably not.  It is a great movie, though? Undoubtedly, yes!Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
The Dark Knight," There Is No Peace...
","One thing I realized after watching 'The Dark Knight' was that, for the first time in my life, I do not want to be Batman. It is a horrible, horrible life. There is no peace, no rest, no happiness for Bruce Wayne. 'The Dark Knight' crystallizes what it is like to be the Batman in a way never seen before on the printed page or on the silver screen. And I do not want to be Batman. I'd rather be any other superhero -- Superman, Green Lantern, or even the Flash.And another thing. Batman, especially Christopher Nolan's Batman, does not whine. He doesn't complain about how bad he has it. He is the antithesis of Spider-Man, particularly Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. Peter Parker seems to almost wallow in his misery, whereas Bruce Wayne gets up, dusts himself off, and launches himself at evil and injustice again and again.And I'll take the Dark Knight over Iron Man any day. Bruce Wayne plays the role of the vapid, moral-less playboy. Tony Stark is one. Bruce Wayne never compromised himself to do what's right. Tony Stark does this all the time, and even kills people. And lastly, Batman's identity is a secret...Stark basically unmasks himself for everyone to see. I'd rather have the Batman on my side at any time.Now, this is no normal review of 'The Dark Knight.' You can get that anywhere. I apologize for using this review as a sounding board, but after seeing the masterpiece that was 'The Dark Knight,' I just had to share my feelings. And don't get me wrong, I loved 'Iron Man.' Loved it. But, Iron Man is no Dark Knight. There's only one and thank God he still lives on the silver screen.",10,3,7,20 July 2008
Pulp Fiction," See it a second time...you'll like it!

It is violent, bloody, and profane, but sometimes, I need an injection of that in my life.  Great performances abound, but it is Samuel L. Jackson's pre-Jedi Master performance as the spiritually inclined Jules that truly makes this film terrific to watch.  Also a treat are Ving Rhames and Harvey Kietel as the Wolf.  When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I wasn't impressed, but the second time, I realized what a good time I had watching it.  Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,17 May 1999
The Untouchables," One of the Greatest Films Ever Made
","The Untouchables is a masterpiece from beginning to end, and features some of the best work by its cast and crew in their entire career.An adaptation of the classic television show starring Robert Stack, this film depicts Treasury agent Elliot Ness' war against Prohibition and its staunchest supporter, Chicago mob boss, Alfonse 'Scarface' Capone.  Kevin Costner is terrific as our hero, with an honest and earnest performance, tempered with emotion and determination.  Robert De Niro is incredible as Capone, and delivers many of the film's best lines and on-screen moments, including one in particular involving a baseball bat and the ideal of teamwork.  However, the true scene stealer is the legendary Sean Connery as career cop, Jim Malone, who shows the novice Ness the ropes and the indelible 'Chicago Way.'Along with great performances, the film also has dead-on direction by Brian De Palma; a truly excellent screenplay by David Mamet; grand, dramatic cinematography; and a memorable, stirring musical score by the immortal Ennio Morricone.The Untouchables is one of those few films to come along and actually leaves me fully satisfied.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Well, it could've been much worse...right?
","I liked 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' right after I left the theater. I defended the durn thing to anyone who'd listen. But, as the days ticked off, I came to find myself not liking this film as much as I had when the credits rolled and the lights came on.'Revenge' is crude, sexist, and a bit bigoted, and those are things I didn't believe when I first saw the film. I feel ashamed towards Hasbro, the owners of the Transformers brand, for letting such a nasty-spirited film feature the properties they have always protected and held close to the chest.Now, having said that, there is much to like about 'Revenge' including the once-again incredible special effects, the lovely Megan Fox, and most especially Peter Cullen reprising his role as the voice of Optimus Prime. There are many very good battle scenes, some pretty good acting, and even a few jokes that don't make you feel dirty laughing about afterward.Here's hoping that Michael Bay, who made the original 'Transformers' his magnum opus, will get back on track for 2011's 'TF 3.'

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Cinematic Tour De Force for Lucas and Company and...
","A Fitting End to the Star Wars Saga on the Silver Screen.Well, I knew Revenge of the Sith would be a good movie. It wouldn't be as good as the other films in the Original Trilogy, but it would at least be better than the other two Prequel films.And boy, how right I was.Revenge of the Sith depicts the fall of nearly everyone and everything that the Prequel Trilogy, up until now, had established and attempted to get us to root for. The Old Republic crumbles in the wake of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's, also known as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, meteoritic rise from war-time leader to emperor of the galaxy. The Jedi Order is decimated to its very core, and not even its young Padawans survive. Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda are beaten, broken, and dispirited, and ultimately, exiled. Padme dies from a broken heart and delivers Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa into a tumultuous new world. And lastly, but certainly not least, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker turns to the Dark Side of the Force so that the only thing he truly loves will not die.It is epic Greek-style tragedy in the form of cinema's greatest space opera, and it works on so many levels, that I will simply not bore you with the details.Revenge of the Sith finally gives the audience the humor we've been waiting for, but it's almost disheartening, knowing the dark turns the film is about to take. It depicts two men, Anakin and Obi-Wan, who genuinely care and love one another, and how horribly awry their relationship goes.Many of the missteps and mistakes of the first two films in the Prequel Trilogy are corrected and rectified, besides the humor. The dialog is stronger, the performances and chemistry between the characters are smoother, and the whole tone just feels...like Star Wars. And that's something we've all been waiting for for six years.Ewan McGregor shines as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and it seems that he finally feels comfortable in that role and its grand surroundings. Hayden Christensen gives a talented, tortured performance as the Chosen One gone wrong, and proves that he is a skilled actor. Natalie Portman is wonderful and luminous as the woman Anakin loves and yearns to save. Yet, the two performers that stole the show were Ian McDiarmid as the malign Palpatine/Darth Sidious, and the entirely-CGI Yoda, voiced once more with dramatic gusto by Frank Oz. As tormenting as the final lightsaber-filled showdown between Anakin and Obi-Wan was, the battle between Yoda and Palpatine is that much more sadder and dramatic. Yoda knows that he is losing a fight he cannot hope to win, and is humbled before McDiamid's Palpatine, as the once venerated Jedi Master must crawl to safety and exile through a rat-sized maze of tunnels and wires.And that duel on the volcano world of Mustafar? It is no heavily choreographed kung fu fight like Obi-Wan and Darth Maul's battle in The Phantom Menace. This is a knockdown, drag-out brawl between two Force practitioners fed up with everything they've upheld and loved. It is violent, dramatic, and ultimately futile for both parties, as Obi-Wan tells his hacked-to-pieces former Padawan that he is sorry that he failed him. Anakin, then set aflame and charred to a gruesome crispiness by the rivers of lava below him, responds only with a declaration of hate for everything and everybody.We see Anakin, now Darth Vader, re-born as the cyborgized, black armored giant of the Original Trilogy, told by his new master, the Emperor, that he has caused the death of his beloved Padme. In James Earl Jones' legendary and mechanized voice, we hear the last vestige of Anakin Skywalker in the form of a tormented cry of 'No!' There are many things to love about Revenge of the Sith, and there are many things to be sad about. It's the end of so much for Star Wars fans, and the series goes out on such a high note, we wonder why it has to end at all.But, at the end of the day, when the final credits role, you must take heart that despite the Sith's revenge and the rise of the Galactic Empire, that on two very different planets, and in the form of two infant siblings, there lies A New Hope.Thanks to Mr. Lucas and all in involved in bringing back Star Wars to the big screen and maintaining a universe of stories and wonderful characters that have brought me, and so many, such great joy.",9,1,4,20 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," A Cinematic Triumph
","The Shawshank Redemption appeared and disappeared in 1994 with little steam. It was heartily acclaimed, but audiences shied away, probably because its story takes place primarily within the walls of a prison.  However, many, since then, have found this wonderful gem, and have declared it to be one of the finest films ever made.The Shawshank Redemption is the story of a young banker, Andy Dufresne, sentenced to life in Shawshank Prison in New England for the murder of his wife and her lover.  The film methodically and sometimes grotesquely depicts Andy's hard time in an episodic form of many situations, sometimes positive and enlightening, other times, grisly and disheartening.  Andy's guide on this trip through hell isn't Dante's Virgil, but Ellis 'Red' Redding, a lifer who has a knack at 'getting things.'  The relationship between these two inmates is slow, yet heart-warming, as is the entire pace of the film.Andy is portrayed meticulously and intelligently by Tim Robbins, who shows the banker's transformation from scared 'fish' to top dog over a course of many years.  Morgan Freeman is Red, who sees his decades within the walls of Shawshank as the only true life he has ever known.  These two are supported by a well-casted group, which includes cameos and extras by real-life prison inmates.The Shawshank Redemption is a film which pulls the audience in, and while long and slow, captures the imagination and forces the viewer to remain through the entire terrific, yet frightening, journey.Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,13 December 1999
Iron Man," The Greatest Marvel Comics-Based Movie Adaptation...until the last two seconds
","Iron Man was one of my favorite comic book superheroes. In many ways, he was the Marvel equivalent of D.C.'s Batman, but also the Dark Knight's juxtaposition.Well, leave it to Marvel to so totally screw up the character, as of late, that I can hardly stand the guy any more.That being said, 'Iron Man' is, indeed, the finest film adaptation of a Marvel Comic book. It eclipses all of Marvel's other cinematic efforts, even the fairly flawless 'Spider-Man 2' and 'X2: X-Men United.' Robert Downey, Jr. is awe-inspiring as Anthony Edward Stark and his alter ego, the Golden Avenger. It's good to see Downey in top form and he ably proves that he can play the good guy, the action hero, and the star of a huge summer blockbuster.And that's exactly what 'Iron Man' is. A huge summer blockbuster. But, the film is also really grounded in reality, features snappy dialogue, and at times, is genuinely funny.Jeff Bridges is terrific as the classic '80s comic book villain Obadiah Stane. He's so nice and charming as Stane, that when he transforms into the villain of the piece, it's quite alarming and disarming (well, at least to those who don't know anything about Iron Man or his rogue's gallery).The film's features spot-on special effects and some great animatronics/costuming work by the legendary Stan Winston. The only time I could tell the 'real' Iron Man from the CGI one was when he moved. Otherwise, the transition was flawless.I so totally fell in love with Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's stalwart assistant Virginia 'Pepper' Potts. Now, here's a Marvel-based redhead we can get behind after the dour, sour Mary Jane Watson of the last two 'Spider-Man' films. Paltrow is absolutely gorgeous as Pepper, and you have to love the way she teetered about in those heels while on the run from danger.The film features a cameo from the Marvel secret agent organization, S.H.I.E.L.D., which has been transformed into an American agency here. And I love the way they are integrated into both Tony Stark and Iron Man's lives. However, why the filmmakers (and more than likely, Marvel's editorial department) chose to have Stark reveal his secret identity at the film's close is really beyond me. What's the point of superheroes at all if they don't have secret identities (the Hulk and a few others notwithstanding)? Yet, much of that shock and disappointment is made up in the post-credits sequence featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nicholas J. Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s public director basically recruiting Stark and Iron Man for the Avengers, Marvel's premier superhero team (think Justice League).Despite this tiny little gripe, 'Iron Man' is amazing, truly amazing. And since Marvel actually financed this small film, hey, they might actually make some money from it this time.Highly recommended.",9,1,3,6 May 2008
X2: X-Men United," The Marvel Cinematic Train keeps rolling along...
","X2: X-Men United is Bryan Singer's franchise's The Empire Strikes Back. It actually and successfully builds upon and surpasses its 2000 predecessor, and that is a feat in of itself.X2 picks up right where the previous X-Men film leaves off, and never stops for a second.  It contains all of the elements of a hard sci-fi film, action-adventure, and poignant drama, and somehow, pulls it all off.Hugh Jackman returns as the stalwart Logan, AKA Wolverine, still on the search for his past.  This collides with the appearance of Nazi-esque military scientist Colonel William Stryker, portrayed delectably by Brian Cox, who wants to infiltrate the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, and rend mutantkind asunder.  All of our previous players have returned, yet in beefed up, fleshed-out roles.  And somehow, Singer and Co. have been enable to inject further characters, such as Aaron Stamford's manic and morose Pyro and Shawn Ashmore's earnest Iceman.  The true stand-out is Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, alias Nightcrawler, a young man who is committed to his Christian faith but is cursed to live life looking like a blue demon. Kurt's pain, but upbeat attitude towards forgiveness, makes him an incredibly realistic character.  Cumming's scenes with Halle Berry's redeemed Storm are terrific and heartfelt.And let us not forget our villains.  Along with the aforementioned Col. Stryker, Sir Ian McKellen's Magneto returns, as does Rebecca Stamos' Mystique.  McKellen chews up the scenery and naturally, delivers some of the best lines in the film, but Stamos' Mystique's part is extended and magnified, giving us a better picture at this deadly, although conflicited, femme fatale.It was a shear pleasure to see the introduction of one of my favorite X-Men, the long lamented Colossus, played here with enormous physicality by newcomer Daniel Cudmore.  Colossus is not seen much, but when he is, the audience is transfixed by his awesome metallic form.  Here's hoping we hear and see more from the armored X-Man-in-training in the future.Patrick Stewart wears the Professor X role much like his immaculate suits: perfectly.  The role was his to take and he it has enveloped him nearly as well as his previous Capt. Picard role from Star Trek: The Next Generation and its subsequent feature films.  Professor X comes off as the loving instructor and mentor, but his mind-manipulation ability appears frightening in the context of X2.  We truly learn that Charles Xaxier is the Earth's most powerful mutant...and perhaps, man.Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen shine, as always, as Wolverine and Jean Grey. Jackman owns the role of Logan, and we even get well-received glimpses of Wolverine's 'berzerker' behavior.  Janssen, and this is SPOILER MATERIAL, is the biggest surprise of X2.  Her revelation of the emerging ability to manipulate the star-wide Phoenix Force, is a great surprise for the long-time comic book fans.  However, her self-sacrifice and apparent 'death' were huge shocks.  Yet, as the film ends, we glimpse through Professor Xavier's mind's eye, and see that Jean will return, but most likely, will never be the same.James Marsden's Cyclops is a delight, as always, but unfortunately, and this is my only gripe, is in the film very little.  However, his short scenes are so densely packed with drama and emotion, fans of Scott Summers will be forgiving.  And besides, if there is an X-Men 3, and God willing, there will be, with Jean Grey's likely return, Cyclops must take a central role in a possible 'Phoneix/Dark Phoneix' storyline.You cannot see X2 once.  There is too much on screen to be viewed, and potentially missed.  For comics fans, there are plenty of Easter Eggs and little hidden secrets, and unless you're a mutant, you cannot catch them all.  So, see it again if you can, and take along a loved one.  X2 is one film you must not miss.Marvel Comics' cinematic triumphs continue to build and amaze.  If Warner Bros. had learned long ago that in order to make successful, well-received films featuring their trademark D.C. Comics superhero characters you must employ the best talent who treat the characters honestly and with reverence, we might not have had a glut of terrible Superman and Batman movies.  And while the Marvel train chugs along, Warner Bros. mires itself in self-doubt and second-guessing, leaving the fans out there with the question of whether we'll ever see another GOOD Superman or Batman film ever again.Highest recommendation!",Null,1,2,5 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," Fine dramatic turn for Bruce Willis
","The Sixth Sense is a great suspense thriller, and one of the best films of 1999.  It features a surprisingly wonderful performance by action superstar Bruce Willis, who has found a new niche in his lengthy, and sometimes disappointing career.  His dramatic, understated turn as the tortured child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe is truly great.Haley Joel Osment gives a powerful performance as the young Cole, our adolescent hero who possesses the strange, psychic ability to see and interact with ghosts.The Sixth Sense pleasantly surprised me with its performances, twists and turns, and an awe-inspiring ending.  It shows the viewer, what I already knew, that Bruce Willis a talented actor with a greater range than just the legendary Die Hard.Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,16 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Beginning of A New Era In Film
","Well, I can safely say in this day and age of cynicism and sardonic sarcasm, that I still believe in Star Wars.  I wasn't yet alive when this film was released, and I only began to learn of Lucas' legend when Return of the Jedi, but that was enough to get hooked. Star Wars was and is a marvel of movie creation.  It lambasted its way into an era of hi-tech special effects, big budgets, and simplistic storytelling. Some call it the death of cinema, but I call it the re-birth of the matinee.  People easily forget what movies are and supposed to be.  Not moral messages or poignant take on society.  A movie is a chance, an attempt to get away from the pains and pangs of normal life.  Star Wars succeeds in every way.  I was fortunate to see the Special Edition of this film last year, and was pleasantly surprised that none of Lucas' touch-ups took away from the overall magical quality of the movie.  Were they needed?  Of course, not, but they did not detract.  I saw young children who have never heard of a Wookiee come alive again, with giant smiles and sparks in their eyes.  Star Wars does its job, and it did its job on me again.",Null,0,0,10 November 1998
Tarzan," A True Triumph for Disney and for the Lord of the Apes...
","I was fortunate enough to see Tarzan over this last weekend, and I really didn't know what to expect.  I had seen that it had fairly good reviews, but I was wary because primarily of two things: Disney and Rosie O'Donnell.How pleasantly surprised I was!  This was not only a very faithful and respectful depiction of Tarzan, but also the best animated production Disney has put together since The Little Mermaid.  It featured superb animation, very realistic and very fluid, and incredible scenery and action sequences. The voice-over work was very good, as well, especially by Minnie Driver as Jane Porter, Tony Goldwyn as the Jungle Lord, and even Rosie O'Donnell as young Terk.  O'Donnell's ape sidekick never once detracted from the film, and neither did Wayne Knight's Tantor the elephant.I was very moved by this film, something that happens only rarely.  When Tarzan yelled his classic jungle cry, I definitely misted up.  This is the way Tarzan should always be portrayed!  While many purists will see this film as diverging from the immortal E.R. Burroughs' storyline, it still shows the reverence and respect that this character has always deserved but never attained.Very satisfying and highly recommended for children of all ages.",Null,1,1,26 June 1999
Fantastic Four," Marvel's First Family Done Well
","Well, most people will tell you that Fantastic Four isn't a good movie. These people include so-called film critics, comic book geeks, and plain idiots.Well, I am a comic book geek, fancy myself an amateur film critic, and have done some idiotic things in my life. And I still liked Fantastic Four.It is an exciting, thoughtful cinematic adaptation of Stan 'The Man' Lee and Jack 'King' Kirby's creation, the Fantastic Four, the comic book that ushered in the 'Marvel Age' of comics that gave us such characters and filmic fodder as Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Incredible Hulk, and Daredevil, among many others.The film got many things right - Ben Grimm's horror at becoming the rock-skinned Thing, Reed and Sue's love-hate-love relationship, and Johnny Storm's shear love of being the Human Torch.More questionable is the portrayal of Julian McMahon's Doctor Doom, which was changed quite a bit from his comic book counterpart. Well, I believe the dark, demented, jealousy-driven spirit of Victor Von Doom was still there, and a bit more fleshed out and realistic.The humor was spot on, as was the drama, and you really felt sorry for these guys, especially Ben. Marvel's track record of edgy, depressed characters began here with the Thing, and in Michael Chiklis' tortured portrayal, he really shines.I recommend those of you who have not seen Fantastic Four to see it, with objectivity and the idea of just having a good time. I just feel that when the spirit of the source material remains, a film adaptation can be good, and Fantastic Four is good.Highly recommended!",9,2,6,12 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Standard Bearer of the Star Wars Universe
","The Empire Strikes Back, technically superior to Star Wars and dramatically superior to Return of the Jedi, still remains the best of the series. While not my favorite of the trilogy, I still am fascinated by the array of events that take place in this film.  It contains extreme contrasts, from the swampy Dagobah to the stark Cloud City, and gives the characters much more complex storylines.  Mark Hamill stands out once again as the intrepid Luke Skywalker, who finally gets a taste of the Dark Side while training with the legendary Yoda and with a botched confrontation with Darth Vader in Cloud City.  The rest of the group is trapped in space, without a working hyperdrive, and caught in the belly of a space slug.  ESB also offers a glimpse of Boba Fett, the enigmatic bounty hunter who had few lines, but unforgettable screen presence and a gigantic cult following ever since. The Special Edition of ESB is also a treat, with a enhanced and truly menacing Wampa on the icy Hoth, and great CGI effects on Bespin.  I highly recommend The Empire Strikes Back, but don't forget, this isn't a stand alone film. You have to see the entire series!  Hopefully, that won't be hard for any of us...",Null,0,0,17 May 1999
Gladiator," A Epic For A New Era...
","Gladiator is the eagerly anticipated film in the mold of such sword-and-sandal epics as Ben-Hur and Spartacus.  This time, the familiar tale of a slave who defies an empire takes a violently realistic turn, giving the audience an entirely dramatic and satisfying film.Featuring a magnificent portrayal of Legion General Maximus, our stalwart hero, by Russell Crowe, Gladiator also possesses an excellent supporting cast led by Joaquin Phoenix as the young, mad emperor Commodus, gorgeous Connie Nielsen as Commodus' sister and former love of Maximus, Lucilla, Djamon Hounsou as Juba, Maximus' staunch ally and friend, Rolf Mueller as the mighty Germanic warrior Hagen, the late, great Oliver Reed as fight promoter Proximo (his best role since Athos in Richard Lester's Musketeer films), and the immortal Richard Harris as the last great Roman emperor, Marcus Auerlius.Gladiator is quite a spectacle, and portrays the spectacle of the Colosseum and its satellite arenas in a violent and bloody fashion.  It portrays a decadent Rome crumbling in its foundation, and united only in its love of the gladiator.Highly recommended!",Null,0,0,8 May 2000
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," No Longer My Transformers...But...
","I adore the Transformers. For me, they rank third behind Superman (and the DC Comics Universe as a whole) and 'Star Wars.' There was something so intrinsically and viscerally cool about normal looking vehicles and contraptions that could turn into giant, sentient robots. I ate up the original Generation One toys and the three seasons of the Sunbow cartoon up with such relish, and pretty much believed that these characters and this story could never be fully realized in a live-action movie.Of course, I was wrong with 2007's 'Transformers,' a film I enjoyed then and thoroughly love now. It filled me with such nostalgic gladness, but I knew even then that, despite hearing Peter Cullen's baritone protruding from the metallic lips of an honest-to-God, real (well, CGI, anyway) Optimus Prime, that this was no longer my time or my era. Generation One was dead and gone, and something entirely different had replaced it. However, I felt that the spirit of 'The Transformers' remained and that was good enough for me.Then, came the train wreck that was 2009's 'Revenge of the Fallen.' Blame for this debacle comes in many forms, not the least director Michael Bay's rush to start production on the film in the oncoming wake of the Writers Guild strike. The film was sloppy, poorly edited, choppy, and at times, really offensive. Yet, there were good things about it, just not enough to make me want to see the movie more than once.'Dark of the Moon' corrects many of the mistakes of 'Fallen,' and expands and expounds upon the original film. It hearkens back somewhat to Generation One, but really does ring the death knell for that era of the franchise. This Optimus Prime, despite the same voice, is not the same Prime we all grew to love and look up to. This is a character that comes off as an actual general at war and a leader of a displaced race seeking refuge and peace. This Prime made the hard decisions to finally stop the Decepticon menace and fully embrace Earth as his home and mankind as his protectorate. That make me love this version of the character and look up to him even more than his G1 self.Now, 'Moon' is overlong, by about an hour. Excise the goofy, sophomoric, potty (literal) jokes, the stupid characters like Sam's parents, Agent Simmons -- hell, most of the human characters, then you have a nice, fast-paced, stream-lined action film. I never really cared for these people, at least not in the way I cared for the Transformers, particularly the Autobots, and what's oddest to me is that the newest additions to the cast of characters, like Carly, were the most intriguing and interesting.The entire Chicago battle sequence is breath-taking and shows Michael Bay at his gratuitous best. The guy knows how to film battle scenes and ILM's CGI work is seamless and realistic. Everything about this movie seems expensive, but in a good way.And what can I say about the original Galvatron, legend Leonard Nimoy, portraying good-guy-turned-villain Sentinel Prime? Well, it's good to hear Galvatron's voice one last time.I don't know what will happen next with the Transformers' live-action franchise, but I'm intrigued to see it continue on in the hands of another set of filmmakers and designers. I'd love to see the blocky, chunky Transformers of the G1 era return, and maybe even hear Frank Welker as Megatron at last...but I doubt it'll happen. Why? Simply because these just aren't my Transformers any more.And I'm okay with that.",8,2,7,5 July 2011
