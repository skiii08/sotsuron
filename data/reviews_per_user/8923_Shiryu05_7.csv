Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Complete
","Rubbish...Sacha Baron Cohen thinks it's a given that any and all of his appearances will result in brilliant comedic performances. What a complete waste of time, this film (if one can call it that) had less than 0.5 % true genius. The rest was just rude behaviour coupled with an insensitive boorish attitude, which can be funny if the person can actually pull it off. Picking on the Jewish nation, regardless of whether you're Jewish or not fuels other areas which really should be left alone...especially at a time like this when any badmouthing of the Jewish person/s will usually be 'graciously accorded' to have come from people of the Islamic faith.Ali G limited to sitcom time isn't bad, stick to that job Sacha, you really don't do well in this arena.",1,9,19,4 December 2006

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 180 degrees Turnabout...or as much as one can make considering
","Hmm well, what can i say that has already not been said ? With the vast amount of hi-tech gear out there today, there is always the ever present danger of making movies, especially those of the science fiction/fantasy genre, where the characters/scenery, basically the whole film do not mesh well together. Directors become lazy, there is no real emotion between those participating in the movie and the audience is left with a hollow empty feeling *rather those with sense enough to garner what is happening* of incompletion. I'm not particularly enamored of the fact that George Lucas created far superior looking equipment/environments/visuals for this second trilogy when the first trilogy is eons behind in the fancy technical gear. I do understand that IV, V and VI were made a while back but he should not have made such obvious enhancements, which niggle me to no end considering i know how Luke Skywalker's visuals appear to the eye. Would have been better to keep things somewhat simple, but instead the film seemed cluttered, with far too many CGI happening all over the place.Star Wars I and II were poorly done, saving graces were Ewan McGregor, Yoda and at a few moments of fleeting darkness - Hayden Christensen *didn't think he would be able to shake off the 'Higher Ground' aura that surrounded him for a while, but have revised my opinion considerably* Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker was a very interesting choice, and while Hayden looked as if he were somewhat blindly walking in the dark in episode II, there were glimpses of his potential to grow into the role of Darth Vader. One frequently saw glimpses of a very troubled young man *wonder what's troubling him in reality ?* who is constantly fighting against something that never seems to break its grip on him. In episode III I would say that he has matured and grown into his role, he again played perfectly the part of someone who is genuinely tormented by what seems to be an ongoing struggle in his head and conscience. He did good.Natalie Portman on the other hand is one of the most wooden actors I've ever seen, she has no charisma, no screen presence and maybe what can be termed 'robot emotions' the woman looks as if it would kill her to show some real emotion, why Lucas cast her as Padme is a mystery to me. I cannot think of another actress who would have fit the part but it would have been better to hire an unknown actor than cast Ms Portman who portrays her character in an unappealing manner. Hayden Christensen, in his scenes with her actually made me feel like shedding a few tears at a few scenes but take a look at Natalie Portman and one even forgets what emotions one is supposed to be feeling, she's completely lifeless. *George Lucas - Why again did you hire her ??* Ewan McGregor did well as Obi-Wan *loved the last exchanges between him and Skywalker in what looked to be a volcano* he could have been Alec Guinness himself, as well as the Sith Lord/Palpatine - excellent acting done by him which gives you a strange chill. Yoda as always is a fascinating fellow, who doesn't love him ? I've somehow grown strangely fond of R2-D2 and his never ending tweeting and chirping. Mace Windu, an expendable part. Samuel L Jackson, while a good actor, would not be missed if his part were not there.When one is so engrossed in the exchange between the characters on screen, and forgets which actor is playing what character, that to me is a sign of great acting.Inspite of all my 'harsh' comments, I really enjoyed the movie, I'm in love with Star Wars, always have, always will be and this was a great movie, especially considering how the first 2 turned out. Fits in nicely with the old trilogy. I think I cried when Darth Vader, towards the end of the film, asks if his wife is OK. Damn, there were some fantastic scenes in this movie *Ewan McGregor/Anakin Skywalker final exchange on that ashy slope*. George Lucas had incredible vision back in those days, he lost it *and what seemed to be the heart of his films* for a while but have almost redeemed himself. If only he didn't do this whole film in front of a blue screen....spoils the magic that he almost got back. Watching this movie is bittersweet considering we know how it ends. Now I definitely feel like crying...this was a very memorable and important part of my childhood and I will never forget it",8,3,6,4 June 2005
Arrival," Sci-Fi that requires you to look deeper.
","This movie actually requires you to pay attention so for all those expecting action, warfare and a G. I. Joe type scenario, watch it again from a different perspective. Arrival had 2 important messages for me and I hope others see the same after viewing it.1. Mankind is too quick to declare war on anything they feel threatens them WITHOUT making the effort to fully understand the situation. Look at our current leaders of the first world nations - the USA, China, Russia, the UK...all of them are full of s*#t, threatening and bullying those they deem lesser than themselves. There has never been a more USELESS organization than the United Nations (Palestine, Syria, Rwanda..the list goes on where these countries are at the mercy of the these so-called world leaders who couldn't give a flying f&#k!) which basically looks and acts like a front that has no substance and takes their orders from the very sources committing these atrocities. 2. While we don't officially have the tech to fly through time in either direction (by the time you read this review, opinion may have revised), the second theme is just as important as the first: learn from the past to prevent errors from happening in the present in order to protect our collective future!We don't have an infinite amount of time so we need to act, however this doesn't mean be an a$$hole and pillage/steal/threaten/destroy in order to come out top dog / ahead of the competition. If everyone works towards bettering themselves, alone, instead of uniting to better humanity, 99% of the world and her beauty is lost to us. Let's open our minds and hearts, understand both sides and try to make a better world for everyone.",8,2,9,4 February 2017
Wonder Woman," Wrong Actor...so so wrong
","I found it disturbing that Gadot was cast as the 'defender' of humankind when she not only served, but is proud of serving in the Israeli army (IDF). When Steve was describing the death of innocents, women and children while compelled by the lasso, it was a slap in the face considering that army (IDF) has no compunction about imprisoning and killing innocent men, women and children and a former army member is on screen, talking about her experiences. Her 'naive' persona, her outrage etc. falls flat for me considering I've seen footage of dying Palestinians that puts any previous war to shame.Patty Jenkins' decision to cast Gadot (under pressure from higher powers perhaps?) made me cry, as dumb as that sounds.I can look past the fact that Gadot is skinny as hell (versus WW having the physique of a bodybuilder - think Gal Yates) but the implication that this was the 'best' Hollywood could find boggles the mind.3 stars for the appearance by Chris Pine.",3,4,11,24 November 2019
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman not so wonderful
","The interview is not meant to throw shade on the director, who likely tried to do the best job with limited resources...well I tell myself that. I've been a fan of Wonder Woman since high school...that was 20 odd years ago. Let me start off by saying your main character should never have a bad rep in real life...especially when portraying someone that upholds truth and justice. That being said, while I love Gadot's accent, the actual woman puts me off in that her role in the IDF made her top consideration for this project...WAIT WHAT? Yeah, that's right. the IDF, the army that brutalizes the young, the old and the infirm in Palestine. Wonder Woman and the amazons are meant to protect mankind, yet we see their main fight against the Germans...back to Israel again and the injustices committed against the jewish nation. We never get a break from this story. We see you inserted an Israeli actress...playing the heroine. The movie was reminiscent of a 'what the evil germans did to us' pamphlet and how Israel rises above. Hollywood is run by Zionists, this is a prime example. It's a pity though, this movie could have really been something great had it a more believable heroine. 3 stars solely for Chris Pine's performance.",3,0,4,29 December 2017
Munich," An interesting movie
","2nd chapter, 1 minutes 43 seconds into movie 'it's not just a publicity stunt, let me remind you: ali hassan salam√©, he invented black September,' well now that goes a little too far...you point 1 finger, look how many are pointing back.Anyone familiar with special intelligence, covert agencies and those with eyes and ears in their heads should KNOW that when you want to force attention onto something or create/recreate bad blood between nations treading a delicate line, why not kill a few of your own just to prove a point ? Spielberg's researcher/screenwriter said he'd laid his hands on all the material he could find. I suppose everyone breathes a sigh of relief 'he read BOTH sides of the story' well no actually because if anyone cared to really uncover the truth behind the truth, you would find the world a very chilling place to be, where you would take the life of your own just to make the other seem the villain. Pathetic really since those responsible have to lie behind smoke screens and continuously remind the world of what has been done and is being done on a daily basis to them when they commit worse on their neighbours.Spielberg loses credibility when he pushes forth a distorted and rather shameful one sided opinion, but then again, he is what he is. Make up your own mind after reading all the facts about Munich, and never underestimate what the Mossad special intelligence can sacrifice without a blink of the eye.",5,1,6,29 March 2007
