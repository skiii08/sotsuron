The King's Speech," A Movie That Will Inspire You.
","Having learnt in History about King George VI suffering from stammering, and indeed, I myself, having suffered from the same speech impediment, I was very interested to know how Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II's, father dealt with this. I had also learnt about his elder brother – 'Edward and Mrs Simpson' and had also watched the TV series all those years ago, which starred Edward Fox.The movie, directed by Tom Hooper, begins by depicting the 1930's London and how a member of the Royal family approaches a man who can help her husband to overcome his problem. The scenes, showing authenticity, depict such scenes as a person walking in front of a car, which did take place in those early days of the motor industry so as to avoid accidents and really set the theme and the atmosphere. This then depicts the reason why the King's elder brother abdicates and the pressure that the younger brother, King George VI, faces.Colin Firth, as the King, portrays the King , in a manner that makes one believe that he really has the problem and delivers his dialogues in an a most believable manner and at the same time makes one feel that he really does have this problem.Helena Bonham Carter, as the Queen Mother, is also, excellent and executes her role in a way that shows her brilliance as actress. The two little girls, who portray the roles of Princess's Elizabeth and Margaret, also perform very well. Another actor, who really excels in his performance as the man who helps the King, 'Lionel Logue,' is Geoffrey Rush, who acts the character that makes one feel like believing in him, as a therapist. As a matter of fact, I remembered my therapist, putting me through almost the same exercises as he puts the King through them.This was one film that I found most inspiring and even though I have overcome that problem and when one thinks back to the problem it makes them feel inspired. Today, I, myself am involved in media and broadcasting and will say that 'this is one movie that is well worth watching.'",10,1,2,30 January 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Kids! Have You Ever Seen A Panda Do Kung Fu? No, This Is 'wicked.'
","This animated movie from Dreamworks has to be one of the best animation movies that I have ever seen.A sweet but lazy and a clumsy panda, named PO has dreams of fighting five legendary fighters - a tigress, a Viper, a Crane, a Monkey and a Mantis. But there's a problem and that is that these fighters are all trained in Kung Fu but the Panda isn't and he is working in his father's noodle restaurant, serving noodles to customers. But one day, it is announced that that there will be a selection process of choosing a 'Dragon Warrior' and as everyone in the town go to watch this, PO accidentally (nothing happens accidentally) enters this competition and at the same time, there's breaking news that the evil Tai Lang, a Snow Leopard, has escaped from a nearby jail.Directed by Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson, the voice overs are by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie and Lucy Liu and is written by Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger.The martial arts movement for this animation was actually put on after the sequences were performed by real artists. But what has really made this into a good and watchable movie is that the story takes place in ancient China and the character of PO is such that it just makes one laugh but deep down one is aware that he is also a sensitive character.Although the movie is for children, I must warn that there is violence but it is mild and, in some cases, very funny. Targeted at children, this movie is not just for them but for the whole family.",10,1,2,12 July 2008
The Jungle Book," Absolutely Worth it
","I first saw this movie as a child when it was first released in the cinemas and then read the book and then, again saw the movie when it was re - released in the 1990's.Bagheera, the panther,roaming in the jungles of India, hears a cry of a baby that has been abandoned and upon reaching the ares, he sees that it is a human baby - man cub. He calls upon all those living nearby, including some wolves to see what can be done to take care of the man cub. They all agree on looking after him but they fear that one day, Shere Khan, the tiger will find out and come after the man cub, whom they have named 'Mowgli.'. One day, they all get together, after being informed that Shere Khan is nearby and they decide to send Mowgli to the man village and Bagheera, the panther should take him back. Enroute, they bump into Baloo the bear and some monkeys, who try to kidnap Mowgli.Inspired by Rudyard, Kipling, who was born and lived in India during the British rule, from his novel 'Mowgli Story,' this is very well adopted for the screen by the master of animations, Walt Disney. And who can forget the song, 'The Bare Necessaities?' The Colonel Haathi and his elephants marching through the jungle and Mowgli meeting Baloo. This is one of the classic Walt Disney movies that cannot be forgotten ever. You can sit and watch this with your children at any time and enjoy it.",10,1,2,9 January 2008
A Bridge Too Far," An Excellent War Movie
","Until 1944, the war was still going Hitler's way but then came the D - Day landings and everything changed and end of the war was in sight. The question now was, 'How quickly can this be brought to an end?' After the liberation of Paris, the Allied movement in Europe slowed down and this began to give Hitler and his troops a bit of time to move back and put up a fight such as 'Battle of the Bulge.' It was at this time that Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery came up with the idea of capturing bridges - it was all a question of bridges - over the river Rhine in Holland. During the planning stages of this, the information that was coming in from the Dutch underground that several German Panzer Divisions had moved back into the area, was ignored. At the same time dropping of the Allied troops in and around Arnhem area, where most of the Panzers had moved back to, was a going 'A Bridge Too Far.' The movie directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, has a multi star cast: Dirk Bogarde, Sean Connery, Maxmillan Schell, Hardy Krugger, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, James Caan, Edward Fox and Gene Hackman. Based on the book by Cornelius Ryan and the real event itself, the movie depicts reality of war.'A Bridge Too Far' has been considered to be a military failure by many.As a matter of interest, Sir Richard Attenborough directed this movie when he was planning to direct his biggest movie, 'GANDHI.'",10,3,5,27 January 2007
Gandhi," Excellent
","'Bapu' as we all called him, was the father of the Indian Nation and his movement of 'satyagraha,' which he began after being thrown of a train in South Africa and challenge the authorities, has inspired many to try and follow his footsteps. The movie stars Ben Kingsley as 'the Mahatma,' Rohini Hattangady as 'Kastuba,' his wife, Roshan Seth as 'Nehru,' Saeed Jaffrey as 'Vallabbhai Patel,' John Mills as 'Lor Mountbatten - the last Viceroy' and Trevor Howard as 'Judge Broomfield.' Sir Richard Attenborough has done an excellent job with this movie, which is just over three hours in duration but during which one does not get bored as the acting by the actors is excellent, as is the direction, cinema photography, etc. It was this movie that enable the term 'East Meets West' to be used in music, provided by George Fenton and the Sitar maestro, Pandit Ravi Shankar with the tabla maestro, the late Ustad Allah Rakha. The script is well written by John Brilley, who went on to win an Oscar for the best script for this movie.As it is mentioned at the beginning of the movie that it is very hard to show all incidents of a man's life in such a short time. The movie is well made and worth while watching.",10,3,9,11 October 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," Top Class Movie
","I first saw this movie in the cinemas in the late 1960's and was very much glued to the screen and thoroughly enjoyed it.Based on the time that TE Lawrence spent in Arabia, the movie unusually begins with him getting on his motor bike and minutes later he has an accident is killed. Then comes the back flash and his time in Arabia during the desert conflict during the First World War.Filmed almost entirely in Jordan, the movie has some brilliant piece of cinema photography which can only be enjoyed in the cinemas to see the full effect, brilliant acting by Peter O' Toole - it was his first movie, as well as by all the others including Omar Sheriff and Alec Guiness. The music score by Maurice Jarre is well supportive to the movie and especially where the Arabic style is concerned as is the script by Robert Bolt. And finally, what can be mentioned about the director, the late David Lean except he is excellent.Conclusion: Nowadays we don't get to see such classic movies in a cinema. For the simple reason is that they don't make them anymore. Lawrence of Arabia is one movie that is worth to watch whether on a video or a DVD and if at all possible, make sure that you are sitting in front of a large screen,",10,2,6,6 November 2006
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," Couple Made In Heaven - Excellent! Worth Watching.
","I had no idea what this was all about as I hadn't watched many of the promos of this movie. But what I did know was who it starred and that it had a new actress and that it was filmed in Amritsar.A young woman who is fun loving, flamboyant, basically an extrovert, is about to marry a man she loves. However fate takes a turn and she marries a man who is sincere, realistic, government employee, hard working  basically an introvert. The problems are that he is much older than her and there's no love on behalf of the woman and he is unable to express his love for her.The movie stars Shahrukh Khan, Vinay Pathak, Anupam Kher, Kajol, Priyanka Chopra, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee, and Farida Jalal. But it does go on to introduce newcomer Anushka Sharma. This is directed by Aditya Chopra and co  produced by himself along with his father, Yash Chopra and Shahrukh Khan. The music is superbly given by Salim Suleman.What a way for the newcomer, Anushka Sharma to make an entry into the movies  introduced by Yashraj and acting in her first film as King Khan's heroine! Indeed she has made an impact with this movie and has gone on to prove that she is a good actress. She is able to use her facial expression brilliantly and her eyes are expressive as well. She has done a good job of her role in this, her, first movie. In time to come, this actress can give some of the other actresses of today a good challenge. One is able to see that she is determined and is capable of giving a good performance.With Shahrukh? Well what can one say except that it is unusual to see him the way he does in this film! His performance, as usual is beyond doubt, good and he manages it extremely well. He has also made Yashraj laugh after all the disastrous movies that have been released from them earlier. Not only that it has probably made the cinema owners smile as well due to the opening weekend being able to rake in the money that it has. He has once again proved why he is where he is and why he is called 'King Khan.' Its been a year since 'Om Shanti Om' was released and so it may be a good few months before we see another film with him. Let's mot forget 'My Name Is Khan,' with Karan Johar.Vinay Pathak is just excellent in the supporting role as the friend who supports all the way through and one who does not hesitate for one moment to tell his friend whether he is right or wrong.The settings is beyond any doubt well done and being set in the Punjab city of Amritsar, the Golden Temple being shown every now and then gives on the real atmosphere of the area and the music by Salim Suleman does suit this very well and not to mention the songs and the dances that come along in this semi musical genre movie. The songs are also worth listening to and especially 'Tuj Mein Rab Dikhta Hai,' by Roop Kumar Rathod and Shreya Ghoshal and 'Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte' by Sonu Nigam.Conclusion: Whoever thinks that this is a boring film, it isn't. This movie also shows what each partner has to do in order to try and make their marriage work and more so when one of them is much older. This is a movie that can be watched with your family and enjoy it.",10,5,11,15 December 2008
The Dark Knight," 'Do You Wanna Dance With The Devil?'
","'Do You wanna dance with the devil?' was a piece dialogue that has stuck in my mind ever since the first Batman movie was released in 1989, which starred Michael Keaton as 'Batman,' Jack Nicholson as 'The Joker,' Billy Dee Williams as 'Harvey Dent,' Michael Gough and Kim Basinger as 'Vicky Vale.' Today, Jack Nicholson's role is still remembered as it was then and since then there have been quite a few 'Batman' movies but none have really matched up to it until this one.Here, this is revived by Christian Bale as 'Batman,' one of the three who continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City, Aaron Eckhart as 'Harvey Dent,' another one of the three who also continues to eliminate crime, Sir Michael Caine as 'Alfred' Batman's butler and finally the late Heath Ledger as 'The Joker' who takes over organised crime and eventually wants to kill 'The Dark Knight.' The movie also stars Morgan Freeman.This movie, also known as 'Batman: The Dark Knight' has to be one of the best movies this year  at least for a good summer attraction. But be warned it does contain some violence and some spectacular stunts as well.Conclusion: This movie is one of the summer blockbusters this year and is worth watching if you like 'Batman.' Unfortunately one of the actors was not able to see this movie being released and that how well he has performed  the late Heath Ledger, who, I felt, suited the role very well and that it can be matched to Jack Nicholson. This movie definitely surpasses the hype that has been going on.",10,3,8,19 July 2008
Taken," Good Action and Thriller - Worth Watching.
","I just had an inkling as to what this would be about and nothing else. So going to watch this was a total surprise and more watching Holly Valance, who I had last seen in the Australian TV soap 'Neighbours' all those years back.A former spy, who is separated from his wife, allows his 17 year old daughter to go to Paris with her friend, believing that she is going to watch the group 'U2' performing in Europe. But soon finds out that she's been kidnapped.Starring Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen and Holly Valance, the movie is directed by Pierre More and is written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.Besides being a good action / thriller, this also deals with what has been on the increase over the last few years and that is women trafficking through Europe with organised gangs and also shows the internal sides of this with the use of drugs and how women are sold into prostitution. Off course there are other methods that the organised gangs have been known to use but this just shows how easy it is for them to trap women into this. This is what Pierre More has really highlighted extremely well and even goes on to show that this can happen in the most romantic city in the world, Paris. It makes one think that about these women, working they way they do, what many consider to be the oldest profession in the world, what is their original back ground and how they have managed to reach in cities such as the red light districts of Amsterdam and other major cities as well as being sold to wealthy individuals.There are some very good action sequences and some are breath taking as well, not to mention that use of sophisticated gadgets may make one remember a bit of James Bond.Filmed in France, this does contain topic of sexual and drugs related nature as well as violence in relation to that and many may find some scenes rather distressing. Therefore watch out for parental advice, or, the certificate rating. But never the less, this is a movie that does contain good action and is worth watching.",10,4,9,4 October 2008
The Happening," Not QuiteThe Sixth Sense But Still Good
","This movie was much talked about before its release and why not since it was by the same gentleman who brought 'The Sixth Sense' on to our screen. To some extent, this has lived up to its hype.People, walking through New York's Central Park, start to get confused - repeating their words, standing still and then shooting themselves and this is believed to be a terrorist attack. In the meantime, a science teacher, Elliot Moore, is called out of his classroom and is informed that due to the incident in Central Park, the school is closing down and so Elliot and his wife flee the town in a train with their friend and his young daughter, Jess, who starts crying for her mother. Here they are informed by other passengers that the attacks are not just in one place but several and is spreading in the North East area or the country only. The train then comes to a halt in a remote town and everyone on it is informed that this would be the last stop as they had lost communication with everyone else. However, at dinner that night they hear on the news that these suicides are not caused by terrorist attacks but is a natural phenomena.The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Lequizano and Ashley Sanchez. This is directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan.Though not so good as 'The Sixth Sense,' this movie is a gripping thriller which has involved some very good special effects. There are scenes of some gruesome nature involving blood and in some scenes, the director very cleverly leaves the imagination to the audience.Conclusion: A good thriller to watch but don't compare it to 'The Sixth Sense.",8,3,8,14 June 2008
Apollo 13," One of the most remembered incidents
","I remember listening to the news on the radio that the lives of the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 was in danger as there had been an explosion and that they were losing oxygen. Not understanding what this meant as I was ten year old child, I immediately put the question to my father and he explained it to me. I ran to the nearest window in the room and looked up to see if I could see it. Because I couldn't I presumed that something had happened and prayed that they returned safely. After that I never heard of Apollo 13 until the movie was released.In the days during the Aplllo missions, it was something exciting to hear about men being put on the moon. The movie portrays the excitement of the mission launch and not to mention the first landing on the moon by a human - Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.",8,4,8,20 August 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," A Good Film By Danny Boyle - Worth Watching.
","Not really knowing what this was all about except that it was filmed entirely in Mumbai, India and that it had a Bollywood Actor in it, I was totally surprised with it content.A Indian teenager, who lived in the slums in Mumbai (previously known as 'Bombay') and works in a call centre as a servant, goes on to the famous game show, 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,' known in Hindi as 'Kaun Banega Crorepati,' which was initially hosted by superstar Amitabh Bachchan when it started in India and then later by an equally superstar, Shahrukh Khan, in the hope of winning his girl, who he has known since his childhood days.The movie stars Dev Patel, Anil Kapoor, Freida Pinto, Irrfan Khan, Mahesh Manjrekar and Ayush Mahesh Khedkar. This is directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandon and the music score is by A.R. Rehman.Filmed entirely in India and mostly in its financial and entertainment capital, Mumbai, most of the scenes are filmed in the slums and this really brings out the reality of how lives in those slum areas as Boyle captures it as it really is. This also shows the reality of how children, from such areas are sucked into crime, begging and at a later stage of their lives, particularly females, into possibility of prostitution. Dev Patel is very convincing in his role as the teenager who comes from the slums but more than that it is his younger version, played by Ayush Mahesh Khedkar, who really makes it all look natural when it comes to acting a child who lives in the slum. He portrays what a child is like in that area and more so when it concerns big movie stars of 'Bollywood.' Freida Pinto, could have done a bit more in her role, but none the less, she has done a good job. Anil Kapoor as the host of the game show, made one feel rather uncomfortable when sitting opposite him in the chair as compared to the British host of the game, Chris Tarrant and of the Indian version of the game  Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan, who made the contestants feel at ease. Irrfan Khan, who has done some good 'Bollywood' movies, is good in this as well but it is Mahesh Manjrekar, in the role of 'Javed,' once upon a time a gangster in the slum, that is perfectly cast.Watch out for Amitabh Bachchan's hand in this movie.This is a movie that is definitely one of the best this year and is worth watching.",10,1,3,30 December 2008
Valkyrie," An Excellent, Historical, Factually, Intense, Correct, Drama - Just Excellent.
","Having studied the History of the Second World War in college as well as for a media project in depth details and having known that there were several plans to remove Adolf Hitler, the Fuehrer, I was very keen to see this one on the screen from the moment I had heard about it Colonel Von Stauffenberg, whose real name is Claus Philipp Maria Graf Von Stauffenberg, a officer in the German army during the Second World War and a Roman Catholic by religion, is a member of the German Resistance Movement, gets injured and loses an eye and two fingers in a Allied attack in North Africa as he is a member of the Afrika Corp, who are on the retreat as the Allied army moves forward. But when he gets better he goes to a clandestine meeting and meets three figures, one of who wants to become the German leader by getting rid of the Fuehrer.Starring Tom Cruise, Carice Van Houten, Kenneth Brannagh, David Bamber. Thomas Kretscmann and Tom Wilkinson, the movie is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander.Tom Cruise is natural in his role as Von Stauffenberg and he has shown the intensity in his acting in such role as has Kenneth Brannagh. The movie itself recreates the atmosphere of the time and goes on to give the audience the feeling that they are witnessing an event in history. But what makes it lean more towards to make this is that it shows the bombardment of the German capital, Berlin. Factually correct, this movie depicts the last plot that was hatched to remove Hitler, the Reich Fuehrer Heinrich Himmler, the propaganda minister Josef Goebbels and also Herman Goering, commander in chief of the Luftwaffe.This is a very intense drama that is really worth while watching and more so for those who are interested in the Second World War events.",10,7,11,10 January 2009
All the President's Men," A Brilliant Piece of Investigative Journalism Shown In This Movie
","The story regarding the mysterious 'Deep Throat' had been in the news ever since the Watergate scandal in 1972. Many had said a lot of things about the character, including the theory that this was the writer's imagination. But,I, myself, who first saw the film when it was released in 1976, before reading the book on which this is based, had said to a lot of my friends who were studying journalism with me that this character had existed and did not want to be revealed and hence the rumours. We were asked to read the book and understand it in the appropriate manner as well as learn and understand the techniques used by Bernstein and Woodward. We also had a debate whether the character existed or not. The rumours persisted until 2005 when it was finally revealed as to who 'Deep Throat' was  FBI's the then second men, W. Mark Felt, in a Vanity Fair Magazine.In the early hours of 17 June 1972, Washington Post reporter, Bob Woodward is woken up to be informed that there had been a burglary at the opulent Watergate building in down town Washington. Soon another reporter from the same company, Carl Bernstein joins in and the two gradually begin to uncover a scandal that would rock the whole Political system and may be also the first constitution of the United States of America and leads to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.Starring Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, Ned Beatty, Hal Holbrook and Jack Warden, the movie is based on the Pulitzer winning book by the same title by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and is directed by Alan J. Pakula.A movie that is definitely worthwhile watching and more so if one is aiming to become an investigative journalist. In many parts of the world, Journalists today make up some story or another so that they are able to assist the sales of the newspapers. But this is not the case here  this is real hard hitting investigative journalism at its best.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are very convincing as the two investigative journalists working for the Washington Post, Woodward and Bernstein.Conclusion: I, myself have done a bit of investigative journalism and I can say that this movie is worthwhile watching and something from which today's aspiring and potential investigative journalists can learn from.",10,3,4,24 August 2008
