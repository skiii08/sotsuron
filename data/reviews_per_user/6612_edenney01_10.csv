Blade Runner 2049," Not perfect, but a very worthy sequel
","A good sequel is a very rare thing in Hollywoood, and a good sequel made decades after the original movie is as rare as a four leaf clover, but this movie almost lives up to the original (heaven knows The Force Awakens sure didn't). It captures the mood, visuals, atmosphere, and score of the original perfectly, which is quite an achievement for a movie as extraordinary as the original Blade Runner was, particularly considering when it was filmed. That said, the characters in this movie are lacking the depth and emotional connectivity that you had for them in the first movie. In short, they're just not as compelling, and it's hard to get emotionally invested in any of them. I also think they didn't put enough effort into the story, compared with how much they put into trying to recapure the look and feel of the original. I gave it an 8, and I'd give the original a 9 (considering when it was flimed). I would VERY strongly recommend that everyone see the original before watching this. I can't see too many people really enjoying this movie if they didn't see and like the original.",8,1,4,31 December 2017
About Time," Worth watching, but it wasn't as good as I expected
","I'd probably have to give this 6 out of 10 (I downgraded it from a 7 after further consideration). Girls will probably like this somewhat more than men, but it's not entirely a chick flick. I really enjoyed Love Actually, and I love Rachel McAdams (what guy wouldn't), so coupled with the generally very good reviews I expected to really like this.The movie is certainly worth seeing and I'm sure some will like it more than others, but overall I just felt like it definitely didn't reach its potential, due in large part to a very poor soundtrack and musical score. I'm 43 and I like a very broad range of music, but I can only think of one song in the entire movie that I was even familiar ('Friday I'm In Love' by the Cure). Because it played early in the movie and it's a great song, and also because Love Actually had a great soundtrack, I was expecting a lot more. Everybody knows a good score and/or a good soundtrack can make or break a movie, and for me at least, this was just one of those movies where it largely broke it.I'm guessing I wasn't alone in being somewhat disappointed by the movie, since we were literally the ONLY two people in the theater for a 10:20PM showing in a medium sized Southern California town. That's a little bit late, but certainly not so late that the theater should've been 100% empty. I think I'd have to recommend this one for a Redbox rental when it comes out in 6 months rather than overpaying to see it at the theater.",6,2,8,27 November 2013
Romeo + Juliet," One of the worst movies ever
","I like most of Leo's work and Claire Danes is a halfway decent actress, but this movie is just complete garbage. Not sure who's bright idea it was to do this pseudo modern day interpretation of Romeo and Juliet, but it was a horrible idea, or at least a horrible implementation. 2 teenagers running around Southern California beaches in the late 1990's while reciting Romeo and Juliet in The King's English, just does NOT work. No surprise that it got decent treatment by movie critics, it has plenty of men singing and dancing around in drag in the party scene, which looked more like your typical San Francisco party than anything else. The movie critics just eat that up with a spoon, all the while calling it avant-garde. Do yourself a favor and just re-read the book, or watch the 1968 adaptation if you want to see a movie. Or if you're a Leo fan, you could always just re-watch James Cameron's adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, if you actually want to ENJOY a movie.",1,1,3,16 October 2012
Bad Teacher," So bad, my daughter and I walked out after 20-25 mins
","I can't write a complete review because for the first time in my life I actually got up and walked out of a movie, along with my adult daughter, because it was so bad. The movie was NOTHING like I expected based on the previews. I was expecting risqu√©, sexy and funny, and instead I got lewd, raunchy, and ANYTHING but funny. The couple slight chuckles I got in the first 20-25 minutes before we walked out, had nothing to do with the lewd, wildly misguided attempts at humor, but rather the subtle things like Cameron Diaz's character avoiding other teachers in the hall that are looking for a shoulder to cry on.I would liken the ATTEMPTS at humor in this movie to something like Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle... but unlike the mostly very funny White Castle movie, Bad Teacher misses the laugh mark by a MILE and then some. It's just simply NOT funny, and it was pretty awkward to watch with my OVER 17 daughter (you DEFINITELY don't want to take your teenage kids to see this). To sum it up, if you liked that disgusting Battle Sh*ts scene from White Castle, then Bad Teacher is YOUR movie, go see it. If you thought that scene was raunchy, lewd, disgusting, and NOT funny (unlike the rest of the movie), then AVOID Bad Teacher at all costs. Or just play it safe and avoid it period, you're not going to miss anything.",1,28,53,9 July 2011
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Wait for it to arrive on cable... at best
","When I heard a remake was being done of this movie and that Depp was going to star in it I was optimistic. The book was good and the original movie was entertaining as a child, though incredibly dated visually. When I saw the first preview that optimism vanished and I was very disappointed by what I saw. That was reinforced by both the critics' reviews as well as the public reviews after the movie was released.I opted to wait for it to arrive on DVD, and then only watched it when a friend loaned it to me, and I'm very happy that I didn't spend a penny on this. The movie was absolutely atrocious, and I can't for the life of me figure out how it has an average rating of 7.5 on IMDb. Every person I've ever talked to that has seen this movie did not like it. The movie is so bad that I really don't even know where to begin with a review! Suffice to say that I didn't even stick around to watch the ending, I called it quits about 3/4 of the way through the movie and I very rarely do that, especially if I'm watching a DVD.The movie, at least what I saw of it, was pretty much word for word and scene for scene, identical to the original. The cast of characters was also the same. The Oompa Loompas looked to me to be digital copies of a single Oompa Loompa, but I'm not positive.The biggest disappointment to me was Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. I really like him as an actor, and there are few movies he's put out that I haven't enjoyed, but I couldn't stand him in this movie. This is unfortunate because Willy Wonka is an interesting character that has a lot of potential for a good actor. I don't know how the character was written but Depp played it very effeminately, which seemed to me to just be weird, and not in a good way.I could go on and on about all the disappointments of this movie, but it really just seems like a waste of time. Whatever you do, no matter how much you liked the book, the original movie, or Jonny Depp, don't pay a cent to see this. If you must see it, wait until it comes out on cable or eventually network television.",2,3,6,24 June 2006
Friends with Benefits," Total waste of time, watch When Harry Met Sally again instead
","IMDb had a 6.7 rating for this movie which is usually represents a movie worthy of watching at least once, so I decided to give this a shot even though I don't care for JT or his acting at all. Huge mistake. The movie was raunchy and totally predictable, it wasn't the least bit funny, and there was no chemistry at all between the lead actors (due in part to the fact that JT doesn't talk or act like a heterosexual).Seriously, is this what passes for a romantic comedy nowadays?. I wanted to kick myself for wasting 2 hours watching this garbage, when I would've MUCH rather watched When Harry Met Sally for the 7th or 8th time. But hey, if you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall (garbage), or Good Luck Chuck (garbage except for Jessica Alba in itty bitty Penguin underwear ;)), then maybe this movie is for you. A word to the wise though, don't watch it with your children, regardless of age.",4,1,4,16 September 2011
Inception," Shutter Island meets The Matrix
","The title says it all, if you've seen both movies you'll have a good feeling for what to expect.I have a tendency to pick apart unrealistic details in movies, so I kind of liked the fact that the entire premise of the movie was unrealistic with today's technology. It forces you to accept the reality that with specialized equipment and training, a person could construct an entire dream world, and bring others into that world without their knowledge. I didn't have to waste any time or effort picking apart what was plausible or implausible, I could just enjoy the movie and go along for the ride, much like the Matrix.The ride itself is a wild one, and most of the movie is non-stop action and intrigue. The special effects are top notch of course, which is to be expected from a movie that is going to incorporate a heavy mix of CGI, blue screen, and wire work. The largely unknown cast does a worthy job, and DeCaprio does some of his finest work to date. Overall it's a fun, enjoyable movie, with a very unusual premise. Take a couple hours out from reality to watch it, you won't be disappointed!",9,0,4,6 December 2010
Arrival," One of the worst movies I've seen
","There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said in the myriad of other 1 and 2 star reviews. This movie is quite simply a complete and total waste of 2 hours. I'm an avid moviegoer, and I particularly like movies that exercise your brain as well as entertain, but this completely uninteresting, boring movie just puts you to sleep. I'd liken it to an extremely pretentious, ridiculously overpriced piece of abstract art in a gallery, to which everyone ascribes their own motivations to the artist, but in actuality was just a bunch of cockroaches walking through spilled paint and on to a canvas that was laying on the floor. If you want to watch a couple semi-visible squid-like finger puppets stand in fog for 2 hours while painting circular ink blots in the air, then ignore what I've said, this is the movie for you.Now as to the absurd IMDb rating, I'm convinced that IMDb ratings have recently started being greatly inflated by some overseas company that's paid by the studios to submit very high IMDb ratings through bogus accounts, much like those companies that advertise on TV that they'll create your company's Facebook page for you, then fill it with positive reviews. Obviously that's completely dishonest, but for the moment it's legal. I reached this conclusion after recently watching another highly overrated steaming pile of feces (Nocturnal Animals), ironically also starring Amy Adams, who I happen to like. In both cases, the average rating of people who wrote out a review was substantially lower and much more realistic than the IMDb rating. With Nocturnal Animals I was so shocked that the rating could be so high while noticing so many horrible reviews, that I went through all of the reviews (there were 163 at the time) and calculated the average rating. It was a very mediocre 6.3, which is a number you'd associate with a so-so movie that you may or may not like, whereas the IMDb rating for it was (at the time) 7.8, a number you'd associate with a very good movie that most people would enjoy watching. I haven't taken the time to calculate the average reviewer's rating for Arrival, it's simply not worth wasting even more of my life, but again, having looked through 3 or 4 pages of the most recent reviews, it's painfully obvious that the average reviewer's rating is WELL below the absolutely ridiculous IMDb rating of 8.3, and probably in the neighborhood of 5.5 to 6.5, much like Nocturnal Animals.",1,11,20,19 January 2017
Prometheus," This movie requires incredible suspension of disbelief
","The elements were largely here to produce a very nice prequel to the original 'Alien', and it would've made for a nice fresh spin on a very, VERY tired series of movies. Unfortunately this wasn't actually a prequel, and the elements I'm referring to have really confused a lot of people that have seen Alien and some of the sequels, but don't necessarily live and breathe the Alien movies. Personally I really liked the tie-ins to the original Alien movie. In fact those tie-ins, coupled with some beautiful cinematography and good CGI were the only things I really DID like about this.The characters were heavily underdeveloped, leaving viewers with no real attachment to any of them or anybody to really root for. There was VERY little suspense of the nature that made the original 'Alien' movie so successful. The script was disjointed and just seemed to be thrown together from bits of ideas, almost as if the editor was just handed all of the footage and told to edit it into a movie, without having ever read the script or even conversing with the Director.And finally, the most ridiculously irritating thing about the movie was the completely implausible actions by just about every single crew member on board the ship. I doubt that I need to rehash all of the specifics... I'm sure it's already been covered countless times in the hundreds and hundreds of reviews. Basically they all just acted like a bunch of stoned teenagers exploring some abandoned building or cave, with no respect for the fact that they were in one of the most inhospitable environments known to man and dealing with multiple unknown alien species.As an adult, it was incredibly difficult to watch this movie in the theater. Every 30 seconds I was thinking 'oh give me a break', or 'yeah right, as if anybody would be that stupid'. And we're talking about engineers, scientists, archaeologists, and highly trained crew members that went on a mission that was SO important to them that they were willing to leave their family and friends behind, knowing at the VERY least they wouldn't see them for several years, IF they ever made it back. It's not like these were idiots that just picked up the 'Help Wanted' sign in a store window and took a 9 to 5 job, but that's definitely the way they all acted.Perhaps teenagers and/or those with sub 50 IQ's might find this movie much more believable and enjoyable, but personally I found it very difficult to sit through. I would however say that for fans of the Alien movies it IS worth watching at least once...",5,1,1,1 October 2012
Her," Fell WAY short of expectations, and not appropriate for all agess
","Joaquin Phoenix unfortunately committed career suicide several years ago, and after 5 or so years of consuming mass quantities of alcohol and illegal substances, and giving Hollywood the middle finger, it looked like he was ready to make nice and put his acting talent back to good use. Although I've enjoyed most of his past movies, I really didn't miss him much while he was gone, particularly since he did it all to himself. Still, when I saw the previews for this movie and what it was about, it looked intriguing and I thought it had a good premise that would make for a cute, offbeat romantic comedy of sorts. I decided to see it with my 24yo daughter, which quickly became a little awkward for both of us when JP started visually fantasizing about having sex with a near full-term pregnant woman, and another chick that got off by being beaten with a dead cat during sex. Oh yeah, and let's not forget his operating system (voice by Scarlett Johannson) that pondered what @n@l sex would look like. There was also a lot of gratuitous use of explicit words and imagery that just totally didn't fit in at all with the theme of the movie, but that's the least of the issues I had with it. The list just goes on and on. Cute romantic comedy suitable for watching with the entire family??? Not so much!!! It just dumbfounds me that anybody would think those things belong in a movie such as this, or at least the way the previews/trailers projected the movie to be. It was all as out of place as it would've been in something like Sleepless In Seattle. I'm hardly a prude by any measure, but none of that stuff had any place in this movie, and some of it had no place in almost any other movie I can think of, except perhaps the documentary that Casey Affleck made when Joaquin Phoenix decided to quit acting ('I'm Still Here'). Having your 'friend' cr@p into your mouth while you're sleeping fits right in with some of the stuff that was in this movie. It really makes no sense, because the middle half of the movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be... a slightly zany, offbeat romantic comedy (though with very little comedy) about a guy that falls in love with his computer and his smart phone's operating system. Aside from the wildly inappropriate content earlier on in the movie, the ending was absolutely HORRIBLE. I won't give out any spoilers of course, but it was completely as if the writers just had NO IDEA of where to go with the story and how to wind it up!!! The ending was just totally nonsensical and empty! The sort of ending where you're watching a scene and you say to yourself 'Don't EVEN tell me this is the end of the movie?!?!'. My advice, DEFINITELY wait until it's out on DVD/Blu-Ray and spend $1 or $2 to rent it from Redbox or watch it on Netflix. I certainly wouldn't suggest anybody spend $20-$40+ to see it in theaters, and I definitely wouldn't recommend taking any children younger than mid teens to see it solely due to those few scenes. It's really too bad, because those scenes added NOTHING to the movie, weren't funny imho, and did nothing but take a movie that should've been appropriate for almost all ages, and make it completely inappropriate for children under 13-15.",6,18,36,2 February 2014
