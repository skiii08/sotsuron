The Blair Witch Project," The best horror film of the '90s, but not for everyone
","First off, this film is NOT for everyone. Do you feel like you need to see something to be scared of it? Do you have no imagination? Then don't even bother. Blair Witch is...I don't want to call it a 'thinking man's' horror film, as it doesn't raise any philosophical questions (though it will keep people talking for a while) but it is definitely more for people who have a strong imagination. No gore, no makeup, no boogie monster, and no shocks...just pure unadulterated terror.I won't even bother with the plot, since everyone already knows it. The 2 merits of the film is in the style: everything is very gritty, with no music and nothing that ever strikes one as fake. For example, take the scene where Heather opens up the bundle of sticks (don't worry, I won't reveal what's inside!). In a typical horror film, she would let out a long scream and you would hear 'dun dun dun' on the soundtrack. Here, it all seems so real you can't help but feel the same terror and helplessness as she.Secondly, the acting is amazing. This is Method acting taken to the extreme...nobody gets 'everyone I know is dead but I'm going to investigate that strange noise anyway' scared. No, they get 'I'm so terrified I can't even move or stop crying' scared. Like a real person. And they aren't your typical seemingly retarded teenagers who can't seem to walk into a room without tripping, either. You get to know them, and the first half of the film is even very funny, as you get to hear them chatting and quipping away, oblivious to what will happen. I can't wait to see these three in other roles!All in all, this is a must-see film for everyone, though not everyone will like it. Personally, I love it. I should also mention that it's MUCH scarier in retrospect than in the theater. The final scene STILL hasn't left my mind.",Null,0,1,1 November 1999
Fight Club," Amazing!
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I hate to say that about something that was just made mere months ago, because it makes me sound shallow, but it's true. Every single frame is just filled to the brim with such startling originality that it's like an ultra-violent, philosophical Being John Malkovich. Not very many films greet you with a man crying into another man's breasts.All I knew about the film was that it was about a club where men gather to beat each other into a bloody pulp as a way of perging themselves of that nasty taste work leaves in their mouths. That's just as well, as the less you know beforehand, the better. At first I was dissuaded by the opening credits, which are filled with completely gratuitous CG. This would make one think they were about to watch an 'MTV style' movie, which I despise...Armageddon and Natural Born Killers are like what Satan would make if given a camera. And then the movie starts, and again I wasn't very excited...another movie that starts at the end, and thinks it's clever. But then it REALLY starts, and I was immediately entranced by its world of social satire and its depiction of materialistic losers. I was a big fan of American Psycho, and I enjoyed these scenes in much the same way, especially the line about how the Narrator would rather look at the IKEA catalog than porn. Than he falls in with the Fight Club. That is all I'll tell you about the plot.Back to that style thing...I loved it. It seems like it could get gratuitous or overdirected at any minute, but it never quite crosses that boundary. It stays hyperactive enough to keep you interested, but subdued enough to let you enjoy what you're watching. Its 2 hours and 20 minutes seem to flash by in a second, until the ending. It's also VERY violent. The beatings are extremely brutal, especially the accompaniying sound effects, and there are two gun shot wounds so gruesome I'd love to know what they bribed the MPAA with to avoid an NC-17. I wasn't bothered by it, but I'm sure lots of people will be.And as for the ending, this is where the film faltered. There's a twist, yes, but that's not the problem. It's a good twist, like in American Psycho, where it actually adds to what's been seen before, rather than films like The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense, which just tack the endings on to encourage second viewings (they DO both deserve second viewings, but only because they're good movies). The problem is the scenes after the surprise is revealed. Up to this point we've been treated to a film that gives us something we've never seen before in scene after scene, and then it all gets wrapped up with...two normal fights? What happened? There are two battles here, one physical, one psychological, and they're far too normal to be here...they belong in a typical action movie. And come on, a bomb diffusion? With the 'which color wire' scene and everything? Puh-leeze. Save it for a Van-Damme flick. This was the only point where I started to get restless.There's a whole anarchistic philosophy behind the film, which I loved. I didn't buy into it or believe it, mind you, but I loved it...no matter if you believe in something or not, you have to give credit to someone who can think it up in the first place. The script is so jam-packed with great dialogue that this is a film that will be endlessly quotable, like Kevin Smith doing Nietzsche.Like I said, everything is filled with originality, right up to the final shot that has a subliminal frame of...well, you'll understand once you find out about Tyler's hobbies :) See it.

Akira," One of the greatest animated films ever made, but SEE IT SUBBED!
","I'm really getting sick of this film being tossed off by critics as 'visually impressive, but too confusing'. Or by people who haven't seen referring to it as 'that gory anime sci-fi movie'.  Nobody regards it as what it is: a modern masterpiece.The first time I saw it, I had never seen anime before. This was a new experience and I loved it. It was dubbed, and it was edited for television, yet I was still awestruck by the entire film. I watched it 2 or 3 more times in this incarnation, but I couldn't understand a thing that went on, and forgot about it. About a year later I saw it subbed, and it was like a whole new movie: there was much more emotional depth, and the translation was better so I immediately understood the whole movie! I can't believe how badly the dubbed version butchers the experience...not as bad as what we did to 'Nausicaa', but pretty close. In the dubbed version Kaneda sounds like a robot,  and the Colonel is permanently growling. In the subbed version the Colonel emerges as probably my favorite character in the movie: the only voice of reason in a city run by corrupt politicians. The scene in which he is ordered to relinquish command, but instead orders his men to kill the messenger because 'we're all going to die soon anyway' is very moving. I've now seen the film countless times in its subbed incarnation, and every time I am swept up in it, almost hynotized by the beautiful images before me.My one and only complaint is the beginning, with the gang war: it's just too...generic. I've lent the film to friends who didn't watch past the first part, because they thought it was too much like 'typical' anime, and I had to force them to watch the rest (of course they loved it). It just doesn't even hint at the beauty and epic sweep of the rest of the movie.The film is also remarkable from a filmmaking perpective, and I don't just mean the animation. The use of dissolves followed by quick cuts are very inventive and effective, as are the various perfect transitions. And best of all the music adds to the film on many different levels. Image and sound play off each other to the point where I couldn't imagine the film without it. The flashback scenes all have an extremely washed-out color palette, where everything is brighter, perfectly evoking a more innocent time. And the film is packed with indelible images. My personal favorite is in the aftermath of Tetsuo's first major attack, when it's at dusk and pieces of the SOL are raining down on earth, Tetsuo's body sihouetted against the sky.I will love this film forever, and though some people say it's a Blade Runner rip-off, I say Akira is better than Blade Runner in every way possible. Katushiro Otomo is one of the best and most innovative directors in the world, let alone animation directors. And he's not a one-movie fluke either...watch a fansub of Memories and be prepared to be wowed all over again. It may take a while, but one of these days people will wake up to Otomo's genious.",Null,1,3,19 April 2000
The Sixth Sense," Great, but not the greatest
","In my experience, there are two kinds of movie trailers: Trailers that take a bad movie and make it look good, and trailers that take a good movie and make it look bad. The Sixth Sense is of the latter category. I saw the trailers, thought it looked stupid - not just because of the presence of Bruce Willis, but just because it didn't look interesting. Then it started getting critical raves, and I figured 'what the hell, I'll give it a shot'. Boy am I glad I did.I only have one major major problem with the film: The ending. I have an uncanny ability to sniff out twist endings from a mile away ('The Usual Suspects' didn't fool me for a second) and this one's no different. Okay, I'll admit I had the ending spoiled for me ) but even if I hadn't, the 'subtle' clues are so blatantly obvious I'm surpised no one else got it...it seems to me like the first time you see Willis and Cole's mom sitting together (like 10 minutes into the film), it should be a simple matter of connecting the dots. And another thing: I wouldn't mind if the twist took up maybe one slightly enigmatic shot. But instead they have to spend like 5 minutes showing us flashbacks, sound bites, etc. etc... Frankly, I thought it was a bit of an insult to my intelligence. But the director (sorry I can't remember his last name) seems like a very smart guy, and I keep having images of him arguing with studio executives, telling him 'Oh, you have to add so and so, make it more obvious...' and he finally caves in and does it.But that doesn't matter, because the rest of the film is fantastic. It had a few really really scary parts (the sick girl comes to mind) but it wasn't 'terrifying' like everyone says. Blair Witch kept me up a lot more. But it's a very intelligent film, with a good script, creepy score, and kind of understated direction (which is a good thing). What really pulls it all together are the performances: Bruce Willis is genuinely good. He still tends to be a little monotonous, but he shows a lot more emotion and range than, say, Die Hard. Toni Collette was excellent as well. But little Haley Joel Osment...wow! I am truly in awe of his performance. I still think the Supporting Actor category should've been his by a long shot. It would be an amazing performance by an adult, but to come out of an 11-year old boy...wow! The scene towards the end of him and his mom in the car truly had me choking up. And the creepiest scene in the movie doesn't even involve ghosts: it's simply Haley Joel's monologue in the hospital bed about seeing dead people. The expression on his face, his barely-a-whisper delivery, the faintest hints of tears at the corners of his eyes...it sent shivers up my spine, and trailer clips simply do not do the scene justice.All in all a great movie. American Beauty was the only best picture nominee that actually deserved to be nominated in the first place. Cider House Rules? Come on...I could make a list of better movies from 1999, but I won't. One of the best of the year, but not in the top 5.",Null,0,0,29 March 2000
The Matrix," This has got to stop!
","The ridiculous worship of this movie has got to stop! I'm not saying it was 'bad', but it wasn't that good, either. Contrary to what everyone thinks, it's not even particularly original. The plot has been used many times before, in everything from The Truman Show, to the TV show The Prisoner, to Jacob's Ladder. The special effects, with the exception of the 'bullet time' sequences, have all been done before.There's nothing this movie can do that another movie can't do better. The kung-fu fights were pitiful when you compare them to Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. The acting - with the notable exception of Laurence Fishburne - is horrendous, especially Keanu Reeves (some of his lines had me laughing out loud). The script manages to weeve an interesting and entertaining storyline, but the dialogue itself was extremely clunky and boring...does anyone really talk like that? And most of all, the gun fights were nothing special. Practically the whole thing was in slow motion, making it about as exciting as watching paint dry. For real action, everyone should see a John Woo film, particularly Hard-Boiled. He uses slow-mo as well, but he does it in such a way that it actually adds to the scene, not detract from it. I'm sure the reason everyone thinks the movie is so fresh and new is because it's new to them. See some of the aforementioned films for true art.Finally, all of the other comments saying the film is a 'spiritual' or 'inspirational' film is laughable. It's an action film that doesn't really try for anything more. On the other hand, Terminator 2 manages to rise above its 'just an action movie' origins and become genuinely moving.All in all, it was an entertaining and fun film. But high art? No. The best Sci-Fi film ever? Of course not. (ever seen 2001?) The greatest movie of all time? God no! It's good, but it's nothing more than that.My score: 6/10",Null,0,0,7 March 2000
