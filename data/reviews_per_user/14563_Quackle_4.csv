Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not comparable to the originals
","I found this movie awful, I thought it dragged on and on, and, unless it's just me, I found it terribly hard to understand. Sorry, but I cannot compare this to the classical Star Wars episodes. 1/10",Null,1,2,22 February 2003
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The Odd Humour: Nothing Great.
","Unfortunately, 'Life of Brian' is not riddled with jokes that one understands. It tends to make fun of Romans rather a lot, so if you are a Latin teacher, I do not recommend this film. The only part which I'll always remember is the first part of the film when Jesus is making a speech.3/10, unfortunately.",Null,1,6,18 February 2003
Kickboxer," Nice takeoff of Karate Kid
","[Possible Spoilers] Great film, with the same concept as 'Karate Kid'. The heros brother gets disabled in a kickboxing fight with a legendary warrior, and of course, our hero must avenge this! I strongly recommend this film. 7/10",7,5,6,20 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of it all...
","I loved this film. Simple. I'm sure you will too. I watched this first in 1984 or so, the original version, and was amazed. It got me into Star Wars - and I'm still a fan of it today. It is obvious that this film had a lower budget than the sequels + prequels, but I found that this film has an atmosphere than none of the others have - Possibly as its a new world(s) you're part of.It has everything - From villains, to love scenes, to intense space battles which fill you with adrenalin. I recently purchased the 2004 DVD, and found it worthwhile. I strongly recommend giving this film a go - whatever version you go for, you're in for a treat.May the force be with you.",9,1,2,25 February 2005
