It," Scary and Enjoyable
","I enjoyed the novel and the original mini-series and of course this only covers the part of the novel and mini-series when the protagonists were kids. But as for me, there is no question that this version is superior (in fact vastly superior) to the mini- series. The locations were great (Port Hope is used for the downtown of the imaginary Derry while most of the film is shot elsewhere in Canada) and the cinematography top notch. The special effects were excellent and scary. Although I suspect most people who see this will have read the book or seen the previous mini-series, I won't spoil your pleasure by giving any of the plot. The acting was very good. All of the young actors were fine. A particular shout out to Jeremy Ray Tayor who plays the overweight kid and really nails the role and to Sophia Lillis who plays the only girl in the group of loser kids and is absolutely great. But all of the kids give excellent performances. I think those were the two hardest roles to pull off well which is why I note them. Bill Skarsgard is a convincing and terrifying clown and Stephen Bogeart as Sophia Lillis's father is almost as creepy. Nicholas Hamilton was convincing as the leader of the bullies to the point where I almost didn't recognize him from his role in Captain Fantastic. All in all some good scares, some excellent acting, a visual treat and I can't wait for part two when the kids are grown up.",8,5,11,8 September 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Maybe the Best Film of the Year
","This is a terrific film with great performances. There are twists along the way and although the ending may leave some people unsatisfied, I thought it was perfect. The feel of the movie was certainly one of depression and frustration, but at the same time it managed to show hope for the human spirit. No matter how bad things are and how awful someone may appear to be, there is always the chance that there is some redeeming quality and this film brings that out. Frances McDormand is nothing short of amazing. There is absolutely no way she can't win an Academy Award for Best Actress for this role if there is any justice at all out there. It is a great performance, one of the best any actress has ever given and despite the Academy's recent penchant for giving awards strictly based on political correctness (or simply nominating Meryl Streep for whatever drivel she's been in that year), they can't ignore it and not give her the award. And Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell both deserve serious award consideration for their performances. They too are great as are the rest of the stellar cast. A film that makes you think, makes you laugh, and makes you appreciate what you have.",10,4,11,28 November 2017
Baby Driver," Best Car Chase Scenes Ever
","This film brought me back to memories of some of the great car chase scenes from films like Bullitt, the French Connection and the Seven- Ups. Really awesome car scenes here and there are many of them, not just the one great scene we got in those films. And the score had some great songs in it to (really loved hearing Carla Thomas's B-A-B-Y). The performances were top notch with Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey having a lot of fun as bad guys (Jamie was particularly menacing) as did Jon Bernthal and Paul Williams in briefer roles. Ansel Elgort in the lead and Lily James as his romantic interest delivered solid performances. Eliza Gonzalez steals every scene she is in and we'll hopefully be seeing a lot more of her. The ending was the one part of the film that to me fell short and why I can't rate this even higher. But this is action packed exciting entertainment. The car scenes are worth the price of admission just by themselves.",8,12,21,3 July 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Solid Entertainment
","I wasn't really expecting that much out of this film as I rarely do out of films that are sequels in a long series. And for the most part the comedies that have been out lately have been very disappointing. But I was pleasantly surprised. The action scenes are good, the special effects are very impressive and there are plenty of good one liners that will bring a chuckle in the film. The film moves along at a quick pace and the cast were all very good. You expected Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush to be good since they always are and Johnny Depp has the Jack Sparrow character down to where he could probably play him in his sleep. Kevin McNally and Stephen Graham are also back and again provide solid laughs. Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are the new two young characters a la Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (who both appear in minor roles themselves that are basically just cameos). They are well cast for the roles and deliver what they were cast for (both are young, energetic and good looking). The plot isn't the movie's strong point, but is is good enough to move things along quickly and to allow you to enjoy the action, effects and comedy without getting in the way. All in all an enjoyable two hours.",8,6,17,27 May 2017
Midsommar," Ari Aster's Next Film After Hereditary Doesn't Disappoint
","I was looking forward to seeing this as I had seen Hereditary by Ari Aster and thought that was a truly frightening and incredibly good film. The previews for this one hadn't grabbed me as much as those for Hereditary, but since I was so impressed by that film, I eagerly awaited this one. As good as Hereditary was (and I thought it was the best horror film of the year), this film is even better. I don't want to go into too much plot detail since virtually anything except a brief overview might be viewed as a spoiler. So to be brief and not give anything away, the story concerns an American couple whose relationship is unraveling going on a trip to Sweden. They are joined by three friends of the man including one Swedish student friend of his who is essentially going to be their guide as he shows them the local culture of where he's from. The performances are all terrific. William Jackson Harper (the only actual American born and raised actor in the cast although Jack Reynor was born in Colorado before moving back to his mother's native Ireland at two) and Will Poulter are spot on as the friend who is maybe a little too driven by his research work and the friend who is just a total jerk respectively. Vilhelm Blomgren is amazing as the super laid back Swedish friend who is showing them his home. Two up and coming British actors, Archie Madekwe and Ellora Torchia have good turns as British students also visiting. There are many good performances by the Swedish cast playing the villagers. In particular, the veteran Swedish actress Gunnel Fred as a village leader and newcomer Isabelle Grill stand out. But the real revelations are the two leads Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. Florence was great in the comedy Fighting With My Family and in the mini series The Little Drummer Girl, but here she really delivers an award deserving performance. And Jack Reynor who I first saw in some interesting Irish films, but who Americans should be familiar with now after parts in movies like Detroit (alongside his cast mate in this film Will Poulter who was brilliant in that film) and of course in the series Strange Angel, gives a truly shattering performance. All in all this film moves ahead of The Wicker Man (the original) as the best horror film about a cult ever made. This will probably be one of the best films of the year and I doubt any horror film will come close to it. One of the best horror films ever made. Now I can't wait for Ari Aster's next film. What a major new talent he is!",10,2,6,7 July 2019
Wonder Woman," Great Entertainment
","This is one of the best movies of the year so far. The plot is interesting and the casting was great. Chris Pine was perfectly cast and Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright were both very good as the main Amazons. Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were terrific bad guys and David Thewlis is always great. And a special shout out to Lucy Davis who is marvelous providing some comic relief. But of course this is ultimately Gal Gadot's film and she was an impressive Wonder Woman. She's very tall and gorgeous of course so you knew that physically she would fit the bill well, but she really delivered in all of the scenes including the lighter moments. There is a lot of action including some really good scenes with the Amazons in the beginning of the film. The special effects were good, but not great (I did see the 3D version). I really loved the island of the Amazons set and would love to find a place like that to retire to. Even the vintage clothing in the film looked good. The movie moved quickly (especially the first hour and a half). All in all a very enjoyable time at the movies.",9,12,25,3 June 2017
Alien: Covenant," Terrific Entertainment But Predictable
","The movie was visually stunning and well acted. There was tons of action as expected and the two hours went by quickly. The movie is really attempting at its core to examine some very deep questions. The only downside is that from the minute David appears pretty much everyone in the theater knew exactly what was going to happen (and I mean exactly). So the 'twist' ending was not a surprise to anyone, it was exactly what people were expecting. But ultimately I can forgive that since it was great entertainment and am looking forward to the next movie in the series.",8,19,34,20 May 2017
