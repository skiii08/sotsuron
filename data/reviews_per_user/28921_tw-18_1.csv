Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A great conclusion to a rather confusing film
","I'm sure there was a mass of cinema-goers who, despite enjoying KB Vol. 2 on some level, do not consider the film to be a 'serious' one. Many have in fact silently labeled it a gratuitous, unrealistic, cheesy comic-book style 'beat-em-up' flick. Although I disagree, such opinions are completely understandable.Tarantino has really gone all-out with the gore and violence in this series and I must admit the constant bombardment of bright red splashes, surreal combat sequences and Magyver-style escapism is as distracting as it is shocking. I'm almost certain Tarantino has a legitimate reason for this wan-ton element, but I'm not sure what it is. I guess I'm not that perceptive...However the films are, in my opinion, powerful in their simplicity. And the action is very entertaining. Tarantino presents the film in a quasi comic-book way, which works very well with the juxtaposition of characters, scenes and sequences. The characters, despite their comic-book-like presentation, are actually believable and likable. A mother, a bride, a woman with a past she wants to forget, was betrayed in the most vile way and seeks vengeance against those who have wronged her - 'more serious' films that have tried to portray something similar to this powerful-yet-simple characterisation have often come across as cheesy and 'try-hard'. The film is not trying to dazzle with its gore and superhero-style fight scenes. To me (and I may be alone in this), the comic-book factor and surrealness of the world in which Kill Bill is set, desensitized and directed me to view the film, its simple plot and the characters in a less critical way... The acting is superb, despite a hint of melodrama. Harradine is fantastic. We as an audience can't help but join Beatrice on her quest, we understand her. We come to see she is not crazy or irrational - just merciless to those that showed her none.KB Vol. 2 follows the Bride as she moves down her list. Tarantino tones down the action slightly in this volume to give way to character development. Thurman, Harradine, Hannah and Marsden portray their characters well. The dialogue, however dramatic the actual words were, was presented naturally and believably. Harradine is especially superb. Hannah and Marsden are surprisingly effective together on screen.Tarantino uses black+white colour and polarised lighting to give emphasis to memory flashbacks. The audience is privy to plenty of background of the Brides history as a trained warrior, where we are cleverly shown some of her physical and character strengths... And weaknesses. We come to understand how she became what she is.The relationship and history between her and Bill is explored, but I found myself not fully understanding if it was completely genuine on Bill's part. He is a possessive man, and Tarantino allows ample time for Harradine to illustrate and develop his character.KB Vol 1 & 2 are both give to the audience what they take in with them. Less philosophically, if person sits in the cinema and rolls their eyes the epic, gory and comic-book elements of the film they are likely to be either too closed off or too distracted to notice the subtle and beautifully simple aspects of the film. Watch Uma's face closely, look away (with disregarding) from the centre-stage action and notice the body language, juxtaposition and voice of the characters - Tarantino has created a story that relates to every one - it takes the basic elements of revenge, comradeship, pain and possession and presents them in a raw form that most will recognise - even those without PhD's and those who do not 'dig art-house movies'.The conclusion to this film is satisfying, with Thurman giving it her all. I felt pumped, relieved and indeed, slightly sorry to say goodbye & good luck to the Bride when the film was over.",Null,0,1,14 August 2004
