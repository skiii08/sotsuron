The Blair Witch Project," All buildup, no movie
","'4010 comments????'  Wow!!  I've only read the first page, but they look mostly negative, to me; and I must agree.  I can't believe my man Roger Ebert gave this four stars!!  (Maybe he switched to a 10-star scale, like Imdb!!)I was actually beginning to get into the movie, sort of.  The actors seemed very real, they seemed really scared.  I didn't mind the low production value.  I was looking forward to the cast LEARNING something about what was going on, which would REALLY scare them.  Perhaps it's because I watched 'Curse of the Blair Witch' on the Sci-Fi channel first, which misled me to believe this was a movie about a witch!  All it was about was three people scared by something.So, anyhow, I'm sort of getting into it, can't wait to see what happens next, and BOOM!  It's over, credits are rolling, and everyone in the theater is kind of sitting there, like 'Okay, now what?'",4,0,2,2 September 1999
