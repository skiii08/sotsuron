Captain Phillips," Great eye opener.
","Starts off quite slow but builds really strong towards the end. Tom Hanks really does make you believe that he is in danger and might not make it out of that alive. This is definitely one of those movies where you are not really sure the main character will survive.With that said, the last twenty minutes of the movie are what earned him\the movie all the nominations and awards.But......the navy took way too long to show up, i mean i understand that its building suspense,but it just became more and more obvious that they were going to appear at the end of the movie and miraculously fix everything,which they did. Plus, we know nothing or feel nothing towards the captain's family,its genuinely only between the captain and the three pirates. And i really wanted to shoot one of those pirates,he was doing way too much.He did a great job at being annoying! All in all, definitely one of my favorite movies,makes you think out of the box,and i appreciate that about it.",8,0,3,21 October 2014
