The Mask," Iconic if only because it's funny
","Jim Carrey scored a home run with this film. I have to say, The Mask was one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies if only because he gets to bounce around the screen like a cartoon character. He was made for a role that's literally a cartoon. Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a foil to his alter ego in the mask, who is almost a character on his own. Not only does it show the regular character growth that comes in a movie like this, it presents more comedy than some 'comparable' works like 'Stranger Than Fiction' from Will Ferrell. Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) is the perfect 'unattainable' girl for Stanley: hot, almost oppressed, and may actually be looking for a nice guy - even if she doesn't realize it. Though that may be a little clich√©, it works because Stanley gets the girl in the end.I think the real shame was that they couldn't get Carrey for the sequel and that the Son of the Mask turned out to be such a flop.",10,1,2,20 June 2009
