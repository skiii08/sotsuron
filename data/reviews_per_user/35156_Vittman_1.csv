Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Put aside your expectations.
","After watching Episode I if you are feeling let down, think about why for a second. Did you try to write Episode I yourself, and then became disappointed that George Lucas wrote the story his way instead? Did you expect to see Darth Maul share half the screen time with the Jedi Knights? Well guess what, this isn't your movie, and there is a specific reason why Darth Mual has limited screen time. What is the purpose of Episode I? To establish the Sith, and to reveal how Anakin Skywalker, 1.becomes associated with the Jedi, and 2.meets the mother of his future children. So, what is Darth Maul's purpose in the film? He is there as the bad guy who 1. kills Qui-Gonn (we all knew he had to die sometime before Episode IV) and 2.reveals to the Jedi the existence of the Sith. He serves his purpose exactly. Qui-Gonn dies, and Yoda and Mace know that somewhere out there there is another Dark Lord of the Sith= Darth Sidios. The Phantom Menace refers to Darth Sidios. He is the Menace that is right before everyone's eyes, but yet isn't seen. And if you are confused by the plot as some are, again, think. The reason that the film revolves around the battle for Naboo, is because Darth Sidios creates the battle for Naboo. The question is why? Why? So that he can be elected as Supreme Chancellor after the removal of Valorum. This is the sole reason that Naboo is invaded, so that Senator Palpatine can be elected Supreme Chancellor after forcing the vote of no confidence on Valorum. Bottom line is the film is great, and anyone that criticizes the plot as confusing, or Lucas for not using Darth Maul more, just needs to THINK. This film comes before Episodes IV, V, VI. Certain things MUST be set up, and certain things MUST happen. If you don't try and write the movie on your own, ahead of time, then you won't be disappointed.",10,1,1,19 May 1999
