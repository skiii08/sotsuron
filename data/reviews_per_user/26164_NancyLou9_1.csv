The Benchwarmers," One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time!
","I can't figure out why everyone's being so hard on this movie. It isn't often I can go to a comedy at the theater and actually laugh out loud. However, when I saw this movie this weekend, I wasn't the only one who was laughing, and I mean often. There were times the audience was laughing so much I had trouble hearing the dialog.This is, simply put, a movie about three guys, almost over the hill, who decide to play some baseball against real Little League teams in the state. It's not about some grand scheme, it's not about the glory, it's about standing up for those who were always picked last in gym, always called names for not being athletic, it's about the little guy and standing up for the underdog.I have seen other critiques of this movie and people are complaining about the plot line, the dialog, you name it, there's something wrong with it. Don't go to the movie expecting to see any Oscar moments, they simply aren't there. If all you really want a good laugh though, go see this movie. Bill Romanowski plays a character who makes fun of his 'roid rage' while he played football. Jon Heder is 'almost' Napolean Dynamite, similar voice, but the character is funnier. David Spade has some issues in his personal life that really steal the show (Think Gir in Invader Zim).I don't want to say too much more about the movie because it would give away something hilarious. As far as being a waste of my money, I plan to go to a matin√©e this week so I can see it in a less crowded theater and hear the dialog I missed. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it several more times.At the end of the movie, the theater cut off the credits for some reason and the people in the audience fussed until they turned them back on. Not a single person left until the last line had rolled on the credits (also funny, stay and watch them).This is one hilarious movie and it's '...freakin' awesome!'",10,59,109,10 April 2006
