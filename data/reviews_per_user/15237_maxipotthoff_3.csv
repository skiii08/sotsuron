Lucky Number Slevin," Very good movie if you haven't been spoilered.
","Lucky Number Slevin is an all out great, interesting and exciting movie. It honestly had me guessing what would happen next. I came in to this movie without any preexisting knowledge about it so I was never sure if it was going to turn into a pure action piece or go the rout the movie took. One of the best movies I stumbled upon on my quest for good popcorn content.",8,1,1,20 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Mixed Bag
","This movie is indeed a mixed bag. The first half is all over the place. There is no real purpose, a confused tone, just over all a complete mess. But the second half feels like a Starwars from 35 years ago. It's charming, likeable and a complete nostalgia trip.
SPOILERS:
For me this change happened when Han Solo appeared as a memory for Kylo/Ben. It was a heartfull scene brilliantly acted by Harrison Ford and from there on I was completely on board. This movie absolutely dislikes TLJ and it shows. They listend to the fans, killed of stupid characters, left other ones with almost no screentime (rose) and again, like the force awakens, they worked like the return of the Jedi sorywise and I think that is good thing. I must admit a am completely biased as a true Starwars fan and the nostalgia completely resonated with me. Many of these good moments don't work if you don't know the older films (4,5,6) and so this movie can't stand alone. It is a safe bet that I really enjoyed and will be looking forward to it making a nice addition to my collection.",7,0,2,24 December 2019
The Terminal," The Pasta of Movies
","This film is by no means a masterpiece, but if you just want a good time, good music, good performances and a couple of laughs then this is for you. I recommend this movie if you don't quite feel in the mood for anything genre specific like a hard drama or a ridiculous comedy. Watch this with people that are not 'that much into movies' like your family for example. It's harmless, charming and just a fun experience but you won't be thinking about ist long after you watched it. It's good at being what it is, nothing special but it makes you happy in the moment that you consume it. It's pasta, not bland but not spicy either.",8,0,0,4 May 2020
