Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan
","The first thing to say is that 'Borat' is a compilation of partly hilarious comedy scenes, with a really talented leading actor. I really laughed as much as I rarely do in cinemas these days. It's not a subtle humour, it's a 'ha-ha-ha'-kind of humour. Some of my favourites: the social behaviour trainer, the feminist group, the car salesman, the rodeo ride; The victims of his jokes are the ethnic and social minorities, who have to fight hard against prejudices in every day life. There has been kind of a big controversy going on, when 'Borat' first hit the screens. The question is: Does Sacha Baron Cohen really uncover prejudices and moral double standards in the people he talks to, or is he only using and treating them the same way he seems to be criticizing, the treatment of the 'uncivilized' by the seemingly 'civilized and intelligent'? While I do not doubt Baron Cohen's principally good intentions, the way he is proceeding can certainly be discussed.",7,20,32,28 March 2007
Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Impossible III
","The third installment of the 'Mission: Impossible' series is the first one I have actually seen. What drew my attention to this film was the name on the director's chair: J.J. Abrams. He is the man behind TV series 'Lost', which creates enormous suspense, unseen on TV for a long time. What Abrams manages here is to give the movie a dark and uncompromising touch. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great in the scenes he's on, but he has too less screen time. Michelle Monaghan (or her role, this remains to be seen) is cute, but has no charisma at all (see: Katie Holmes, can that be a coincidence?) and Tom Cruise once again proves that he can't act (ok, I know that there've been some rare exceptions in the past). But being an action-flick, this doesn't really hurt the movie badly. Although 'Mission: Impossible III' loses a little bit in the last third, the overall result for this in the action movie summer 2006 is slightly positive.",6,0,0,14 November 2006
Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette
","Unlike many, many other people I liked this film. Sofia Coppola's follow-up to 'The Virgin Suicides' and 'Lost in Translation' bears her trademark again: The exact examination of human feelings through often tiny aspects of one's personality. Underlay this with great modern melancholy pop classics and you have a mixture of high class. The first half of this movie is so great again, I absolutely loved it. And although nothing really changes after the first half it drags on a little bit too long in the end. The film doesn't tell a big story, but nevertheless a great one. This is definitely a movie where the fault for the bad reviews (at least for the very bad) lies in wrong expectations. I've never liked Kirsten Dunst better in a movie, she was absolutely amazing. Sofia Coppola has a sixth sense for transforming feelings into on-screen pictures, this makes her one of my favourite directors. There are not many directors where a lesser film is as interesting, fresh and good as 'Marie Antoinette'. I can't wait for her next project.",7,2,3,19 August 2007
Se7en," Se7en
","The serial killer movie is one of the (if not the one) concise genres of the 1990s. David Fincher started his feature film career in the 90s with 'Alien 3', a good but not great sequel to the 'Alien'-series. But this film already revealed his sensitive instinct for threatening scenarios. With 'Se7en' he made one of the best thrillers of all time, an archetypal film for the word 'genre-defining'. So many films copied the style of it in the following years until now, that this style ultimately became nerve-racking for me in every new film. This is the one problem I felt while re-watching it. New audiences may not even be able to really understand what made this movie so great when it first came out. But its qualities are still visible today. The character of John Doe is a masterpiece of evil man-characterization. Kevin Spacey owns the screen his whole screen time, but I also like the characterizations of young hopeful cop and old cop, who has lost his faith in the good of life. As I said: One of the best thrillers of all time.",9,2,2,11 March 2007
Fight Club," Fight Club
","An excellent film. A lot of the credit for 'Fight Club' I think should go to the writer of the novel Chuck Palahniuk. What a great way to talk about our modern day society. The film looks like your typical Hollywood popcorn blockbuster flick and has therefore a real mass appeal. But below the surface of a very well made thriller there is a not too hard to find subtext (at least the headlines of the subtext are not too hard to find) about our capitalistic society that everyone should be able to catch. I'm not sure if Fincher's stylization made the best possible movie out of this novel, but it definitely found the best possible middle course between mass appeal and message. Edward Norton is to be watched in the role that turned him into a massive star. And as he is one of the finest actors of his generation, to watch him is just a joy. David Fincher favourite Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden and is as iconic as the amazing Helena Bonham Carter in her part as Marla Singer.",9,1,3,16 October 2007
Memento," Memento
","It's a rare experience these days, to watch a movie and have the feeling, that you just are seeing something new, something that hasn't already been there. This was at least the feeling that Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' gave me and in this case it's not so much the story that is new (although it is pretty great and fresh nevertheless) but the way how it is told. The reverse chronological order makes it a challenging experience. This is really a film that gives you much substance for discussion, because you might not really understand all about it. Whether or not full understanding is possible at all is a question I haven't answered for myself. Did his wife actually die? Was it himself who killed her? Who can he really trust? Some of these and more questions I was able to answer after some time, some I can't figure out till right now. But I will for sure try it again. Thank you, Christopher Nolan!",9,0,2,18 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' provides some entertainment at the moment you watch it, but that's it. It is just an utterly forgettable film, the day after you've seen it you might not even remember what it really was about. All that stays in mind are some of the images and effects, and we have very often seen in the past few years that this is too less for a film with 145 minutes. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is surely the reason, why this film works at least on the humorous level some times, but also the fun factor does by far not reach the heights of the fresh 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'. The actors all deliver respectable performances, but the script doesn't really give them anything more to reach for. Gore Verbinski seems a little bit like a leasing worker who can make good work ('The Ring', 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'), but only when he is given really good source material.",5,1,2,28 May 2007
Hostel," Hostel
","'Hostel' was a hotly debated movie when it came out. Examples of the past are: 'The Passion of the Christ' (without any point, boring) or 'Borat' (funny, but nothing really special). I had the privilege to see these films months after their original release and it allowed me to have lesser preconceptions. The same it was with 'Hostel' by Eli Roth. It is not a bad horror film. If you know the rules of the horror genre, there won't be too many surprises in this film, but it still is thrilling and shocking at times and this makes it worth seeing. If it comes to the violence, everything you heard is true. It's definitely one of the most brutal movies I have ever seen, but still not worth the stir that it caused. My point of criticism is that sometimes I was not sure if the depicted clichés and stupidities are just there for themselves or if the director actually wants to say more with that. That's not a problem for me, but it makes the film a bit trashy, less serious, and this again hurts the suspense.",6,1,1,19 August 2007
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 2
","Spider-Man has big troubles in this film. His major power has, like his uncle had predicted, led to ever greater responsibility for mankind. But as Spider-Man is not only Spider-Man but also the student Peter Parker, he has to study, he has to work to pay his long-overdue rent and he is troubled by the guilt for his dead uncle and by the secret love to Mary Jane. This emphasis on the personal troubles of Peter Parker getting along with being Spider-Man is one part of the secret why also the second film in the 'Spider-Man' series works very well again. The second part is Alfred Molina's villain, and for that matter also the partly really astonishing action scenes. The train fight of Doc Ock and Spidey is one of the great action scenes in the last years. And, surprisingly, also the overly soapy dramatization of Peter and Mary Jane's romance does no harm and comes over as being pretty charming.",8,2,2,23 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback Mountain
","What this movie comes down to is a love story, to be more specific, a story of love under difficult (almost impossible) circumstances. This kind of love stories have always been the most popular and we have often seen them. Despite being one of the best of them, Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' adds the situation of the lovers being gay, which is the trigger for (almost) all of their problems. Or, more exactly, the real problems are caused by the society, which doesn't accept homosexuality, and the main characters treatment of it. When Ennis (Heath Ledger) tells Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) the story of how two gay men living together were killed when he was a child and then shown to him and his brother as a deterrent, this was just a scene that I won't forget. Later in the movie this image comes up again and gives you a punch right into your stomach. Much critical praise came over 'Brokeback Mountain', I would say: Fully deserved.",9,18,20,18 November 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow
","The first third of the movie features some actually gripping scenes. The special effects are definitely astounding, the tornados or the big wave flooding New York. The problem with this film lies in the screenplay written by director Roland Emmerich and Jeffrey Nachmanoff. Nobody expects an exceptional character development in a catastrophe movie like this. That's due to the unofficial rules of blockbusters, where producers seem to be in agreement: The dumber, the better. But the characters here are written so one-dimensional, it's literally an attack on every thinking man's and woman's intelligence. After the imminent threat for the people in the library caused by the flood is passed away, absolutely harebrained situations are introduced to put the characters in danger (look e.g.: wolves, blood poisoning). Further clichés (or rather stupidities): oh so bad vice president, good president leaving the white house as last person, noble scientists, ; but as I said, the first third is at least pretty much fun (but please don't use this film for a discussion about climate problems, this would be an insult).",4,2,4,28 January 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
","There happens so much in this film, but at the same time there happens nothing worth remembering. That's due to the fact that the conflicts are coming and going almost like nothing happens. Nothing leaves any traces on our main characters, everything is manageable, nothing is or seems impossible. As a result no tension whatsoever builds up. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters. In fact, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' has the exact same problems than its predecessor 'Dead Man's Chest'. Effect, effects, effects, and a pinch of fun, that is all. The also not-so-great 'Spider-Man 3' had at least likable characters, for which you rooted to make it. But here I often asked myself: What is the goal of all this fighting and why should I care? Who are these people? To conclude, I will just repeat a line I wrote about 'Dead Man's Chest': It provides some entertainment at the moment you watch it, but that's it.",5,1,3,28 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3
","'Spider-Man 3' is a good film. Although there is a big gap between the heights its two predecessors reached and what 'Spider-Man 3' is able to accomplish, it still is one of the better products coming out of the big blockbuster factory in Hollywood. That's because Sam Raimi gave the 'Spider-Man'-series a heart, or better, he kept the heart of the comics. So many blockbuster-directors and producers today think a pseudo-cool look or language or story makes a good movie. So I give Sam Raimi credit for this, but I think this time he is also responsible for the weak spots of the film. Three villains are too much. Raimi gave up one of the main reasons why he had been so successful with this series: The villains had enough time to develop. Here only the conflict between Harry and Peter is working for the largest part. That's really a shame, because both, Venom and Sandman, had huge potential. In addition to that, also the Peter-Mary Jane relationship doesn't really work this time.",6,0,0,24 May 2007
Zodiac," Zodiac
","David Fincher is back in the serial killer genre. With 'Se7en' he delivered one of the masterpieces of thrillers. So the expectations for another serial killer film of him are almost unattainable. But Fincher is a smart boy and knows that and so he went into a completely different direction, which was about the cleverest thing he could do. In 'Zodiac' he plays with the expectations of the audience. He starts the film with multiple killings, but he didn't shoot these scenes the way you would see them in a thriller, he uses a very unexcited and more observing style. Often the film is called a thriller, but I don't really see where this is coming from. There are definitely frightening scenes (like the one in the house, where you hear footsteps above), but it is more a character drama, or as Fincher sometimes calls it in interviews, a press film. With 'Zodiac', Fincher proves that he is really a director who can do anything (well, we haven't seen a Fincher-comedy). Before I forget it, great actors: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo,",8,0,1,19 August 2007
The Prestige," The Prestige
","Christopher Nolan is really one of the most reliable directors working today. That's really something I appreciate very much and 'The Prestige' is yet one another great piece of cinema. I like movies that deal with obsession. A recent one was 'The Aviator' which I absolutely loved, but most people didn't. A thing that nearly all stories about main characters, who are obsessed with something share, is that their heroes are having the biggest troubles when it comes to interpersonal relations, and mainly in their love life. And that's a theme, which always gets me. The highlight of 'The Prestige' for me is Christian Bale. His character and the way he plays him, that's A-rate acting. I also liked the  nowadays omnipresent  Scarlett Johansson, who had an unthankful thin part. Nolan continues his confusing style of storytelling and keeps the tempo up. A great thriller, although the way the end resolution was unveiled felt awkwardly inappropriate to me.",8,0,1,16 February 2007
We Were Soldiers," We Were Soldiers
","There is no questioning of the Vietnam war in 'We Were Soldiers' whatsoever. It is one of the ground rules in telling a story: To understand one person's actions you have to get to know one's motives, one's aim. But if the film tells us that the soldiers were only fighting for each other and not so much for their country, so why didn't they stop fighting. This film is 100% pro-war and doesn't even know why. It also draws an interesting view on gender topics. All the women in the film are depicted firstly as loving wives to their brave husbands and secondly they are doing the classical household works. And if you are asking, also in their caring for the widows they are acting as loving wives to their brave husbands. It's unbelievably reactionary. They are not even trying to hold their men back from fighting in Vietnam, because they know what the United States are fighting for. It's good that they know, because after 130 minutes the viewer of this movie won't.",2,4,9,22 April 2007
Ocean's Twelve," Ocean's Twelve
","It's all about the stars in the 'Ocean's' movies. Above all, of course, there are George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. Everything is damn cool and easy, decisions are being made quick and nothing discountenances the Twelve. Clooney even stated in an interview that he makes movies like 'Ocean's Twelve' to coin money, so that he's able to finance his not so mass-appealing productions. The 'Ocean's' movies are there for the purpose of making money. Many critics blame them for this. But if you're honest they are very well made entertainment, that's their purpose and they achieve this with ease. Steven Soderbergh is the man who makes everything look that easy. He mixes different styles, shakes them and on screen the result is very chic. Of course, that's all very harmless, but why bother, as long as not all productions lose their edges, a few of them are fine. The thing that I really like about 'Ocean's Twelve' is Catherine Zeta-Jones and her character. That's the proof: The more women, the better.",7,1,2,16 October 2007
Knocked Up," Knocked Up
","It's been a long time since I've last seen a really good romantic comedy. When you look at Hollywood's mainstream output in this genre recently you will discover oscitant boredom. One part of the key to Judd Apatow's success with 'Knocked Up' is that it's rated R. Many rom-coms are just too harmless and children-friendly to find a way into the heart of the audience. Apatow also writes real characters, not only templates. This is obvious in the female main character Alison. She is elaborated very well, unusually well in a genre where the female lead often only has the task to look well. And the character is also acted very well by Katherine Heigl, who proves her movie qualities here. But also the male characters are very interesting, led by Seth Rogan's Ben. They are portrayed a bit hyperbolized, also for fun reasons, but the emotions are pretty real still. The result is a movie that's very funny with great characters, a good soundtrack and a few really true insights about relationships. That's pretty steep!",8,1,3,18 September 2007
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","This was Martin Scorsese's major breakthrough. For me it's interesting to look at this film, because I always thought, that his style changed a bit around mid-till-end-80ies. Recently I've seen lots of his newer movies, so now it was similar to seeing 'Taxi Driver' for the first time, because I almost had forgotten how absolutely unique it is. This might be the definite film about loneliness and isolation, in its style it is defining urban film-making. It's paradox that surrounded by an uncountable crowd of people, people can cut themselves off and fall into biggest isolation. Travis Bickle is a deeply disturbed man, but ironically in the end he becomes a hero, whereas he could easily have become a murderer of the next president. Paul Schrader's script is close to life and full of tension. Scorsese's direction is extremely vivid (as are the colours of New York in this film), and full of great stylistic ideas. Robert De Niro's acting is outstanding. Bernhard Herrmann's music is romantic and threatening. A perfect film.",10,0,1,11 April 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's Thirteen
","I really liked part one and two of the 'Ocean's'-series and part three is ultimately the same film again. What makes the 'Ocean's'-films worth their price is their entertainment quality, which they take out of the interacting between their massive stars. One critic maintained that these films bring back the old habit of making films, which the viewer is watching for the stars and not the film itself. I mean, he is right to some extent, but if you're honest, that has always been the case. Why do big budget movies almost always have to have big names? They attract many viewers. The only difference is the impudent frankness with which Steven Soderbergh operates in his series, but when it's done with the right amount of self-irony as in 'Ocean's Thirteen' it's only positive. What I remember is a funny, charming film with a great cast consisting of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Al Pacino. The minus point is, that it's a bit too male-dominated, but hey, I still like it very much.",7,0,2,19 August 2007
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket
","Here we have Stanley Kubrick's contribution to the big complex of Vietnam war movies. The war film genre has always been one that Kubrick was very interested in as his earlier work proves and even some of his unfinished projects dealt with it. The first quarter of an hour in 'Full Metal Jacket' consists of the infamous military training camp with the drill instructor, played by Lee Ermey. This first part of the movie is certainly responsible for 'Full Metal Jacket' being one of the really big entries in the war genre. Rarely (or never?) was dehumanization put to screen so merciless. The second part plays in Vietnam and it shortly falls behind the beginning. Still, this part is showing very effectively the result of the soldiers' training. In the end they aren't even able to learn from their actions, they're just 'glad to be alive.' A very fitting image for the whole war. As usual with Kubrick, the camera is always exactly where it has to be and delivers outstanding images.",9,0,1,11 April 2007
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump
","I think I've seen this film now about five or six times, the most of them when I was between 10 and 15, and now from a little distance it seems not illogical. 'Forrest Gump' definitely is a film very suited for children with much of its not too subtle humour and you can recognize that it is generally made for a large, large audience with all its political correctness and clean showing of sexuality (I mean you can't offend anyone, can't you?). The background sound is provided by a huge amount of popular classics of the time. It's also funny how the film connects different historical occasions and persons and weaves them into the overall story, what makes a big part of the films charm. This film has heart, that's why I still like it, although there are some negative qualities that are reaching surface more and more for me. The main thing is that it's just too overly soapy dramatized. And after multiple viewings also Tom Hanks' acting starts going really on my nerves.",7,3,7,5 May 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
","The first part of Peter Jackson's incredibly successful trilogy adapted by the books of J.R.R. Tolkien sets the standards for a modern day blockbuster. The reason why I prefer 'The Fellowship of the Rings' over the two following instalments (which are also great) is the way Frodo gets to be the carrier of the one ring. As a person who hadn't read the books prior to seeing the films, I could perfectly imagine how Frodo gets drawn into this world he had known nothing about. When the young hobbits encounter the Nazgûl, this are some really gripping scenes. But also the rest of the movie can stand up to this perfect start. For me 'The Lord of the Rings' has always been a movie about friendship and love between people and the changing effect it can have on the circumstances under which one has to live. That's impassioned rhetoric, but it's true, at least to some extent.",9,0,0,2 January 2007
Cast Away," Cast Away
","The 'Forrest Gump'-team tries another film together and it's not bad, what a surprise. In this first sentence I yet tried to include also the reason why it's not really good. This film takes no risk in nothing. I mean if you have Tom Hanks, you could at least take some risks in your story or in the way you shoot your movie or in the themes you choose to treat. You have Tom Hanks, people would still come and watch it. But instead, Zemeckis is satisfied with pure mediocrity, and delivers us a movie with a little bit of action, a dominating love story, a sad end, a whiny score, and Tom Hanks. To cut it short: A little bit for everybody. I hope Zemeckis is not surprised if someone accuses him of making boring movies some day. Boring through their volitional mediocrity. I repeat: It's not bad what we get here, some parts (the first 20 minutes on the island) were actually good, but who cares? You won the predicate: Film for the whole family.",6,0,1,6 November 2007
The Village," The Village
","This is M. Night Shyamalan at the height of his game. 'The Village' works on both important levels. Firstly, as a genre movie it is frightening. Shyamalan once again determines his reputation of being a master of suspense. But this time, unlike for example in 'Signs', the film also works as a character drama. A very well told story hides behind all the scares. And a study about superstition, (religious) fundamentalism and courage. This was one of the worst reviewed movies in Shyamalan's career. I can't see any other reason for this than wrong expectations. I get the impression that many people disliked the movie, because they 'knew' early that the monsters weren't real. But that's exactly my point, the film doesn't rely on the twist, because it's digging much deeper. Overall, I love the acting in this movie. But the standout in 'The Village' has to be Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Walker. I also love the music by John Newton Howard.",9,0,1,2 January 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine
","This film has an amazing beginning that in its style reminded me of 'Magnolia' or 'Boogie Nights'. There is high tempo and you get to know all the characters of the family, and all of this with really great scenes. So the first montage is immediately one of the highlights of this wonderful film. I've often heard critics saying 'Little Miss Sunshine' is predictable, and yes, they are right, it really is a little bit. But when it's done as charming as here, there is nothing to complain. The way Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton give space to each of the characters and come to the conclusion that with all its faults family still can be one of the best things on earth is feel-good cinema par excellence. The end sequence on the stage of the beauty contest just made me rejoice inwardly, with its childish spirit of kicking the rich one's ass. Not that I was a big fan of the genre, but if there ever was a film for the whole family, this is it.",9,0,2,19 August 2007
The Shining," The Shining
","Stanley Kubrick's only real attempt on making a horror movie, has turned out as one of the best horror films ever. While all the actors do a great job in this movie, the real main role here plays the Overlook hotel. I can't think of any other film, in which the location of the story makes a contribution this big to the atmosphere. The huge hallways and rooms and their extraordinary great interior equipment are frightening just for what they are, partly because of the emptiness and isolation suffered by the main characters. Undeniably great are, of course, also the steadicam shots of Danny in the maze and him riding through the corridors of the Overlook. The degree of technical perfection that Kubrick delivers with 'The Shining' is stunning. Further big contributions to the film's success are made by the haunting and effective music, as well as the source material by Stephen King, which was adapted and provided with some major changes by Kubrick and co-writer Diane Johnson.",10,0,0,14 November 2006
American Beauty," American Beauty
","If you want to have believable and with all their faults likable characters Alan Ball is the man to go to. Anyone who has seen this debut of screenwriter Ball should not be surprised about how great 'Six Feet Under' turned out to be. With this wonderful script, first-time director Sam Mendes brings us a movie that is extremely funny at times, while in the end it might bring some tears to your eyes. Kevin Spacey plays this midlife-crises troubled man so ironically but honestly at the same time, it's just great. But also the rest of the cast is awesome: Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, they all deliver outstanding performances. 'I don't think that there's anything worse than being ordinary', Mena Suvari's character says once. If there is one thing that 'American Beauty' is not, it's normal.",10,0,1,14 November 2006
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now
","From my point of view out of all the movies about Vietnam, and there is really a lot of them, this is the best. With its surrealistic approach, it goes a different way than the Vietnam films at that time did. A way that lets the viewer see the absurdity of war even clearer. A war like this can never produce anything good. Soldiers go (or have to go) to a foreign country, they see a culture, which they are not trying to understand, because they feel superior. That's what they have been told: 'We are the civilized modern humans, these are uncivilized savages.' The soldiers kill or get killed. And for what? That's what Marlon Brando's character General Kurtz means, when he says he's seen 'the horror'. 'Apocalypse Now' is the most philosophical influenced Vietnam war movie with elements from many different genres, the horror film among them. A few words to the Redux version: It's a little bit less dark, a little bit less horror, a lot more of politics. It makes not a better film, but a different one. But still excellent.",10,0,1,11 April 2007
Collateral," Collateral
","Michael Mann is what I would call an urban filmmaker. Here in 'Collateral' he shows us the nightly Los Angeles so often that I guess he loves this city, even if his crime and drama-filled films let me suspect that he has pretty ambiguous feelings towards it. With 'Collateral' it's the same as with the great 'Heat' and 'Miami Vice', this urban atmosphere of restlessness and very short moments of beauty once again dominates the movie. Here it is combined with a very thrilling story of a hit man, who has to kill five particular people in one night. It's a good film and very cool again, but it didn't work fully for me because of the two main characters. On the one hand we have Max, played by Jamie Foxx. I never really got to believe the emotions and the changes that this man is going through. On the other hand there is Vincent, played by Tom Cruise. Cruise isn't able to play the moments of violent eruption believable.",7,0,1,18 September 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
","A very fine movie from Andrew Dominik, who directed it and also adapted the screenplay from a novel by Ron Hansen. The train robbery sequence is built up in a very unexcited way and executed very well. After that the film concentrates on James' gang and how fast trust can knock over in distrust. Men get killed, friendship is not possible  there is just too much past in between them. Woman and children have to do the hard work, while their men are carrying out duels. And they also have to deal with it, when from one second to the other they lose their husbands or fathers. Also the end was very good, it added the right tone to a visually rich and thoroughly told story. The film is dominated by the performances of Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. While Pitt is really great as Jesse James, in comparison to Casey Affleck he has to pale. Affleck perfectly portrays this seemingly weak character with his conflicting behaviour.",8,0,2,6 November 2007
The Number 23," The Number 23
","I'm of the opinion that the genre 'mystery thriller' is not an easy one to handle for a director. A master of this genre in the not too distant past was M. Night Shyamalan, who showed that you either need a damn good story to make it work ('The Sixth Sense'), or you have to have the feeling for what buttons you have to push when and how ('Signs', 'The Village'). A mistake one can easily make, and here I'm coming to Joel Schumacher's 'The Number 23', is that you try to cover the lack of enough own ideas by shouting the ones that you have as loud as you can. But in almost all cases this doesn't help, because the audience will notice. So you need really good images to keep people interested. Some of the images in 'The Number 23' have a captivating quality, but most of them are just hackneyed in a 'We've seen that a 1000 times'-way. Sorry, but showing hundred different ways to get to a result of 23 doesn't make a movie exciting.",4,0,2,11 April 2007
The Lives of Others," Das Leben der Anderen
","'Das Leben der Anderen' by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is a very good examination of the life circumstances in the former DDR. I'm very impressed by the acting in this film, mostly by Ulrich Mühe. He plays this stoic guy, a seemingly strong believer in the DDR-socialist system. We see his apartment, which is sparsely furnished. An exemplary citizen, who is working hard to protect the state against its enemies. And yet, by supervising all these artists, he gets a glimpse, that there might be something else to life than what he had learned. It also makes the fundamental problem of surveillance subject of discussion: It doesn't work, because who supervises the supervisors? And it also discusses the arbitrariness of the state leaders and makes universally applicable statements. Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch share a very interesting dialogue about the compromises you have to make in a system like this. Everyone has to make decisions. Who are we to judge if we don't see the big picture?",8,0,1,27 February 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Good Night, and Good Luck.
","'Good Night, and Good Luck' is a good movie about the success story of how Edward R. Murrow, a TV journalist in the mid-50s, helps to uncover the lies spread by communist hunter Junior Senator Joseph McCarthy. A thing that bothered me while watching it was that McCarthy was characterized too one-dimensional as a bad guy for my taste. I think Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov made it a little bit too easy for themselves with this good-against-bad-story. Nonetheless, George Clooney's film is an engaging work about the duties journalism has and about the courage one needs. And as such, it is still valid today, in a time where all different kinds of media get more and more under the (financial) influence of companies or political groups again. A special mention deserves leading actor David Strathairn, who shows us a Murrow with such moral integrity, you would want to congratulate him personally. Furthermore, shooting in black and white was a very good choice for this atmospheric motion picture.",7,0,2,3 January 2007
Jerry Maguire," Jerry Maguire
","'Jerry Maguire' is a movie I can watch over and over again. It's one of my favourite movies. That's neither due to particularly outstanding cinematic qualities, nor to over-the-top acting (although Cuba Gooding Jr. really deserved his Oscar). Nevertheless it's one of my favourites. Credit goes to Cameron Crowe. I will compare it with 'Almost Famous', the other great film of him. I think from an 'objective' point of view, both films are equally good, but the story and characters of 'Jerry Maguire' are much closer to my heart. I really feel I can identify with them, and that is the difference. I absolutely get this character, like I don't get many. I understand his wish to do something important and right with your life, I know this problem with 'good at friendship, bad at intimate relationships', I share a positive view but also know that we live in a mostly cynical world. I also know what critics of the film say and in some way I do agree in many points they state, and maybe they are right. But I just love this film, I can't help.",9,10,15,28 May 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Pride & Prejudice
","I think everyone has the potential to need a certain amount of kitsch in life. Now I'm not a person, that is generally inclined towards these kinds of movies. It depends often on little nuances in the developing and treatment of a story. And when it's done right (like here for example, there is the right amount of irony throughout the movie), I like it. This kind of romanticizing would be wrong in stories that try to be realistic or those, which are at least trying to create a close-to-life feeling. But when a film never pretends to be anything else than a fantasy, a fairytale, this romanticism can work. And here it does. Keira Knightley is a gifted actress and absolutely lovable as Lizzy (a deserved Oscar-nomination for her), while the whole ensemble plays very well. The extensive use of dramatic music is also working extremely fine. I would be thrilled to see, if director Joe Wright would be able to make another good Jane Austen adaptation, because this one is a success.",8,1,3,27 February 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Reservoir Dogs
","'Reservoir Dogs' was the kick-off to Quentin Tarantino's so far fabulous career. It is a very energetic heist movie, that already uses the style of non-linear time structure. For example, a thing that I find very interesting about it is the scene where all the gangsters get to know each other and get their new name  this scene is set nearly at the end of the film. Really great here is also the dialogue, Tarantino's trademark. It starts with the discussion about 'Like a Virgin' and, my personal favourite, the discussion about giving tip. Endless discussions, all written really sharp, follow about who is the traitor. In those moments where no one is talking, more than once it gets violent, as in that classic scene where Michael Madsen cuts ear to 'Stuck in the Middle with You'. And there we have another Tarantino trademark, the soundtrack, that fits perfectly, like always. My problem with some of Tarantino's films, including this one, is that they are too cool, there is too few room for real characters with real emotions.",7,0,1,19 December 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma
","It's impossible to see this film, which arose so much controversy ever since it was released in 1975, without any kind of preconceptions. I only knew it was notorious for the violence and sex, but didn't know what kind of historical subtext and criticism of our modern day consumption society it includes. Now that I've seen it, I think it's a film of vital importance. I don't know if I have ever seen such a strong plea for a compassionate and social society, because the film shows us what the alternative is like. There is almost no element in this film, that isn't entirely dehumanized, empathy just doesn't exist. Even the weird end sentence from one of the guard boys, 'What's your girlfriends name?', can only be understood as a mocking of which we have seen the past 120 minutes. The only human emotions are the pain and humiliation felt by the victims or the brave acts of love some of the victims share secretly.",8,5,8,16 February 2007
Inside Man," Inside Man
","I guess it hasn't been easy for director Spike Lee to get 'Inside Man' as good as he did (with large contributions by screenwriter Russell Gewirtz). If you plan to make a movie about a bank robbery these days, you better bring up some really good ideas. But after all, there is still a bitter taste about a heist film, because it's so hackneyed. However, after the miracle that '25th Hour' is, I put my trust in Spike Lee and he didn't disappoint me. There is no big introduction, the movie gets going fast and it keeps going. It features lots of interesting twists and you constantly wonder what the hell is going on. You have an idea that the burglar mastermind (very good performance by Clive Owen) is cleverer than you can imagine, but it's just at the end you realized how perfectly planned everything was. Great acting is also contributed by Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer and the rest of the cast, while Plummer's Nazi storyline is really extraordinary.",8,2,3,5 December 2006
Three Colors: Blue," Trois couleurs: Bleu
","In the beginning there is a car accident (a popular scenario for filmmakers). Julie has lost her husband and her daughter. After that she wants to lose every connection to her old life, because she couldn't stand being reminded of her big loss. That's an understandable human reaction. We do not hear anything about why she is able to afford living without working, we know that she has enough money and that's it, because also for Julie money is not important. She has to find her way back into life. The film deals with love, loss and coincidence. If she had found out about her husband's girlfriend earlier, what would have been her reaction? Juliette Binoche is fabulous as Julie, she carries the whole movie with her believable performance. Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is superb, he lets us see the world the way Julie sees it. The camera often concentrates on small pieces to underline how she has to struggle with herself and isn't interested to think in bigger terms.",8,0,0,14 January 2007
The Departed," The Departed
","Martin Scorsese is out on the streets again, and once again, we get to see, that this is a place that he knows. 'The Departed', screenplay written by William Monahan, is Scorsese's best film since 1995's 'Casino'. It's primarily a great acted movie. Jack Nicholson plays his usual crazy guy ('She fell funny!'), Matt Damon is great as Nicholson's rat in the police and Mark Wahlberg's character Dignum is not exactly one of the pleasant kind. Special mention also for Vera Farmiga as the only woman, who has one of the most interesting parts in this male-dominated gangster film. But it's Leonardo DiCaprio who steals the show. His character is the best written in Monahan's script, we get to know things about his past and his motivation, so we can understand much better why he gets trapped inside this deadly game. He also is present in my favourite part of the movie, the scene where Martin Sheen dies. The tension that this scene is filled with and the surprising way it ends is extraordinary.",9,1,2,15 December 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
","I wouldn't say that 'Anchorman' is a very good film, it's more like a collection of funny and partly hilarious scenes, and in between those are also plenty of scenes, that didn't work for me. An advice for future comedy-makers: Just get Will Ferrell and Steve Carell and your film can't be a total flop. While Ferrell is great in everything he does, Carell literally steals every scene he is in here. Even when someone else was talking, I always looked at Brick. Just check the scene where he tries to 'flirt' with Veronica (Party! Pants!). One of the highlights was also the massive fight between all the different TV news teams (with a considerable number of guest stars). The problem is: Funny scene after funny scene after funny scene gets a little bit tiring after a while if there is no plot that keeps the whole thing together. And in this case, that plot is very thin. But this does almost no harm, because it's really damn funny.",7,0,1,24 February 2007
American Gangster," American Gangster
","Like a model student learns everything he is told to learn, 'American Gangster' has all the elements a good gangster film should have (if you go by the book). On the one hand the gangster, Frank Lucas, a man who revolutionized drug dealing in the early Seventies, played outstandingly by Denzel Washington. He is someone for the audience to identify with his charisma, but at the same time this inhuman part of him works repellent. On the other hand there is the cop, played also very well by Russell Crowe. He, too, is a character to sympathize with, mainly because of his high moral standards and his human flaws. On a very personal level, however, 'American Gangster' couldn't fully convince me. It's thrilling, dramatic and the material is very interesting, but I had the impression that it is done with a real fascination for the genre and not so much for the characters and the social network. All in all a good film with its share of minus points (amongst them Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character).",7,0,2,5 December 2007
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo
","East Asian cinema is famous for its big share of over-the-top emotion. Everything has to be extremely dramatized (Of course not everything, but if you look at the overall average, it applies). This kind of film-making brought us masterpieces, but it can also be too much sometimes, given that many moviegoers are rather inexperienced concerning Asian cinema. I was a little bit distracted by this in Je-gyu Kang's 'Taegukgi hwinalrimyeu', because it made this otherwise very realistic film a bit unrealistic. That's a general problem, that I think this story would have been better material for an opera. The characters are given clear qualities, there are enough conflicts between them to keep the viewer interested a running time of 143 minutes. The sequence of the film I remember the most is when the South Korean 'traitors' were mass executed. It just felt like another form of violence than in the rest of the movie. In the end, the whole film didn't capture me, because it was too loud when subtlety would have been more effective.",6,2,7,19 August 2007
The Good Shepherd," The Good Shepherd
","Robert De Niro's 'The Good Shepherd' is a long and detailed look at the men, who sacrifice their life for a life full of paranoia and without trust. The film doesn't give us an answer for their motives, it shows us Edward Wilson, a literature student, who somehow gets into espionage and becomes one of the CIA founders. You can see De Niro's fascination with this topic in every frame of the film, it is filled with so much love for the material, although, on the surface, people will see a very cold film about a cold man, unable to have a close relationship to his wife and son. For a long time I just couldn't get warm with Matt Damon, but in recent times I have become a fan. He really has been great in all of his recent films, but the one film, that would really be HIS film, had still to come. Until I saw 'The Good Shepherd'. There is rarely a scene without Matt Damon and he carries the film with his silent, nuanced performance.",9,1,2,24 February 2007
Platoon," Platoon
","The way how Oliver Stone describes the soldiers in his Oscar-winning Vietnam film 'Platoon' is similar to what we've already seen in 'Apocalypse Now' for example. He shows us a bunch of mainly poor people, a drug taking behaviour beyond the border of the acceptable and military leaders that are anything else than exemplary. But this film wants much more to be a vivid documentation of reality. Stone wants us to feel the deadly insects on our own skins, he wants us to feel the heat, he wants us to feel the fear, what it must be like to sit in the middle of an unknown jungle knowing that the enemy is going to attack any second. He wants all of this, so that the viewer can at least get a glimpse why the soldiers are carrying out this horrible massacre. He doesn't want to apologize it, but give us a psychological insight. Until the massacre the film is extraordinary good, after that I had a bit of a problem with the extreme black/white characterization of Elias and Barnes.",8,0,1,11 April 2007
The Queen," The Queen
","'The Queen' is at its heart a very conventional film. From time to time I felt like it had some kind of TV-movie-feeling. That's due to the structure of the film. The characters develop, the scenes between are sprinkled with nice jokes and much of the dialogue comes across pretty unnatural. But, of course, the dialogue in the scenes that I refer to has to be unnatural, because it actually is in real life. But it all strengthens the feeling I mentioned. What is absolutely not TV-like is the acting of Helen Mirren. The strongest sequences of the movie for me were mainly those where 'the Queen' was on screen alone, may it be her face in full scale, may it be her looking at the sea of flowers in front of the Palace, or may it be her trips out in the nature. And there is this absolutely stunning Diana-car-sequence, where sound, editing and images form something definitely memorable. Definitely not TV-like.",7,0,0,27 March 2007
Blade Runner," Blade Runner
","First I have to say the version I've seen is 'Blade Runner: The Final Cut', and I'm eager to see the other versions of this film. I can't think of a better way to start a movie than it's done here. While the credits are shown ominous music resounds and then you see the first images of 'Blade Runner': A sight of Los Angeles in the year 2019 that looks like something as close as it gets to hell. Furthermore this foreboding gets confirmed, this film shows a bleak place, where all humans live like robots and no joy seems to have space. Many films have a dark vision of the future for their topic, but on the visual side I think I've seen nothing better than this. It is a film made for the big screen. But also the story of the replicants is great because it's filled with so much subtle sadness. Do we have the right to create robots that are able to feel? There is more than a bit scepticism about progress in 'Blade Runner'.",9,0,1,6 November 2007
Casino Royale," Casino Royale
","Daniel Craig's first attempt as James Bond led to a very good action movie, much different from the last instalments of the series, in a better way. Craig is so great here, he doesn't only play the running, fighting and shooting convincingly, but also the more quiet scenes. And in those scenes lies the secret of why 'Casino Royale' turned out to be much better than its predecessors. James Bond isn't the killing machine with no doubts and second thoughts, he makes mistakes and has to pay the price for them and if someone dies because of him he feels guilty. The second amazing contribution to the movie's success is made by Eva Green, who has the thankful role of a Bondgirl that's unlike all the others until now. She and Craig in the train share the best scene in the movie, an amazing dialogue for which I only can congratulate the writers. Martin Campbell's direction is pleasantly unobtrusive, although the film is not without flaws.",8,0,1,1 December 2006
Signs," Signs
","I think I've rarely seen a movie that left me with an ambivalent feeling as strong as I had it after watching 'Signs'. It is another proof that M. Night Shyamalan is as talented in creating a threatening mood and lead the audience to nail-biting scenarios as rarely anyone else in the United States. The scenes in the cornfield are some of the best in recent suspense cinema history and could easily have been in one of the best movies in recent history. If there hadn't been this other part in this film, meaning the past of Mel Gibson's character as a priest, the death of his wife and the way he slowly finds back a way to believe in god. In a horror film it is advisable not to show the threat, so the viewer has many possibilities to envision it for himself. You have to keep the possibilities open. For creating suspense, Shyamalan is well aware of this principle. But when it comes to the faith storyline (and also the resolution), Shyamalan ignores the many possibilities and serves religious hardliners.",6,2,6,16 October 2007
The Deer Hunter," The Deer Hunter
","'The Deer Hunter' is a classic, its film artistry is stunning on the technical and the acting side. Screenwriter Deric Washburn knows how to create real characters and he knows how to introduce us to their inner life with tiny details. But still, the film doesn't really work for me. I appreciate the basic idea behind it. I think the decision to spend this big amount of time letting the audience get to know their characters is brilliant. So the first hour is the one that works masterly for me. But also the final hour, with the boys coming back from Vietnam (or not, as in Nick's case), is crafted well. So, what works in Michael Cimino's 'The Deer Hunter' is the character drama that shows us the consequences of this war for the individuals and as a result of that for the group. What doesn't work is the middle part in Vietnam. The Russian Roulette is terrifying but doesn't fit into this context. And to show the Vietcong as inhuman beasts with no human feelings makes it even worse.",7,0,2,11 April 2007
Casino," Casino
","One thing that I love about Martin Scorsese's movies is their more-dimensional portrayal of characters. I often have both, feelings of sympathy and feelings of revulsion towards the people in his movies. The same feeling occurs towards Las Vegas and its casinos in 'Casino'. On the one hand Scorsese glorifies the old casinos. When Ace laments in the end, that today Las Vegas is nothing more than a gambling Disneyland, we suffer with him. It's a place run by emotionless businessman. On the other hand, however, Scorsese knows about the victims that the old system claimed, about the abyss behind the shiny surface. The film is acted very well by the 'Goodfellas'-duo Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, while the biggest surprise for me was Sharon Stone. For me Ginger is a victim of this system, although some people might argue that she herself is responsible for the situation she's in. In the end, she is not the only victim and many other problems will be solved in the desert surrounding Las Vegas.",10,1,1,17 December 2006
Heat," Heat
","Michael Mann's thrillers are almost unmistakable. Even if the plots are different, you can feel it's a Michael Mann-movie by this strange mixture of melancholy, violent and urban atmosphere he creates. 'Heat' is definitely one of the best thrillers of the nineties. What's so special about it are the characters (like in nearly all of the big movies). The two men on opposite sides of the law, who fight against each other until one of them dies. It's inevitable. They don't really like what they are doing, but are doing what they have to, because that's what they are good at. When this seemingly vastly different men finally meet, it's an unforgettable moment. One of many in 'Heat'. I'm impressed with the way the two players are being shown failing to maintain the relationships with their wive/girlfriend. And when there's action, it's a blast. All of this brought to screen by gangster-film legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, with the direction and writing of Michael Mann. (Nearly) Perfect.",10,1,3,27 February 2007
Gangs of New York," Gangs of New York
","Many people don't like this movie but I think there is at least one thing that you just have to adore about it: That's the love and ambition the filmmakers, and especially Martin Scorsese, put into it. To be honest, I can't think of any other movie which wants to include so many different parts to a story as 'Gangs of New York'. But therein lies the dilemma: The things I love it for are also the reason why it fails. When it's great it's extraordinary great and that's almost always the case when Daniel Day-Lewis is on screen. There is an almost magical moment, when Day-Lewis is sitting by the bed of Leonardo DiCaprio with a flag around his chest. The following dialogue is frightening and touching at the same time. You forget about what an extremely brutal guy Bill is and only see this man who has found a son. But there are parts in the script that just don't work, as great as they would be on their own. Another thing is that some characters seem to stay unfinished (for example Cameron Diaz) so you can't really connect.",8,1,2,15 December 2006
True Romance," True Romance
","Here we have a movie that really had the chance to be great, and it even turned out great to some extent. First and foremost, the scene where Dennis Hopper explains Christopher Walken his cultural background. It is cited all the time, but that's just because it really is one of the best movie scenes of the Nineties, and definitely something among the best ever to flow out of Quentin Tarantino's pen. I think , Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in their roles and their relationship, their falling-in-love is set up very well by the script. I also totally dig this idea of really going through hell for love. And for that matter, I think the title is chosen very wisely, it's a 'True Romance'. But as the movie goes on and introduces new characters, it loses. Those police officers, Dick Richie, they were just patterns of characters, not real characters. And some of the action sequences looked a bit too smooth to be really exciting.",7,0,1,19 December 2007
Born on the Fourth of July," Born on the Fourth of July
","Oliver Stones second work on the war in Vietnam is a much more political film than its predecessor 'Platoon' was. Stone is often called one of the most critical filmmakers working today, and he is often put on the left side of the political spectrum, which is something that this film confirms pretty strongly. But one thing is not to be denied: With all his critical attitude, he still is a patriot, and his films are very patriotic in a wider sense. I think 'Born on the Fourth of July' is a good work, because it spends enough time establishing the characters, it helps us understand why young men are willing to risk their life in a war, for which they don't even know the reason. It's an accusation against a government who sends their citizens to a war, while telling lies about the true backgrounds (Once again history repeats itself in Iraq). In the end, I think, this movie became too much of a Hollywood success story, but nevertheless it is a very touching film with political and social commitment.",7,2,4,11 April 2007
