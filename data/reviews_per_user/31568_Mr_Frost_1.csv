Sucker Punch," Avoid this movie unless you're a fan of vapid, empty 'entertainment'!
","Just finished watching 'Sucker Punch' after the FOURTH time attempting to finish it! :-\ Aside from being one THE most atrociously, horrendously god-awful messes of a piece-of-poop movie I've ever seen (and trust me, I've seen a LOT of stinkers through the years!)the MAIN thing I could think during the ENTIRE movie was that the main girl character ('Baby Doll') NEEDED to be lobotomized AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE! Why? To PROTECT ALL OF US from her OBVIOUSLY homicidal, paranoid, self-destructive, utterly VIOLENT, and obviously PSYCHOTICALLY DELUSIONAL mind and behavior! :-\ (This judgment was verified as being correct at the end of the movie when Dr. Gorski actually told us what 'Baby Doll' had actually done/accomplished in the real world!) The other thought I CONTINUOUSLY kept having (which is why I had to keep turning it off and coming back to it another day FOUR TIMES) was 'What the HELL does ANY of this have to do with being in a mental institution????!'. I understand that the filmmaker wanted to show that 'Baby Doll' had built these alternate universes/realities to wall away the horrendous abuse that she had suffered at the hands of her father, but this movie would have INCREDIBLY GREATLY benefited from showing us some ACTUAL scenes from our objective reality from time to time (her sitting in a cell, going through therapy, ANYTHING)! But we didn't get any of that All we DID receive was CGI. o.0 All this accomplished was to serve to highlight her INCREDIBLE insanity and TOTALLY disconnect me, as a viewer, from the tissue-paper-thin plot and characterizations!This movie marks one of THE first times I have EVER found myself ACTIVELY rooting AGAINST the main protagonist! I THINK that the filmmakers WANTED us to (or at least hoped we would) sympathize with or, at minimum, empathize with the main character, but not only was she totally psychotic & delusional, what little of her character that WAS actually shared with us wasn't even particularly Likable! :( Similarly her comrades weren't the most likable characters EITHER! From the time the previews began airing on TV, I SO wanted to see this movie! And, to be honest, (contrary to how I may sound in this review) I REALLY WANTED to like this movie! However, at the end of the day, I simply could not. I'm not even entirely sure which demographic this movie might even begin to appeal to! (shrug) MAYBE to males who like T&A and lots of action But, I mean, come on, you can get that in your typical action movie and still get a plot and likable (at least bearable) characters in the process!",4,0,5,21 July 2011
