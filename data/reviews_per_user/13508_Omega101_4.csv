Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually Splendourous, Intellectually Torturous!
","This movie appeals visually, but the plot, story and dialogue can drive you crazy with its predictability and contrived cliches.  The fact that Lucas included the universally hated Jar Jar Binks, and stubbornly includes him in Episode 2 just sums up how nonsensical this movie is.I maintain that the most important thing in any movie/show is not how a show start, or how good the idea for the plot may be, but it is how a movie ends. I've seen so many movies that had a good idea, but the writer wasn't clever enough to come up with a rewarding ending - for example the Cantonese movie 'God of Cookery' was a total farce, as well as 'Independence Day' and 'Harry Potter'.  The Phantom Menace joins that hallowed list of unimaginative endings by having some kid defeat an entire army of thousands of robots by destroying one ship from the inside!  It seems not only has Lucas ripped off his own movie 'Star Wars' but he's also ripped off 'Independence Day'!! Why anyone would want to copy a movie with a contrived ending is beyond me, but it just shows that Lucas just doesn't know how to write a 'great' story.Like I said, visually splendourous, but the movie has too many terrible elements like the stupid Jar Jar Binks, and the dumb ending to be a good movie.  I give it a 3/10.  Let's get a real writer for Episode 2!",Null,0,1,5 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Exciting and dull at the same time
","I'll be brief, the movie is a hit and a miss.  The actions sequences are some of the best action I've ever seen on film, but the dialogue is frightfully dull.  The love scenes in particular could have been so much more, and perhaps the development could have been given to a more experienced writer.Anakin comes off as being too immature for a Senator, which could have been okay if we were given something to show why Amidala would have respected him.  It might have been improved perhaps if generally speaking Anakin showed immense maturity for his age, but you saw glimpses of his emotionalism.  Subtle hints would have fared much better than the obviously childish antics of Anakin.However there's no doubt that Star Wars fans will love the film.  There's been so much talk about this and that throughout the previous four films, and finally the fifth film does the walking!  Especially nice to see the king of talk: Yoda, finally earning the right to spout all that annoying rhetorical philosophy.I give it an 8 for enjoyment, an 8 for plot, a 7 for the acting and a 5.5 for the direction and script writing.  George has some great ideas - but sometimes I wished that someone else did the directing.",7,0,0,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Genius + Vision = Perfection
","Tolkien was and is a genius.  When you combine the work of his masterpiece, with the remarkable vision and dedication of Peter Jackson, you have such an awe-inspiring film that stands as probably the best film of all time.I've never seen a film that captured the true essence of the word 'epic' that was also full of rich emotional and moral depth that other movies like 'Titanic' and 'Gladiator' were sorely missing.The special effects are top-notch and are not gratuitous unlike special effects seen in 'visually-rich-but-poor-plot' films such as Star Wars. Every ounce of special effects carefully augments the story and brings out the full flavour of Tolkien's world.The acting is marvellous to behold.  One is totally convinced of the identity of the characters.  Each actor has artfully transformed into their character such as to surpass the imagination of the readers of the trilogy and utterly convince you that they *are* the character!Peter's creation is scary, exciting, dreamy, epic and rollicking good fun. What more can one ask?",10,0,0,27 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Dismal, Contrived, Ripoff and just plain dumb!
","terribly contrived and juvenile.  From the outset, it treats viewers like they were little children - the problem is, that most children won't realize how terrible it is because they haven't the breadth of experience to notice how contrived and unoriginal the plot is.I don't blame Columbus though, JK Rowling has created a cliched story full of unoriginality and character shallowness.  The fact that Harry Potter seems to be everybody's favourite and is virtually invincible in the film just makes you feel sick at how predictable this film is.And the ending - my gosh, what a terrible ending.  Star Wars was bad enough with their super proton topedoes that destroy whole mother ships (and stupid Darth Vader never learnt the lesson of having such weaknesses from his experience in The Phantom Menace).  But Harry Potter tops it with it's ridiculous ending whose sole explanation is a mother's love? Ludicrous!Go see a real movie, from the original genius of JRR Tolkien: The Lord of the Rings.",1,10,24,27 December 2001
