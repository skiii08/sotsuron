The New World," Quite slow and even partially boring.
","It's probably my fault that I watched this movie immediately after I've seen Apocalypto and had an immediate picture in my mind of how (good) this movie could have been. Compared to it, not even the costumes seemed realistic and rather actually rather 'dull'. The second mistake, was probably to expect a similar movie that is more focused onto the colonists and the colonization process itself. The movie even starts in that way and keeps the impression up for quite a while, but it ends up in being a slow love-story which centers only on Pocahontas for almost the entire second half of the movie. You really got to love long camera-shots focusing on her just walking around the set or staring at someone for minutes on end to actually begin liking the second half of the movie, not to talk about various long nature shots dubbed with the overly illustrious theme music of the movie for over 2 minutes. It had some good things about it though, especially the beginning made me wonder what it would have been like to have lived at a time like that, while having completely different things to worry about compared to today and with large parts of the world still unexplored and 'mystical' (Here be Dragons), in which you didn't have a Google Earth at the tip of your fingers to zoom in and see any island or part of the world you want from above or being able to fly there in a matter of hours.5/10 even though it's more likely only high 4 for me personally.",5,1,5,5 August 2007
The Love Guru," Just painful to watch...
","The jokes shoot and miss throughout the entire movie. It didn't make me laugh or grin even once and for the 2nd half I was occupied thinking 'When is it finally going to be over?'.Without the booty here and there and Jessica Alba as eye candy I probably would've even stopped watching it after a while (It's got a lot in common with Uwe Boll's latest disaster 'Postal', also is it just me or can you tell which comedy is going to suck by checking if they have 'midgets' on the cast just for cheap laughs?).It's too bad really, because with a decent script and a good director it could've been great, maybe not another 'Austin Powers' but something similar to 'The Guru of Sex' from 2002, which wasn't really all that bad and had some great moments.",2,0,6,4 October 2008
The Fountain," Great Cinematographic value but hard to watch.
","When I decided to watch this movie all I had seen about it was a short glimpse at the genre and the rating on IMDb. I thought I would be tuning in to another fantasy movie but boy was I wrong. The movie itself and the story were wonderfully weaved, but it depressed me over a certain degree a usually enjoyable movie should do in my opinion... I have a problem with just 'accepting' mortality as a given but that seemed to have been the movie's main point and throughout it I was torn between liking it as a piece of art, full of symbolism or hating it because of the overly dramatic value and forced ideas I do not really agree with and which also make me feel somewhat uncomfortable. In the end I ended up giving it a 8/10, because of the first but as a warning to anyone expecting to watch this movie as a pure piece of entertainment and without inciting any heavy thinking, just don't... It really is not that kind of a movie.",8,0,0,24 May 2007
300," An epic tale of heroism from the oldern times, retold with the technological possibilities of today.
","As the title says, the best way to describe this movie and everything it resembles is by saying it is a epic tale summarized and retold with todays technological possibilities.It is full of exaggeration, hyperbole and yes even close-mindedness... But it is told out of the viewpoint of the Spartans, it doesn't even try to be historical or politically correct and is also idealizing a lot of things, but it accomplishes every single one of those feats greatly. For me it transcended the feeling you get from reading old sagas (like Hercules or Odysseus), full of heroic people fighting and defeating monsters and demigods, the slow-motion and all those other effects all seem to serve as a means to making the movie seem more epic and it certainly succeeds at that.9 / 10",9,0,2,23 July 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," Overrated
","It wasn't a bad movie really in my opinion but it seems way overrated... Watched it, and after all the awards and praise I was hoping for something to blow my mind or at least be extremely entertaining, instead I got a solid 7. Compared with City of God (which is similar in many aspects) this can't really hold its ground. For one because the first was actually based on a true story and thus also written and filmed believable from the start up to the end and it was a movie depicting things as they really are (albeit maybe a little flashy) and focusing on the life story of one individual in the middle of it all, as opposed to Slumdog, which mainly focuses on the 'Who is Gonna Be A Millionaire'-show (seemingly to be more appealing to the western civilization and TV viewers) all around... No surprise with shows like 'American Idol' and 'Dancing With the Stars' leading the ratings in the US and in some cases International TV, while shows with brains get the axe by the minute. If you want to view it as a 'mirror' into Indian culture etc. I guess it was okay, but again it focused too much on the show and the respective answers. There are movies with a more... subtle approach that I liked more and imo succeeded better in doing that, e.g. Darjeeling Limited for example... Also there were some cringe worthy moments like the flashbacks near the end, how he couldn't answer some of the more simple general questions, but somehow 'circumstances' allowed him to answer questions in the show, and how winning just by coincidence saves ones entire life and is something to be admired, a few of those ruined it even more for me... An okay movie, but 8 Oscars and so much international acclaim? (While City of God didn't get one) I smell something fishy xD",7,2,4,12 April 2009
