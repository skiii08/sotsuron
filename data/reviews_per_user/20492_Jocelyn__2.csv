The Blair Witch Project," wow!
","this is without a doubt, one of the greatest movies.  i've NEVER seen anything like it in my life.  i think that if a big movie production company woulda made it, it wouldn't be as good as it was with its low budgeting. it wasn't as scary as i thought it would be, but it was really cool",Null,1,2,15 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," What a saucy Aussie
","I LOVED THIS MOVIE....absolutely without a doubt the best so far.  Of course, this is considering I haven't seen Austin Powers 2 yet.  But I did love this film and that HOT aussie.  However what's that 10 Things poem? That was so the best poem ever!",Null,0,1,27 April 1999
