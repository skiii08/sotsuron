The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," toying you emotionally.
","I don't know how to say it but... 'Mockingjay Part 1' is a bit disappointing for some reason. But it's because probably... I put too high expectation of this movie.BUT! It doesn't make me say that the movie is bad! NO. Although the battle scenes are less than the other two previous movies, this movie keep playing with our feelings, emotionally. Some parts of this movie make me tear up. I give them two thumbs-up for that.Katniss... I can see how miserable her life without Peeta and also... 'there's no more Distict 12'. Thanks to Gale who saved Kaniss's family.Lastly... I wish 'Mockingjat Part 2' will be more fantastic than Part 1. Just like Harry Potter... I hope Part 2 will be full of combat scenes. Hahaha.Oh. I forgot something. I love District 13! Live underground? Wow. The 'tight' system will always save them from Capitol's bombs. Amazing.",8,18,51,20 November 2014
Interstellar," Excellent Imagination
","The first thing I remembered after I watched this movie was 'Inception' (2010).Inception was the first movie that 'pressed' my brain so much. The wild and awesome imagination in that movie made me couldn't even say any bad thing about that movie.Just like 'Inception', this movie had something beyond human thought. The movie without boundary and seemed impossible, but still... there is a strong scientific basis in it. The movie like that would make us think... 'Oh God! It can be happened someday!'Awesome movie! Thanks to Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan. I love this movie so much!You must watch it, guys. :)",10,1,5,12 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Absolutely Brilliant
","Basically, I love movies that have 'based on true story' label in it.Now, about this movie. I'm totally amazed and surprised that there was a mathematician behind World War 2 and he was also the man who actually 'fight' Hitler in a different way.He's so smart. I even didn't understand what he was saying in the whole movie. *laughs*Well, about the fact that he's gay... it's not surprise me because there are a lot of famous people who actually gay during that period. The punishment that his country gave to him was too cruel (considering the fact that he was the one who made England won the war).You guys must watch this movie.",10,2,8,17 February 2015
