The Blair Witch Project," No-one seems to understand the concept of this movie!
","This is to all those people who complained it 'wasn't scary', 'we didn't see anything', 'what are they running away from?' All I can say is, you just didn't GET it! For all those Hitchcock fans out there, you will no doubt be familiar with the concept of suspense - that is what this movie is built on, and makes it scary. The whole point is, there is nothing more frightening than your own imagination. Whatever they are running away from, is anyone's guess, you the viewer can make 'it' as scary as you like. Why do you need to see anything, why do you need to see something that a writer/director/producer has made up? It scared the hell out of me, because I was afraid of what I was imagining.I agree with other reviews that say don't listen or read anything before you see the movie, as I sensibly did not. View with an open mind, this is not a conventional, gory horror flick but it has power and an eerieness that, if you allow it, will pull you in.",Null,0,0,14 December 1999
Bridget Jones's Diary," Laugh out loud funny! Miss it at your peril!
","I saw this film having read the books and the reviews. I therefore went to the movie with an open mind, prepared for cuts and considerable changes to the plot. But if you bear this in mind, as well as the fact that any book written in first person narration will be difficult to transfer to cinema, you won't be disappointed. There is no denying it. It is very, very funny!It is inevitable that this movie will be compared to 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Notting Hill' what with Hugh Grant being in front of the camera and Richard Curtis being behind, but it is nice to see Grant playing the villain for a change, instead of the floppy-haired sweetheart we've all grown to love. He was the perfect choice for the role of Daniel Cleaver and you can see why Bridget is attracted to him, because he is gorgeous!Colin Firth was equalling good, reprieving the many elements that he brought to the character of 'the other Mr Darcy' in the BBC version of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice'. He has a wonderful, quiet charisma about him in this role and I found myself with quite a crush on him by the end of the movie!I only have a few objections: Not enough scenes with Jude and Shazzer etc. and the direction was a little disjointed. Also, the elaborate fight scene between Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver (which was not in the book) could have been much shorter!Overall, as Bridget would say, V.G!!!",Null,0,0,17 April 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Fave movie, good characters
","This is undoubtedly one of my fave movies. I saw this and then read the book. Obviously there were differences, but I was surprised how, in general, the film had remained true to the original plot. I thought the love story with Mina & the Count was a beautiful touch and added to the overall gothic nature of the story. Also, I think in the book we never discover the origins of Renfield - he was never a lawyer as far as I could tell and was merely a cruelly, manipulated lunatic. The film giving origin to this character clarified his significance to the overall plot. Beautiful, dark and mysterious.",Null,1,1,19 October 1999
The Ugly Truth," When Pygmalion met Doris Day
","There's no denying it. 'The Ugly Truth' is yet another predictable rom-com where you can see the ending coming a mile off. But then it's films like this that you watch for the journey rather than the destination, and 'The Ugly Truth' differs somewhat from other rom-coms in that it's ruder and more sexual in nature.Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a successful T.V. producer for a morning show in Sacramento. Faced with falling ratings, her boss decides to pep things up by hiring outspoken Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), host of 'The Ugly Truth' a late night show where Mike shares tips and personal anecdotes in an attempt to dispel common 'myths' about relationships. Abby clashes with Mike immediately, seeing him as arrogant, outspoken, chauvinistic and the complete opposite of her idea of the ideal man that she believes she's found in her handsome neighbour Colin (Eric Winter). In turn, Mike thinks Abby is a control freak but his highly accurate insights into her personality further serve to infuriate Abby, and the two bicker constantly. Nevertheless, Mike is a ratings winner which leads Abby to reluctantly accept his advice about how to attract Colin. Mike begins to instruct Abby in what to wear, what to say and how to act around Colin. The plan works and Colin and Abby begin dating but Mike has developed feelings for Abby in the process and is jealous. Sure enough, against her better judgement and in spite of her relationship with Colin, Abby finds herself falling for Mike. Who should she choose? I really enjoyed this non-demanding film. Other reviews have mentioned Doris Day films, most likely for the'I can't stand him' becoming 'I can't resist him' plot, but in my opinion 'The Ugly Truth' owes more to 'Pygmalion' or 'My Fair Lady' with the creator falling in love with his creation. In this case, Mike 'creates' his ideal woman in Abby and falls for her. Katherine Heigl plays the same nice girl she plays in 'Knocked Up' and '27 Dresses' (but then hey, I like that nice girl and it works for her). Meanwhile, Gerard Butler simply sizzles as Mike, oozing with masculinity and charisma next to the good-looking but rather asexual Colin. You can totally understand that while Abby is attracted to Colin with her head (as he possesses all the qualities she thinks she wants in her ideal man), her heart and body are drawn to Mike. The two leads spar nicely throughout the film and the sexual tension between them continues to bubble before boiling over completely when the two share a sexy dance and afterwards a passionate kiss (two of the best scenes in the film during which you truly believe that these two people are crazy for each other). Plus, the ending was a bit of a departure from the usual rom-com â€“ while you normally see the couple walk off into the sunset together, you hardly ever get to see what they do once they get there if you know what I mean! Loved it.The other characters in the film were so-so and had little to do as this is very much Heigl and Butler's show, but the chemistry between the two leads was spot on and made the film for me.I'll definitely be getting this one on DVD.",8,2,7,25 August 2009
