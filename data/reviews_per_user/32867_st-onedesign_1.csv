Iron Man 3," An amazing experience.
","I had the pleasure of watching the film premiere last night and it blew me away. The film delivers in both storyline, and visual effects. From start to finish you are thrown in to lots of action, twists and turns. This film will not disappoint all you hardcore Marvel/iron man fans.There are some big twists, which really make this film that bit more exciting. For me the most impressive part of the movie were the visual effects, which you would expect from such a film as this. They really push the boat out with huge explosions, gun fights and all the usual extras. I do believe this will be one of the biggest films to date. Definitely worth an 8 out of 10.",8,118,227,19 April 2013
