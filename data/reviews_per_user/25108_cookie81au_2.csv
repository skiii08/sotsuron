The Blair Witch Project," Original, Creepy and Brilliant
","The movie 'Blair Witch Project' is a fantastic display of a box-office smash not needing to be a high budget action film or a soppy drama story. This film is a fantastic thrill ride for lovers of horror like myself.Although I have heard people argue that the acting was sloppy, the storyline was brief and choppy at best and the camera work was complete crap; but I say thats what makes the film so creepy and entertaining.The acting was obviously pretty bad but HELLO!, they weren't actually acting. It was intended to be a real life account of their search through the woods for the Witch, so when they found themselves lost and obviously not alone they started to panic; as anyone would in that situation. I myself thought it strange that they would continue to film even though things started to go wrong but the pieces of footage after the second or third night were done with Heather's camcorder on which she recorded a personal diary of the project, plus being committed to her work she probably wanted to capture every moment on film no matter how scared she was.Speaking of the camera work, i believe that it was what really made the film so scary with the scenes at night where the camera was pointing toward the ground so you couldn't actually see anything but you still could hear the sounds from the woods and its then that you get the same feeling that they have, you cant see what is going on you can only hear it, which is much more frightening.When I heard of the upcoming Blair Witch 2, I was disappointed that the makers had chosen to film it in the standard 3rd person perspective as all films are. Although they can't have another group of kids in the woods with their own camera again as it would simply be a redo of the original, I would have preferred if they leave it be and let the legacy that was created with the first live on instead of trying to commercialise it into a big budget film.As you can tell i speak highly of this film and believe that it was what the horror genre needed, a truly creepy film that can shock you every time it is watched.",Null,0,1,15 October 2000
Halloween," Getting out of control, But the first is still a legend
","What can we say about John Carpenter? From the beginning with 'Assault on Precinct 13' right through until 'Vampires', he has never failed to provide horror lovers with fantastic macabre stories and wonderful suspense-filled scenes.Although there are a few indiscretions ('Christine' and 'Halloween 3' spring to mind), he is regarded to be one of the greatest horror filmmakers of the 20th century (and into the 21st we can only hope), and why is this you say? Because of a low-budget shock film made in 20 days in 1978, HALLOWEEN.This film is what started the teenage horror films of the 80's and 90's rolling off the production line. From this film sprang some other classic film such as 'Friday the 13th', 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Scream' and so on and so forth. Although the other three I mentioned are among my personal favourites none match up to the thrill ride I discovered when I first saw Halloween. The creepy setting, the well thought out background story, the vulnerable teenage girls and the fearful Dr Loomis who believed all too much what Michael Myers was capable of; these factors set the stage for what would become a legendary film for several decades to come.People have said that the film has no merit and is a waste of time to watch as it has no blood or gore and the thrills are less than spectacular, but in the seventies this was the thrill that was required to kick start the horror genre which was taken over by the monster movies of the 40's and 50's and then the sci-fi alien movies of the 50's and 60's.As for the many sequels that have been spawned from the original, with the exception of part 2; I believe that they are getting out of hand like the Friday the 13th saga. I am the type of horror lover that can watch a movie over and over despite it being thought of as 'crap' and I do enjoy the Halloween sequels but I think that they should have left it alone with H2O instead of announcing that it wasn't actually Myers in that movie because it can't go on forever and if they are not careful people will start to forget Carpenter's original story. If John Carpenter decides to be a part of Halloween 8 perhaps the master himself believes that the story can be salvaged and it could turn out to be quite a good film. My one true wish is that no-one will attempt to make a remake of the original Halloween, because you can't redo something that is perfect as it is already. You can look toward the remake of Psycho for evidence of this.I will genuinely enjoy the new Halloween movie without a doubt but i hope that it will be the end for the originals sake.",9,0,0,15 October 2000
