Black Swan," Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!
","Darren Aronofsky completely blew me away with this fine piece of cinema. I thought that his previous work was very impressive. This movie, for me, just pushed him into another stratosphere of film making. The only thing about this movie that kinda bothers me is that it ends, depending on how you viewed 'The Wrestler,' the same way. That is only a very small detail though. Overall, I was left virtually speechless after leaving the big screen. If this doesn't win Best Picture and Natalie Portman doesn't win best Actress then I think they really misjudged it. Everything thing about this movie was beautiful. The camera angles were signature Aronofsky with little tweaking in actual technique. The mood is nothing that I wouldn't expect from an Aronofsky film, dark and disturbing with a hint of borderline, Horror elements to it. It's truly not a Ballet film for the faint of heart. I suggest watching this movie and simply, be amazed.",10,5,12,1 January 2011
Children of Men," A Call to Action
",This film affected me in a very profound way once I saw the first time. Now that I've seen it numerous times it very hard for me to look at this film and not get choked up while watching it. It truly is a work of art. The cinematography for this film is absolutely stunningly beautiful and captures the disgusting state of the world.For me the film is so politically charged that I don't even know where to start. It really is a call to action for the world to open it's eyes and look at the world that we are becoming and move towards a peaceful change. The film feels like it is a mixture of A Nous la Liberte and Blade Runner. It is probably the best contemporary film that I can think of that really does have deep meaning and will always hold a very special place to me. This film is a must see for anybody who is a fan of cinema at it's finest.,10,2,9,14 February 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," It Could Have Been One of the Greatest Movie Trilogies Ever
","Ladies and gentlemen I knew from the very end of this movie that I was on the fence about whether I liked the movie or not. It wasn't until I watched the movie on the small screen that I was able to sit down and watch the movie without the blaze of sound effects and the giant screen, to see what the movie actually was... a let down.I don't even really know where to start. I guess it will be with the story. The story was nothing all too groundbreaking. It has all the same stuff as Batman Begins and The Dark Knight but it seems to be a little lack luster. Bane isn't really the menacing character that he could have been. The major dubbing that was done with his voice made him sound over the top Shakespearean and I just couldn't take it. I never really was sold on Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle and was even less impressed with the terrible one liner (Cat got you're tongue?)from her and from every other character(So that's what that feels like?).I also want to add that the last hour of this movie is just complete crap. The way Bane gets taken out is lame, the bomb being carried off by the Batcopter into the ocean is lame, showing that this character that we had started to like was actually Robin was by far the LAMEST part that Christopher Nolan added. Especially since I thought he said there wasn't going to be a Robin in the movie.Overall, I felt that the movie wasn't made with the serious frame of mind as The Dark Knight was. The previous two movies in the trilogy were fantastic and while they have their great themes in it I think the 99% that was supposed to be represented in this movie really took a back burner to the complete lunacy of the whole movie. I've often had to compare it to The Avengers this year and I typically say this, ' The Avengers is a movie that knows it's not serious and doesn't try to be serious, The Dark Knight Rises was a movie that was supposed to be serious and came out comical. I'm fully prepared to take heat from the haters out there and I just want to say I couldn't care less. Enjoy the movie if you like but I hated this terrible movie.",1,3,9,31 December 2012
