Airlift," Charm To Eyes, Warmth To Heart & Invoking Patriotism in Blood, Airlift is a GEM which should not be missed...!!!
","What A Film! Recently Bollywood has produced some top notch films. This film is one of them. This is not to be missed at any cost. Not only acting, but screenplay, dialogues, scenes, action, drama... There is everything in this film. Everything is excellent.Akshay Kumar (Ranjit Katyal) is a businessman who only care is about his family and money. When the Iraq Army starts to invade Kuwait, he finds himself and his family in trouble. While getting his family into safety, he finds other people have no option but to look up to him. Now he has to save them all.Akshay Kumar as Ranjit Katyal has played flawless role. His wife (Nimrat Kaur) is supportive. Nimrat has a good acting skill. Purab Kohli is good with his supportive role in film. Kumud Mishra has a good government employee role and he has played it excellent. Others are good too.The film has a tight screenplay. We think this evacuation was simple as we read it in the papers or on wikipedia but the director has researched all about it and presented in a brilliant way. Each problems they faced was worst and worst and the director has shown it in a brilliant way. This is what makes the film so special.The reasons this film should not be missed is:1) The main reason is the history which (i am amazed) 60% of indians don't know (Especially the younger generation). These are the heroes of India.2) The efforts director made to show this history to Indian Cinema and the rest of the world.3) Brilliant Acting. Flawless Screenplay. Very Good War Scenes. On-The-Point Dialogues. And most of all... Patriotism! Jai Hind!",10,3,5,25 January 2016
