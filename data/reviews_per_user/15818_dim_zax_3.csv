Ford v Ferrari," Solid, enjoyable film
","Let's get the negatives quickly out of the way. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies in this one and some play major parts in the story. But it is quite impossible to cram 5 or more years of reality, into 150 minutes of film. So, it is a pass for me.What i really didn't like though, was the racing/action scenes. There wasn't any sense of speed in them. Instead there was a lot of camera trembling, sped-up shots and cgi. That was a real let down in a film that has a car as one of the main protagonists.On the other hand the actors were all brilliant. From the main man (Damon), to the bad guy (Lucas), to the daredevil (Bale) everyone added significant parts to plot and character development.The plot was going to be good because the real story had all the ingredients for a Hollywood movie. Danger, emotion and underdog status, along with the sad story of a man capable of greatness, but always on the out of the corporate new world.And last but not least, the cars were simply fantastic. The Cobras, Mustangs and GT40s from Ford, alongside the main opposition in the Ferrari 330 P3. Majestic!
Even if you know the story or don't, petrolhead or not, it is a very well made film that you have to see.",7,1,1,18 February 2020
Creed," 'Rocky: The final chapter', filled with emotions and memories...
","Try seeing this film as the last chapter of a biography. The last and biggest 'fight' of Rocky, whose companion is a young man, a young boxer for all of us, but an old friend for him. An old friend (Apollo) to whom he still owes and has to perform a final good deed in order to get even.To some, this film might seem predictable. And at times it might be, but it keeps doing well what it should do, by constantly stirring up emotions and building characters.Especially for the Rocky franchise fans, this film is the kind of a farewell that you would expect from the 'Italian Stallion'. A tough and fighting goodbye, ending on a high note through all the hard times, the same way as all of the films prior to this did.",9,0,0,19 October 2017
Rush," One of the best racing movies out there.
","Let me start by saying that this is an excellent movie, based on a true story. So, all the F1 fanatics out there, including me, should forgive various improprieties. Yes, there are a few of those, but the film as a whole, portrays in a vivid manner all that made F1 racing so great in the '70s.Some of the unrealistic facts that caught my eye: - Hesketh, as a Team, did not pull out from F1 at the end of 1975. James Hunt simply left them for a better team. - The driver that was killed during Watkins Glen GP 1975, is Francois Cevert and was not decapitated. - Nurburgring 1976. Lauda did not lose his helmet and no driver was hurt in the qualifying session, before the race. There are a few more, but Ron Howard managed to knit those events so nicely in the story, that you could pretty much believe that things happened that way!Another area that really impressed me, was the resemblance of the actors to the real people and the amount of work that went into Daniel Br√ºhl's make up, in order to make his scars look the same like Lauda's did, after the accident. It is really amazing!In conclusion, everyone can enjoy this film, no matter how much into F1 he/she is. But you have to remember one thing, this is not a documentary, it is a movie.",9,4,6,20 September 2013
