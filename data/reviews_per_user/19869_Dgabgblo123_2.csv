The Longest Yard," One of the better Adam Sandler movies of late
","I saw 'The Longest Yard' with my friend today and have to admit I did not have high expectations. However, after 15 minutes, I knew this was a different kind of Adam Sandler film. I have never seen the original, but have to guess that the story is the same. Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers who infamously threw a game. An alcoholic when the story begins, he is sent to jail after playing a reckless cat-and-mouse game with the police, using a stolen car. He is called upon by the warden (James Cromwell) to put together a football team, with the intention that they would lose, in an annual game against the guards. Sandler brings together an incredible group of misfits, which include several giants, Chris Rock as his assistant coach, and Burt Reynolds, who pretty much gives himself the job as coach (I read that Reynolds played Crewe in the original; it would've probably been more interesting if Reynolds' character would be Paul Crewe and Sandler's character would've been differently named). While in many ways a standard Hollywood movie, with plenty of Sandler-esquire product placement, it is by far his best movie since Punch-Drunk Love and his most entertaining since The Waterboy. Chris Rock also gives one of his better performances here. I think the film really excels, however, in its good execution. It is fast paced, well edited, with some good music in the background. Not an award-worthy movie of any means, it is, however, a fun way to spend two hours with plenty of entertainment to keep nearly anyone happy.",8,1,3,8 June 2005
Crash," Powerful ensemble piece
","Paul Haggis(the writer of 'Million Dollar Baby')makes his directorial debut with this powerful drama about an ensemble of characters who are connected through a car crash. The characters include a seedy cop (Matt Dillon), who has racial sentiments due to his father's company going bankrupt do to affirmative action programs; the attorney general of Los Angeles (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock) who get mugged by two black teens (Ludacris and), both of whom have different positions on the race issue; a detective (Don Cheadle) looking for his long-lost brother; a TV director (Larenz Tate),who represses his anger at the racism he sees; and a foreign businessman who must deal with a paranoid American society. Main flaw in the film are there are too many stories with too many characters, not all which fully develop, but Haggis makes each character memorable and interesting and provides situations that always ring true. People wanting to see this movie for Bullock or Fraser should stay away: Both appear in almost cameo-like roles.",9,1,10,10 May 2005
