"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Drag queens bopping their way through the Australian Outback
","For my buck, Priscilla Queen of the Desert was just going to be another gay movie.  There was a real trend in the mid nineties with films like The Birdcage, Too Wong Foo, Its my Party, and Love! Valor! Compassion! exploding onto the screen as America began to feel more at ease with its gay brothers and sisters.  And as we watched these movies, a whole `Gay Comic Genre' was really born.  Also we can't forget about the popularity of gay stand up at that same time.Priscilla did indeed avail itself of this trend, and every gay humor trick in the book.  It also managed to slip us some really amazing visual, comic and compassionate moments.  The relationship between Mitzi and his son is both intimidating and soulful.  As a gay man and a cross dressing performer, he was very unsure as to the receptivity of his son and really what sort of dad he could be.  Mitzi (Hugo Weaving) and his two buddies (Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp) head for the deep outback to perform at a holiday spa doing their drag routines. They buy a bus for the trip (from three Swedes named Lars, Lars and Lars), and they christen it `Priscilla Queen of the Desert'. 
The trip to the outback is fraught with delays, mean hearted blokes, and desert creatures (not to mention some very musical Aborigine).  They shtick their way to the club, dancing to Abba, and dressing divinely all at the same time.  This is a very funny movie and you will not be disappointed.",Null,1,2,25 February 2000
The 13th Warrior," Banderas best work, a look at Viking culture and battle
","This has to be Antonio Banderas's best work.  The contrast between the Muslim culture and the Viking culture is wonderful.  Banderas is constantly faced with the rowdy Viking attitude.  They spit and growl and drink and cuss and fight and kill.  Banderas plays an Arab who can't abide much of their behavior, but they grow on him and he becomes `little brother' to them.  Banderas starts to earn his Viking stripes by figuring out their language, then he shows what a brilliant horseman he is, and then ultimately (of course) he is a marvelous swordsman and a brave fighter. 
The Eaters of the Dead are even more repugnant to him than his funky brother Vikings, and so he fights them with gusto.  It is easy to fall in love with the Viking culture, they laugh constantly, and live fiercely.  It would not have been an easy life, but seeing the wolf capes and beautifully carved and crafted boats are just wonderful.  This movie is a visual delight.  It was just my cup of tea.",Null,0,0,18 March 2000
Being John Malkovich," Bizarre but witty look at the desperation of our times...
","The brilliance of this movie was its insight into human nature; the pain of this movie was its insight into human nature.  The basic concept of stepping out of our lives and into someone else's alone is just wonderful.  Women or men get to enjoy the feeling of experiencing an alternate sexuality, feeling thin if you are large, feeling important if you are dull.  The portal that takes people there is the key to the movie.  The film really also serves as an exploration of what we do as people surfing the web, interacting as whoever we want to be.  The fact that the author chose John Malkovich is also interesting.  A brilliant actor, but a surly and intense man, JM is not a pretty boy actor, not a vacuous Treat Williams type, but a character actor - one who will play a killer, a psycho or whatever challenging role comes along.  The reality is that even for the gristly Malkovich ordering towels over the phone is fun and games for some one looking through his eyes.  The sexual chemistry of having sex as someone else with someone else also gets a little weird and interesting.  It made the sexual partners straight, gay, there and yet voyeur all at once. The twists and turns are really endless.",Null,0,0,17 June 2000
Man on the Moon," Brilliant depiction of the often misunderstood comic genius Andy Kaufman
","Man on the Moon is the life story of Andy Kaufman.  There is no question that Kaufman was brilliant, and that when he chose to do so, he could charm and mystify his audience.  The problems that he faced were almost all self-inflicted damage.  At times Kaufman did humor that was acidic and grating.  Any in the audience that took him seriously or did not count themselves in on the joke, turned against him in a rage. 
The wrestling against women issue was the funniest example.  If you looked at it as pure humor and didn't allow yourself to believe that he really felt that way about women, it was very funny.  If you took him seriously, it was as offensive as any thing could be.  Andy was very like Lenny Bruce in that way.  He chose to attack societal norms to inflict shock on his audience. They were two of a kind in that regard.And Jim Carrey was just brilliant.  It was possible to believe that you were just watching Andy and those around his life.  They also mixed in enough people playing themselves to further that illusion.  They also had a lot of fun hiring actors and others in his life, to play different characters in his life, DeVito playing Shapiro, and Shapiro playing a club owner for example.  The biggest disappointment for me in the entire film was not getting to see the song `I go mad when I hear a yodel'.  On one of Andy's Saturday Night Live appearances he did that song over the music of a Choir of Conga players.  It was absolutely remarkable.  The yodeling over the top of the extremely funky groove was strange and just hilarious.  I was so hoping to see it includedÂ…And of course the continuous running gag with the Tony Clifton character was another amazing piece of acting by Carrey.  JC was playing Kaufman, playing Clifton.  It was almost eerie how he could drop in and out of characters. The Clifton character was the ultimate obnoxious lounge singer, taken to the greatest extreme possible.Kaufman was the consummate prankster or practical joker, and his favorite victim was his audience.  The Tony Clifton character was playing a concert, and Kaufman came out on stage just to try and trick on the audience.  He had his buddy play Clifton to add to the controversy.  He worked together with the pro wrestler in Memphis to create tremendous controversy.  I didn't know until I saw the movie that this was an agreement between those two.  I thought it was real.  Andy had put one over on me for nearly 20 years.  The only problem with this joking was its failure as a marketable commodity.Then as he was dying, he went to the Philippines to find a miracle cure for his Cancer, and instead he found a showman and grifter.  It was just the kind of show that Andy himself might have done at some point.  When he realized it was fake and how, the joke was on him, that realization was just one of the things that made me cry during this film.  The irony of that moment was impossible to miss.  Also what a horrible time he had convincing every one that he really had cancer.  He had `cried wolf' in a comic sense once too often to be believed.The funeral scene was another that brought on tears.  Watching everyone who had been in his life singing together and holding hands was the ultimate Kaufman fantasy.  Andy lived to see people just getting happy, and he made his final act and remembrance just such an event.  This movie will move you, twist you and wring you out. It is a must see.",Null,0,0,21 February 2000
The Matrix," Science Fiction Thriller blurring the lines of reality between computers and the physical world
","This movie has moved into my list of top Science Fiction favorites along with such films as `Blade Runner', `Dune', `Star Wars', `Soldier' and perhaps even `The Fifth Element'.  The whole name game was interesting, from the religious perspective.  Neo (which means New) was indeed a new breed of hacker and so did turn out to be the 'savior' of all, with his side kick Trinity - her name gave me a whole Catholic vibe.    Lawrence Fishburn's character was, of course, a type of John the Baptist.  He was a voice crying out in the wilderness, and was very much on the verge of dying the same inauspicious death as John.  Zion was the main frame, heaven itself.  The Oracle or prophet was interesting, and gave us the only non-Christian twist with her Dali Lama like search for 'the one' among the psychically gifted kiddos in her lime green apartment. That whole scenario was right out of Little Buddha, which, ironically, Keanu also starred in.   Thank goodness one of the Lamas offered the wisdom of the spoon to our Jesus (neo).  We are even given a Judas, who betrays our savior for the mere thought of some steak and wine, quick and happy to take his bag of Silver.How about the writers poking some fun at Bill Gates with the window cleaners making their loud squeaking cleaning noises.  That is right off of a Windows screen saver.  Also fun with them picking on Oracle as the prophet, that name couldn't be accidental with Oracle as the leading data base vendor in the world right now.  This didn't escape the writer's attention.We of course followed a bit of Alice in Wonderland with the White Rabbit leading him to the Disco, and then to Trinity.   Lawrence Fishburn then offers him a red or blue pill, and then the scumbag Judas character gives our savior a sip of his home brewed liquor, at the moment that he reveals to him his displeasure in their current surroundings.  This is almost a last supper reversal, where Jesus let Judas sip from his cup before the betrayalinteresting.  Then of course the Oracle herself gives Neo a cookie, so that he will feel better.  Cakes and Cups prevail throughout.  They are even given what could pass for 'Manna' to eat.  The Hebrew for Manna literally means, 'what is it?'  This surely fits the gruel that they ate in their bowls.What else, the scene in the elevator is right out of Speed, one of Keanu's best.The submarine scene with them all sitting quiet, like 'Run Silent, Run Deep'.  It is a sub marine classic to park the sub, go quiet, and then wait out the depth charges with sweat running down your faces.The scene where Keanu loses his mouth was taken directly from the science fiction classic 'I have no mouth, yet I must scream' by Harlan Ellison.  It also reminded me of the cover of an old HP Lovecraft book I once owned.The device that they used to suck the bug out of Keanu's stomach was this giant intricate machine, yet powered by plugging in to the cigarette lighter hole in the dash of the car.  The car that they chose were these Kennedy-presidency-era limo Lincolns (with tops), always black.Finally, for now, the fact that the only escape were these forgotten hard copper phone lines by Bell or whichever phone company.  The last vestige of the escape was actually low tech and hundreds of years old by then...no cell phone could save them.",Null,0,0,7 February 2000
