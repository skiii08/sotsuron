Skyfall," Best bond since the 60s? Combination story, bad guys
",Maybe the best bond movie of the last 40 months years. This and casino are neck and neck. THe Gillian gives this one a edge much stronger villain than casino. Bond also has been thru much more by this point. I would say Craig has made 2 classics and 2 solid ones. Will see what the fifth one is like,10,0,3,12 April 2020
