Lucky Number Slevin," The Usual Suspects minus balls, plus Guy Ritchie, equals...
","Well, it equals a bit of a letdown. I like The Usual Suspects. It had style, it didn't hold back, and I didn't see the ending coming. By the end of this movie, the majority of the plot twist has been telegraphed halfway through, and what remains is a husk of The Usual Suspects. Its main flaw is that it breaks the old storytelling rule about showing rather than telling.Not only that, it tries to do too many things. It has a love story. It has self-consciously clever dialogue. It throws in Guy Ritchie-style cinematography, which works, and some random Guy Ritchie over-the-topness, which doesn't. This all has the effect of neutering the movie and forcing it to pull its punches, because it can't do all of these things and still be a powerful mind-twister.Lucky Number Slevin is not horrible, though. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley do good work with their odd characters. Lucy Liu unfortunately has a lot of that clever dialogue, but her character is nearly surreal enough to be interesting. Josh Hartnett alternates between convincingly natural and unpolished fake. The soundtrack by J Ralph improves the feel of the whole thing, and the visual style fits with the flow.I'd recommend that if you watch this, you use your favorite method of turning your brain off, or at least down a bit, beforehand. Then it has a fighting chance to blow you away like it wants to.",6,0,0,29 May 2010
Public Enemies," Not actually bad, but not good.
","This film is a disappointment. Johnny Depp is rather good as the bank robber John Dillinger, and Christian Bale is not bad as Melvin Purvis, the agent chasing him. However, put simply, it feels rushed. The cinematography is ineffective and spastic, and the editing fails to make the story interesting. Perhaps these things needed more time given to them. It's actually boring, which is not what's expected of a gangster film. Without that attention to detail, it ends up simplistic but busy, a bad combination.The director of photography also did LA Confidential, so it's difficult to blame him for the uninteresting look of the movie. There are two chase scenes which echo each other, one through an orchard during the day and one through the woods at night, which were done well. Most of the action scenes are just bullets spraying everywhere while people run around, with only rare attention paid to constructing a coherent sequence of events. The camera is far too jerky, far too often. Michael Mann is probably to blame for all of this, as the director.Weak story, uninteresting flow, and visuals without enough punch add up to make this one a waste of time.",5,45,90,2 July 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," It's an influential movie, but it's got its flaws.
","2001: A Space Odyssey is worth seeing, because you'll understand references and be able to make conversation about it.  However, you might not enjoy watching it.  There were a few things I really liked about it, but I wouldn't say that I had a good time watching the film.That's not to say that I particularly regret spending the time (it is a bit lengthy) to watch it.  Afterwards it is interesting to mull over some of the themes, and develop your own take on it.  I won't be so pompous as to try to feed you my interpretation of the meaning, because there are too many ways you could explain each thing.  However, as vague as the metaphors are, I feel that Kubrick beats the viewer over the head with them.  The phallic object(s), the question of whether or not man is special, 'man's first instinct,' and so on: I don't know about everyone else, but I felt like Kubrick tried a bit too hard to make his themes clear.  I didn't know anything about the film beforehand, so I wasn't primed to come in and analyze everything.  However, when the message and substance are so blatant (even if you can't be sure quite what they are), you are forced to self-consciously think about the movie while watching it.  'Ugh, I've been watching birth imagery for the last five minutes,' you think, and it detracts from the experience.  Even if you realize you might be wrong.The themes are certainly interesting questions, interesting things to think about.  And I'm not saying that they're presented in a shock-value sort of way.  Without dialogue, action, and dynamic camera work, though, when the artistic parts come up and come on so strong, it's just overkill.  The ending sequence is particularly guilty of this.  Everything is metaphor, and Kubrick chose some rather mundane ways to represent the grandiose, almost as if he thinks no one will have any clue what's going on otherwise.  'Oh, come on, a bathtub?' you may find yourself griping.As for the claims that the movie is boring, they may go a bit too far, but there is some validity to them.  Certainly some scenes are most effective when they're stretched out longer than you'd expect.  At least for me, Kubrick stretched them out far longer than was necessary.  Given the flavor of the film, long sit-back-and-enjoy-the-beauty scenes seem out of place while you're trying to discover out what's going on, and they end long after you've taken it all in.In all, if you enjoy your thought-provoking experiences coming in story form, you'll be disappointed.  If you like to change how you view the world slowly, and don't take well to things that try to blow your mind, you'll be disappointed.  If you're not interested in an experiment in film pace, you'll be disappointed.  If you'd rather have fun watching a movie, and do the deep thinking later, you'll be disappointed.  See the movie I suppose, but there will be many things that will make you want to roll your eyes.",6,1,3,2 December 2001
Avatar," Entertaining, but won't hold up over time
","Avatar tells the story of a man who is paralyzed from the waist down, and through controlling an alien body with his mind, gets more and more absorbed into the alien culture, their respect for the world around them, and their fight against encroachment by humans.For someone who typically dislikes movies which try to walk the line between mindless blockbuster and subtle storytelling, Avatar exceeds expectations. There was a ridiculous amount of hype for a movie which appeared to have graphics which were nothing new, and a silly story. Well, the graphics are better than expected. The story is not told in an especially compelling way, due to the blockbuster style where everything is just as it seems and the plot flows in a straight line. However, the world of Pandora is quite immersive, especially in 3D, so the graphics make this movie. While the effects, especially of alien characters and animals, still do not quite look like they were filmed, the trees and rocks are very convincing. The 3D interfaces that the humans use for their computers are slick, the ships look real, and the mystical glowing alien plants and insects are cool.The live-action 3D is very engaging for now, although a little glitchy. Most likely we will look back on this movie in the future and wince, after the technique is improved. For example, sometimes the side of an actor's face has a strong highlight as seen by one camera, but not by the other, which produces a disorienting effect when one of the viewer's eyes sees the highlight but not the other.As for the story and message, it is a rather standard one of not messing with nature and the indigenous people, which honestly distracts from the expected brainless blockbuster action, romance, and coming of age story. Many of the serious things in this movie were done better in Mononoke-hime. The parts where it is a blockbuster work well enough despite somewhat uninspired action, and it probably would have been better if it had stayed fun and dumb. All in all, worth watching, but by a slim margin.",6,3,5,16 January 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Truly deserves its high rating.
","Shawshank is an absolutely amazing film.  Its concept is not especially compelling; you might even call it plain, but oh, the execution!  Certainly this is how to make a movie.I saw Shawshank in the cinema, which is always good, but not necessary for a film where the plot and filmatic skill are what draw you in.  When I left, I noticed that everyone was sniffling.  The film is so beautiful that even the tough people cried.  I don't mean that it's a tearjerker either, it doesn't make you cry out of sadness or pull cheap stunts to get the tears flowing. Well, perhaps sadness has something to do with it, but it's a deeper kind of sadness, one that's got tears of joy in it too, not 'how could they kill the dog?' sadness.  And while it makes people cry, they're glad they saw it. It's not even my kind of movie, but there's no way I can give it less than a 10.Notice that this movie is loved by all kinds of viewers.  From the people who aren't so articulate to the movie snobs, this film hits home on a level that none other I know of does.",10,0,0,21 March 2002
Bruce Almighty," Great concept, poor execution
","How can you mess up a comedy about an ordinary man (Jim Carrey as a somewhat self-centered reporter) being given the powers of God? I suppose a better question is how to do it right, and on that subject the creators of Bruce Almighty missed the mark.This film takes an idea that almost everyone has wondered about in some form, in one of those 'what if?' daydreams, and gives it a specific incarnation. The viewer is treated to some very well-done effects, like Bruce parting traffic, instantly coating everything in sight with Post-it notes, and driving girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) wild. Don't forget the scene that makes the movie worth watching: Bruce forcing his competitor, anchorman Evan Baxter (Steven Carell from The Daily Show) to ramble and babble like a lunatic while on the air.However, the plot comes up kind of short. It gets somewhat fragmented with all of the funny physical comedy, and then when it tries to hit on an emotional level (and a somewhat sappy, unoriginal one at that), there hasn't been enough buildup. In particular, Grace and her relationship with Bruce aren't given enough exposition to expect the viewer to naturally care about them, so some things come out forced. For the most part though, this is forgivable, since the film is really a comedy with a spiritual message, which it does get across.The real problem is the soundtrack. The orchestral score is distracting and too demonstrative. It's reminiscent of cartoons or pure slapstick comedies: too many musical sound effects. It's almost surprising that there's no trombone going 'bwa bwa bwaaah' when something bad happens to Bruce. On the other hand, the film isn't actually for small children like the score would suggest, since there is a fair amount of cursing and mature material (for example, Bruce driving Grace wild). Perhaps it might have been better served going with an R rating, exploring the idea more thoroughly, and tossing out the cheesy sound effects. Since the creators didn't make that movie, we don't know. In any case, the one they did make is passable, but does not live up to the high standard set by the concept it's based on.",4,0,1,15 January 2004
