The Ring," The reason that I now buy DVDs
","A killer video tape that kills you after you watch it? Sounds oddly oriental. Not surprisingly The Ring is an American remake of the cult Japanese horror, Ringu.I've seen many a movie that I wish would have killed me after watching them but i'm stepping away from the point as The Ring isn't one of these films.After the grisly and unexplained death of her neice, a young reporter and her ex-lover follow up the rumour that the girl, like many others had watched a mysterious video tape and then received a phone call telling her that she was going to die.As with most horror stories our heroes decide to dive in at the deep end and watch this tape. From here another story unravels as the couple try to fit together clues that might save them.The mood of The Ring is just right for a horror film and is well complimented by the dull colourisation which really creates an unclean and edgy atmosphere.Being a horror that relies heavily on visual impact there were the inevitable 'boo-scares' that not only sent a shiver down my spine but through my legs and into the seat in front of me. Some scenes were chilling enough to send the rather large woman sitting in front of me to start blubbering and hiding her face.Once again the children are the stars of the show with some very mature performances but the unsung heroes are the special effects team who created some wonderful illusions. I still can't fathom how they managed to pluck a fly from inside the TV screen.All in all The Ring does promise a chilling slice of horror although I have heard that the japanese original is superior. However if, like me, you haven't seen the original and you're looking for a fright (why you would be looking for that I have no idea but hey, each to his own) The Ring is worth a view but not really memorable.Be warned; I haven't been able to watch a video since and I have suddenly become very suspicious of little girls.A chilling, though not underwear ruining, 7/10",Null,0,0,9 March 2003
Pearl Harbor," An attack on the most blatant overly patriotic tripe ever made
","I can't believe that I wasted 3 hours of my life watching this terrible propagandarist rubbish. Not only was it about an hour and a half too long but it is the most shamefully over-patriotic film i have ever seen. The American producers obviously couldn't bare to show an American loss so an American attack on Japan is tacked onto the end,lengthening the film and forcing me to endure even more pain. The script is terrible, changing from love story to goofy comedy to supposed drama. The biggest chunk of the budget had obviously been spent on special fx (which were the only plus point of the film) which is why the script was lacking and wooden actors were hired. By the end of the film I could tell that one of the leading males was going to die but i was so mind-numbingly bored i couldn't have cared about which one became worm food. Yet seeing as Ben Affleck wouldn't stay dead earlier in the movie and had been jilted it became more obvious that the other guy would croak. And what was that bit with Cuba Gooding Jr all about? He had no importance in the storyline and seemed to be there so that the movie could be sold by the names of those in it, even if there is no point in them being there. Pearl Harbor was obviously trying to emulate Titanic yet only goes on to be a lesson to future film-makers; Big-budget effects and pointless cameos do not make a good movie.Pearl Harbor should be seen as in insult to those who lost their lives in the actual event.",1,0,2,9 July 2002
8 Mile," Rocky Vs Eminem?
","I won't admit to being a fan of Eminem and when I heard that he was making a movie, i thought instinctively of Vanilla Ice (saying that, 'Marky' Mark Whalberg and Will Smith don't seem to be doing too badly).Though I will admit to having been impressed my the trailer and various previews and so I was looking forward to this after I was left disappointed and disillusioned with films by Gangs Of New York the previous week.Certain reviewers compared 8 Mile to Rocky but then I like Rocky so thats not really a big thing. In fact it gave 8 mile standards to meet.Thankfully I wasn't left disappointed by an inspiring tale set in a gritty and painful backdrop.The cast didn't over-perform and certainly didn't under-perform as they carried out some real and meaningful scenes. Eminem proved that he can act though it is difficult to see him in any other role, the story of Rabbit is practically biographical. The only slight doubt in casting was Kim Basinger. Not that her performance was bad, in fact she was fantastic as Rabbit's trashy mother, however she seemed a little too glamorous for the part.I have never really been a big fan of rap but I sat in open-mouthed amazement as Eminem did his stuff in the various battles throughout the film. The final battle is an immense build up of emotion and leaves you on a real high.There is nothing to say other than this film delivers in a big way. It was everything that I hoped it would be and I was hugely impressed and entertained.So Eminem does meet the levels of Rocky in terms of the film but I still know who I'd back in a fight.8 Mile deserves a street-wise 9/10",9,0,0,24 January 2003
Big Fish," The secret to good story-telling; build up slow and then reel'em in
","We all know Tim Burton's work. He is possibly one of the few contemporary directors to whom you can attribute a definite style. The wildly immaginative approach to most Burton films would appear to be a perfect match for a film which takes place largely in a fairy tale world.Burton does not disappoint, delivering a tale which catches you by the imagination and dangles the unbelievable in front of your eyes in such a warm and gentle manner that you have no choice but to be entertained.The film itself explores the dynamics of storytelling, demonstrating the simple fact that the subject matter doesn't matter a single bit, it's the way that a story is told that determines a classic from the Kurt Russell film, Soldier. (A nice idea for a story but very badly handled.)This is possibly where I can draw the only fault of the film. The non-linear editing of the beginning of the film may seem like a clever idea in other films but here it seems a bit confused and slightly muddled. Once the film gets into full flow, jumping from present day to the 'reality-enhanced' world of Edward Bloom's past, it is highly enjoyable.Albert Finney is good as the older Bloom but Ewan McGregor completely outshines him and i'm delighted to report that his Alabama accent is spot on throughout the movie and in no way as irritating as I had assumed it would be.The supporting cast is fantastic as well with Danny De Vito and Steve Buscemi really standing out.Big Fish is a film that is well worth the admission fee and will leave you with a great sense of satisfaction. The imaginative plot and creative characters bring you right into Burton's fictional world and you will leave much happier.Big Fish reels in a whopping 8/10",Null,0,0,12 February 2004
Die Hard," The ultimate action movie
","I looked up action movie in my dictionary and it just said Die Hard. Die Hard is quit possibly the only movie i can watch over and over again, even though its not a movie geared at making your brain work, it is nonetheless a masterpiece. The storyline is quite simple, terrorists take over building to nick a shed lad of cash, end of story. Yet the way the story is crafted is a true work of genius and has yet to be matched by director Tierney. Yet who can blame him, Die Had set amazingly high standards.What are the elements of Die Hard that make it successful? I think its the way that this particular action film is very similar to a western in its approach. Just think about it, a lone law enforcer (New York cop) turns up to single-handedly to save a village (skyscraper) from outside forces (terrorists) who threaten to disturb the peace (kill everyone). Add to this mix explosions, one on one gunfights and some killer wise-cracks from the hero, and you've got yourself the ultimate action film with the ultimate action hero. even the villain is great.Die Hard is quite possibly my favourite action movie, nothing comes near it, not even the sequels! A 10/10, 5 star, 2 thumbs up film!",10,1,2,8 September 2002
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Jury's out on this one
","Having read and enjoyed the book I had high expectations for this film. I hadn't seen any other adaptations either, so I would have nothing but the book to compare it to. So I ordered the DVD. I know you shouldn't judge a DVD by it's cover but when I saw the tagline, 'Love never dies,' alarm bells started reverberating through my skull.I don't remember this in the book but what the hey, i'll give it a go anyway. From the first scene I saw exactly what Coppola had done. He had taken Dracula away from it's traditional horror roots and slapped a love story on top of it, for a blood-thirsty bloke this was a little hard to handle. With so much artistic license, could Coppola really claim that this was Bram Stoker's Dracula?There were elements of the film that I was pleased with though. I was very impressed with the frequent reference to the characters' diaries, the writing covering half of the screen was a very clever visual technique.
The plot had been a bit mashed up in order to fit it into two hours but this meant that the characters do not grow as close as they do in the text. To be honest there is very little character interaction in the film. Gary Oldman, Sadie Frost and Anthony Hopkins all put in strong performances but i'm a little bewildered as to how Keanu Reeves got cast. He was so sure he was the one, I wonder whatever happened to him?This film uses a lot of strong imagery and in places is visually entertaining. Some of the techniques employed are very clever and pretty unique. However some of the special effects looked a little on the lame side. The make-up department had a field day on Oldman's many guises and it's much to their credit.Dracula lacked the tension to make it a true horror and as a fan of the book I wasn't really impressed by the romantic dimension that had been added. Romance fans and followers of artistic films will enjoy, fans of the book might want to avoid.Dracula bites the dust with 6/10",Null,0,1,28 February 2003
Gangs of New York," So close to being the greatest film ever made.
","I'll admit that I couldn't wait to see this film. The hype made me believe that this would be the most complete movie-experience of my life. Even without the hype I was expecting something huge due to the names involved, Di Caprio, Diaz, Broadbent, Day-Lewis and of course Scorsese. For a young sprog like me, what better way to attract me to a period drama (although if Tarantino did one it would take it a step further). From the opening scene I felt that my faith would be rewarded as Scorsese orchestrated a wonderful battle and laid the foundations of the story. Fantastically filmed and choreographed, it was exactly what I wanted from the film. However it couldn't keep up the standard that it had set so early on and the film began to drag at around the mid-point. It took far too long for Leo to be found out by Day-Lewis and even when it happened it wasn't used to it's greatest possible potential. I personally would have to liked to have seen Leo trying to live up to his father's legacy or hating himself for becoming to close to the man that killed him but it never happened. Yet even when things started to go well, I still believed that Scorsese wouldn't let me down and that I would leave the cinema on a high. It felt like it was all falling into place when Di Caprio hangs the dead rabbit on the fence, it was almost like Rocky going back into training. At this point I was sure that I would get the climatactic ending that I wanted and when the two gangs finally(it did take longer than was really necessary) marched into the streets I was on the edge of my seat. Yet I was left completely disappointed by a real sell-out ending. It had all the right ingredients to finish with the most epic ending in film history but it was more than slightly anti-climactic. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie, it is well worth seeing if only for Daniel Day-Lewis' breath-taking perfomance. If he doesn't pick up an oscar it will be the greatest miscarriage of justice in the history of the planet. I was also very impressed by the end time-lapse which very cleverly brought us up-to-date and credit must be given to the set-builders who created an amazing recreation of New York. I was also overwhelmed by the amount of extras in each shot. Every shot was busy and filled with things to see. Overall Gangs of New York is still better than your average film and well worth a look but I was left empty and disappointed by the finale. I feel that it is a real shame to have wasted such potential so Gangs of New York gets itself 7/10",Null,0,1,14 January 2003
