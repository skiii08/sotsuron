The Blair Witch Project," Not worth the time...
","This movie received so much press I ran out to see it.  It is one of the few movies that I regret not only my monetary investment, but also the time I spent watching it.  The ending made me (and the rest of the theatre) moan out of disgust, as it was so predictable and cliched.  This movie may have to replace 'Crybaby' as the worst movie I've seen.",1,2,3,5 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One big ad, but entertaining still
","Episode One is one of those movies that received so much press it couldn't ever live up to all of it, though it managed to not be disappointing. Overall the story seemed to lack actual meat.  I felt much like I did after 'Back to the Future Part II'.  That is I found myself wondering why I just paid to watch a 2-hour trailer for the the next in the series.",8,0,1,5 October 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The classic action film
","This is one of the best movies I have seen.  It is the first of 3 in a great series, a series that knew when to quick too.  All three are well worth the time, but this is the most entertaining of them.  The action is just right, and the story just flows.  This is a definite 'first-run' film.",9,0,0,5 October 1999
The Mummy," Not Indiana Jones, but still worthwhile
","This movie provided a good laugh a few times, but overall it was only mildly entertaining.  It did manage to hit one several genres, but failed to master any of them.  The horror was cheesy, as was the drama, and the action. The humor was canned at times, but that fact that the movie was coherent with all four of these made it worth watching.  It is a 'renter', meaning wait for the video.",6,0,0,5 October 1999
Titanic," Long, but worthwhile
","The movie was heavily marketed, and as such I expected great things from it. Fortunately it lived up to the hype (which is rare.)  After seeing it in the theatre and loving it, I tried to watch it on video a few months later but couldn't.  It is extremely slow once you know the story line. Definitely worth watching once, but not worth owning.",7,0,2,5 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Excellent Movie
","This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.  (and unfortunately for my budget, that's quite a few!)  The story was great, as was the acting. The effects were not overdone, but just subtle enough to keep it realistic. I was definitely impressed by the thought that had gone into the script. This movie is one of the few I'd recommend as a 'first-run' movie, meaning get out there and see it.",10,0,0,5 October 1999
The Matrix," Good Action/Sci-Fi
","After watching this movie I wanted to run on the walls (literally).  It was a flashy techno-drama with great special effects.  The story kept me interested, and the acting was good.  I would place this in the 'first-run' category, meaning get out there and see it in the theatres.",9,0,0,5 October 1999
