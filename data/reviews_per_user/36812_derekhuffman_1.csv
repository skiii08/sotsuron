Marie Antoinette," Horrible
","Why someone would put this much work and employ this much talent to make this movie is unconcionable.WTF is with the horrible modern music? I told my wife as we watched this. 'I swear, if Bowie comes on (a la another stupid crap movie, A Knight's Tale) I'm turning this off!' But it just didn't end. Gah! Just when I started to feel bad for this 'most abused' woman, in this crazy position as 'ambassador vagina' from Austria, the music would just annoy the hell out of me and distract me from the story.Perhaps they'll have a DVD 'no crappy music' option.At least that would release me from the pain of having to endure this again.",3,0,1,13 February 2007
