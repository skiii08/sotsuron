Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can - One Of Speilburg's Best
","Catch Me If You Can is an absolutely fun film from the theme song to the adventures of Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abignale. The actors and characters are outstanding! Based on a true story of a con artist who couldn't handle the divorce of his parents, Leonardo DiCaprio breathes life again to the young Frank. Tom Hanks provide hilarity and a sternness to the plot as he and Leonardo provide perfect chemistry on the screen. Everything is perfectly set in it's time of the 1960s. From the airports to the clothes, the 60s are brought to life again. Steven Speilburg did a wonderful job, as well as the people who did props, clothes, and other items, bringing this picture to life. Comedy, romance, suspense, family, and the true art of bank fraud are brought forward in this remarkable film. With a shocking ending and sweet story line, this film definitely deserved more credit than it got. Watch it. You won't regret it.",8,2,4,1 October 2005
Corpse Bride," The Corpse Bride Is To Die For
","I think that The Corpse Bride is a beautiful story. It's about true love and kindness. Johnny Depp is a perfect Victor Van Dort and all the characters are played wonderfully. The animation is superb from facial expressions to a reflection in a tear drop. The ending is one worth waiting for. It's an excellent film that all families should see. I'd suggest not taking children younger than 8 or 9. They might not understand the story line that young, but they'll love the dancing skeletons and the fun songs! That was a surprise: all the songs they sang. If there's one song you must hear it has to be the skeleton one, but also the piano sequence is beautiful as well. Hope you enjoy the film as much as I did!",9,153,181,1 October 2005
