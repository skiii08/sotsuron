","Kill Bill Vol. 2, the second part of the fourth film of Quentin Tarantino, is a homage to spaghetti western and martial arts movies.After of the Bride defeated to Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii, she must cope with Elle Driver, Budd and his brother, Bill. The beginning, like in the previous film, has a strong scene because we see when Bill shoots to the Bride and she tell us directly about her revenge's travel and her final objective: Kill Bill.The elements of spaghetti western films present in this movie are: - The desert environment. - The rough and tough characters. - The dirty aesthetic. - The soundtrack for gives more intensity to confrontation scenes: the Bride & Bill, the Bride vs the grave, the Bride vs Elle.

Mulholland Drive," The unique neo-noir surrealist film and one best movies of all time
","Mulholland Drive is the ninth movie of David Lynch on 2001.Originally, this story was going to be TV show, like 'Twin Peaks', but this project was canceled in 1999, in this moment, the story end in Rita with her wig. However Canal+ took the project and David Lynch realized the film, as we know it and for own good luck.This film has attractive, unique and interesting elements: - The mysterious, emotive and subjective soundtrack, moreover excellent three songs: 'Sixteen reasons', 'I've Told Every Little Star' and 'Llorando'. - The critic for Hollywood. - The use of three languages: English, Spanish and French. - The thrilling and tragic lesbian relationship. - The symbolic persons (cowboy, old folks and vagabond), the psychoanalytic elements (colors (blue, red and pink) and traumas) and the metaphorical objects (blue key and blue box). - The neo-noir elements: fatal female, the crime, the detectives and a fatalist environment. - The possibility for interpreter the story from perspectives like metaphysics, dream, reality or both.Like in The Shawshank Redemption, another of my favorite movies, Rita Hayworth plays an important role in the story because the amnesiac girl takes her name and Lynch uses her name, maybe as a symbol of yearning of stardom and fame in the main character.Furthermore, this film catapulted the Naomi Watts's career, so in the next years, she did some important movies (21 grams, King Kong, The impossible); however, the Laura Harring's career didn't climb.The story of this film we can divide in four parts:-The (metaphorical) beginning: The purple hued swing dance number, Diane and the old folks, and the bed.-The idealistic (dream) part: One woman suffers a car accident on Mulholland Dr. and then she stays amnesiac meanwhile Betty arrives to Los Angeles and she goes to the Aunt Ruth's apartment, in this place Betty finds the amnesiac woman (Rita), they decides resolve the mystery of accident and the identity of Rita meanwhile Betty search the stardom. For the other hand, the director Adam Kesher must confront the mafia that controls his film and they impose one actress: Camilla Rodas. Adam is fired, his woman is unfaithful and she, with her lover, takes out to Adam of his house. For the night, Adam go to one ranch for see the cowboy, this gay say his that should do. Next day, Betty does her casting and Adam chooses to Camilla; later, Betty and Rita go to Sierra Bonita for find to Diane but they discover that she is die, so Betty do one wig to Rita. In the night, Betty and Rita do the love and they go to 'Club Silencio', afterward Betty finds the blue box, they go the Ruth's apartment, Betty disappears and Rita opens the box with the blue key.-The depressive (reality) part: Diane Selwyn wakes up and she has many memories with Camilla: from their relationship until their fracture, this include the party, her jealous, her madness, her revenge and her depression. In this part, the watcher must connect the story between Rita and Betty with the story between Camilla and Diane.-The confused (metaphysical) part: Undoubtedly, the hardest part for understand. The vagabond appears behind of Wilkins restaurant; he throws one bag with the blue box, rotten meat and can opener and the old folks leaves the bag. In the Diane's apartment, she sees the blue key, the two detectives touch her door and the old folks persecute and torment to Diane, she takes one fire gun and shoots herself. Finally, blue smoke appears and we can see the face of vagabond, Betty and Rita together in dream place and the lady of blue hair saying: Silencio. This part can have many interpretations so we must enjoy this ending and we must avoid the over analysis of the story.I like the neo-noir movies and the surrealist works, so I love this film because David Lynch gets to combine these two genres.Finally, this film so excellent and it deserves more recognition for the people.",10,2,3,25 February 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The best revenge story
","The fourth movie of Quentin Tarantino has an excellent story and elements very attractive.The beginning has strong scene because Bill shoots to The Bride while she tells his about her baby. The sentence: 'The revenge is a dish best served cold', tells us the subject of revenge along of movie. The revenge is an important subject because it is an inseparable element of the humankind, from the beginnings of human history the revenge has been present in many stories.The soundtrack is good because the director uses the appropriate music in the adequate moment during all movie, especially in the chapter five when we can hear funny and action music. In my opinion, the most characteristic music is the whistling and the songs of group 5.6.7.8's.The Japanese culture is present in all movie: its language, its ideology, the samurai swords (katanas) and the anime animation. Really, Tarantino make one tribute to the Japanese movies with his film.Despite her rancor and her angry, the bride always faces her enemies without traps and stratagems, that is to say, she fights with honor and bravery in all moment.The main antagonist, in this part, is O-Ren Ishii because we see her life, from the parent's death until her own death, so we can understand the personality of O-Ren.Like in others Tarantino's movies, there is huge use of blood in fight scenes, especially during the sword fights, in my opinion, this is an element strong and attractive.The movie can divide in the five parts: - The chapter one (2): The bride fights against Vernita Green. - The chapter two (The blood-splattered bride): The bride stays in coma for four years, when she wakes up she begins her revenge. - The chapter three (The origin of O-Ren): The most novel part of this film, the bride tells us the most important events in the life of O-Ren Ishii, in anime animation. - The chapter four (The man from Okinawa): The bride goes to Okinawa for visit Hattori Hanzo and he gives one samurai sword. - The chapter five (Showdown at the house of blue leaves): The best part of film, the bride fights against the bodyguards, the Crazy 88s and O-Ren Ishii, using her sword.Undoubtedly, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one best movies of all time for many reasons and is a film that all people should watch.",10,5,10,9 February 2017
The Descent," The descent of the human nature
","'The descent' is a film of Neil Marshall in 2005. The title can suggest some ideas: - The descent the six friends into one cave. - The descent of human towards its real animal nature, in this case, the human can do horrible things for maintain her/his own life, even kill if is necessary.For other hand, along of the story, we can observe and identify the personality of the six women: - Sarah: brave and depressive. - Juno: selfish and proud. - Beth: helpful and sensible. - Rebecca: intelligent, strong and protective. - Sam: emotional and enthusiast - Holly: impulsive and angry.Furthermore, there are good aspects in the movie that we can emphasize, for example: - The incredible realism for the cave: the dust, the sensation of claustrophobic and the rough relief. - The play of colors's lights between red (flare and blood), yellow (wood fire and artificial light) and green (flashlight); this light's game we can see it in the film 'Creep'. - The comfortable and beautiful woods. - The sensible and profound soundtrack that transmits emotions like mystery, adventure and horror; especially in the beginning and the ending. - The use of dreams and hallucinations for represent the Sarah's traumas. - The violent battles between women and crawlers, and the dramatic deaths of some characters.This movie has bad elements like: - The clich√©s of horror movies: in middle of the nothing (woods), the stupid decisions of main characters, false scares, and, more recently, the use of screamers. - The excessive use of blood during the crawlers's death.The story we can divide in five parts: - The beginning: A car accident, where Sarah loses her husband and daughter. The meeting of six friend in middle of woods (Chattooga National Park) and the road towards the cave. - In the cave: The six friends enter in the cave, they cross narrow tunnels. The collapse of one tunnel and the fear of Sarah. The lie and the descent of Juno. The dexterity of Rebecca. - The accidents: Accidentally, Juno hurts the Rebecca's hand when she falls. The fracture and splinting of Holly. The first sighting of crawlers and the discovery of the cave paintings. - The attack of crawlers: The six friends find one place with many animal bones and the crawlers attack. Holly dies; Juno kills one crawler and to, accidentally, Beth. One crawler hunts to Rebecca and Sam. Sarah sees the horrible nature of the crawlers, she kills Beth and three crawlers. Juno saves to Rebecca and Sam of her hunter, but later these two sister die for the crawlers's hunting. - The depressive ending: Sarah and Juno gather again, they fight against some crawlers in a bloody and violent battle, Sarah discovers the truth of Juno and she wounds the Juno's leg. Sarah falls of tunnel, she dreams with her escape of cave and the Juno's ghost. Finally, Sarah wakes inside cave, she sees her daughter meanwhile we hear the crawlers's calls.Along the movie, there are some mysteries unsolved: - The origin of cave paintings. - The origin of crawlers, possibly they were humans. - The destiny of the adventurers of XX century. - The destiny of Sarah.The Sarah's revenge against Juno can have several motives, for example: - Juno had one adventure with the Sarah's husband. - Juno wounded and left Beth. - Sarah needs to live and she uses to Juno like bait.The Sarah's destiny during story's ending could be the next: - Sarah will die in cave by the crawlers. - Sarah will survive inside the cave and she will be one crawler. - Sarah will achieve to encounter the departure of cave.The second part of story is bad, it changes essential elements and it responses some my questions, but I consider that film like one apocryphal story. In addition, whether the studios do the third part, then I hope a best story and that film will put in order the errors of second part.Without a doubt, 'The descent' is an excellent horror movie and it deserves major recognize for its achievements.",10,2,5,15 January 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," The triumph of human spirit in the Shawshank prison
","The Shawshank Redemption is the first film of Frank Darabont and the best movie of all times, undoubtedly.Based in the short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption' of Stephen King (the master of terror), this adaptation is the most realistic story about the hard reality in the prisons and an excellent reflect of our daily life (fear, hope, routine, justice, ambition, freedom and so on).There are many interesting and endearing characters in the story; however, I only can mention the main characters, they are: - Andy Dufresne: the main character, a man condemned to two life imprisonments for an error, however he is the most optimistic and intelligent character. - Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding: the narrator, the best friend of Andy and the person who get anything for the prisoners. - Samuel Norton: the ambitious warden of Shawshank prison and the main antagonist. - Brooks Hatlen: the old man that takes care of the library in the prison and the institutionalize man that must confront his hard reality.In the story, we can watch the main ideas of the stoic and existentialist philosophy, especially the last ideology such we can see in the Andy's actions because he looks for his liberty and he makes his destiny. For more information, anybody we can see the next video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91XDnA9z8h0.Like in Mulholland Drive, another of my favorite movies, Rita Hayworth has a great importance along of story because Andy have a poster of Rita Hayworth, he and 'Red' watch her film 'Gilda', and Stephen King uses her name, maybe as a symbol of yearning of hope.This film we can divide in nine parts: - The Andy's judgment: Andy is condemned to two life imprisonments. - The first two years: Andy must confront many problems in the prison, especially Bogs. - The ascent of Andy: Andy helps to prisoners, guardians and the warden. - The destiny of Brooks Hatlen: After 50 years in prison, Brooks leaves prison but he must face the new world. - The prison's library: Andy builds a better library in the Shawshank prison. - The Tommy's story: Andy decides to help Tommy, a new prisoner, and he will help to Andy. - The descent of Andy: Andy have problems with the warden so all needs hope. - Andy gets his freedom: Andy gets his liberty and 'Red' tell us how he did it. - 'Red' gets his freedom: 'Red' gets his liberty but he must fulfill a promise. However, the story is very fluid, so anybody could enjoy the story in all moment.The most powerful scene in the film is when finally Andy gets his freedom and he celebrates in the rain, because it represents the triumph of hope after many years, furthermore the soundtrack is excellent in that moment.Along of film, there are important sentences that invite to reflecting: - Get busy living, or get busy dying. - Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. - Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free (This sentence not appears in the film, but it is important for explain the story).This film is the best and more people must know this masterpiece of the cinema story.",10,0,0,8 June 2017
