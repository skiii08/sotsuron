The Ring," The Ring - New Definition of Horror (Minor Spoilers)
","Do you want to see a horror movie filled with gore, blood, sex, and swearing!? Well ... don't watch this movie. This movie amazed me because of it's originality. While other movies are coming out like 'Freddy vs. Jason' and 'Jeepers Creepers' which are partially scary only because of their gore content, 'The Ring' probably took a risk by coming out in the midst of these movies. The basis of the movie revolves around an urban legend about a video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it. The video is a mix of horrifying clips of various things -- a woman jumping off of a cliff, a nail through the finger, dead animals -- and as soon as the video ends you get a mysterious phone call. 'Seven days,' the person says at the other end, and soon enough, at the end of the seventh day, you unexplainably die. A newspaper reporter's niece suddenly dies and rumors are going around it's because of this 'killer video tape'. She tries to unravel this mystery and ends up watching the tape herself. She tries to figure out how to undo the video tape's 'curse'. As the movie goes along there are very scary parts, and overall the movie has a spooky feel to it. 10 out of 10!",10,1,2,30 December 2004
