Ford v Ferrari," Not a comic book movie
",Great to see a well done movie that isn't based on a comic book-keep them coming Hollywood. Thanks.,8,0,2,27 November 2019
Knives Out," Stylish and Very Stupid
","The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey.",4,187,360,1 December 2019
The Irishman," Ridiculous
",Maybe my experience was tainted by having read the book this movie was based on-I Heard You Paint Houses (which was a great read)-but this thing was just sad all around. The main character was this huge (like 6.6 250) tough as nails Irishman who basically could beat up just about anybody in a streetfight. Hoffa himself was short but very strong and tough. Having these two guys both in their mid 70s playing these guys as younger men was absurd-in one scene Frank (the Irishman) meets Buffalino when he is like 19 or 20-Russell helps fix his car-De Niro looks like a guy in his late 70s with a weird face-he doesn't move at all like an athletic 20 year old guy. Anyway the whole movie is like that-it just seemed ridiculous-especially when you consider Scorcese had the budget to get a proper cast and do a proper movie.,4,1,3,5 May 2020
Sinister," Lack of internal logic is a problem
","SINISTER wasn't terrible but certainly was a disappointment as the trailer looked quite promising. IMO the basic problem with the film was the lack of a plausible internal logic. Example: SPOILER ALERT: A true crime novelist (Hawke) moves into a house which was the location for a gruesome mass murder of the previous owners and the subject for his next book (his wife is unaware of and definitely not in favour of this). Anyway, they move into this empty house and Hawke finds in the attic a box of Super 8 home movies detailing not only that mass murder but many others, all shot by the killer. The same guy who left Hawke a box of these films also left about 6 copies of Hawke's biggest selling book in the attic. Hawke does not feel threatened in any way by this,does not think he or his family is in any danger. Imagine if a serial killer had left you this evidence in your house and obviously knows who you are and what you have been up to. Hawke doesn't notify anyone or even think it is a problem in any way-from there things get worse for Hawke but you have already disconnected from the whole thing.",6,1,2,26 October 2012
Joker," Mixed Bag
","Good-outstanding visuals and direction-a few great scenes.
Bad-this movie is a poorly structured remake of Taxi Driver-basically a what if premise-what if Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver became the Joker. Great comic book villains or movie villains in general all have superior abilities-this Joker while evil and violent is rather deficient in intelligence which lessens the the experience. So if you love the movie Taxi Driver you will love this movie. If not, you won't.",6,1,2,9 October 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," You have got to be kidding-what a mess
","Quite an achievement to make a film as filled with sex and drugs as this one and this BORING. Yes, if you are 13 years old you will likely enjoy this flick because your parents probably don't want you to see it and it is 'forbidden fruit', but there aren't many adults left in North America that haven't seen this exploitation garbage done a lot better countless times. As for the promised 'comedy', this simply isn't funny at all-some were forcing laughs in the theatre I was in but EASTBOUND AND DOWN or SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA it sure ain't. Major disappointment all around. How exactly is Jonah Hill in so many movies-the guy literally has no business in front of a camera at all. As for De Caprio's big 'Oscar' performance-at no time at all during this film did I for even two seconds believe De Caprio as Jordan Belfort. Jeez.",4,24,49,2 January 2014
Parasite," Lots of Hype
",Prepare for a big letdown if you fall for all the hype on this one-long and slow and extremely pointless and downbeat. Avoid.,4,5,11,27 February 2020
