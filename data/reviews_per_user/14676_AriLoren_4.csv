50 First Dates," Profound
","This movie goes beyond any other expectation of love.I never would have imagined a story so well portrayed.It's funny and shows how love takes us to greater strengths to show those we love most.Definitely recommend this movie.It has it's off moments that makes me say 'what in the world were they thinking?', but overall I give it a 10. Made me cry like a baby in the end no matter the times I've seen it.If we all went the extra mile for a love one as in here, more marriages would last.",10,23,27,5 April 2011
Lone Survivor," BEST FILM FOR ALL TIMES
","The length humanity goes to protect others is mind boggling. I loved the entire movie. To know that based on the decisions they made their entire life were changed forever. The events that transpire after are shockingly unbelievable but true. I feel for those lives lost in battle. Truly a remarkable movie that should be watched by all.

Cast Away," Phenomenal!
","I had already watched this movie years ago, but I have a bad memory, and because of a book that I recently read, made me want to watch this movie again. I loved the movie from beginning to end. I was crying my eyes out by the time I reached the end.This story is brilliant, and all of the effort that Tom Hanks puts into this movie is just phenomenal. No words to express how well created this movie was, and how everything seemed realistic. From the cut on his leg from the corral, to his losing weight, having his beard and hair grow out. I am just breathless. No matter how devastating it ended, it was just perfect because it made the story more realistic.The tragedy of that plane crash, to him trying to survive in that island without the most important thing, emergency supplies, and any company but Wilson, a ball. The story was just magnificent overall. By far one of the best films out there.",10,0,0,10 September 2012
Joker," JOAQUIN DID IT AGAIN!
","Superb story line, performance, graphics, and setting. The Joker was not a movie I wanted to see, and once I started to watch it, I was completely in love with it. You can never go wrong with Joaquin, hence the reason I watched the movie.",10,1,2,15 March 2020
