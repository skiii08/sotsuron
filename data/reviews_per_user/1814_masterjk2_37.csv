Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Hook line and sinker
","The first 'Holmes' was well made and hooked us into this travesty. I realize that movie makers think that they have to cater to 14 year olds. We're many times that age and we don't need, fancy special effects to make the movie enjoyable. The first half was merely a video game with the depth of a trout pond. The second actually came alive with some real dialogue and even a dash of substance, like Die Forelle, classical music which madmen have been happy to obsess about since talkies came into being. Then the added Don Giovanni, beautifully staged for more musical color. Not there is anything wrong with Hans Zimmer's score. That was the highlight of this movie. To have such well tuned actors as Law and Downey acting more like Bugs Bunny and Mr Magoo than the real talents they are is sad. And it will probably only get worse. Those of us who enjoy fine acting and a credible plot will simply stop going, leaving the audience to an ever attenuating adolescence which is happy with lots of booms and little brilliant dialogue. Sad.",4,2,4,8 July 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Dreadful
","So I've seen all of them... not sure why but I did enjoy the first one. From there it was mostly downhill, except the last was OK too. #2 and #3 we OK, but lacked the verve the first one had... the imagination. After that it's just a cat and dog fight amongst the adversaries. Rosenberg has written the screenplay for all of them and except for the first has shown little true talent. The plots are pedestrian and hackneyed for the most part--- passing for fair daytime soaps, barely. But I like the cast; several have good acting skills. But Dawn One reminded me of the old Star Trek series when the actors all get together on the enterprise and sit around staring at each other wondering when the plot is going to start. But she's got millions of suckers, who fall for this stuff. Most of the movies have grossed about $300M on budgets of $100M or less. Imagine what they could have done with a talented writer!",4,5,7,5 May 2013
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Nowhere
","I gave this a gratuitous '3' for Good Cinematography, Good Acting and Good Score. The rest was drek. Has anyone ever heard of a plot? I don't think the screenwriters had. Who in his right mind would try and transport this very dangerous criminal across Arizona just wearing a pair of dangling handcuffs? Nobody is that dumb, except for screen writers. Then after he kills Tucker with a fork (!), he's still allowed to ride along with his courtesy cuffs on. So he pulls a gun and kills another man. This seesaw back and forth continues for the whole interminable movie... we'll throw away the handcuff key, now be a good boy.... bam bam bam... more are dead. Then when he decides to help our hapless hero transport himself to the prison train ??? all sense of reality is gone. This evil man suddenly sees Jesus and repents? And then when he gets into the prison car all by himself, well all I can say is it's a good thing the damn movie was over for I would have thrown a shoe trough the screen if it got any sillier. All you people who raved about it need to return to reality. This is some sort of Disneyland fantasy-land nonsense. Truy Awful!",3,9,15,18 March 2009
Marie Antoinette," Vapid Versailles
","This was, without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring would be a compliment. And the 'music' if you want to call it that, really distracted from what little thought there was behind this stinker. Having music of the 20th/21st century blaring at us part of the time was jarring. Why not Buicks pulling up to cart the royals away... TV in the bathroom... Disneyland on the grounds. Utterly stupid. When a sound track is effective, I can really be entranced by it. When it's this bad, I just want to scream. The acting was for stick people. The dialogue idiotic. The fountain pools had more depth. Nice costumes and they should be. That's where there was the only sign of life. It cost $40M to make and grossed 16M... lucky to get it. Truly dreadful!",1,5,8,27 November 2007
Spartacus," Spurtacus
","It moves with spurts of candor and lapses into ennui. I originally saw this movie with my Latin teacher. She was as unimpressed with much of it as I am today. At the time, I thought it wasn't bad. But I knew there were a lot of factually incorrect parts of the plot and characters. That's a needless flaw. I just saw the longer version on cable tonight. Loved the gay sex scene (implied) between Olivier and Curtis. WAAAAy ahead of its time.... and didn't make it in 1960. Although the opening scenes up through the revolt are reasonably good along with the sets and the scenes of Rome pretty good, the movie then devolves into a sort of Roman Westward Ho. There are so many factual errors, not to mention the psychology of the characters being more 20th century than 1st BC. It's a grand spectacle, but unfortunately mostly filled with hot air. A great cast of course with Laughton, Olivier and even Douglas... plus the ever conniving Ustinov. Jean Simmons looks like she's just waiting for the 4:05 express bus to Burbank, most of the time. I did like it that a Jew wrote the book at a time when he was oppressed in America and another Jew played the main character who was being oppressed... a lot of symmetry there.",5,11,21,11 September 2007
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abe-bismal
","What a stinker. I guess the ones who wrote rave reviews took time out from reading Marvel comics and playing videos games to see the real life of Abe. I don't think I've seen a dumber movie in some time. Not only is the basic history completely wrong, the plot is about as believable as Alice in Wonderland. Now there was a drama! Alternate realities are OK if that have some sense of sensibility. Abe the magic axe wielder is not. I watch In True blood and the whole Dawn series and enjoy them. But when you try to mix a real persona with a fantasy, you had better do a lot better than this. And of course they had to have a 'chase scene.' They chose horses. Very dramatic. :-( Love the part where the vampire throws a horse on top of Abe and he just keeps coming. Any idea how much a horse weighs? If one falls on you, you won't be getting up.As for the phony train sequence, seen that done that before. I guess if your 10 years old, this passes for drama. Too bad they couldn't squeeze in Big Bird as a vampire gobbler.",3,0,2,22 May 2013
World War Z," Brad to the rescue
","Brad Pitt has become more than just a pretty boy. He can involve you so you care what happens to him. That's what saved this movie from being just another Zombie Walking flick. The writing was pretty mediocre from so many standpoints. The opening scenes are good except it certainly takes Brad and family long to run. If everyone is running away from something, is that not a good time to start running also as opposed to dawdling around waiting to interview someone? But it was scary. The scene in Jerusalem was very well done, even if obviously CGIed. Who knew Zombies could swarm and plan like bees? The plane scene is good also. The bicycles to the military plane seem stupid. And the chase down the WHO hallways seems, ludicrous. They sent Murielle to Nova Scotia... Oh No. Not Nova Scotia. That seemed lame. It's worth the watch, but no classic. But the film has its moments.",6,0,0,19 May 2014
The 13th Warrior," Beobarf
","Well, it has nice scenery. That's it for the good news. The acting was transparent. Oh sure, it's a time when men were men and women were... vassals and plots were optional. But nothing is properly developed. We are taken down one road to develop a character or plot line only to have it dead end. Then there's all the hooey. The burning worm is nothing more than a bunch of men carrying torches. Gee, the locals couldn't work that out? The marauders aren't really demons, they're men dressed up in bear costumes. And the evil 'mother', looks more like an escapee from a Rave, high on crystal. She dips her fangnail into a bowl of black goo...ooh scary! Crichton can be a good story teller, sometimes. But this was more like a retelling of Beowulf as visualized by the Smerfs. Poor.",4,1,2,21 June 2007
The Secret in Their Eyes," Brilliant
","I watch a movie almost every night after I work on computers. Most are drivel like Eat Love & Pray it's over(Julia's worst effort) or Hereafter which made me think Eastwood should be out to pasture. But this movie was genuinely brilliant. Great acting, complex and humanly believable plot and very fine directing. It should have gotten an Academy Award for Best foreign flick, but, oh, of course, one scene shows a vagina and another one the miscreant pulls out his penis to show his verbal adversary how big it is. WAAAAY to provocative for American audiences who think nothing of watching people being murdered violently, but god forbid any genitals should be shown. The tempo of the movie was perfect, never once letting me look at the time to wonder, 'how much longer does this drag on? Bravo",9,1,2,23 May 2011
Troy," Ain't history grand?
","Or so Wolfgang would have us believe, even with his diminution of the larger than life characters of the Iliad. The theory being, let the characters act like every day 'joes' from As the World Turns but make the sets ever so grand. As for the accuracy of the epic as written by 'Homer,' why bother? Hollywood can do it better. Never mind that Achilles' lover was Patroclus, not his cousin, which would better explain why Achilles' anger at his loss was white hot and his grief inconsolable.Pitt looks good, if not believable. What's with all the self psychoanalyzing? This isn't Ibsen. It's Homer. Gods are gods and men are men. Even demi-gods don't go through life analyzing themselves. They just do what they want. They're heroes, after all.The sets were nice--- very deMillean. But the dialogue??? Surely if they could do a fair job of Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis, someone could have done better with Homer's Iliad. In fact, although I translated all of my Homer from Latin (never took Greek), I'm sure that even Cliff's notes did better.It's strange that a story that has been revered and admired for almost 3000 years still isn't good enough for the maven scriptwriters and directors of Hollywood. However, I hazard a guess this movie will not be remembered for 30 years, let alone 3000.After watching this movie a second time, I have to admire Pitt more. His Achilles is Homeric in many respects...more than the screenplay. But what is striking is his performance in the battle scenes. He exhibits incredible grace or was this something they could do with special effects? I know now what I want, 7 years later. I want HBO to attack the Iliad with the same gusto they produced Rome. The Iliad needs far more time for character development than 2+ hours. It would make a wonderful 10 segment story and could be treated with the respect it deserves. Not this comic book synopsis (which is grossly inaccurate.)",5,0,3,25 January 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," At Wits End
","If I could just rate Johnny Depp, I'd probably give it an '8', but I can't. He was the one decent thing about this mishmash. A plot would have been nice. Instead we're given 10 or so pinballs that are bounced from one bouncing situation to another to a hole to another flipper... they veer off in some direction... unknown to the director, or even the writers. Just play it by the seat of your pants. There are no rules, no plot, no real characters... just a phenomenal amount of special effects. It was good for the 'actors.' No dialogue to learn... just make it up as you go along. Depp is amusing, and acts as though he's rum soaked through out the entire, incredibly long movie. But maybe he was, thinking, 'Oh, well, it's big bucks in the bank even though the parrot has the best lines.' And don't forget the cute little monkey, everyone's favorite... everyone under 5.There's nothing wrong with movies like this. And the special effects are special. But it could have been more. The first one was very pleasing. The second less so. And the 3rd, interminable.More and more movies are made for those under 16. I'm over 3X that. But even at 16, I think I would have found this movie boring, as they go for one more sword fight, one more brawl, one more sinking ship, one more Johnny Depp reproducing endlessly. One more dead person coming back to life and killing someone who had been previously alive. There are no rules. If you were a ship's plank a few minutes before, extricate yourself and tell your tale of woe, or kill someone who is supposedly unkillable.Although some may like the music, I merely found most of it repetitious, consciously so.Did I say I don't much care for this animation? Ooops, I'm repeating myself. Must have been inspired by the flick.",5,2,3,24 May 2008
Closer," Slick Shtick
","Mike Nichols has taken a work of dubious value and turned it into something that shimmers at times with brilliance. But the brilliance comes from the directing and the acting. Not the writing. There is the shtick of fast forwarding everything so that we progress through 4 years of time, effortlessly and without the entanglements of life, only their conflicts. There is the shtick of using Cosi Fan Tutti in the background, reminding us that such parlor room farces have been popular for centuries. And there is the shtick of 4 card pick up at every re-entering of the 'now.' Each time we have to sort out who is with whom this time, as those cards had merely been tossed into the air and fell down this way or that. The dialog is witty, a few times. Verbose always. Animated always. And comes in short staccato bursts, like machine gun fire--- or more like the lob of a tennis ball over a net of neutrality. Larry: So Anna tell me your bloke wrote a book. Any good? (lob) Alice: Of course. (return) Larry: It's about you isn't it? (lob) Alice: Some of me. (return) Larry: Oh? What did he leave out? (lob) Alice: The truth. (return) I don't believe that mature, intelligent people talk this way. They may if they see enough movies like this one where life once again imitates art. It's cute. It's meant to be funny. It's e/mail talk. The most worrisome aspect of this movie is that many people seem to relate to it. That's not a compliment to the movie- it's a sad comment upon our society. These people bounce from one another like balls in a pin ball machine, being hit by a paddle of emotion which inexorably forces them into the arms of another. I have no doubt that many people live such lives, but it's sad. Each professes love for the other, at some point, but has no concept of what loving someone means. Part of having a loving relationship is devoting so much time and energy to that relationship it becomes the most important thing in your life. These people are all so wrapped up in themselves they really don't have the ability to love. There is nothing wrong with writing a screenplay about such people as long as the audience understands that you are not displaying it as a model for life, but rather offering a moral that this lifestyle is only self destructive. This movie doesn't do that. We are left with one relationship which is broken but the other seems to survive through pure inertia. The final shtick of Dan's discovery that Alice Ayers is not really Alice Ayers, thus denoting that their whole relationship had been a lie from the beginning, is an amusing, if not silly twist. How could someone from the USA get jobs and live in the UK and never divulge her real name? They've lived together for almost 4 years, off and on. It's more pleasing when plots make sense.",6,1,1,27 November 2005
Gone Baby Gone," Gone, just gone
","There are two aspects to this movie... the posing of a serious moral dilemma with a complicated, seriously flawed plot. The goal, to propose the dilemma could have been presented without the flaws, which would have made a much better movie, but not one where everyone left saying, 'Gee, I never had it figured out.' Of course you didn't. We all work within the basis of our human experience. And when people do things in movies which are against self interest but advance a plot to confuse us, I call that mere trickery.First, the plot errors. The reason no one could logically figure out 'who done it' is that so many people do things which people just don't do. The first was the brother in law... the one who helped set up the whole scheme in the first place. He overheard the conversation which set up the heist of the money from the robbers of the drug dealer. OK, that's fine, except why in the world would he go with his wife to our intrepid detectives to hire them to discover what he had done. Or if that seems believable do you think anyone would volunteer his pension to be discovered? He could have just gone as a bump on the log. But no, he wants to get caught? Then when the Deadly Duo go to the cops with what they've found out about the druggie mom, the cops act surprised... fine they should be. But when they go to question her, they really grill her until she snaps. They could have asked a few polite questions (or without such vigor) and left. But no, they yell and scream at her until they get the truth. Did they forget they don't want the truth? And then the whole charade with Morgan Freeman and the recorded phone call. Sure they want the suckers (the detectives) to be witnesses to their Comedy Francaise, but all they would have to have done would present a phony note, or just say there was a conversation which got back to the top cop and they were meeting the coco loco drug dealer to get the girl back. No! Top cop wants to get caught too. And is. Plots like this are merely designed to fool us, the watcher. No thanks. The writers felt this is necessary in order to set up the moral dilemma... is it best to return the poor little girl to her addicted mom and a life of poverty and abuse or leave her with Morgan Freeman, to be reared 'happily' away from her neglecting mother. Affleck's character decides, correctly, that she must be returned and the perpetrators of all these crimes, if not already dead, imprisoned. This is not decision for the benefit of the little girl. It is a decision for the benefit of society. If everyone just went around deciding whom to kill, whom to rob, whose children to take away, we would live in a world of more chaos than we already do. So we can thank the writers for at least posing a serious question of morality. But they could have done it ever so much more honestly.",5,5,8,26 July 2008
Oblivion," Were we so lucky
","I gave it a '4' since it had a beginning and end (2 points) a middle (1 point) and some lovely blue skies (5 points) I deducted 2 points for stupid plot and another 2 points for poor video game. This movie has little to offer unless you have never seen a movie before, or a video game. Most of the action was a video game which is fine if you're 12. I'm about 5 times that. The acting was stone face or 'awk' surprised. In it's favor it wasn't 4 hours long. But is was over 2 hours long and that's about 110 minutes too long for this movie. The screenwriter obviously thought he had come up with some brilliant ideas. A mish mash of many others ideas is what we have. If you haven't figured out the entire plot in about 20 minutes... sorry you're a bit slow. 'Oblivion'... that's where this turkey should rest. I noted that in this country, it bombed. But worldwide, it was a hit. Of course, many of these countries are just now getting their first movie projector. it's a whole new world. Can hardly wait for 'Oblivion', the book.",4,2,5,15 January 2014
The Matrix Revolutions," Pseudo movie
","I'm sure this appeals to a generation so wrapped up in video games that they only want to see more of that when they go to movies. But this is barely more than a video game. It has pseudo-acting, pseudo-philosophy, pseudo-science and a pseudo-plot. It surely couldn't have interested anyone past the age of 25. The first two of this 'trilogy'...really more like a puzzle with 3 parts, none standing alone but when put together does at least form a whole...were more 'real' and interesting. But strip away the mumbo-jumbo and what we're left with is a lot of people wandering around looking like they are on massive doses of thorazine, amusing machines that look like they came from the old Star Wars trilogy and antiquated ideas of what weapons of the XXX century will probably be like (the idea that they will be firing bullets, nothing more than hot lead, at these futuristic all-devouring machines is truly silly science.) In fact there is not one thing that is believable ...maybe that appeals to adolescents, but to anyone who has seriously thought about the future, one would hope they would have developed more imaginative weapons, better speaking skills, better ability to emote and lead lives that have more meaning. This is barely a 5 out of 10.",Null,3,6,17 November 2004
28 Weeks Later," Blair Ditch Project
","At first, I was appalled at how bad this piece of tripe was. Then I finally got it. As the camera jerked from one scene to another and the music swelled to make sure that we knew something horrific was happening (in case we hadn't noticed heads flying off), I was reminded of the Blair Witch Project, another paean to hurky jerky movie making. Then I got it. This movie was released only a few days before Tony Blair left office. This was a subtle (well, not not subtle, maybe) vision of what GB would be Post Blair. A brilliant satire. But did anyone get it? No one could take this incredibly inept piece of nonsense seriously. But how was one to take it, then? The answer? Laugh hilariously. As people chew each other up, pass the popcorn. When they burn up all the survivors, yell out, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' When the few actors who are not infected try to act terrified, yell 'Ooooh, scary.' I suppose the current movie going generation, apparently under 17, has never heard of George Romero. They may think all of this gore is a new vision, or think gore has only to do with global warming. George did it much better in every one of his movies and they aren't brilliant... just good. But compared to this nonsense, Romero's movies are the Sistene Chapel compared to finger painting. Hopefully, even though this movie seems to have pleased some, we will be spared anymore efforts from this promoter of sensationalistic blood and guts in which the guts of the movie are constantly spilling out of hapless victims. That's a plot that's just a lot of rot.",2,1,2,8 May 2008
Knowing," Know-Nothing
","This might have been a good movie a one point, but it didn't turn out that way. Plausibility is nice, even is Science Fiction. In order for a plat to have viability, there must be a logical progression. Up to a point, there was. But then we discovered that the sum of all efforts in this movie is Zed...Nada... Zilch. Cage can run around tracking upcoming disasters all he wants but it just doesn't matter. In the grand scheme of things, he too is a Zero. If he had stayed at home brooding about the unfortunate death of his wife, drinking and watched the news, the result would have been the same: The Mysterioso Men would have whisked his son and the heroine's child off in their flying artichoke and everyone on Earth would have still become crispy critters. That's just too much for me. If all is foreordained no matter what you do, then don't bother. Watching someone in this exercise of utter futility is not entertaining, at least for me. Camera work and special effects were good. Cage was Cage- a Shakespearean actor hopeful who talks to an imaginary Horatio, even when asking for directions. I gave it a five because they tried. Anything higher would imply they succeeded.",5,0,1,26 December 2010
American Beauty," Perfection
","I don't know how many times I've watched this movie. Seven, at least. Probably once a year since it came out. The first time I saw it, I realized I had seen something profound... that's very, very rare. Not only is the story line engrossing, but so are all of the performances. There is not one weak link. But it is the dialog which drives the movie, as it should for people who want to think. No car chases, cats jumping out of closets, animated space ships with wooden characters or people riding brooms. Just words...words which lead to cataclysmic consequences for our protagonist. It's the way of the world. Words are what drive our lives in whatever direction we choose, if we're lucky or doom us if we're not. The wonderful irony of this movie, besides all its other attributes, is that Burnham is executed (for that's what it is) not for any of his foibles, nor his confronting his wife for her vapid existence or confronting her for her infidelity, nor for his romancing what surely must be an underage cheer leader, nor for the hatred professed by his daughter toward him, nor for blackmailing his employer... no he's killed because the father of the next door boy thinks he's gay and finally confronts his own homosexuality, makes advances to Burnham, is rebuffed and can't handle it.",10,0,1,25 February 2007
Quantum of Solace," Not Bond
","It only gets a '4' because Craig is so good. But really, just one chase scene after another? Perhaps 'Run Rabbit Run' would have been more appropriate, only he's deadly. There is little of the panache of many of the previous Bonds. No regulars, except 'M', which stands for muddled... never knowing whether to praise him or have him killed. No Q No Moneypenny No sexNo interest.Just Jason Bond... action hero... In fact a Marvel of one. I've seen so much of this tripe of fast car, fast boat, fast plane, fast foot chases that I'm bored with it. Sure, it's well done (better than the almost non existent dialogue) but it's boring. Nice scenery.Too bad. could have been good, I think, with a screenwriter.",4,17,24,17 April 2010
District 9," Drivel
","Although Peter Jackson is a talented man, his talent was clearly subsumed by moronity. But have to give the progenitors of this nonsense credit, it's an audience pleaser, if you're under 20. The lead actor was good. The animation was OK, but hardly original. It was a combination of Transformers and Dead Man's Chest, both superior to this attempt. And the music was a limp attempt to copy Hans Zimmer. The biggest problem? The immaturity of the whole thing. I don't need to see ANOTHER movie with mechanical creatures, mechanical acting and a mechanical plot probably written by a computer. People who have allowed computers to become their promary mode of communication and have little true interaction with other human beings, except on Facebook may think this is great writing. It's not. I see that the movie got a very high rating. If it's a rating based on Video game plots, acting and 'human' emotions, fine. If it's based on an art form which really represents the classic elements of great writing, it's woefully lacking. I gave it 3 stars for the prawns, who seemed more 'human' than the humans.",3,7,14,8 October 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Planet of the Dopes
","WOW! This movie grossed almost half a billion dollars? No wonder I seldom go out instead watching this stuff on our 70' screen at home for free. Would I have felt like a monkey if I had paid for this sentimental piece of treacle. It started out OK. Pretty good and of course Lithgow playing the dottering old fool was believable. It progressed well until we got into the hackneyed monkey versus keeper scenario, with Brian Cox trying his best to make a totally forgettable role...interesting. The gorilla had a better part. Everything after that became totally predicable. I guess modern audiences don't need a real plot. A lovable creature, a kind master, a dash of romance between the humans, a car chase or two...throw in a helicopter and you'll take off. Really this was pretty pathetic. Franco tried; Caesar tried; even the proboscis monkey tried. It was hopeless. Too muddled. As for the shoot off plot about creating a world pandemic, don't tell me Caesar comes back and invents a cure...PLEASE. PS. Lovely redwoods. Used to go to Muir woods often.",5,1,6,16 September 2012
I Am Legend," 'I am...pitiful'
","What a mishmash of nonsense. Any of these people raving (like then zombies?) about this absolute piece of garbage ever seen a sci-fi flick before? Omega Man? Last man on earth? Anything? Vincent Price was amusing as the Last Man on Earth and the movie had a wonderful macabre sense to it. Heston was Heston (in Omega Man)... good fighting evil, as only Heston could do, vampires trying to wrench that gun out of his hand (and crosses too). They were survivors, each in his own way.Poor Will Smith's character, Neville, is just plain stupid, and he's supposed to be a brilliant scientist. Have you ever known a brilliant scientist? I have. They aren't dumb. They wouldn't go racing up and down deserted streets at 80 miles an hour in a sports car because they would be afraid something bad might happen... and then who would help? If he wanted to shoot some game for dinner, surely a stroll in Central Park would yield something.The first major flaw was the death of Sam, his only companion. I knew it would happen. Poor writers always create a bond between man and animal and then kill off the animal to create pathos. But their act of scribbling only created bathos and my desire to turn of the set. You see, they knew they could get away with killing off a 'mere' German shepherd. If they had given him a child to care for and to nurture, and then slaughtered it off, the audience might have revolted. But a dog? Oh well... for most. Not me. It created instant enmity. I struggled on to see how much worse it would get. I wasn't disappointed:Anime monsters to create the illusion that Neville is in the battle of his life with video games. Ugh.But then, comic relief... unintentional. A heroine arrives (you knew she would. That's why they killed off the poor dog.) She's heard his pleading broadcasts and has made a detour on her way to Vermont to see the Big Apple... the scribblers fail to tell us how she accomplished that feat in a mere car since all the bridges have been blown, but hey, if you've made it this far into this piece of utter nonsense, why start thinking now?She saves Neville's life, somehow. That's also unclear and inspires him to 'continue his work'... you know saving mankind with a cure for anime monsterism...that's the mankind of which he thinks he a party of one.Then there's the attack on the house, where infected humans (read animes) are shown to have developed super human powers (maybe they don't want to be cured... all they have to do is stay out of the sun and they are all Supermen.) Will of course, sacrifices himself in a blaze of glory... too bad they couldn't bring back the dog.And Anna of two days goes on her merry way to Vermont, magic potion to cure the world... all ten people... with her. She traverses the waters surrounding Manhattan in her Hop mobile once again, I guess.I'm a very demanding person, I know. I require a plot that makes sense. With writers like Protosevich and Goldsman you're SOL. No one could write this badly and have any talent. But I suppose we will be subjected to their tripe again since the movie was a hit... well, others may be... not I. I really can't stand anything this stupidly contrived. The only reviewers who liked the movie were New Yorkers and those who love NYC who marveled at the opening shots of weeds in the streets of NYC. It takes a lot more than that to get my admiration!",3,0,0,23 June 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Ultimately Drivel
","I gave it a 5 only because the lead actors were so good and the plot was reasonably good until it devolved into another silly car/motorcycle/foot chase. Hey, you can do this once. Not every damn movie. It's boring. The rest of the plot was plodding, but at least it had some structure, albeit trite. Then bring in the big names Albert Finney (unknown for anyone under 40, probably)- Scott Glenn, Joan Allen for their 2 minutes a piece to pretend it's a continuing saga. Then they sail off into the sunset? Mon Dieu, Bond did that a hell of lot better. Everything was set up to keep the Senate from hearing about the super secret program yet we only get 3 minutes of testimony and that's it?

Brilliantly conceived, well acted, wonderful love story and a bit of a mind twister, even if I did have it worked out about 1/2 through. That's OK when all the parts come together as they did in this work. There just isn't a weak spot. The Prince is princely and evil... we don't have to stretch our imaginations too far for that. The police are corrupt, until finally confronted with what they believe to be incontrovertible evidence. The heroine is beautiful, poised and determined to spend her life with the man she loves, even if it means self destruction. And our hero is a hero of epic proportions. Philip Glass's music, ever so improved from the '80s, is flawless also, if not a little distracting a few times. But like Hermann, he understands how to create tension when necessary and beauty with harmony when that fits the picture. The cinematography is truly remarkable, lending an air of a 19th century daguerreotype photography... with a faded patina, yet crisp, somehow. And the illusions...did I forget the illusions? Of course, we can, today, do so much with holograms. But this is the 19th century and the movie is good enough to make us believe that we are actually watching something in the 19th century. Thus, we are astounded. Watch the orange tree grow. It may not be the most spectacular of the illusions, but it is the most harmoniously perfect. Of course, anyone who loves Bergman will be reminded of 'Ansiktet', the Magician. The plot is different, but the reaction of the establishment is not...in fact almost identical. That also, was a great movie and I'm sure that Neil Burger was inspired by it. Bravo, is all I can say. If I had been in a theatre at the end I would have stood and applauded.",10,1,2,4 March 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Only 50 years ago.
","The events this movie portrays happened over 50 years ago... and yet they happen today again. As such the work is poignant. As a history lesson, for those who don't know history, it is extremely well done. As a movie, it is somewhat unfulfilling. There is no conclusion to the action. In order for this movie to have worked completely, it would have had to have focused upon McCarthy himself and show his downfall, partly caused by Murrow's heroic commentaries. As it is, we see Murrow's work and his valiant determination to stand up to the right wing demagoguery of the self serving McCarthy. McCarthyism is all around us today, making the movie apropos. Instead of communism, now it's terrorism...the republicans have to incite the masses to fight something. Of course, terrorism is real (and has been for decades.) But now they use it to incarcerate people without trial, send some to foreign countries for torture, declare war on countries to fatten the pockets of their favorite corporations and... as usual, accuse anyone who has a different point of view of being 'soft of terrorism.' They are just as reprehensible now as they were then. Unfortunately the ones who will watch this movie are the intelligent, the curious, the ones who already know there is a problem with our Big Brother govt. Those who voted for this regime and who still support it will challenge their minds with another cliff hanging episode of Wheel of Fortune, resolute in their knowledge that they are red blooded Americans.",8,0,0,21 April 2006
World Trade Center," populist pap
","6.5 the average? Please! This was a poor movie from beginning to end. Stone does have talent, but it attenuates by the year. And the drama queen Cage couldn't have been much worse. But this movie was merely meant to take advantage of peoples' emotions about a tragic event. It offered no insight and nothing but a lot of weeping and groaning. It was like watching CNN (for over 2 hours) asking someone whose baby has just been run over by a Mack truck, 'Do you think we should ban big trucks from the road?' Americans have to stop wallowing in self pity and move on. Yes, it was tragic. So are the thousands of lost their lives in Iraq for absolutely no reason other than the lies told to us by this duplicitous govt. (more American lives wasted there than WTC and over 50,000 Iraqi lives.) Truly tragic.",3,2,6,6 December 2007
National Treasure," National Treasure-Not
","One of the enjoyable things about the whole series of Potter movies (aside from superb casts) is that they are pure fantasy and no one would ever get confused and think they were anything but that. And then come along things like the Da Vinci Code and National Treasure which blur the line between facts and fiction so badly that many people may get confused. No, I'm not talking about the back of the Declaration of Independence... the thought that there is a secret map on the back was so silly that surely few would believe it was true. But the idea that the Knights Templar formed into the Free Masons is not true. The Templars were disbanded in the 13th century. Free Masonry did not come about until the 1700s. But this confusion was used for plot simplicity, allowing the signers of the Dec. of Ind., many of whom were Masons, suddenly be transformed into Knights Templar. Then they could hide the Templars' Treasure. The problem of this nonsense for me is since so many people don't read (or think) they may actually believe this is true. It's not! The Masonic Order is non-denominational. It avows belief in a Supreme Being, but no particular one. The Knights Templar were catholic monks who became warriors. The two groups couldn't be further from each other. So that turns the entire plot into utter drivel. And that matches the dialog, the acting, the car chases...etc. Another Bruckheimer crowd pleaser which has the depth of a puddle. In the past, crowd pleasers could have some body, even a message about life. The message in this one is, save your money. (Note: The sets and special effects of the 'Masonic Temple' underground were brilliantly executed, but not worth the wait.)",4,2,4,1 January 2007
Inside Man," Brilliant
","For me, Spike Lee is erratic. Sometimes brilliant, sometimes not. But this movie is a fine example of what he can be. However, it's not for everyone. Those who love 'action' movies, shoot 'em up, bang bangs will be disappointed, if not just plain hate it. It moves slowly. It has a labyrinthine plot. No money (from the bank) is stolen in a 'bank robbery.' You have to think. And worst of all, no one is killed in a hostage-hold up. Many will think, 'Where's the fun in that?' While having a lot of tension and seeming violence, there is really little real injury done to anyone. The most pain is delivered by the police shooting the innocent bystanders with rubber bullets. But look at what happens...what the results of this story are: The robbers, who turn out to be the good guys (or as good as you can be when you're robbing a bank). They are rewarded with a fortune. The paragon of virtue, the Bank owner, turns out to be the bad guy and is exposed for what he is... a monster. Our hero, the detective, is promoted, cleared of erroneous, felonious charges and ends up with a fabulous diamond with which he can propose marriage. In other words, this is a truly perceptive, ingenious parody of American 'gansta' movies. It parodies all the senseless violence we are usually subjected to and predictable plots. It parodies all the normal 'good guys' versus 'bad guys.' It even has a moral. Although there is little violence perpetrated by the robbers, the most violent imagery is on a child's video game in which one 'brother' slaughters another by shooting him and blowing him up. The child finds this machinima amusing and believes that you must get the stash and 'Kill that nigga.' Later, when Washington's character asks the cop who reported the robbery in progress if he's ever had a gun stuck in his face before, he responds, 'Yes, by a 12 year old. He shot me in the chest.' The juxtaposition of the faux robbery in progress with its lack of genuine violence is played off of the inhumanity of the child's game and the fact that the only time the officer has been shot was by a child. Lee's robbers are genteel. But in the real world, we teach children not to feel. Truly a remarkable movie...the camera work, the taut tale, the irony, the acting... Bravo.",7,1,2,28 April 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Da Vinci Drivel
","LOTS OF SPOILERS! With all the hoopla, I was actually tempted to go and see this movie in a theatre, as opposed to waiting until it came to my own 60' screen. I'm glad I waited. I could have waited longer. What a mess! Let's start with the good part... the locations: Great shots of the Louvre;Belvoir Castle; Eglise Saint-Sulpice; Château de Villette; Lincoln Cathedral;Rosslyn Chapel;Temple Church;Westminster Abbey; not to mention great locations like London, Paris, Malta, Scotland, many other parts of England and France. That's it. That's all the good news, except for Ian McKellen, who did as fine a job as anyone could to make his role seem plausible, although I always like Jean Reno and Alfred Molina for their work... wasted on this movie. I didn't bother to read the book. I like my history factual, not conjectural. Hopefully, it made more sense than the movie. And if it caused anyone to examine his belief in the apotheosis of Jesus, good for it. A good start for this work would have been good dialog. It didn't have it. The actors mouth the words, but they aren't believable, but since the dialog isn't either, that's all you could expect. And the plot! I don't mind Byzantine plots, but in the end, they have to make sense. This whole thing revolves around the catholic church's obsession with not letting anyone know that Jesus had a child with Mary Magdalene. OK, so I can believe that. They've been paranoid about the truth for millennia. But who can believe bishops that reveal the supposed secrets of the confessional, running around with $10M in bearer bonds, hiring assassins, bungling attempts to find the thingamabob? Ludicrous. Police officers who go around beating up people for no reason, fall for the old toss the homing device out of the window-trick- and chase a dump truck like keystone cops-bank managers who wait for 20 years for someone to come and use a magic key...etc. The explanation of 'The Last Supper' and the 'V' between Jesus and Mary representing the Holy Grail, and being a representation of a woman's vagina was laughable. I had to wonder how many takes it took to get through that scene before McKellen could finish without bursting into laughter. In the end, any bright person could have found the crypt of Mary Magdalene without the secret map hidden in the thingamabob with the cryptic message. It made all the chasing, hiding, people shot, money wasted, deciphering...pointless. It reminded me of when I was a child and had to send off for a secret decoder ring in order to understand the secret message from Captian Midnight's show on TV. When I got it, it was useless. So was this movie. What a mess!",4,2,4,30 December 2006
The Happening," The Happening-Not
","Shyamalan has talent, but it's undeveloped. He tells a story as though he were a father telling his son a bed time story... in his case always about the boogie man. He sets it up brilliantly, creates tension masterfully and then, like a father who just wants to get the story over and leave the room, he fumbles badly. We are not children and our eyes are still open when he exits, no satisfactory plot conclusion or denouement in hand. He starts out the story wonderfully, immediately creating tension with the people in Central Park stopping and then going crazy. Then the falling bodies from a building. Then the panic. And then...not much. I won't bother analyzing the dialogue which seems sophomoric, often or the clear plot errors. But no matter what else plants might do, including releasing deadly toxins, they don't make wind storms. They just don't, unless we're in the Lord of the Rings and the Ents are present. Trees don't sway their limbs at will and grasses don't wave in their own wind... etc. No only that, although some plants do know when they are being eaten and emit toxins to ward of predators, they don't sit down at a round table and talk to each other, the Elms to the crab grass to the foxglove to the mustard to the Willow and decide, with malefaction, to exterminate anything, let alone mankind. They might, a specie at a time, evolve to give off toxins in the air, but they wouldn't just turn them on and off like pesticide blowers, unless they are all controlled by some Hindu Hayagriva. And if there were some deadly toxin released and blown around magically, it certainly wouldn't have any trouble getting into a 150 year old house or shed.... windows open or shut. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's clear that Mr. Shyamalan needs a lot of help. He should come up with the ideas and maybe even direct. But he needs someone to write a screenplay that will make sense. Three years ago I complained about this man's lack of talent in writing the 6th Sense. The plot made no sense. Yes, it was a good mood piece, but it was designed to fool us, at all times and when you knew the ending, you knew that the plot made no sense. It's wasn't the 6th Sense... it was No Sense. But now others have seen that behind the curtain, there is no 'Ansiktet.'",5,0,2,12 October 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star schlock
","So let me be the naysayer, maybe the only one. This movie has the artistic merit of a poor comic book. But maybe that's what the audience wants. The dialogue is barely two dimensional. The characters, under apparent Gestalt therapy, discover in the end who is good and who is evil, for that is what all these movies are about. Yes, the special effects are special...they are especially good. But it seems that all of the writer's effects were designed to accommodate them. They drive the movie, not the dialogue or the people.Yes, it does answer a lot of questions about how the Imperial War started. I probably could have lived a happy life not knowing. The idea of a prequel is a tool best not used, frankly. I have yet to see it used successfully, but attempted so many times by film makers to milk another dollar out something popular. Although they didn't invent the device, they certainly have been the ones to exploit it to its worst ends.Maybe children are fascinated by such movies, but anyone who has had to experience life can hardly find this anything similar to it. Although Ian McDiarmid did try to deliver his lines with sagacity and evilness, if he saw himself flying about, upside down, round and round, he must have surely have burst out laughing as I did.Movies must present the verisimilitude of some reality, even if its one in the far distant future. The dialogue wasn't realistic. The characters were a mere pastiche. The acting was good for a high school play, but no more. The music was just more of the same and as unimaginative as the rest of the movie.The only good feature is that there surely won't be more of these chapters, for if I have to listen to Yoda yodel one more mangled sentence structure, scream I will.",3,1,4,4 June 2006
Shooter," On target
","This is a pretty well told story and since it disses the current buffoons running the govt., it got my approval. The storyline made sense most of the time even if I always find tedious these movies in which a mere human seems to be a superman... bullets fly all around Wahlberg but never hit him, except for the dufus cop at the first of the movie... and of course he actually missed because he was supposed to kill him. But, if you can forget all that and treat him like a Jason Bourne, the movie works and Wahlberg is almost as talented as Damon in the 'faster than a speeding bullet' arena. Just the right amount of evil coming from the FBI and the crooked Senator... not so much as to make them laughable and enough to make them a serious threat. If the movie has a fault it is that once again we see the system failing. We know who the crooks are, since we movie goers are omniscient, but no one is in real life... so the blow out at the Bozeman ranch (Bozeman never looked so good!) is excessive... but we accept it because we KNOW he's killing evil doers. Unfortunately, life is far more complex.",7,1,3,11 August 2008
Prometheus," dumb just dumb
","Surely it takes more than just a lot of very good special effects to make a movie. At least I think it does. This had probably the worst plot of any Sci Fi movie I've ever seen considering the amount of money wasted in making it. There wasn't one original. idea in it and they stole concepts from about every Sf movie made in the last 30 years. It starts with explorers finding a cave in Scotland in 2089, yet they look like they just stepped out of an LL Bean catalogue circa 2000. OK, move on. They have discovered wonderful hieroglyphics which point at the sky. They match others who point at the sky. From this pointing they deduce how to find the planet the aliens came from. Amazing. So a rich man funds the project and off they go. he sends a hologram in which he says he wants to help mankind and will soon be dead. Only the brain dead cannot see the plot coming... aliens found...alien secrets of life found... rich man gets eternal life. Hovering in the distance in is cold hearted daughter. They land and discover a large mound that's hollow and seem mysterious. Mysteriously, they leave their weapons at home and head out in a large craft that could hold 100 but only has 5 and trailed by two golf carts that hold four... this way they will be threatened more when the big storm comes. Hello...Ever seen Red Planet? A dead steal from that movie. They discover wonderful things and of course since everything in the world is just beautiful, don't worry about monsters or evil. Bowling pins start oozing goo, little things slither through the muck and become spitting cobras which kill and they find monster #1. Meantime they have to scurry back to the ship because a big storm is coming. One woman gets pregnant with an instant alien (think Alien movie), rips it out of herself, stitches herself up and goes back to battle. The movie title should have been Artemis. Meanwhile, David, (think HAL-2001 with a body) goes goofy. Mad wealthy man appears ON THE SHIP... big surprise. How many movies have had a wealthy man dash off into space to live forever? They all head back to Magic Mountain to find the one true alien. Like a sleeping Prince, they kiss him awake and he goes bananas... tossing them all aside and going to his giant console, like Quasimodo, playing a giant organ, bringing the ship to life. The unlucky scientists flee, trying to get off the ship. Our fierce captain tries to ram his ship into the other ship (think Independence day) and does. It goes down with all hands aboard, except the undaunted female scientist who escapes, finds another alien ship that she navigates with David, who is now bodiless, except for a head. She heads out to find the other Aliens and see if she can persuade them into helping mankind...HAHAHAHA. Of course, on board is another alien, think Alien. The sequel will feature Segorney Weaver. Mein Gott! alien, think Alien. The sequel will feature Segorney Weaver. Mein Gott!",1,4,7,8 April 2013
1408," Utterly stupid
","Well, Cusack was good, most of the time. That ends the good news. For people who can't write, this was brilliant. Imagine, a dream world in which one never knows whether it's a dream or 'reality.' Such is the stuff of nightmares, particularly if you paid good money to see it. Plots, well written ones anyway, require some logic. This movie had none. A lot of special effects that were well done, but the director could have added anything and it would have been as logical as what he did add. A hodge podge of montages, with one silly thing after another. When things go creepy, there has to be some reason behind it. And when things happen, there needs to be a reason for that also. We see a lot of random things happen for no reason. So we're just supposed to sit back and take it. Ugh. True, there was no real gore and that beats movies at the other end of the scale which have nothing but. But a plot would have been nice...this endless hit in the head with a surf board, all a dream, all reality, all fantasy nonsense is for people with no real sense of good story telling. King should be ashamed to have allowed his name to be used in conjunction with this piece of tripe. Surely his short story was better written. If it wasn't, he better retire to the farm and milk cows, instead of money out of ridiculous plot lines.",2,1,2,29 December 2007
Signs," Shyamalan schmaltz
","Here is a man who could be a great writer/director but instead goes for the bucks and banality. He knows how to tell a tale. He knows how to create tension. He knows how to get the most from his actors. He doesn't know how to make the story make sense nor leave out the hyper sentimentality. Yes, he does know how to make money and that's what it's all about. I've seen most of his movies, usually leaving the theatre or my TV thinking, why wasn't that better? 'Signs' is clearly such a movie. He immediately grabs our attention with the 'signs' in the corn field and slowly feeds us more info, building tension all the way. When the 'martians' as I will call them, even though they undoubtedly came from billions of miles away, are playing cat and mouse, it's exciting. When more and more 'signs' show they are probably hostile, we continue to wonder what will happen. And then we find out. Nothing much. It is so utterly unbelievable that an advanced race, at least technologically, would come all the way to earth to 'harvest' us and walk around 'naked' on a planet with 70% water, when water kills them. Stupid. They would wear some protective costume. It's also unbelievable that they could come all that way with no weapons. Hostile creatures have weapons to destroy enemies. They didn't travel all the way to the Earth looking for better scenery. They came to conquer us, with what? Their bare hands? This is really a silly plot. We don't even see them attack anything. We just hear them rumbling around upstairs, like burglars who dropped by. Then they leave mysterious designs cut into the walls. OOOOH. Scary. Then the big confrontation with the eight fingered nudie. Phoenix conquers it with a baseball bat! It could have been Neanderthal vs. Homo Sapien. The subplot (main plot) about the self unfrocked minister and his rejection of god, is just lame. His wife is killed when she decides to go for a walk in the middle of the night along a highway. Surpirse! A truck hits her. Well, that is unlucky, but maybe it would be better to go for a walk on your vast farm. So Mel blames god. OK. Blame him for having a stupid president while you're at it. Then when his son might die from the secret poison gas of goofy the alien, he prays to god and god saves his son. Pretty fickle this god. So he returns to the cloth. Is this a plot or propaganda put out by the cathlolic church...or in his Night's case, the Episcolpal church? Oh well, it made money. Surely no one in his right conscious mind would accuse M. Night of being a great writer. There's just no logic to any of his work. But who needs that when you keep rolling away wheelbarrows of cash?",4,5,9,20 May 2007
The Sixth Sense," Silly Slickness
","For those who rank this movie is 'great' I have to wonder if they've ever seen a truly good mystery/supernatural movie in their lives before. The plot in this work is so uneven as to lose my attention all together. We are supposed to believe many things that simply don't make sense when you add them all up. Good mood piece-yes. Good plot-no. The acting was acceptable. The sets were good. The suspense, not bad. But a screenwriter has to do better than just 'trick' you. If there's going to be a twist, or lots of twists, fine. But make sure that they make sense. So many movie makers believe that if they can merely put together a piece with lots of twists and turns so the viewer can be fouled, they have succeeded. But it takes more than that. A lot more. Where's Satyajit Ray when you need him?",4,1,2,27 March 2005
The Great Gatsby," Soulless
","So much time was spent on the staging of the elaborate parties, which was well done, that there was little for the core of the plot... the three affairs, one with Nick and Jordan, totally ignored. Of course the movie can't cover everything and it did hit the high spots accurately, but there is no passion, only ersatz parties, which anachronistic music including 'rap' at one point is played. It's just poorly written. Fitzgerald's book had soul and vision of a society corrupted by greed. This movie seems to extol the value of greed, proving that 'all that glitters is not gold' as far as movie making goes. DiCaprio was good as was Maquire, but the women seem more like mannequins... perhaps echoing performances of silent screen stars of the 20s.",5,6,10,16 March 2014
