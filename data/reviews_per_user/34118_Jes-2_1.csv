Requiem for a Dream," I was blown away.
","After this film finished, I sat there for a minute thinking 'My God!'. This is a powerful film about the possible consequences of the use of drugs, both illegal and prescribed.What starts off as a relatively lighthearted, almost comical look at recreational drug users, meanders its way through people's lives towards a destructive end. Along the way, we see people given hope and something to look forward to before it is all wrenched away in the most brutal of fashions.Definitely a film to watch.",10,0,0,11 February 2001
