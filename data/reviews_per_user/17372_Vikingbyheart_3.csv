Train to Busan," A great horror action zombie film!
","Horror movies were never the same after the zombie trilogy by the director George Andrew Romero. In Night of the Living Dead (1968) we were presented to zombies who eat human flesh, a thriller mixing horror and social criticism. In the second film, Dawn of the Dead (1978), besides the social satire about paranoia and humanity to the brink of apocalypse, the movie explores the comic potential of zombies, especially black humor. We are the headless and cannibalistic beings who roam the cities. Closing the trilogy, Day of the Dead (1985) continues with the social criticism and the comic tone, but relies on a more depressive and gloomy scenario, apart from the use of graphic violence. Following the footsteps of George Romero we have the gore Braindead (1992), the horror 28 Days Later (2002) and Rec (2007), and in humor genre, Shaun of the Dead (2004), Zombieland (2007) and Død snø - Dead Snow (2009).The South Korean movie Busanhaeng (original title) or Train to Busan (english title) focuses on horror and action, with some moments of suspense. Written and directed by Sang-ho Yeon (known for the zombie animation Seoul Station - 2016), the film tells the story of a financial sector executive, Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong, known for Do-ga-ni - Silenced - 2011) who agrees to travel with his daughter, Soo-an (represented by Soo Kim-an), from the capital Seoul to the city of Busan for she spends some time with her mother (Seok's ex- wife). After embarking on a modern express train (KTX) passengers discover that an epidemic is raging South Korea, turning much of the population into zombies. With an infected person on board and the disease rapidly spreading, father, daughter and other passengers will have to fight for survival and for their lives, trapped inside a high-speed moving train.The director Sang-ho Yeon does a great job, managing to immerse the viewer in the plot. Despite most of the action been set in a train the film has a dynamic narrative and impresses for its visual and technical accuracy. Unlike the slow zombies of George Romero's trilogy in Train to Busan they are extremely agile, threatening and lethal. Another highlight is the cast. The characters are well developed, even for a horror movie and the actors deliver relevant performances, especially Sang Hwa (played by Dong-seok Ma, known for Joheunnom Nabbeunnom Isanghannom - The Good, The Bad, The Weird - 2008), the girl in the role of the daughter, Soo-an Kim, and Yoo Gong acting as the father. The soundtrack and sound effects are moderate, providing genuine scares.There are still some elements in the movie of South Korean culture, as the obsession with education and study, and a strong critique of modern society. The quest for professional success even at the expense of family and leisure time is questioned in the film, as well as the social tension. Moral and ethical conflicts involving empathize or not for others and follow or not the animal instinct of self- preservation are exploited by different profiles of the surviving passengers.Despite having some clichés of the zombie genre Busanhaeng is a great horror film, with good moments of suspense, well-constructed action scenes, a well-chosen cast and the right amount of tension to captivate the viewer.",8,1,2,29 September 2016
Green Room," A punk rock band living the most hardcore night of their lives!
","A movie with crime, suspense, horror and punk rock: can it still get better? Yes, it can! We are graced with the performances by Patrick Stewart (known for his interpretation of the captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation - 1987-1994 and Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men franchise) and Anton Yelchin (only mentioning some of his latest work: The Driftless Area - 2015, We Don't Belong Here - 2016, Star Trek Beyond - 2016 and Porto - 2016). The film Green Room gains even greater importance as one of the last works in which we see the actor Anton Yelchin, who died on June 19, 2016, at 27 years old, pressed by his own car against a concrete mailbox in the house where he lived.Directed and written by Jeremy Saulnier (Blue Ruin - 2013), Green Room tells the story of four young musicians, Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Akia Shawkat), Tiger (Callum Turner) and Reece (Joe Cole), members of a punk rock band called A'int Rights. With the tour's failure and the blunder made ​​by the producer with the payment of the show, they will perform for the last time for a neo-Nazi audience at a roadside club around Portland. After the show, by chance, they witness a crime in the dressing room. As the only witnesses, they are prevented by the contractors from leaving the place, being locked in a room. Living the most hardcore night of their lives, can they rely on the promise of the club owner, Darcy (Patrick Stewart), that everything will be fine?Two key elements that the director uses to make the movie are tension and nervousness, employing the claustrophobic atmosphere of imprisonment to create some disquieting moments. The dark tone of the picture is fundamental in this process, relying on poorly lit and dirty environments, apart from the use of graphic violence to shock the viewer. The soundtrack is very subtle, almost going unnoticed at times.Another gimmick for fans is all the characterization work of a punk rock band. The members of A'int Rights travel in a van, live with little money and due to the dream of being able to make a living with their music and art. Like every young musician in early career, they play in sh*tholes for a few bucks and participate in the underground scene of the cities. A funny and entertaining moment of the film is when the band plays the cover song Nazi Punks F*ck Off, written by Dead Kennedys, a visible provocation to the neo-Nazis who were there.The cast was well chosen and here we have to highlight the performances of Anton Yelchin and Patrick Stewart. Playing two opposing forces, the first is sensitive and intense, while the second is cold, calm and meticulous. Stewart, giving life to the character of Darcy, imposes respect and arouses fear.Green Room is a film with a simple script: be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even with a low budget, the director was very effective portraying the nightmare of the four young musicians. It's worth following Saulnier's next movies.Originally posted in: https://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br",8,3,7,20 July 2016
