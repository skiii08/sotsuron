Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Perhaps once you stop laughing, this 'offensive' film may make you think.
","If there is such a genre as offensive comedy, this immediately becomes one of the all time best. This does not only turn Americana on it's ear, it shoves it up it's own ass. The hell with 'Passion of the Christ,' this is the film that Mel Gibson had wish he made.Is it extremely offensive to Jews? Well, I'm Jewish and I'm certainly not offended. Is it offensive to all the other ethnic groups it supposedly offends? I guess it depends on one's individual perspective. However, when a stereotype is twisted and pushed until it is a distorted, funhouse mirror of reality it no longer reflects the object of ridicule, but those who hold those beliefs. Borat is the most offensive and the most brilliant film I have seen since Monty Python's 'Meaning of Life' and 'Life of Brian' I give it a big ... 'high five!' Great success.",10,6,20,3 November 2006
United 93," You must be ready to see this ... or don't see it at all.
","I chose to see this mostly because it seemed that the families, from what I've read, gave it their approval; so , in that spirit, I felt I was showing support for them though I have no idea if they get any of the profits from this film. I wish I hadn't seen it. I simply wasn't ready. I developed a huge headache and generally felt real distress as I watched. I'm not a headache person. I'm not a queasy person. I simply wasn't ready.Is this a good film? That question is a very difficult one for me to answer. It feels like a hybrid: part documentary and part traditional film. As you all know by now real people played themselves, especially in the traffic control scenes, which, in conjunction with stripped down official sounding jargon and straightforward camera work, gave it the documentary feel. On the plane, it became a traditional film. But is it good? This merges with the question, 'was it exploitive?' The filmmakers took liberties with character development. There was no traditional character development at all. Glimpes, but nothing more than that. They properly assumed that we knew the character and story lines of the most prominent passengers as portrayed by the media previously. Allowing for that assumption, the filmmakers essentially placed us amongst the passengers during the last 40 minutes of the film and let us directly observe their fear, their anger, their discovery, and their response. It was visceral, but, in my opinion, it wasn't because of craft, it was because of the painful memory of the actual event.I think a good film , even if it feels dated when seen years later, is still felt by that latter-day audience on many levels, allowing for that film to be still recognized as a good film. I think that 20 years from now this film will be felt as if it were the equivalent of a TV movie of the week. Without the shared experienced that is present amongst today's audience, it won't have any emotional weight on it's own.But for right now, this is deeply disturbing film that for some might be cathartic, for others might be interesting for the behind the scenes observation, and for other's might function as a satisfactory action/thriller film. But for me, it was simply too soon.I so hope the families of these brave men and women have found some peace. I truly do.",5,3,8,30 April 2006
Nacho Libre," Slapstick south of the border ... in tights
","Much to my surprise, as I begrudgingly went to the movies with my 12 yr old son, I LOVED this film. I expected nothing, yet in return, I received a wonderful 1 hour and 40 minute respite from the real world, filled with slapstick humor and total silliness. Slapstick humor always walks a tightrope between bad taste and belly laughs. The Three Stooges are mind-numbingly inane: most laugh intensely and some never get the joke. Laurel and Hardy isn't for everyone either. Nacho Libre is not filled with Woody Allen irony, it doesn't have Christopher Guest's drollness, and it's not James Brook slick. It's not sophisticated humor! How can any film featuring Jack Black as a Mexican friar/fryer/wrestler/wannabe wooer ... all for the 'good of the orphans' be taken seriously? It's simply for the 12 year old boy in all of us who laughs when Moe hits Curly and laughs when fat guys, even with over the top Mexican accents, are paired with skinny guys ... in a wrestling ring ... with stretchy pants.I originally wrote this as a reply to a poster who asked if the mean IQ of people who liked this was 93, but the post was subsequently deleted. But to him I say, 'By the way, I'm a physician and my IQ is a tad over 93. But even if I had no job at all and even if my IQ was 93 ... who cares ... I laughed, with my son, eating popcorn, in the dark. And that's the joy of sharing a movie like this.' No es?",8,328,384,16 June 2006
The Incredibles," transforms animation into the future
","One of the best action films I've seen in a long time. I've read many suggestions that it is borrows from Spy Kids, James Bond, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yes. Yes. And yes. But personally, I thought differently. Remarkably, I had the same response to this film as I had when I first saw Star Wars. For those of you who have seen this movie, your response to that statement might be, 'huh?' Let me explain. When I originally saw Star Wars, several things happened: first , I was absorbed into a world so different than my own, but when all was said and done , it became as real as anything I've ever experienced. Secondly, we all knew then and there that this was the future of special effects. Thirdly, be it ultra cool Han Solo; wanna be hero Luke; or uber-female Princess Leia, many people could identify with the characters. This film transforms animation, like Star Wars did for it's genre, from the present into the future. It does so because everyone involved aspires to excellence. They succeed by creating animated landscapes incredibly rich in detail, by developing movement and action that is, at times, simply exhilarating, and by brilliant 'acting' so rich with nuance, humor, and emotion that voice and drawing merges into a full fledged human. In fact, when I think about it, other than Harrison Ford, the one lingering difference between Star Wars and this film , other than the obvious - plot, was that the acting was better in this film. If you saw Star Wars ... and you did ... you saw the future of science fiction. If you see this film, you will see the future of animation. And the force is with them both.",10,0,1,5 November 2004
