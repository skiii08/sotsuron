",I loved this movie. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was exceptional. I have been a Johnny Cash fan for years and I wasn't real sure someone could capture his essence but I was wrong. I was so impressed with Mr. Phoenix's work I bought the movie and watch it regularly. Reese Witherspoon was also very good. I was disappointed that Mr. Phoenix didn't win the award for his performance he certainly earned it. All in all I think it was the best movie I have seen in a lot of years and I thank everyone who made it and all of the actors who were in it. It's not very often that you find a movie that captures you as this one did. I have always felt that the love story between Johnny and June was one of the sweetest and most destined of any I've known and Mr. Phoenix and Mrs. Witherspoon managed to capture that feeling between them and portray it for the audience. I was really impressed with the whole movie. I was amazed to learn that they both did their own vocals and played the instruments. It just goes to show you how talented these two actors are. Again I thank you. You gave me a wonderful couple of hours in a beautiful story.,10,0,0,8 March 2006
