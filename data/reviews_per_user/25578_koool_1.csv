The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely terrible.
","We of the movie going public have finally been duped to the point of no return. Normally I don't vote on a film until I've seen it more than once, but I really feel bad about spending the money to see it once. I read somewhere where it cost around $35,000 to make,that had to be stretching it.No plot,definately non existing acting,cinematography was worse than most home movies I've ever seen. If you want to see a better movie,ask your relatives to drag out their home movies in 8mm.",1,2,4,18 August 1999
