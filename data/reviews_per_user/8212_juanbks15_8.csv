Insidious: Chapter 2," Disappointing
","First of all, I have to say that I am a fan of Horror Movies, and personally I don't believe that about ' Sequel is not as good as the first one ' because I have seen a lot of sequels that have been much better than the first movie. About this one, I really liked the first, I could say it even scared me really hard. But this sequel was not needed, and is even worse they didn't put any special effects in this, if they did, then it was really sad. Giving a 4/10 due to the acting. I think it was not bad. About the movie, is not a worth-watch being honest. So if you watched the first one, liked it and you don't want to get disappointed, just skip this movie.Sorry for my English.Honestly, Juanchy.",4,5,9,1 June 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Can't wait to see the Part 2.
","If you are expecting the same movie you've seen the past year, you are not gonna like this one. There are no Games this time. As you seen in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Katniss destroyed the forcefield and Games were cancelled.So the movie is centered on Katniss as The Mockingjay, the new hope for the Districts to do what they wanted for years, a rebellion against the Capitol. You will see a good movie if you are a fan, and we wont be able to see much action scenes on this one, but that's not important because if you are a fan, the movie will keep you entertained in every moment.Loved the CGI and acting. Ending scene was absolutely fantastic, I just can't wait to see the Part 2.Giving a 8. If you are a fan, you will enjoy it for sure.",8,8,32,29 November 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The best movie I have seen this year.
","There are a lot of movies I've watched this year, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier is, undoubtedly the best I have seen not only in this year, in a long time. The most I liked from this one was the hand-to- hand combat. It was because the fights scenes are so well done, with a great choreography behind them. Special effects are amazing, see it and you will realize that everything in this movie looks realistic.Chris Evans does a great job as Captain America, I just hope he won't be replaced for the next movie. Sebastian Stan, Scarlett Johanson and Samuel .L. Jackson were so good at their roles. With this, Marvel has demonstrated that they have a lot more to show and I can't wait to see The Avengers: Age of Ultron. I'd say that Captain America is now my favourite superhero after seeing this.Don't miss it. This is a must watch!10/10.",9,1,2,12 August 2014
The Bourne Identity," The movie has everything you can expect from an action film
","There are a lot of movies where the C.I.A is it's principal theme, but this one is the best I've ever seen about it so far. I didn't know about this trilogy until 2010. I said 'Whatever, people is talking very well about this one, lets give it a shot'. What can I say? It was not a waste of time! The first time I saw it, couldn't wait for the part 2, I just became a big fan of Matt Damon. The movie has everything, drama, action, good acting and a great history. Damon is the only one who can be a Jason Bourne in my opinion, his character is so smart but not so brilliant like a Jet Li. You will see a realistic movie in all it's senses, even the fights have realism. But remember this is not all about fighting, shooting enemies or killing people like a crazy man, this is a different movie you will enjoy for sure. If you are looking for a man who kills everyone just because he wants to, I recommend you to not watch this movie. Strongly recommended to everyone, nothing more to say.",9,2,2,10 March 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Shocked.
","I am not a guy who cries easily with a movie. That's not my style. I am not trying to sound tough, but that's the truth. I remember I only cried with 'Gladiator' (when I was 12). Now 'The fault in our stars' is in my list (now I am 18 believe or not)I never liked romantics movies, I am not that kind of guy. To be honest, my girlfriend wanted to see this one so I said 'Okay, lets see it, to have some fun'. What I found? I found a very, very emotional love story between two teenagers with cancer.The love story between Hazel and Gus will catch you and will never let you go even if you don't like these types of movies. I even want to see this movie again and again!Talking about acting, it was so amazing! I really liked Ansel Elgort's work on this film. I see a new Hollywood star right here.Okay so, this is a movie for everyone. No age limits. Deserves 8,5 + in my opinion.My vote 10 out of 10. Great film.",10,0,1,5 September 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Not a Jason Bourne but an Aaron Cross.
","Well, I am a Bourne fan, but to be honest I was not expecting much about this movie because I knew there was no point on making another one, it has already ended in The Ultimatum, but yeah here is finally ' The Bourne Legacy '. What to say, it is, of course, not a bad movie, it has a good history, good acting and good action scenes. But there is something I really missed from The Bourne series, it was THE REALISM. I am a big fan of realism in movies since I watched Bourne, and when I heard this new ' Bourne ' will be about some experimental pills which gives him advantages such as speed, intelligence, etc. it ruined my hopes about this movie. More like a ' Super soldier ' as Bourne. Giving it a 6/10, due to Jeremmy Ranner and Rachel Weisz's acting. Quite disappointing this new film for our trilogy, which has already lost its original Jason Bourne.",6,0,0,22 April 2014
Kick-Ass," Demostrates everyone could be a superhero without being Superman.
","Despite I am not a big fan of comedies, this one is a bit different in my opinion. Thought I'd not review this movie, but it surprised me 'cause I was not expecting so much. Maybe it is because I am a young boy? It could be. Before you go to the cinema, I have to warn you about this movie. IT IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ONLY. I watched this one just because I was bored to be honest, and also because people were talking very good about this movie, which is pretty weird because nowadays is hard to find good comedies. This one is a movie to enjoy with friends, I recommend you to go to cinema with your friends and you guys will enjoy it for sure. To be honest, one of the best comedies I have watched.' Come on, be honest with yourself. At some point in our lives we all wanna be a superhero. '8/10. Worth watching.",8,2,6,13 May 2014
Sinister," Horror genre is not dead, see this movie and you will know why.
","Well, I am quite surprised because I thought the genre called 'Horror' was going to die soon. Also I am surprised because I thought I couldn't get scared by a movie. This time I have no doubts, this movie will scare you out more than once. You wont forget this film easily, trust me.If you like the horror genre, you can't skip this movie. The story was quite interesting and acting was actually fine. Can't say much about this one, just go and see it. You will know what I am talking about.7.5/10Strongly recommended for true horror fans.",7,1,3,18 July 2014
