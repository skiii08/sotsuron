The Lobster," A big miss!
",First half is excellent. Second half is as if they did not know what they were doing anymore. I was disappointed.,5,0,1,17 November 2019
The Incredibles," A Must Watch
","Maybe 10/10 is a bit exaggerated. However, I watched this movie in 2018 - 14 years after its release. Still, I think this is the best superhero movie I have watched in a long long time. Now just imagine how incredible this must have been 14 years ago. In short, The Incredibles (2004) is an excellent promo for the 2018 movie. :)",10,1,1,27 July 2018
