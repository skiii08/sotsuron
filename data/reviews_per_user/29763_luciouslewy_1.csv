Insidious: Chapter 2," Poor, especially in comparison to the first.
","Just another awful sequel to a wonderful movie. Terrible all around and contradicts the first movie. Basically just a thrown together piece of crap. The acting seems poorer too and its the same actors. I just really did not care for it and the first one scared me to death and back. This one felt like a B movie or like it was an independent film. The story is twisted and 100% rewrites the original movies story line, which in my opinion is the main downfall of the movie. I mean come one... the old lady was really a guy in drag???? What the heck are these writers thinking. The first movie had no cracks and was a very kept together plot. This movie strings you back and forth until you has little or no interest to continue watching it.",1,9,18,29 April 2014
