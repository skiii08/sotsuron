The Monuments Men," If you watch the great trailer you've seen the best of the movie.
","What a waste of money and time. Had George employed the editors making the trailer to write, direct and edit this film, it might have actually been enjoyable. This was unfortunately one of the most disjointedly scripted movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The story was randomly hopping this way, that way, presenting completely unrelated anecdotes from the different missions the Monuments Men were on. As another IMDb reviewer (Wilbrifar) pointed out: ' It's like watching a sequel to a movie you didn't see; the characters are acting like 'here we are, old buddies together again in Part 2' and the audience is left totally out in the cold because there was never a Part 1. ' That is very much how the movie felt; the actors were proficient in delivering their lines as well as they could, given the nightmare of a script they had to follow - but there was no chemistry between any of them at any point, so when they were getting all joking and friendly with each other, it just looked and felt awkward; like being at a party where you're watching someone be overly friendly to someone else. I would never watch this again.",2,25,33,20 February 2014
Pacific Rim," Brace yourselves; the clichés are coming !
","Guillermo's sold his poor soul to the bleak, hope grinding Hollywood machine. And unfortunately he's taken Ron Perlman along for the ride. I saw the trailers; I was prepared to see a somewhat shallow sci-fi action flick with lots of monsters and robots. But this... This gargantuan, monstrously concocted mind numbing piece of celluloid refuse had me almost in tears of exasperation. The only reason I went to see this was the vain flicker of hope at seeing del Toro's name at the helm, having seen some of his early stuff - amongst others the beautifully eerie Devil's Backbone. How does a promising director with such a flair for suspense end up serving his used toilet paper to be projected on cinema screens? I would love to know. I couldn't understand half of what was being hollered at me through the deafening rain, overpowering tuba farts and gnarling metal. I couldn't see half of what was going on thanks to the constant night (is the lack of light a metaphor of the director's mind?) and the driving rain, both used to great effect to mask any failings in the CGI. Despite this, I could still predict every minute of this sad cliché bonanza as it was unfolding. Watch the trailers, they're entertaining; you'll see everything worth seeing (the good CGI) and spare yourself the disappointing (lack of) story line and unfortunate acting. 2/10, and that's giving it an extra point for the detailed effects.",2,11,19,28 August 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," For lovers of action-packed, explosive stuff with shallow plot.
","Good points: well filmed, good action sequences, well made props and costumes. Basically: the visuals were pretty good, except for the fact that the camera work was actually too soft and sterile for that kind of movie.Bad points: very predictable script, bad dialogues, shallow characters, poor acting, even from seasoned actors like Charlize Theron, who has in the past demonstrated high skill (vide: Monster). The remaining actors (Tom Hardy included) need to attend workshops at the very least. Some of the supporting cast should change jobs altogether. The experience of this movie was overall shallow, based on visuals and clichés. I expect a little more quality from the writer and director of something that cost an estimated $150'000'000 to make. Result: 6.5/10, rounded up to 7, as the rating system doesn't take 1/2 points.",7,3,8,18 May 2015
