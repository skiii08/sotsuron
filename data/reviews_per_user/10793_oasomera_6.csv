Ford v Ferrari," Best movie out there and probably a true classic
","I was looking forward to a new movie about racing cars and especially one about doing Le Mans because there's a lot I'd like to know about that race in particular. This excellent movie is less about the ins and outs of particular races than about two of the men behind one actual attempt to give America a presence in the toughest race of all. It's a wonderfully American story though one of the men is an expatriate Brit, Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale like he was born to play this role. The part is the true center of the film despite Matt Damon's strong performance and that of numerous supporting players. I will truly be surprised if this movie doesn't sweep all the award shows.",9,2,3,22 November 2019
Knives Out," Miraculous movie making at its finest
","We hadn't gone to the movies much lately, then we saw Midway, which we enjoyed, and then Ford v Ferrari which we enjoyed even more, and now Knives Out which we had heard was even better than the first two. They were right.It's a joy to be entertained by this ensemble from Daniel Craig, as Benoit Blanc, to Ana de Armas, as Marta, and everyone in between. They make those old Agatha Christie movies seem under-played and not very carefully cast, which is saying a lot. Without digging into this film's origins I very much doubt we'll ever see a sequel with a plot anywhere as good as this one. This movie is richly wrought and overwhelmingly satisfying and the only negative thing I have to say about it is just that, there's almost no chance of a worthy sequel.",10,1,6,3 December 2019
Yesterday," A clever reminder of just how powerful this music was
","It's difficult to guess how this movie will be understood by those who weren't alive when these songs were released, but for me and people my age, each song lovingly rendered here evokes a wave of emotion. I really hadn't realized how devoid of joy my youth might have been without the Beatles, but after watching this, it's hard to deny.These are great songs but there's still a lot of mystery as to why they were so effective. Perhaps one day we will have an explanation but for now it's quite moving to relive their first hearing like this.It's hard to imagine someone other than Himesh Patel as the lead here mostly because his voice is so perfect for the Beatles songbook and his personality shines through, but I imagine some will have a problem with someone of apparent Indian descent being the musical hero. Most will quickly be won over aided by his singing and by Lily James' glowing performance.All in all a near miraculous movie for which Danny Boyle deserves much praise.",9,0,3,28 October 2019
Toy Story 4," Truly astonishing work of art
","With each new Toy Story I am more mystified by the achievement. We're forced to stay for all the credits just to feel reassured that this indeed was a monumental effort. But that in itself is mind boggling, I doubt the moon launch was a more impressive a collaborative effort. This is a top tier accomplishment that only a stone cold psychopath would fail to be moved by.And stop to realize these are essentially cartoons you're being mesmerized by. Loved Duke Caboom and Gabby Gabby especially this time around, but all the voice acting is flawless.",10,6,12,8 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," About as impressive a film as I've ever seen
","Easily the best film I've seen this year. The first three quarters or so are hard to believe. What it must have taken to attain this level of artistry! Tarantino's eye and taste are as good as it gets. This is the last I guy I want to see retire. I'm sure there are old time studio heads turning over in their graves in sheer envy.Both DiCaprio and Pitt turn in wonderful performances, DiCaprio more a character part than Pitt's but both instill every frame with star power. It's hard to walk out of the theater and not feel the uplifting influence of Brad Pitt. And then there's Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate who's like a cool breeze on a hot day, a physical relief to watch.The last quarter, Tarantino makes a personal statement about the period and some of the atrocities it saw. He's been criticized for meddling with history but there's something utterly understandable and laudable about the choices he's made. I wouldn't change a thing. I'd be surprised if this film didn't win every award it comes up for.",9,7,19,14 August 2019
1917," One of the most impressive movies I've ever seen
","WWI is my favorite war. I've read a dozen books about the air war in particular but despite knowing a lot about it all it's always been difficult to imagine what the ground war was like. No more. This visualization is so detailed and convincing, I feel I was there.Add flawless acting and a plausible story and you have the one war movie I've been able to get my wife to watch and actually praise.",9,8,12,18 January 2020
