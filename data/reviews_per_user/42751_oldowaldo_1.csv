The Blair Witch Project," i want my 75 pence back
","saw this in CeX for 75p and decided to give it a try, and it was the worst piece of found footage style film i had ever seen, and i watched most of the marble hornets on youtube which is SLENDERMAN based so you can imagine how let down i was by this, this film was almost tense at times but it just never went anywhere, there was no menace, honestly do not understand how this film continued to have hype after the public actually saw it, i'd happily watch this while camping in the woods had i enjoyed it but i wouldn't watch it again anywhere ever again. Actual students trying to make a found footage film can do better than this. The blair witch project failed to entertain, and failed to keep me interested in what was happening, and that was challenge enough. Also ps the ending sucked.",3,2,3,6 November 2014
