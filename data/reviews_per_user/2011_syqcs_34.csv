Ford v Ferrari," Ford v Ferrari
","The director didn't praise Ford by belittling Ferrari. On the contrary, Ferrari is a very respectable company. Ford's executives are selfish, hypocritical and sophisticated. When Le Mans announced that the championship was McLaren, everyone went to cheer for McLaren, only Enzo Ferrari took off his hat to salute Ken. Enzo Ferrari, 68, was a real racing fan after watching the whole race in Le Mans, and Henry Ford left in a helicopter after watching half of the race and didn't come back until the end of the race. Leo, Ford's vice president, always wanted to get wind and rain. Ken was not as respectful to him as other people, which made him feel very unhappy. So he had to retaliate Ken by mean of despicable means. If Ken can win the Le Mans championship, his face is also gilded as a vice president, but he would rather not gilded his face than be willing to be better. This is the highest level of baseness - to harm others but not to benefit yourself. It's not better drivers than Ken who beat him. It's business operations and bureaucracy. It's a dark system of humanity and corruption. The biggest enemy of drivers and athletes is not competitors, but those enterprises and people who violate the spirit of sports.",8,1,3,20 March 2020

","Hayao Miyazaki is a soft genius. Can give this cruel world so much warmth. It's like a dream in childhood. I seem to forget it when I grow up.

","DC version. It doesn't matter how terrifying it is. Today's most basic ghost jumping skills can scare a lot of people, but Kubrick obviously doesn't care about it. After watching the opening subtitles and the audience's status at the entrance of the channel, I was seated. It was a wonderful feeling that 600 people were sucked into the movie space. There are three members of the family, all the actors are brilliant, and the old rascal Nicholson is particularly crazy.

The scene of the collective return of the grey heroes in Fu Lian 3 is majestic and impressive, with the scale at least five times higher than that in Fu Lian 3.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Gift for fans
","Finally, I saw a Quentin who completely rebelled against Hollywood in terms of emotional composition. Why does Pete climb to the roof with a record and Bruce Lee's flashback? Why does Xiao Li want to insert part B in the process of chatting with the protagonist? Is Tate going to the cinema to see his films just to show his legs? When Peter really found out that living George was lying in bed, did the so-called crisis narrative and suspense collapse? It seems to be a hodgepodge of b-piece bridge sections, but Quentin deliberately twisted the chain of continuous action response to break. The film is not mediocre because the audience's expectation of psychological failure. Instead, it rises up a cross flash of light formed by disorderly patchwork of broken glass. The last 30 minutes is actually a bad comment on it. From the very beginning, it is a wonderful recollection of the atmosphere of the times. To portray Polanski and Bruce Lee as peerless fools is a wonderful embellishment of the secular fame and wealth market in which the American dream erupted: everything is just the best-selling goods in the vulgar and gorgeous dreamlike bazaar, while Quentin portrays the flashy human flesh market with gentle and sentimental comic strokes.",8,4,8,19 March 2020

Frozen," A wonderful movie
","It's one of the best Disney cartoons I've seen in recent years. Although there are shadows of many films, it has a unique perspective, focusing on sisterhood, rather than the traditional princes and princesses happily together. The characters are deeply depicted, all of them have multi-dimensional and different personalities, and the introduction of two female protagonists is unprecedented. Music is definitely Broadway level, and it's an integral part of storytelling, not for singing. Wonderful!",9,1,2,2 April 2020

","There is a kind of amusement project in the theme park. Sitting in a car and enjoying the artificial landscape along the established track, the event mechanism will be triggered continuously, and there will be a roller coaster like dive experience at the final climax. This film is basically like this. Everything is carefully designed and manipulated without any disguise. Dozens of scenes are forced to be stitched into one mirror to the end, as well as those special effects and settings. Such a superficial visual technology display is just like the Mcbeth movie, which is meaningless. Several famous actors in the game like NPC for the protagonist's card clearance is a play. A few perceptual strokes are quite eye-catching, which are the few perceptual moments for the characters to break through the technical rolling. The light and shadow design of the scene at night is wonderful.",9,0,1,20 March 2020

Joker," A worthy Oscar
","It's not a super British movie at all. It's a crime movie with ordinary low-level citizens as the main characters. It's probably the most profound one among all the movies of Marvel DC in recent years. The film creates an excellent atmosphere for Gotham City, with dark and humid roads, garbage filled streets, and a sense of impending violence. Such an environment, coupled with a tragic life experience and a bad day, is enough to force an honest poor man into the abyss, turning a little bit from rational goodness to numbness and madness, and every step of transformation is authentic. Jackun Phoenix's bony appearance is heartbreaking. There is no doubt that the movie's King level performance, 'no clown after Heath Ledger' can be taken back.",9,1,1,19 March 2020

This is an important lesson, true love, true connection, and no consideration of any other world. Based on a German novel, the film is a sad, happy, broken story, but no better. Kate Winslet's growth proves that she is one of the best actresses in the world, and her performance is definitely the best choice for Oscar.

","Twenty five years ago, the cartoon was already a classic, and the musical version reached a new high. I didn't expect that CG version could make new ideas and surprises. On the one hand, technology is invincible. It glorifies the beauty of the mainland and the liveliness of all kinds of animals. As soon as Little Simba comes out, the girls behind him all make a cute voice.

The Shawshank Redemption," perservance
","The young bankers in the film, with their mastery of bank finance knowledge, not only win the safety of life and some freedom for themselves, but also strive for the material and spiritual interests of their cellmates. It is also because of his mastery of finance that the protagonist finally completely defeats the cruel and sinister warden and gives himself material freedom. On the other hand, take a look at the six-year weekly application letter, the N-year application letter twice a week, the tunnel excavated day by day with the stone axe that 'can't dig the tunnel for 600 years', the sewer pipe broken with stones in the thunder, the 500-inch smelly sewer crawling through as you vomit. All this deeply portrays a word: perseverance. Anyone who wants to finally gain freedom under the blue sky and white clouds must have these two kinds of talent and perseverance. I also finally realized why I am still depressed at present: first: when I was not able to do so, I liked to paint very much when I was a child, but when I grew up, I concentrated on reading sage books, the college entrance examination, and the brush was never mentioned again. I studied medicine in college, but my days of studying medicine were used by me to learn guitar and read idle books. After work, guitar has no time to practice, naturally abandoned. All along, I have practiced calligraphy, seal cutting, sketches, cartoons, photoshop, flash, Dreamweaver, horticulture on and off and on. And so on interested things, however, no matter which, is typical dabble, give up the reason although each is different, but speaking, in the end is unable to insist. So, I'm basically the kind of person who can do anything and can't do anything. Second: no perseverance can actually be seen from the above, so many hobbies, so many attempts, and finally stop at my halfway. If one thing can last for half a year, the results will be very different. I am the typical 'aimless person often determined'. I have a notebook for writing plans. I don't know if anyone else has such a book. I have to set up a small book like this, because every time I make that plan, I will update it. In fact, every time I make a plan, I hope I can keep doing it, but,. Knowing that I was not regular, so after the most recent plan, I solemnly wrote: 'I hope to last three months'-as a result, a month later, these words made me have no courage to look at the front when I wrote the new plan. I am ashamed to see the film reviews written for Shawshank's Redemption on Douban, and the incisive analysis of the plot, performance and connotation of the film. However, I hid in the side to secretly write this text. Even though my writing skills are poor, even if my mind is superficial, every small person has the right to have her feelings about everything-and it is such a beautiful thing. The film touched me so much that, for the first time, I knew why I had been working so hard, but I had been depressed. Maybe, someone and I feel the same way?",10,0,0,17 March 2020

The grieving people were very dissatisfied with the indifference and avoidance attitude of the British royal family headed by Queen Elizabeth. For a while, the public was furious and the anti Royal sentiment was rising. The death of Princess Diana made the British royal family fall into an unprecedented trust crisis. As soon as Tony Blair took office, the prime minister faced such a difficult situation. On the one hand, he was grieving and angry British people, on the other hand, he was struggling to maintain the tradition and avoid the British royal family. Blair, the 'civilian Prime Minister' on the crest of the wave and under heavy pressure, must find a solution as soon as possible to calm the discontent and resentment of the people, restore the harmony between the queen and the people in the past, and establish her own reputation and prestige .The real queen of England refused to watch the film because she didn't want to see herself played by others reliving the worst week of her life.The purpose of the film is to show the strong emotional exchange among the royal family within a week after Princess Diana died.In addition to flattering Blair for her understanding, the queen basically restored the original appearance of the event. Whether it's the characterization of the queen who lives a low-key life or the cognition of Diana, it's expressed in an extremely objective and comprehensive way.",7,0,0,9 April 2020
La Vie En Rose," Sense of La Môme
","I know songs first and then movies. I've always been moved by La Vie En Rose, an immortal classic. If she had not seen this movie, she would not have been able to fully understand la vie en rose and Edith Piaf's performance. As for the true portrayal of her inner feelings at that time, the boxer who made her love for her whole life and suffered from the plane crash, The love of life and death that once brought her as bright as smoke and fire but unforgettable in her whole life has turned into the affectionate yearning and confession of every word of La Vie en rose.. After watching the movie, I know more about the protagonist of the song. Edith piafu, with a voice that can shake people's hearts, only lived to be 44 years old.The movie 'rose life' makes people cry. Many times we don't believe in fate, we don't want to believe that we will be bound by fate, but in the dark, some things are doomed. For example, Edith piaffe, the French national treasure singer with the title of 'little Skylark' (Marion godia), has a legendary life. Piafu was abandoned by her mother, then sent to a brothel by her father to be raised by her grandmother. Later, after her father retired from the army, she was forcibly taken away to live in a circus. After that, piafu followed his father's work for a living. She began to sing in the street and became a young girl in a bar. Piafu, who officially appeared on the stage, successfully became a star with charming voice and sang many popular songs. But her emotions have been frustrated again and again, especially with boxer Marcel (Jean Pierre Martins). Her old age went from bad to worse and she died of liver cancer. The fate of Edith Piaf is very bumpy, but after success, she suffers from various tribulations. She lives for love all her life. After watching the movie, she cannot help but feel sorry for the fate of Edith Piaf.But what she taught me is unforgettable, always bearing in mind that at the end of the film, Edith's three positive and powerful answers to female journalists' suggestions on women, girls and children - 'to love'.There are dark clouds behind all the lights.
