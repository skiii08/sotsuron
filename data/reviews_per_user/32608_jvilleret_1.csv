Stop-Loss," This movie promotes misinformation
","I saw this movie in theatres when it first came out. At the time I (being 18 and finishing highschool) didnt fully understand it, but something felt 'off' about the overall message that was being potrayed. It was saying things like how the Inactive Reserves was a sortof 'back door draft'At the end of the movie this lady said very loudly and confidently 'thars right, thats absolutely right.' For some reason that memory stuck in my head, i coupdnt put my finger on it, but i knew that there was something not accurate about the whole situation.Had i known then what i know now i would have corrected her. As i sit here writing this in my separation class (on my lunch break) as a member of the US Navy we were previously going over the details of the inactive reserve and that memory of this movie that i saw 11 years ago came to mind and i felt compelled to write about it.The Inactive Reserves is NOT a backdoor draft. At all. When you enlist you are informed day 1 about the Inactive Reserves and what it means.Yes, a person who enlists, signs up for a contract of active duty time as well as Inactive duty time.. realistically it is an 8 year contract. Keep in mind they tell you this before you even sign up...it is absolutely not some backdoor draft that blindsides you out of nowhere like the movie makes it out to be.The person enlisting signs up knowing fully aware of what he is getting himself into. And still makes the conscious decision to do so. If the main character was not ok with the chance of being recalled, he should not have signed up in the first place end of story.When you look at this movie as a propaganda tool it becomes difficult to take the movie seriously. The main character becomes unrelatable and i just cant feel sorry about some guy who is going through everything when he signed up for it in the first place.",Null,1,2,14 January 2019
