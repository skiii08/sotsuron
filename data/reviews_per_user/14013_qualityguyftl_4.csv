The Hangover," This crap won a golden globe?
","The worst comedy I've seen in the last year. The talented cast is wasted (especially Heather Graham) on this unoriginal script filled with shallow stereotypes. Bradley Cooper struts through the movie as a completely unlikable good-looking jerk who has no problems cheating on his wife and ignoring his son while in Vegas. The other actors are mostly forgettable and poor Heather Graham is wasted in her cameo role. How this ever got nominated for a golden globe and how it won is obviously a bit of a back room bargain and payoff with Hollywood Foreign Press, because the film is not funny. I only laughed once during the whole thing and that was the tiger in the car scene. Its sad when Mike Tyson's tiger is funnier then the entire rest of the cast. I'm glad I did not waste 10.00 bucks seeing this at the show, this is a rental and no more. This makes Porky's and Weekend at Bernie's 2 look like The Godfather, don't waste your time.",1,7,14,25 January 2010
2012," Worst of 2009
","2012 is the WORST film I have seen in the past year, thank god I didn't pay 10.00 bucks to see it at the theater. The makers of this film stole scenes from every disaster movie ever made, The Poseidon Adventure, Titanic,Earthquake,Avalanche,Airport, Dante's Peak etc. The special effects were rather amazing but the is nothing believable in the characters ability to at one moment be a slacker limo driver then suddenly a Bruce Willis Die Hard action hero. The same can be said for the Dr boyfriend of Kusack's ex wife, he has had 'Two flying lessons' but can handle a plane like a 20 year Air Force vet? c'mon this was so schlock that I hoped they all die. The whole Russian thing, what was that about? To top it off I can't believe that Woody Harrelson, Danny Glover and poor old George Seagal agreed to be in this turkey. Don't waste your time with this one, its horrible",1,1,3,29 March 2010
Paranormal Activity," Scary and realistic
","Everyone who is giving this bad reviews must be under the age of 25. They don't understand that your own imagination is far scarier than any Jason or Freddy and any of these lame remakes that Hollywood is putting out which all suck. For me, the original Halloween (1978) is the scariest movie ever. Paranormal Activity is really creepy and if this stuff was happening in my house I would be freaking out! The setting is an ideal upscale San Diego housing development where Day Trader Micah and his girlfriend (The fabulous) Kristy (This girl can act!) find themselves at the mercy of a demonic force, which has attached itself to Kristy. This film IS very low budget, but its suppose to be, your watching someones home video of things moving in their house. It was totally believable. The bedroom scenes are just so creepy, after seeing the film and going home, I was not really thinking much about it. Then I went to bed and I thought 'What if stuff happens when your asleep and you don't know it'? That is scary and I thought this crew did a fantastic job putting this together. On a 11,000 budget they have grossed 9 million so far, that is because most people over the age of 30 want something good not some lame Michael Bay crap. I can't stand his work it is so bad and Rob Zombie, horrible. Paranormal Activity is worth the money to see in the theater. Is it the most scary? No, its not. It creeps you out and makes you look at your own home in a very different way. I did have to get up and check the closets and behind the shower curtain before I went to bed. And I left the TV on. Its just disturbing more than scary and it stays with you. The acting is great and the character development is excellent and it is very funny as well. The two actors work well together and are a realistic couple that does realistic things. The last few minutes are SO creepy that I just thought I would be out the front door running down the street if it was me. 9 out of 10 just for showing Hollywood it takes IMAGINATION not millions to make something good.",9,4,8,19 October 2009
Valkyrie," Excellent production of a story we need to know about
","I just saw the film last night at home and I was very surprised at how much I liked the film and how intrigued I was in the telling of this story. I think the anti Tom Cruise crowd did everything they could to try and sabotage this film. But at a cost of around 90 million and a gross so far at almost 300 million world wide, the film did not lose money and the story is an important one for everyone to know about. This film is based on intelligent script writing and performances not CGI special effects and non stop violence, I think most people are so dumbed down by Hollywood they can't connect to anything that is intelligent and historically accurate, which the film is, there were very few liberties taken. I highly recommend this film for anyone who has the ability to understand complex history. Also many of the filming sites were the actual places in Berlin, which makes it that much more powerful.",9,1,2,11 March 2010
