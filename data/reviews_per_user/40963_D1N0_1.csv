Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I must admit the first was more exciting, but the second far more Tarantino-like!
","After i've just seen both the movies (Vol.1+2) I must admit the first was more exciting, but the second far more Tarantino-like.The story itself isn't even that intreging, it's the feel of the movie that sells itself. The direction, the atmosphere, the dialog, the camerapositions... all very masterfully done!! And all in the famous Tarantino-style.*small spoiler* There are a lot of memorable scenes, but one of my favorites is definitely the one inside the coffin! You almost think you're in the coffin yourself, next to Uma (I wish :S)!! *end spoiler*If you're a Tarantino fan, go see this movie (more than once I would say), if you're not? go anyway, you won't see something like this for a loooong time!my grade? do u care? well, an 8.5 out of 10",8,0,1,16 April 2004
