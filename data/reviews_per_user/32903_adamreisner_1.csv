3:10 to Yuma," stunned
",don't know what is more stunning..... the illogical and unbelievable plot or the volume of positive reviews. among all the problems i had with dozens of illogical and impossible character behaviors the fact that the posse dragged russel crowe to the 3:10 while he kills them off one at a time is absolutely the most ridiculous story point i have ever seen. the fact they don't just shoot him dead and then go home to their families is nuts. cowboys of the old west would have and nothing in the movie other than bales character hoping for $200 reward explains why these guys would die off one at a time and ride through hostile Indian territory to get crowe to a train to take him straight to prison with no mention of a trial is just idiocy. any comparisons to movies like the excellent and 100% believable unforegiven are something i cant understand.,1,22,39,6 April 2010
