10 Cloverfield Lane," A missed opportunity
","I will try keep the spoiler level low, so that this can be read before watching the movie.This movie delivers solid and captivating psychological drama, with great characters and a unique story. Especially John Goodman delivers an outstanding performance. Overall I really enjoyed the movie, but the last 15 minutes almost ruined it for me to be honest. I would rather if it had ended with the mystery intact instead of turning to banalities. I hope the DVD/Blu-ray will come with an alternative ending, because this movie certainly deserves something better. I do think that this movie is worth watching, but a minute or so after Michelle rips a hole in her pants (you will know when it happens),there is IMO not much reason to watch any more of it. It will feel a bit incomplete perhaps, but its better that way.I know that some people despise cliffhanger type endings, and I would surely have disliked such and ending when I was a kid, but 10 Cloverfield Lane is a prime example of how bad the alternative can be. It has exactly the kind of silly ending that your marvel-flick-loving friend would come up with in the car home from the theatre, while making the sound effects with his mouth.** edit ** After writing this review, the ending of the 'original' script has been revealed, and it sounds exactly like the ending this movie deserves. If the movie had ended like described, it would have been a 10/10.",7,3,8,11 March 2016
Passengers," Better than expected
","I was expecting, or rather fearing, another Jupiter Ascending when I saw who the two lead actors were, but this movie is more than just two hot celebrities teaming up for a cash-in. I have seen a trailer that sells this as an action movie, but people wanting space action will probably go home disappointed. This is more of an adventure drama, and thank goodness for that. The good part: This movie may not become a classic in the genre, but it does capture ones attention, with a good premise and beautiful space scenery in almost every scene. It gives a good sense of what it could be like to be isolated aboard a massive space ship cruising through the galaxy, with the scales of space contrasting our our tiny lives. The good special effects and scenery combined with the character 'Arthur' carries this one home. Jennifer Lawrence does a decent job as well. The bad part: Im not a big fan of Criss Pratt's acting style as it does not fit this kind of movie very well. When ever he has a chance to add some depth and credibility to his character, it mostly ends up in some sort of silly (like in all his movies, which makes me wonder if he plays the same character in all of them?). The movie also has its share of corny Hollywood-esque jokes, but thankfully its kept on an almost acceptable level. The story of this movie could easily have been made into a thriller, or even a horror, but the aforementioned silly acting and cheesy jokes keeps the atmosphere jolly - but a bit too much so, and this is what drags it down.Overall, I think that Passengers is worth watching.",8,2,5,4 January 2017
The Beach," Vastly underrated
","This movie received a lot of hate when it came out due to DiCaprio's fame with females after his appearance in Titanic (much like how everyone loves to hate Bieber today), and I kept far away from this movie for many years. I too only knew him from Titanic at that point, and when I saw him shirtless on the movie poster I had pretty clear assumptions of what this movie would be like. But I was wrong. This movie is great. Its a captivating 90s new age adventure with lots of twists and thrills, and i kicked myself for not watching it sooner. If you like Inception or Shutter Island, then i think you will like this one too.",9,0,2,5 January 2017
Alien vs. Predator," Pretty good for what it is
","Some say that AVP is silly and that the plot is thin, and they are right, but this movie is not about realism or story depth. Its an action movie where people are hunted by terrifying monsters and get killed without discrimination. This is a slight depart from the original Alien movie and Predator movie which had a more serious tone, so i understand why some may be disappointed by AVP. But if you expect a solid no-brainer action movie that entertains the viewers with suspense and action without taking itself too serious, then you get exactly that. It is a joy to watch all the right people get killed and the right people survive their encounter with the aliens and the predator. The main character is actually quite likable. Its not like in Prometheus, where you'd grow increasingly apathetic with each silly decision made by the characters.",7,39,45,25 December 2016
Arrival," Lackluster
","The premise of the movie is good, and the movie does deliver some suspense and a somewhat new take on the story of what human kinds first encounter with aliens will be like. There are no humanoid aliens or alien technology that looks earthly for instance. It does have some clichés, like for instance 'military guy who wants to kill the aliens' and 'science people vs military people' which makes the movie a bit formulaic anyway. Its a shame since you can see in other places that the makers did try to do renew the 'encounter' genre, but unfortunately they didn't go all the way. Some of these clichés are not even explained properly, and would have left big plot holes if it wasn't because the situations in question are so overused that they are more or less self-explanatory by now.The movie mixes the encounter scenes with scenes from the main characters personal life, and tries very hard to give the viewer the feeling that all the pieces fit together in the end, but it feels forced and very underwhelming to say the least. You don't get that 'Aha' feeling that makes you rethink the whole movie, but more like a 'Thats it?' feeling. You wonder why people would go through the trouble of including aliens in a movie that is essentially about a woman and her uninteresting life choices. Its an unusual mix of genres, but unfortunately it is not very successful in this instance, and the result is a movie that is quite messy and both a weak encounter story and a weak drama.If you haven't watched this movie already, then go watch 'Contact' - perhaps again. Its not perfect, but its a lot better than Arrival.",4,45,100,9 December 2016
Prometheus," B-movie material
","After about half an hour, i was so annoyed with the whole space ship crew that i hoped the aliens would just kill them off and get it over with quickly. The decisions they make are so dumb that it seems completely incomprehensible that anyone would ever trust them to fly an expensive space ship all by themselves. Usually in survival type films there is at least one character that you should develop some sort of sympathy with, but there just isn't such character in Prometheus. The thrill and suspense scenes become kind of awkward when you hope for the wrong guys to win. I do give it three stars because i didn't fall asleep or got annoyed enough to turn it off. For some odd reason, i thought even AVP was better than this.",3,3,6,5 January 2017
Life," Standard horror flick with no surprises
","There is some good suspense, but the plot could have been presented in a more credible and realistic way. The main characters are often acting annoyingly unprofessional, which feels very out of place considering they are supposed to be ISS crew. It is perhaps done like this to give more headroom for giving characters more personality traits, as i can see how a disciplined and professional acting crew could become a bit impersonal and sterile. Except perhaps for the characters 'Sho', the characters are pretty dull anyway, so I would have preferred more realism, which would also have made it scarier (which is the whole purpose of a horror film). The protagonist could have been made a more realistic without jeopardising the plot as well, but I guess that logic and horror are not always easy to unite.In short, 'Life' is not terrible, but its by no means a classic and is instantly forgotten.",5,2,7,29 March 2017
The Martian," I really wanted to like this movie
","I really wanted to like this movie and i was excited when i went to see it. The effects and the setting is great, but the movie never delivered. It completely lacks suspense due to its long run and extreme rate of predictability. When i found out that the rescue mission had to take another trip around the sun, which meant at least one more hour in the theater for me, i almost walked out. To top it off, it also became quite annoying with try-hard one-liners like 'I've got to science the s**t out of it', and silly gags about where for instance excessive use of ketchup is supposed to be funny. I realize that this is done to give the movie a broader appeal, but it also dumbs it down considerably. From the marketing about how it contains accurate science etc, I expected a more 'hardcore' science fiction movie, but it felt more like an episode of Iron Man in terms of 'science' and 'humor'.",4,3,5,2 March 2016
