The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Amazing!
","Coming of age stories are the order of the day. Most film-makers seem to be inclined towards taking up this genre over the others. But unfortunately, not all these films register an impact. They may fare well at the ticket counters due to the star quotient,but hardly do they linger in our memories after their running time.Perks is also a coming of age film but with the difference that it breaks clich√©s and banalities. Charlie is a freshman in high school and he finds himself rather secluded from the rest of the world until he meets Sam and Patrick, his seniors. The film, apart from showing the strength of friendship between the three leads, also broaches some sensitive teenage issues. Charlie, who has just gone through an emotional disturbance in the death of his best friend, feels free- spirited and ecstatic in the company of his two friends. Each of the three leads hit low points in their lives and help each other out in bouncing back. Logan Lerman, as Charlie, is perfect in every sense. He nails the emotional scenes and also brings the cute charm that his role entails. Emma Watson (Sam), venturing out of the amazing Potter franchise for the first time, brims with confidence. Her performance was flawless. Ezra Miller (Patrick) is a very underrated actor. He juggles between the comical and the heavy scenes like a pro. The supporting cast do their bits very well too.On the whole, Perks is an amazing film. By the end of it, you are sure going to feel infinite!",9,0,1,29 December 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Thank God for the last 20 minutes
","It is actually impossible to rate a twilight film as 'good' because it's an established fact that those films make zilch sense and do not provide any remote sense of satisfaction to the general moviegoers apart from the amazingly passionate legion of fans called 'twihards'. So when a person who is not a fan of the series says a twilight movie is good, it means that it is still terrible but not as terrible as the other ones.The final instalment of this outrageously successful series, called Breaking Dawn part 2, tries the patience of the viewer for the first 30- 40 minutes. There is hardly anything that happens apart from the trademark Edward and Bella moments and a little bit of shirltess Jacob. There is also a poorly done CGI baby which is called Renesmee, Edward and Bella's daughter. Just when you contemplate walking out of the cinema hall, you get to see something that can be perceived as a successful attempt to placate the disappointed audience. There is a very well-executed battle sequence with a clever twist that makes you wonder why such scenes were so sporadic throughout the series. Yes, the battle sequence was effective damage control.The performances were mediocre as opposed to the hitherto awful monotony that the cast put up in the past four movies except Pattinson,. who still continues to look jaded, but you can't really blame him. On the whole, for an non-fan, this movie would visually punish you for a while and then give you a breather during its last 20 minutes. If you think the ticket cost is worth those 20 minutes, I suggest that you watch it. Bland film otherwise",2,99,295,20 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," One Word: EPIC
","Talk about raising the bar, and Christopher Nolan will be the one who comes to mind. After two successful attempts at bringing life to the batman series (Batman begins and The Dark Knight), Nolan doesn't seem to have lost his shine as yet, as with this film, he truly raises pushes boundaries and emerges triumphantly. Right from Scene 1, he has you hooked and makes sure that your attention doesn't waver one bit during the entire running time of 164 minutes. The film is set in a backdrop which represents a situation prevailing 8 years after Harvey Dent's death. Gotham city is in danger again, and the Batman has to return, and this time, with more physical and mental strength to rival the diabolical villain, Bane. The performance of every single actor is top-notch. Christian Bale reprises the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman deftly and so do Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. Anne Hathaway, as cat-woman, is kick- ass. She proves that she has much more to herself than just being the regular girl-next-door. Joseph Gordon Levitt is perfectly cast as Robin and delivers an amazingly level headed performance. Tom Hardy deserves special mention for emoting primarily through his eyes, with rest of his face being masked. He nails his part.It will take way too long to list out the epic moments in this film. On the whole, The Dark Knight Rises is a beautifully crafted piece of work, with a slew of moments are sure to linger in your memories for a long time.",9,5,11,1 August 2012
