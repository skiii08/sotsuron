United 93," A True Must-See
","I have seen many powerful movies that deeply affected me, but nothing like this. I've never had such a physical reaction to a film before. I was almost nauseous with a feeling of impending doom, since we all know how it ends, but I still found it to be quite suspenseful. Using largely unknown actors was a stroke of genius, and the mundane aspects of people going about what should have been just another day was part of what made this so gut-wrenching for me. My heart was racing throughout and by the end I was shaking and sobbing. A truly harrowing experience, but one everyone over the age of 16 should have. A true cinematic masterpiece.",10,2,5,6 May 2006
