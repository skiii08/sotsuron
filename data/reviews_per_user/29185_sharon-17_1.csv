Moneyball," Much ado about nothing
","This is my take on a movie called Moneyball that I got to view with a good friend today at noon...Had potential, had a decent set of stars cast, and of course being filmed at the Oakland Coluseum (or whatever they call it these days) with panoramic sights of the beautiful Bay Area and surroundings...a lot of interesting stats and go against the norm dynamics and all the stuff a good movie has to promise...Not one damn sex scene and a lot of nothing to say after 2 hours and 40 bucks light ...I'd say give me an old 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' in front of the boob tube any day...That's the unconveluted and slightly embellished truth...Wait for it to come out on DVD so you can fill the boredom with some of your own extracurricular activity...Sincerely not enlightened by the waste of money that I didn't even spend...;+>",Null,1,3,26 September 2011
