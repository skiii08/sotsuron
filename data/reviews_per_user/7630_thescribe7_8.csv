The Avengers," Avengers: Overrated
","Okay Avengers is good. The dialogue is witty and the action is action. Not a movie so much around telling a story as it is telling jokes. I like that style. But going by the director, Joss Whedon's, quote, 'Make it dark, make it grim, make it tough but for the love of God tell a joke.' Well, you got that last part right. But where's the build up? And I'm not talking about the boring beginning.I guess I just feel like the characters got to wisecrack each other but they didn't really demonstrate that they 'got' each other. I feel like I'm missing something. We didn't get that one moment that was serious, something that I feel like Joss said himself was important to the build up.As I said, I find the beginning to be rather boring. It doesn't grab me with a defining character moment. I don't feel like Avengers is one of the great movies. I don't even feel like it's the best of the series. They did better in The Winter Soldier. They did a better ensemble in Guardians of the Galaxy. It wasn't as passionate as Spider-Man 2. It doesn't compare to the writing of The Dark Knight.They built up to this film with five other character flicks which, I guess, is the reason why this works. I just feel like something more meaningful could been done. I feel like we could have seen how the characters relate to each other. Guardians of the Galaxy could be accused of having the same problem but I feel like they at least joked about relating. Avengers doesn't do that. Hawkeye is there and he does nothing. Iron Man attempts a sacrifice and we don't feel much. Cap is there and he doesn't offer as much American spirit as he could. Thor has some good remarks. Black Widow is hot and... badass. And if there is something I like about life it's a badass hot female.What I'm doing at the end of the day is nitpicking. I mean what I say about this film but it is fun. It is a good comedy. Don't let a couple flaws distract from this. I actually feel like in some ways this film was a build up. We have them all together and they know each other so perhaps they can accomplish more in The Age of Ultron.",8,3,8,18 April 2015
World War Z," Fun, But Not Much
","The film is simply a ride. Nothing special. It's not cheap or anything bad. The music makes it all worthwhile. It has perks such as Philadelphia is the first city you see get wrecked. The zombies are different from what we see in something in The Walking Dead. These are zombies that pile on top of each other so that they can climb long walls. The film is a world war and it takes us around. Not too many character moments but it's all fine for the romp. Because this is something where you just want to chill back, relax, and enjoy the show. It's not mindless like Transformers but not of any high entertainment that sticks out in your mind as others might have. But give it watch if it's on TV.",6,0,1,19 April 2015
The Hunger Games," Pretty Solid Kills
","The Hunger Games takes us to a future where we are sent off to be killed by each other and only one will survive. Well, good premise. Of course this has to be a love story. But who doesn't want a love story while being tracked down by fellow sane humans? The film is flawed but I enjoy it for having one of favorite things in the world: Hot Badass Female. Screw the damsels in distress, this should be who we look up to! .This teenager has to go out and fight real human beings for sport because that's how the system works! She faces a love interest Peta and it becomes something that we can truly say is something real teens should look up to. Screw Twilight. This is a real story that we want to see turn out okay. And I think that's a good movie.",7,0,3,19 April 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the Greats
","What I love about this is... everything really. The catchphrases, the kid that isn't annoying as s**t, and of course the Terminator himself. The first film rocked and intrigued me. There isn't much to say that hasn't been said.What I like is how many times you can just sit back and watch it. It's always entertaining. I'll try to explain why this works in the way I do best: comparisons. What did this get right that Terminator 3 didn't? The story. Terminator 2 feels pretty conclusive but a story can be pulled out of anything. What makes Terminator 2 stand out is that it offers a triumphant, yet a little down ending. Terminator 3 just feels down. Terminator 3 doesn't have a niche going for it.Terminator 4 just feels blah. It looks even more boring than Transformers. Terminator 4 is just something you forget about. Terminator 2 sticks out because of its epic tone and heart. Terminator 4 offers nothing. Not a niche. Not a soul. Not even fun action. Terminator 2 you can just chill and watch stuff blow up while also cracking a smile at the remarks.What makes this stand out from all the Transformers flicks is the fact that the action is intense.The action is everywhere to the point where you don't know what's going on. Terminator 2 let's you see what's happening and it let's you know how it feels!Why Terminator Genisys or whatever it's called is going to suck because you can see it's trying to look and feel like the second one. They've got all the lines and they've got all the gimmicks in the trailer. But what are gimmicks are merely gimmicks. The people who made Terminator 2 knew it would work because it was different and exciting. You know Terminator Genisys won't work because the creators are just relying on something that they know has worked before but don't really know why. And to be honest, Terminator 2 is conclusive.",8,1,1,19 April 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," Lacks Heart and Comic
","As cringe worthy as Tobey Maguire is, you always like him at the end of the day. As cheesy as the original film is, it has a heart and a comic book feel. We felt something during Uncle Ben's speech in the original film. In this film, it is merely glossed over to something that's supposed to add up to more or less the same thing. Also, doesn't anybody ever poke an eye at Peter during all the great powers he has? Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man is perhaps more fitting but he's just missing something. He doesn't have the corny comic book feel to him in this film. I guess this is a more 'serious' version of the Raimi film but there is no substance here. You have a giant lizard running around doing nothing interesting. Everything that relates to Spider-Man just feels glossed over. I don't even think we find out anything about Uncle Ben's killer. We never see him again! Peter isn't even responsible for anything! There is no guilt felt! There are some subplots in here that don't amount much to anything. To the film's credit, they sure did pull off a better love interest for Peter. Gwen is cute and an actual character. I also do feel like Peter is almost more relatable here. Him and Gwen do process chemistry and are cute. But sometimes we need a bit comic book to it. Or something to it. Something like a story. As stupid looking as the Green Goblin looked in the original film you remember him for his cheesy lines. He was at least a character! This lizard dude is nothing! The film fails to add anything new to the Spider-Man mythos and you forget most of it by a year. Where's those little warm feelings you get when Spider-Man kisses M J for the first time (as bad as her character is)? The film is not memorable nor does it have a warm spider heart. It just feels like your average mediocre movie. Putting comparisons aside, there really is nothing here to marvel at. Peter is likable enough but nothing that special. Nothing special in that there's no character development. He starts fighting and stuttering and ends fighting and stuttering! But the Stan Lee cameo was cool...",4,3,6,2 June 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Enjoyed
","What I like about this film is that it creates a new and exciting story to audiences who have no knowledge whatsoever of the original. I've never watched the original but the premise in this gave an appreciation for this franchise. What you get is a man that raises a genetically engineered ape who will be locked down in a cage with fellow less intelligent apes. The apes look and sound epic and we grow to like them more than any human characterThe film does, however, feel like a setup. We've seen how the story started but we didn't get much out of it. We get the consequences of this story by the ending and it does rule. I just feel like we didn't see everything that the story was telling. I feel like there wasn't a lot of connection between all of the apes, but then again this is the beginning of a story and it does right to get us hooked for something more fulfilling.",7,2,4,19 April 2015
Transformers," It Still Isn't That Good
","The film is boring. It throws stuff at you and you feel nothing during the whole thing. This is supposed to be the good one but it really isn't. Shia LeBeouf is bland as anyone else, only anyone else is more interesting. Megan Fox... pulls a guys pants off... so yeah we're subjected to that.The Transformers do actually look awesome and for a little bit when they first appear I'm into it. But then a plot starts that nobody cares about comes along and blows up the movie. There isn't enough corny dialogue that's needed to get us in. This kind of thing needs quirks. It feels like any other movie you see. That's my slogan. Cool robots, yet any other movie you see. There really isn't much to say about it other than go watch something more creative. Stick with the old Terminator movies.",4,0,2,20 April 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," This is an art gallery
","This truly is a one of a kind. I showed this film to my brothers as a half joke, as 'not much happens' in the film. My brothers were appalled by it saying, 'Nothing happens to warrant it being good, but nothing happens to warrant it being bad. But it's still bad for being boring.' I, personally, don't think anyone is stupid for saying harsh things about this. Afteral, this film is about making you feel through images rather than dialogue. If that doesn't appeal to you, I understand that.Film is more than story. I firmly believe that. If you were to take music out of certain films they wouldn't have nearly the same effect. This film is about simulating real life space travel. Actually, well I can't completely tell you what this is about as the film itself has the effect of an art gallery. You stare and behold art. Maybe you respect it, maybe you think art is overrated. The film does, like most works of Stanley Kubrick, make me feel uncomfortable at times. Just the way it looks and feels. It's eerie. Which is the point. Space is so vast and we know so little and we've come only so far. Barely the amount David Bowman made on his mission.",10,1,2,30 May 2015
