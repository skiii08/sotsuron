The King's Speech," Historical Events Intimately Told with Regal Humility Thanks to Firth's Career-Defining Performance
","Tonight is the ceremony of the 83rd Academy Awards, which signals the official end of the 2010 movie year, and it has taken me a while to find an opportunity to see the Best Picture and Best Actor frontrunner, director Tom Hooper's (HBO's 'John Adams') intimate chamber-piece historical drama about how King George VI overcame a debilitating stutter and went on to lead the British empire through World War II. Written by Tom Seidler (his last big-screen credits were a couple of animated films in the late 90's), it is exactly the type of movie that the Academy praises with their accolades, and in this case, it appears justified for a number of elements, chief of which is Colin Firth's masterful portrayal of the painfully shy former monarch thrown into the spotlight by his older brother who could not give up the twice-divorced woman he loved.George VI was known as Bertie to his intimates, and despite his royal lineage, he had no intention of assuming the throne. However, he had to speak in public periodically as part of his duties and stammered hopelessly as is illustrated in the film's opening scene when as Prince Albert, the Duke of York, he chokes and stutters uncontrollably at the close of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition in front of thousands at Wembley Stadium. It's one of several traumatizing experiences for Bertie, but his fair-minded wife Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother, recognizes that her husband needs to overcome the situation to serve the empire. She enlists the help of Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist (and failed actor) based in London, whose unorthodox methods include encouraging his clients to sing, spit out profanities, and share intimate childhood secrets that may unlock the cause of their speech impediments.More familiar historical events take over in the film. When his father, George V, dies in 1936, his brother David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII, but for years, he has been smitten with Wallis Simpson, an American divorcée socialite, whom he wants to marry despite the fact that she would never be accepted as the Queen. This constitutional crisis causes Edward VIII to abdicate and thus force Bertie to take the throne. This chain of events causes rifts among the main male characters that are healed by the onset of a world war. Throughout this period, Bertie and Lionel privately work together in painstaking fashion to overcome the new king's stammering. The climax is the 1939 radio speech that George VI needs to deliver to his subjects upon declaration of war against Germany to motivate them to keep their spirits high during the empire's darkest hour.It's not that Firth does anything all that different here as Bertie from his previous work like last year's 'A Single Man', but his dexterous performance resonates in the way he can be forbiddingly regal and tenderly vulnerable nearly in the same moment. Geoffrey Rush has a field day playing Logue as he gets to represent the audience point of view with his character's acerbic observations and modestly respectable family life. After showy turns in her partner Tim Burton's films ('Sweeney Todd', 'Alice in Wonderland'), Helena Bonham Carter is comparatively demure as Elizabeth, but her innately steely resolve shines through in a flattering portrayal of the woman who would become the most beloved royal in her later years. The trio of actors makes for a particularly effective dynamic among real-life characters and highly personal situations.Smaller roles are filled expertly if sometimes a bit broadly - Guy Pearce playing David as a superficial, nasally fop not above ridiculing his brother's stammering; Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury highly suspicious of Logue's intentions; Michael Gambon appropriately distant as the dying king; and Timothy Spall who does a somewhat ham-fisted turn in what appears to be a caricature of Winston Churchill. Claire Bloom was virtually unrecognizable in a near-bit role as Queen Mary. Careful craftsmanship abound in this production from Danny Cohen's subtle cinematography to Eve Stewart's stately production design to Alexandre Desplat's stately soundtrack, which includes a most effective use of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony during the final scene.",8,0,0,27 February 2011
The Avengers," Avengers Assemble Most Adroitly
","Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made 'Iron Man' (1 & 2), 'The Incredible Hulk' (the 2008 version), 'Thor' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger' purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable. A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in 'Thor') while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in 'Iron Man 2', to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.) For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.",9,4,7,3 June 2012
Vertigo," Obsession as Grand Melodrama in Hitchcock's Most Hypnotic Work
","This legendary 1958 masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock plays like grand Baroque opera full of exaggerated character motivations and preposterous plot turns, yet it is one of the most consistently involving of his impressive canon of films perhaps because he takes an unsavory subject, sexual obsession, and shapes around it a remarkably perceptive character-driven mystery thriller. Co-written with intricacy by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, the tightly drawn story focuses on John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a plainclothes detective who quits the police force after his partner dies during a rooftop chase where Ferguson is debilitated by a severe case of acrophobia. An old college acquaintance, now a shipping tycoon, convinces the now-retired Ferguson to follow his disturbed, potentially suicidal wife Madeleine, and thus begins Ferguson's first obsession.The film twists and turns until her apparent death from a fall from the San Juan Batista mission church steeple. This is where Hitchcock does something quite audacious. Suffering from this unexpected tragedy, the hero of the movie becomes a darker character we are suddenly not sure about. By fate back in San Francisco, Ferguson meets a shopgirl named Judy who bears enough of a physical resemblance to Madeleine for him to stalk her and force her to change her appearance to look like his lost love. At first, it feels rather necrophilic if not downright deranged for Ferguson to act on his obsession of a dead woman, but regardless, a final twist makes the love between Ferguson and Judy impossible to endure. Hitchcock lends a deepening sense of emotionalism to the maddening but addictive spirals of the plot which ultimately makes the film's title even more resonant than the medical condition Ferguson has.Casting is crucial to making the storyline relevant to a viewer much less credible. In a nice change-of-pace, James Stewart makes Ferguson's obsession palpable, and his everyman demeanor takes on a convincing sinister edge, even though his natural affability sneaks through effectively as a counterbalance. In what remains a most underrated performance, Kim Novak manages to play her dual roles with a surprising lack of affectation, from the cool mystique of Madeleine to the desperate eagerness of Judy. Hitchcock uses Novak's natural detachment as an actress to the movie's advantage, as I doubt the more versatile Grace Kelly could have played at least the Judy part as well. Barbara Bel Geddes has precious few scenes in the relatively thankless role of Midge, Ferguson's sometime girlfriend. The San Francisco locations are used to great advantage - the Palace of Fine Arts, the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort Point, the now-defunct Ernie's restaurant, the Podesta Baldocchi flower shop, the cemetery at Mission Dolores - all shot in lustrous detail by Robert Burks. Bernard Herrmann contributes one of his great scores to complement the pacing and atmosphere of the mystery and suspense.The DVD has the splendid 1996 restoration which captures all the visual and aural splendor of the film. It also includes an alternative commentary track that features Novak, restorers Robert Harris and James Katz, Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and most interestingly, associate producer Herbert Coleman who is full of anecdotes. Harris and Katz figure prominently in an interesting 1997 half-hour documentary on the original production and restoration process. There have been many knock-offs - including Brian DePalma's derivative 1976 'Obsession', Kenneth Branagh's blackly humorous 1991 'Dead Again' and most recently, Jun Ichikawa's coldly antiseptic 2005 'Tony Takitani' - but this is most definitely the one to experience.",10,16,26,18 February 2006
Black Swan," Portman Rises Above an Intensely Kinetic Psychological Thriller That Challenges Coherence
","It has taken me a while to see Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed 2010 psychological thriller probably because the marketing campaign at the time of its December release focused more on the film's sensationalistic, horror-film elements. In the meantime, Natalie Portman collected a truckload of awards for her searing portrayal of Nina Sayers, a talented ballerina whose mental state declines as pressure mounts around her starring performance in a new staging of Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' by a prestigious New York City ballet company. She is quite good, although I am less relatively enamored by the film itself, especially toward the end, which beyond recalling Aronofsky's earlier work, 2000's 'Requiem for a Dream', comes across as an intensely kinetic albeit derivative hybrid of 'The Red Shoes', 'Carrie', and 'Single White Female'.Co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin, the screenplay melds Nina's reality, dreams, and hallucinations into quite a ripe melodrama. Nina has long dreamed about playing the lead in 'Swan Lake', and her fantasy comes true in a moment of pure bliss before her descent into madness. The ballet troupe's manipulative director Thomas Leroy picks Nina to replace aging prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre to play the Swan Queen, which is two roles in one – Odette, the virginal White Swan awaiting a kiss from the Prince, and her heartless twin, Odile, the sexually predatory Black Swan who lures the prince away. Leroy knows Nina is fully capable of playing the former but remains unconvinced she could exude the sensuality needed to play the latter. While she has trained her whole life for this opportunity, she remains an insecure, emotionally bruised woman still living with her overbearing mother Erica, a former ballerina who never reached the rarefied heights her daughter is about to enter.Complicating matters is Lily, a new arrival to the company from San Francisco and as liberated a free spirit as Nina is sexually repressed. Meanwhile, as Nina performs to the demands of the role, she crumbles in hidden ways that have her start imagining herself transforming into a swan. Present in almost every frame of the film, Portman is terrific conveying Nina's tentative nature in a way that makes her dedicated training all the more haunting for the sacrifices she makes to achieve her goal of artistic perfection. Within the confines of his predictable role, Vincent Cassel is malevolent enough as the autocratic Leroy, and Barbara Hershey really excels in her few scenes as Erica, showing why Nina's self-esteem has become practically nil. With her haughty manner and skeletal frame, Winona Ryder has more of an extended cameo as Beth, but she makes her fatalistic sense palpable. As Lily, Mila Kunis is almost effortless as Nina's saucy, distrustful competitor.Compounded by Matthew Labatique's constantly moving camera, Aronofsky's florid direction works on an almost surreal level for about the first three-quarters of the film's 108-minute running time, but his lurid horror-film approach gets excessive toward the end when Nina's confusion between reality and fantasy signals an inability to deal with the life she thought she wanted. The 2011 DVD/BluRay offers an extensive, 49-minute making-of documentary, 'Black Swan Metamorphosis' which includes on-set footage and interviews with cast and crew. In addition, there are short featurettes focusing on the ballet sequences, the production design, the costumes, Portman's preparation for the role and Aronofsky's creative process. There are also interviews of the principals from Fox Movie Channel Presents, as well as the theatrical trailer.",6,0,0,2 April 2011
Walk the Line," Superb Witherspoon Complements an Evocative Phoenix in Real-Life Love Story
","What is most intriguing about the new Johnny Cash biopic is how Joaquin Phoenix does more of an impressionistic take on the Man in Black rather than the dead-on impersonation that Jaime Foxx did as Ray Charles, or going further back, that Gary Busey did as Buddy Holly. Although Phoenix lacks Cash's craggy features and full-throated delivery, there is enough resemblance vocally and physically for him to get away with it. Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film. When he performs onstage, it is not so much the musicality that gets you but the often scary glare he gives as a tortured soul. Whether destroying a dressing room or feeling ill-at-ease with his stoic parents, it's a powerfully unrelenting performance that evokes Cash's spirit, albeit one that is sometimes too off-putting and humorless over the course of a 136-minute film.Recent biopics seem to be following similar dramatic patterns. Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to 'Ray' in treatment - a rural childhood, a demanding parent, a transformative childhood trauma, adultery, drug addiction. However, to Mangold's and co-writer Gill Dennis's credit, he does not go back and forth to Cash's childhood to make us understand his pain. Instead, he deals with it succinctly upfront and uses the periodic reappearance of his parents as the emotional link. The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core. Cash's incessant, decade-long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.Reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real-life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern-fried sensibility. What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in 'Vanity Fair' or her overachieving half-spirit in 'Just Like Heaven', are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks. She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially 'Jackson', are among the movie's best moments. Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing. As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no-nonsense nurturing that attracts our attention more than Phoenix's doleful responses.It's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real-life performers or the actors portraying them. Some voices are so recognizable as to defy impersonation (e.g., using Ray Charles' original tracks in 'Ray'). Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter. Credit needs to go to T. Bone Burnett for training them so well for six months. There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.The movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm-singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small-minded shrew. Like all-fact-based movies, the movie can also feel episodic, and it does sag somewhat in the middle as the film belabors Cash's amphetamine addiction. Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood film-making with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.",8,1,2,12 December 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Relentless Skewering of American Cultural Mores Yields a Hilariously Astute Comedy
","This is definitely a comedy that lives completely on the edge. Its sheer audacity and fearlessness against public rebuke are admirable to some, repulsive to others. Except for a few groaners, this is one of the most hilariously observant films about global perceptions of the U.S. and an incisive, unguarded account of the prevailing social attitudes and cultural taboos in this country. In a compelling Andy Kaufman-like turn, Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a television commentator from Kazakhstan, here portrayed as the most backward of third-world countries. He has been assigned by his government to travel to the U.S. to make a documentary about American cultural mores.After introducing us to his country, Borat arrives in Manhattan accompanied by his hefty, worrisome producer Azamat. But there is a change of plan when Borat sets his sights on Pamela Anderson and sets out on a road trip across the country to meet her in L.A. There is no let-up of ridiculous sight gags and maddeningly funny asides during its quickly paced 82-minute running time. Unlike the Pamploma bulls, there is the 'Running of the Jew' in which the Kazakh villagers attack a couple of giant, papier-mâché puppets, Mr. and Mrs. Jew, who in turn lays a giant egg which the local children beat furiously with sticks. Other scenes have Borat erroneously presuming that a hotel elevator is his room and being a semi-attentive student to amazingly tolerant instructors as he gets lessons on comedy, driving and etiquette.Throughout the movie, Cohen keeps upping the ante and yielding even more comic dividends - a question to a gun store clerk about the best weapon to kill Jews answered without hesitation; a B&B owned by a kindly Jewish couple which turns into a scene from 'The Blair Witch Project'; a conservative Southern dinner party that gets ugly when Borat invites an overweight black prostitute as his guest; an aging cowboy who lets his bigotry spew freely at the rodeo; a trio of frat boys from South Carolina who enthusiastically share their supremely sexist attitudes; and most infamously, an extended naked wrestling match between Borat and the grotesque Azamat that ends up in a convention of mortgage brokers. All these scenes expose a raw nerve which feels concurrently offensive, truthful and hilariously comic.Credit needs to go to director Larry Charles, who guides this venture with the same type of deadpan élan he showed with HBO's 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and the screenplay by Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham, and Dan Mazer, which lends a loose structure to what seems to be a series of staged scenes with all the non-actors. But above anything else, it's Cohen's major accomplishment that he can make Borat an anti-Semitic, sexist homophobe and still have him come across as an amiable, cheek-kissing fellow full of innocently executed malapropisms. I'm sure the easily offended will continue to express their disgust, but for the more adventurous, brace yourself for a comedy that will make you roar with laughter while giving you that unsettling feeling of recognition. It's quite a trick which Cohen and company pull off superbly.",9,3,8,29 November 2006
The Sound of Music," An Exhaustive DVD Package and a Pristine Print Should Satisfy Fans of This Indisputable Musical Classic
","It's downright sacrilegious to say anything critical of this 1965 musical classic, and I have to admit I still love the movie like almost everyone else I know. Between the postcard-perfect Austrian scenery captured by Ted D. McCord's vibrant cinematography and the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein score, it's an irresistible entertainment with Julie Andrews ideally realizing the role of Maria, the young Salzburg novitiate nun who may be too independent to become part of the order. She is assigned by the abbey's Mother Superior to become a governess for the seven mischievous children of retired Navy Captain Von Trapp. The rest of the plot focuses on the burgeoning romance that develops not only between Maria and the Captain but also between the two principals and the children.A romantic triangle arises in the form of a Baroness who has her talons in the Captain until she realizes she cannot manipulate the inevitable, but the bigger conflict comes with the encroaching Nazi regime who attempts to strong-arm Von Trapp to serve in the Reich. A closer examination of the 174-minute movie really shows an odd imbalance to the narrative. The lighter first half is all told from Maria's perspective, and consequently, this is where most of the memorable songs are performed. After the intermission, Maria is pushed to the background when the Captain becomes engaged to the Baroness and then later when things heat up between him and the Nazi officials. Even though the story makes sense as presented, I've always thought this strange given the build-up of the story as Maria's personal odyssey.But no matter as the songs are beautifully staged and choreographed by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, in particular, the joyous Salzburg montage used for 'Do Re Mi', the unintended slumber party for 'My Favorite Things', the simplicity of the Captain's rendition of 'Edelweiss', the gauzy gazebo duet 'Something Good', the puppy love pas-de-deux in the same gazebo of 'Sixteen Going on Seventeen' and of course, the how-can-it-be-topped opening title song. Besides the transcendent Andrews (is it a wonder why we all fell in love with her back then?), Christopher Plummer is far more dimensional as Von Trapp than I remember from my youth. Not only does he capture the sternness, but he brings a saucy sense of humor and fey quality in his performance. Looking regal the way Hollywood stars used to, Eleanor Parker plays the Baroness not so much as a vindictive man-handler but more as a convincingly insecure woman too comfortable with her exalted status in life.In stock roles, Richard Haydn provides comic relief as the cagey impresario Max, while as Rolfe, Daniel Truhitte, in his only movie role, transforms from smitten bike messenger to cold Nazi youth in record time. As the Mother Superior, Peggy Wood brings calming assurance, though her dubbed performance of 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain' is a tad too operatic for my taste. The children are all well played, though I tend to think of Charmian Carr as a bit too Ann-Margret-kittenish as Liesl, especially as her singing voice does not sound remotely Tyrolean. Flaws aside, major credit should be given to director Robert Wise, who already performed similar chores on 'West Side Story' and has somehow mastered the art of pacing such a marathon musical story. Wise's frequent collaborator, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, adapted the original stage book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse with wit and heart and manages to tone down the innately saccharine tone of the story.The 2005 40th anniversary two-disc DVD package is obscenely full of extras which should satisfy the most persnickety aficionado. Still looking great at 70, Andrews provides brief introductions to both discs. First things first, the 2005 restoration effort and the transfer on the DVD have yielded a superb print, and it will not disappoint any fan of the movie. There are two commentary tracks, one done by Wise in a rather perfunctory fashion, the other a more anecdotal account by Andrews, Carr, Dee Dee Wood and the real Maria Von Trapp's youngest son Johannes. Then there is a very informative, 63-minute making-of documentary produced for the new DVD, 'My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers' which thoroughly discusses the history of the Von Trapp family, the Broadway incarnation and the complicated transfer of the stage show to screen  even though a number of participants provide recollections, not just Andrews.There are also two charming looking-back interview sessions. The first is a 20-minute conversation between Andrews and an especially acerbic Plummer, who seems to be ridiculing the original Maria in the Broadway version, stage legend Mary Martin, for her reputed megalomania. The second is a 33-minute group discussion among the seven actors who portrayed the Von Trapp children, all looking decidedly middle-aged (their ages now ranging from 47 to 62) and showing a friendly compatibility with one another in their remembrances. There is also a 22-minute featurette showing Carr revisiting the Salzburg locations, providing a history of the city and even joining in on The Sound of Music bus tour (I've done that one, too).Another short focuses on the current phenomenon of the sing-along screenings of the movie, this one a massive event at the Hollywood Bowl complete with extravagantly costumed viewers. Also included are a fascinating A&E Biography special of the real Von Trapps, a text-driven demonstration of the restoration process, and a real howler  scratchy screen test footage of an 18-year old Mia Farrow sounding particularly tone-deaf in her audition as Liesl (I only wish they had similar footage for others who auditioned like Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and the Osmond Brothers). Lastly, there are a number of trailers and an exhaustive photo gallery. Whew. This really defines what a complete DVD package is all about, and in this case, it's perfectly justifiable.",9,5,14,13 April 2006
Skyfall," A Surprising Bond Girl at the Center of Craig's Most Accomplished Turn as 007
","The now half-century-old James Bond franchise is still the epitome of spy-versus-spy action cool having survived the Cold War all the way through the new millennium, and Daniel Craig continues to carry the mythic mantle with steely resolve in his third entry in the series. Directed by top-level filmmaker Sam Mendes ('American Beauty'), this 2012 movie manages to be both a cheeky throwback to the character's legacy and a state-of-the-art Bourne-inspired terrorist thriller. It opens in classic style with a breathless chase through the streets of Istanbul and literally on the rooftops of the old city's Grand Bazaar with Bond and MI6 operative Eve hot on the trail of a target carrying a hard drive containing the identities of every British Secret Service agent. A shot is fired, mandated by M back in MI6's London headquarters, and knocks Bond into a river. This leads beautifully to the macabre Saul Bass-inspired title sequence underscored by Adele's sonorous vocals.Meanwhile, MI6 is under siege and goes underground when Bond finally resurfaces rattled by his near-death experience. Given a Walther PPK and tracking device by a new post-adolescent Q, Bond travels to Shanghai to confront the elusive target again in an exciting mano-a-mano fight. He is led by a sexy enigmatic woman named Severine to Silva, an ex-MI6 agent-turned-cyber-terrorist hell bent on revenge against M for sacrificing him on an espionage mission during the Hong Kong hand-off. As Silva starts killing off the agents identified on the disc, he arrives in London with the intent of publicly executing M, so Bond escapes with her to his childhood manor in the Scottish Highlands which gives the film its name. The story up to this point is genuinely thrilling, but by the time we get to the climax at Skyfall, the movie loses steam and most essentially, creative invention. It becomes an over-the-top conflagration in more ways than one leading to an inevitably fatalistic encounter in a chapel.What also struck me about this movie was the scarcity of Bond girls - only two, neither of whom figures in the climax - but then it dawned on me that Mendes and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan have really set up M as the ultimate Bond girl. Judi Dench has far more screen time in this film than in her other appearances, and she allows us a glimpse behind the starchy Machiavellian mother figure she has played so adroitly. As Silva, Javier Bardem sports another bad haircut (and a dye job this time) to play a Bond villain that balances precariously between menacing and campy. His fey manner and come-on scene with Bond are amusing enough, but the disjointed nature of his role comes from the fact that his vengeance is directed far more at M, not Bond. Eurasian French actress Bérénice Marlowe is stunning as Severine but only has one critical scene that allows her to show any dimension, while Naomie Harris ('28 Days Later') lends comely grit to Eve even if mainly on the sidelines.In an extended cameo that seems to beg for the return of Sean Connery (who would have been too distracting had he been cast), an almost unrecognizable Albert Finney plays Kincade, the resourceful gameskeeper of the Skyfall estate, in avuncular fashion. Ralph Fiennes shows up as an intelligence officer with the authority to determine the future of MI6, but it's clear his character is being set up for the next entry in the series. Joining Connery on the pantheon of 007s, Craig is really making his interpretation of Bond uniquely his own as the super-agent goes through what amounts to a mid-life crisis. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has provided expert lens work to previous Mendes projects like 'Revolutionary Road', captures the richness of the exotic locales - Shanghai, Macao, Istanbul, a deserted island in ruins, and even the Scottish highlands - with fluid dexterity. The film runs long at 143 minutes, especially since the last half-hour does not keep up the momentum built up to that point. The more important takeaway, however, is that the film is successful in whetting one's appetite for the 24th installment in the series.",8,2,9,24 November 2012
The Young Victoria," Stately Though Uninspired Look at a Beloved Queen's Budding Years Ruling the Empire
","All the period detail certainly looks right in this 2009 historical drama, but it amazes me how bloodless and staid the story feels under the pedestrian direction of Jean-Marc Vallée. That's unfortunate given how lively Emily Blunt can be in any number of on screen roles she has undertaken ('The Devil Wears Prada', 'Sunshine Cleaning'). The key problem is that Julian Fellowes' sensitive albeit dull screenplay focuses on what was obviously a happy marriage between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the consequence of which doesn't give rise to much dramatic fire unless wrapped conveniently in political intrigue, insanity or war. Attempts to add sharper edges to their love story wring hollow because at heart, Victoria is not presented as that compelling a historical figure.Because of her station in life, the teenaged Victoria is unable to rebel with any conviction. Her scheming, Machiavellian mother, the Duchess of Kent controls her every move, while her adviser John Conroy manipulates the duchess and her daughter with strong-arm tactics with the aim of forcing Victoria have him rule in her stead before she can mature into her role. However, Victoria steadfastly declines his directives in favor of ascending the throne herself upon the death of her beloved uncle, the cantankerous King William IV. Although young and naive, she rises to the challenge of becoming her country's soon-to-be longest-reigning monarch. In the midst of this transition, she falls for her cousin Albert even though he has been aggressively coached by her uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, to ensure a match occurs.Once Victoria confronts Albert about his ruse, their affection builds and turns into a marriage of mutual devotion with a common dedication to the expansion of arts and science in the empire. The only compelling barrier to Victoria and Albert's happiness is the cagey Lord Melbourne, her trusted, almost-Svengali-like adviser, whose motives remain murky and highly suspect throughout the five-year span of the story told in the movie. Blunt handles her stately role with aplomb, injecting the right level of vulnerability to a character whose ultimate calling came so early in her life. Unfortunately, compared to Cate Blanchett's meaty opportunities in the first 'Elizabeth', she is not given any scenes that take advantage of her innate fieriness. By comparison, Rupert Friend comes across a bit too pallid to make any real impression as Albert.Other worthy actors are given too little to do to strike more than single notes in their performances, for example, Miranda Richardson's petulant turn as the duchess, Mark Strong's Conroy trivialized into a stock villain, and Paul Bettany almost too subtly ambiguous as Melbourne. Only Jim Broadbent stands out in just three scenes as King William. The production details are executed just right from Hagen Bogdanski's clear-eyed cinematography to Patrice Vermette's sumptuous production design to Sandy Powell's pageantry of costumes. The 2010 DVD includes 22 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, a standard making-of featurette, a short comparing the movie' title character with the real Queen Victoria, in-depth looks at the film's coronation and wedding scenes, and a final piece that focuses on the costumes and locations.

The Hangover," Outrageous Bro-mantic Comedy Maintains Surprising Consistency in the Laughs Department
","I would have never considered seeing this 2009 bro-mantic comedy were it not for the fact that it has been garnering such strong critical reviews. My curiosity was piqued since on the surface, the film represents a sophomoric genre that targets a more juvenile, male-oriented audience. However, director Todd Philips ('Old School') infuses what could have been a tired premise with a no-holds-barred comedic sense which is refreshingly consistent and surprisingly human. The pacing is so frenetically furious that the filmmakers give a viewer little time to question the credibility of the often ridiculous plot turns. Written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the story revolves around a typical Vegas bachelor party where three close buddies get together for one last night of drink and debauchery. The trio of prospective groom Doug, straitlaced dentist Stu (who is engaged to a controlling harpy), and cynical schoolteacher Phil is joined by the bride's brother, Alan, a bearded, beer-bellied and socially awkward geek who turns out to be a little too desperate to be a natural member of this fraternal clan.The newly established quartet drives from LA to Vegas and ends up staying in a palatial $4,200-a-night suite at Caesar's Palace. After a rooftop Jägermeister toast, we flash forward to the morning after with their room completely trashed. Inflatable sex dolls in the hot tub, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in a closet, a hospital band on Phil's wrist, and Stu's missing front incisor are the only clues they have to figure out what happened the night before. Even worse, Doug is missing, and they have approximately 24 hours to find him for the wedding. What Philips does cleverly is turn his comic hi-jinks story into a detective story without sacrificing any of the raucous comedy. In fact, the subsequent plot draws broader and broader circles of implausibility with each development reinforcing the absurdist tone with sharp precision. Not too surprisingly, as the movie provides greater clarity on what exactly happened, the movie starts to lose momentum and becomes rather predictable with the inevitable climax of a high-speed scene. Nonetheless, some of the sight gags and set pieces are unapologetically hilarious, for instance, a stun-gun demo for a classroom of grade school children, a naked gangster pouncing from a car trunk, and a highly inappropriate rendition of 50 Cents' 'Candy Shop' at the wedding reception.Much of the film's success has to do with the easy rapport that the four principals have with each other. The absence of a dominating comedy figure like Will Ferrell or Steve Carell actually helps this time around. As Phil, Bradley Cooper ('He's Just Not That Into You') somehow manages to make the standard role of the cocksure alpha male into a genuinely likable character. Ed Helms (Andy in the US version of 'The Office') appears to be channeling a bit of Stephen Colbert in bringing out Stu's neurotic, self-protective tendencies. However, most of the laughs are supplied by stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, who makes Alan not only the model social outcast but also a subconscious manifestation of all the well-intentioned actions that get us in trouble. Justin Bartha has little to do as Doug, as does Heather Graham as an obliging stripper/hooker who finds herself married to Stu. Ken Jeong, the cranky obstetrician in 'Knocked Up', does a loopy turn as a gay gangster in a bit that goes on too long, and look for a very off-the-wall scene with Mike Tyson. The closing credits provide the details of the boys' notorious night through a hysterical series of increasingly outrageous photos.",8,2,4,6 July 2009
Marie Antoinette," Another Misunderstood Monarch and a Dazzling Visual Recreation of 18th Century France
","Director Sofia Coppola certainly takes an audacious look at the life of the legendary 18th century Queen of France who supposedly 'let them eat cake' in this elaborately costumed 2006 film. At the same time, Coppola keeps the dramatic focus relatively small versus the expansive political backdrop of the story. The approach works to a point since the filmmaker has an obviously reflective handle on how a young girl can feel when thrown unexpectedly into the spotlight and then made mincemeat by her critics (think of her aborted acting career when 1990's 'The Godfather III' was released).The downside is that the dramatic arc of the French monarch's life feels somewhat misshapen by this unique perspective since the film's first three-quarters meticulously follows Marie's youthful ascent to the throne and her wearying efforts to consummate her arranged marriage to Louis XVI. There are throwaway scenes of shopping sprees with her ladies-in-waiting and an underdeveloped illicit romance with Count Fersen, all of which would not look out of place in an episode of 'Sex and the City'. Once she conceives and delivers her first child, the movie starts to feel cursory about subsequent events with little of the historic context needed to make the climax resonate.For all the film's dramatic flaws, I have to say Kirsten Dunst is ideally cast in the title role. Starting her role as a 14-year old Austrian princess taken from her family, she captures not only the giggly vacuity but the sense of self-possession and decorum that makes her viable as a queen. A curiously cast Jason Schwartzman gained weight for the role of her bulbous, emotionally indifferent husband, Louis. He says relatively little but his natural awkwardness in period costume succeeds in making the king an ultimately sympathetic figure. Others come in and out of the story though with little resonance, even with proved scenery chewers like Judy Davis as the instructional Contesse de Noailles, Steve Coogan as the advice-giving Ambassador Mercy, Rip Torn as the libidinous Louis XV, and Asia Argento as his blatantly whorish mistress, Madame du Barry.What does work well are most of the visual elements - the use of real Versailles locales augmented by K.K. Barrett's luxuriant production design, Lance Acord's candy-colored cinematography, and Milena Canonero's resplendent costumes. The anachronistic use of 1980's-era new wave music, blended with the Baroque music true to the period and Jean-Benoît Dunckel and Nicolas Godin's original score, turns out to be a daring choice that works well toward Coppola's revisionist view of the queen. Yet for all the creativity on display, one is left to linger on the movie's unfulfilled possibilities of how the economic downturn and class disparities in 18th century France could be seen as a mirror for today. But that aspect obviously doesn't interest Coppola, who shows as she did in 'Lost in Translation', a deep affinity for women caught out of place and the ways they handle their loneliness.",5,2,4,29 October 2006
United 93," Devastating, Relentless and Ultimately CatharticEssential Viewing. Period.
","A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized 'United 93'. At once speculative and realistic, the 111-minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 9/11, but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.As it turns out, Greengrass's heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment, as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either under-the-radar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the real-life characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus, which a more commercial filmmaker would have done, he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film, including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently, we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That's not to say it is any less devastating. In fact, the last half-hour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just-promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. The film also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense, it is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point. This is truly essential viewing.",10,280,403,28 April 2006
Finding Neverland," If You Believe, Clap Your Hands...But Wait Until the Final Twenty Poignant Minutes
","It's no wonder Michael Jackson is drawn to Peter Pan and the concept of Neverland from this 2004 romanticized telling of playwright James M. Barrie's attachment to the Llewelyn Davies family as the inspiration for his classic play. Director Marc Forster, whose only other credit I know is the melodramatic and overrated 'Monster's Ball', draws fine performances from his cast, but the film itself is oddly uninvolving at least until the last twenty minutes. Forster, along with screenwriter David Magee, takes a rather reverential attitude toward their subject, and this beatific sense is heightened by the immaculate approach toward the production.The result seems targeted squarely at the Merchant-Ivory connoisseur of good taste, but somewhere along the way, the edges have been dulled, and the intensity of feeling that Barrie has for the boys has been mollified for a broader audience. Fortunately, Johnny Depp has been ideally cast as Barrie mimicking a convincing Scottish accent in a surprisingly restrained performance. Even so, his unsullied playfulness comes through in his scenes with the children even if they tend to go on ad nauseam. Looking almost too radiant with an innate inability to convey fragility, Kate Winslet has the saintly role of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the sickly mother who lives selflessly for her boys while in self-denial about her undisclosed illness.Even more thankless is the role of Barrie's social climbing wife Mary played in an overly pinched manner by Radha Mitchell (take a look at the outtakes to see a much livelier actress at work). Because her character is drawn in such shallow strokes, the unspoken love implied between Barrie and Sylvia seems all the more distracting from the main point of the story, the parallel between life and fantasy in Barrie's writing of 'Peter Pan'. Unbelievably nearly forty years since her enigmatic Lara in David Lean's 'Doctor Zhivago', Julie Christie plays the predictable part of Sylvia's unyielding, Gladys Cooper-type mother with conviction, supposedly the inspiration for Captain Hook. I only wish her character was developed more to match her well-missed talent. In an even smaller role, Dustin Hoffman plays money-conscious impresario Charles Frohman with welcome panache.All four boys are effortless though the standout is Freddie Highmore, who plays the pivotal role of third son Peter. He plaintively lends the gravity of a serious child recovering from his father's death and unwillingly in the throes of a man consumed with fantasy, especially poignant in the closing scene with Depp. The recreation of the original production of 'Peter Pan' is done well, even the fanciful scenes toward the end. I also think credit is due to composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, who provides an ethereal and evocative musical score.The DVD has the standard set of extras. Forster, Magee and producer Richard Gladstein - though sadly none of the actors - provide informative commentary on an alternate audio track. There are three deleted scenes and about five minutes worth of outtakes which frankly could have blessedly goosed the pacing of the film. Of course, there is the expected making-of featurette, 'The Magic of Finding Neverland' but also a quick film on the film's special effects which could have been much longer and a stars-on-the-red-carpet clip that is completely disposable.",6,1,3,14 December 2005
Gravity," Cuarón's Dazzling Space Odyssey Turns into a Cathartic Journey of the Human Spirit
","The irony of the film's title is that there isn't any, gravity that is, but that's not to say it lacks gravitas. It does in ways both unexpected and transcendent. It's been seven long years since Alfonso Cuarón's last film, 2006's emotionally propulsive thriller, 'Children of Men', which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse. Somehow, the less-than-prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound 2013 science-fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet 91 minutes. Although Ang Lee effectively used 3-D CGI effects to enhance the magical realism of 'Life of Pi', I have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as Cuarón does here within the dramatic structure of the story. Co-written with his son Jonás, the screenplay, by contrast, is life-size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon, at times poetic. This combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time, brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space. The story takes place about 372 miles above Earth, and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and special effects master Tim Webber.Pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen-minute sequence that opens the film. It's a bravura piece of cinema by anyone's standards. In brief, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the Hubble Space Telescope on the U.S Space Shuttle Explorer. Mission commander Matt Kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack. Mission Control reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes. There is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less Earth, and the damage to the craft and nearby International Space Station is extensive. It's enough to say that Stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home. If you don't count the voiceovers at the beginning, there are only two actors who make up the entire cast, and they are grade-A stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore.George Clooney has the smaller of the two roles as Kowalski, and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that Stone needs at the story's most critical points. He makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his character's life- affirming bravado. He also impressively wrote the scene. Even so, this is Sandra Bullock's film from start to finish, and it amazes me how she wasn't even among the top casting choices for the role (Angelina Jolie turned it down twice). Although Stone may come across as emotionally stunted, Bullock offers her natural likability as a necessary counterbalance. However, that observation short-changes her stellar work here, especially the pure physicality of her performance. Intriguingly, her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier in 'While You Were Sleeping' in that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely. Only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences, this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure. Regardless, this is Cuarón's towering cinematic achievement, and the movie truly stands on its own.",10,4,9,7 October 2013
To Be or Not to Be," Luminous Lombard and a Never-Better Benny Light Up Lubitsch's Classic Nazi Satire
","There is a certain sense of melancholy I feel when I watch this 1942 classic Ernst Lubitsch movie, as it represents the last appearance of the luminous Carole Lombard, surely the most breathtaking and high-spirited of actresses during Hollywood's golden era. In a rush to get home to husband Clark Gable after a successful war bond tour, she died in a plane crash during the film's post-production, and as the result proves without a doubt, the world lost one of the great treasures of the silver screen. She and co-star Jack Benny play Maria and Joseph Tura, the egocentric stars of a Polish acting troupe who are caught in the 1939 Nazi invasion of Warsaw. As a world-class flirt, she is carrying on with a handsome young pilot named Stanislav Sobinski, and their trysts begin once he hears his cue to get up from his theater seat, Hamlet's famous opening line to his soliloquy as spoken by an increasingly perturbed Joseph.The romantic triangle quickly takes a backseat to an espionage thriller involving a German spy named Professor Siletsky, who holds the names of members of the Polish underground. His intention is to kill them, but the acting troupe, now with their theater in ruins, band together to stop him. This includes the need for the extremely vainglorious Joseph to impersonate Siletsky in front of the befuddled Colonel Ehrhardt and for Maria to seduce any Nazi official who stands in their way. While it sounds like a piece of wartime propaganda, the film actually becomes more farcical even as people are getting killed.As Joseph, Benny has never been better, conveying both self-absorption and cunning expertly, and the script by Edwin Justus Mayer and an uncredited Lubitsch gives him a number of great one-liners. With her honey-toned voice and smoky elegance, Lombard is at the top of her game as the seductive Maria, as she dexterously shows her comic and dramatic sides with precision and unparalleled style. Delivering her lines with subtle finesse, she provides a strong match for Benny. Sixty-four years later, and there is still no one who can touch her. The rest of the ensemble is memorable starting with Sig Ruman's hilarious turn as Ehrhardt. A fresh-faced Robert Stack, all of 22, plays Sobinski with a callow, zestful energy, while Felix Bressart excels as the ultimately heroic Greenberg.The movie makes direct commentaries on the concentration camps, and the satirical aspects are blissfully unapologetic. The stylishness of the comedy in light of the virulent wartime setting is what makes the film memorable and it proves what a master Lubitsch was at this level of subtlety. The 2005 DVD comes with two extras both featuring Benny - an ancient twenty-minute comedy short from 1930 called 'The Rounder' and a brief commercial for war bonds. I wish they could have included some tribute to Lombard as it would have been fitting on this disc.",10,5,14,1 August 2006
I'm Not There," Flawed But Periodically Compelling Collage of Dylan Makes for a Murky Character Study
","I wish I was better prepared to accept the sheer audacity of Todd Haynes' wildly imagined take on Bob Dylan's life and legend because this 2007 film requires a certain mindset to accept a fragmented story thread that tethers together six disparate evocations of his persona. The conceit is that none of the personalities look remotely like him or have his name, which I believe is Haynes' main point, that Dylan is an enigmatic figure open to anyone's interpretation of who they think he is. Part of the frustration in watching the film is realizing that we don't know that much more about Dylan by the end. Most of the references to his checkered career in the screenplay co-written by Haynes and Oren Moverman will likely go past most viewers, even though many of the lines are direct quotes from Dylan. That's the most significant flaw of the approach taken here, that we are familiar enough with his life to make sense of the story being told.At the outset, we see Dylan as a black eleven-year-old who hops boxcars, writes folk songs as if he was living during the Great Depression, and goes by the name Woody Guthrie after his hero. Luckily, the precocious Marcus Carl Franklin is terrifically winning in the part. The second incarnation is Jack Rollins, a young 1960's-era folk singer with a political conscience played compellingly by Christian Bale. Julianne Moore, the star of Haynes' 2002 Douglas Sirk tribute, 'Far from Heaven', shows up in documentary-like footage being interviewed as a Joan Baez doppelganger. Bale also shows up later as Pastor John singing gospel songs reflecting Dylan's born-again conversion in 1979. With sometimes merciless bravado, Heath Ledger plays Robbie Clark, a Method-style Hollywood actor whose most acclaimed performance is of Rollins in a biopic. He gets married to a French girl, played affectingly by Charlotte Gainsborough, whom he eventually alienates with his obsessive, chauvinistic behavior.The most talked-about Dylan persona is embodied by Cate Blanchett, physically transformed into Jude Quinn, the male singer who achieves the pinnacle of his success in the mid-1960's only to face harsh criticism for going electric with his music. Looking more like a morosely arrogant k.d. lang, the actress gives a convincingly unapologetic performance as the drug-addicted musician whose media sound-bites were becoming a cynical series of non-sequiturs meant to make fools of the press. In the film's weakest passages, a rather somnambulant Richard Gere plays the latter-day Dylan as Billy the Kid in a surreal, San Peckinpah-influenced world set in the tense western town of Riddle. British actor Ben Whishaw rounds out the Dylan parade in a few faux-interviews as Arthur Rimbaud, a young rebel named after the tortured poet. To emphasize the differences among the Dylan interpretations, Haynes uses different film stock and narrative styles to tell the stories and then further convolutes matters by scrambling the disjointed fragments into a nearly random collage. Dylan's music is used throughout, sometimes as background, other times by contemporary performers lip-synched by the actors. His voice is an almost ghostly presence until he finally shows up playing his harmonica in 1960's-era documentary footage at the end.Part of me is genuinely impressed with Haynes' experimental-feeling narrative and how his film is imbued with an adventurous spirit that doesn't hold much concern for an audience's sensibilities. That's also the rub since it's difficult to have a feeling for an admittedly mysterious subject when the portrait is made up of six shards of a broken mirror. The two-disc 2008 DVD set provides plenty of extras starting with Haynes' rather elliptical commentary track. Also on Disc One are four text pieces under 'Intro to Film', one describing the film's six principal characters as facets of Dylan. Disc Two contains six shorts featuring each of the characters replicating the famous card-dropping in Dylan's 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' video. There are also two deleted scenes, four alternative/extended scenes, and an outtakes reel, the total of which runs about a half-hour. Audition tapes of Franklin and Whishaw and a tribute to Ledger are also included, as well as footage from the New York premiere and a twenty-minute featurette on the making of the soundtrack. The centerpiece of the second disc is 'A Conversation with Todd Haynes', a portrait of the filmmaker running about 45 minutes that has Haynes talking about the genesis of the film and how it was made. More Dylan-specific text pieces and two theatrical trailers round out the extras.",5,3,3,13 May 2008
Star Trek," Humanity Trumps Dazzling Effects in an Origins Prequel Not Exclusive to Trekkers
","It's a little-known fact that none other than Lucille Ball is responsible for the birth of 'Star Trek'. As the titular head of Desilu Studios in the 1960's, she green-lit former LA cop Gene Roddenberry's idea of an intergalactic western and championed the series during its brief three-year run on NBC. It is amazing to consider how the franchise continues to thrive 43 years later, so much so that director J.J. Abrams ('Lost') and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have been able to re-imagine the legacy of the series without sacrificing the fidelity needed to satisfy the throngs of rabid fans who pushed the grosses north of the $200 million mark in its first week of release. As someone who is not remotely a Trekker, I have to admit the creators have done a fine job of reincarnating the familiar characters into their youthful counterparts and concocted an engaging, time-traversing plot that smartly avoids heavy exposition in favor of action and pyrotechnics. The result can be sometimes mind-numbing and trivial, but the 122-minute movie is never dull.The densely populated plot throws us forward to the year 2233 (or backwards depending on your perspective on 'Star Trek' lore) as the USS Kelvin confronts a major alien vessel captained by an embittered Romulan named Nero. An alternate timeline is revealed, and inevitable tragedies ensue. Years later, we meet the familiar characters from the TV series culminating in the USS Enterprise's maiden voyage. James Kirk is a cocksure hothead with obvious Starfleet Academy potential, but he is haunted by the father he never knew. The half-human, half-Vulcan Spock is a brilliant student-turned-control freak by his nature but sometimes unable to reconcile the two sides of his identity. Their initially hostile relationship provides much of the film's spark, as they one-up each other in face a common enemy in Nero. This provides a good excuse for the CGI-enhanced action sequences with a plethora of explosions and characters zooming in and out of frame. By the time you start to feel the excess and redundancy in this approach, the story wraps the viewer up in its core ethos - that the Enterprise crew is an extended rainbow coalition of a family even as entire civilizations are destroyed.Abrams and crew are smart enough to recognize that the movie has to capture the heart of the original series in a way that doesn't patronize fans yet engage us non-Trekkers. Most of the casting choices are solid, although a couple of them are rather distracting. With the lightweight veneer of a tween idol, Chris Pine captures the braggadocio and roughhewn manner of a youthful Kirk in a way that tethers him to Shatner's real-life personality without doing an outright imitation of the elder actor. Even better is Zachary Quinto who has little latitude to vary Spock from fan expectation, yet he brings subtle but palpable currents of humanity to his stoic character. The rest of the crew is painted in broader strokes with Karl Urban coming closest to caricature as 'Bones' McCoy; Anton Yelchin, laying on a thick, Cold War-era Russian accent as the extremely young Chekhov; and Simon Pegg ('Hot Fuzz') pulling out all the comedy stops as exiled engineer Scotty. Somewhat more subtle are Zoë Saldana ('Guess Who') as linguist specialist Uhuru, who has a surprising relationship with Spock, and John Cho ('Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle') showing that he can handle action sequences with dexterity as neophyte helmsman Sulu.Covered with latex, Eric Bana is hardly recognizable as Nero, although he makes the most of his character's stock vengeance motives. It's genuinely odd, however, to see Tyler Perry ('Madea Goes to Jail') as the head of the Starfleet Academy and especially the still-doe-eyed Winona Ryder trying to look maternal as Spock's human-side mother. Among cinema's comic book franchises, this one is closer to 'The Dark Knight' than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' on the quality scale. Visually, it doesn't disappoint with Daniel Mindel's dazzling, kinetic cinematography and Scott Chambliss' creative production design that mixes retro and futuristic elements seamlessly. At the same time, the convenient timeline jumble doesn't really give rise to any complex moral quandaries beyond the importance of building friendships and trusting your colleagues. Nonetheless, the movie is propulsive entertainment which doesn't tamper with its genesis and focuses squarely on the humanity of the familiar characters. For that accomplishment, we should all be grateful.",8,1,8,9 June 2009
Citizen Kane," A Young Man's Audacious, Precocious and Fully Realized Cinematic Vision
","Laying claim to being the greatest movie ever made is bound to attract extensive essays from cineastes dismantling the film every which way ad infinitum. Suffice it to say that Orson Welles' first-time effort as a filmmaker remains an astonishing and often unparalleled work. Only 25 years old at the time, he provides an audacious vision in which all the parts of this 1941 masterpiece fit perfectly together with a furious precision. Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors. The beauty of the film comes from the simple fact that no single component dominates the other.The result is as cohesive a vision as has likely been seen on screen and one that Welles was never able to recapture for the rest of his life no matter how hard he tried. The film examines the life of a William Randolph Hearst doppelganger named Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who has amassed a fortune and more than a few enemies. The plot revolves around the mysterious utterance of 'Rosebud' as Kane's dying words and how an investigative reporter interviews the people in Kane's life to find out the hidden meaning of that word. The interviews provide the means for selective flashbacks to his lonely childhood, his beginnings as a yellow journalist in building a publishing empire with closest confidante Jedidiah Leland, his first marriage to wealthy socialite Emily Norton, his scandal-laden run for governor, his obsession in turning second wife Susan Alexander into a world-class opera singer, and his sad decline at his isolated mountaintop estate, Xanadu.The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption. It is startling how convincing Welles is as an aging magnate, and his naturally larger-than-life persona fits nicely into the Shakespearean contours of the character. The cast consists entirely of his Mercury Theater troupe with Joseph Cotten a particular standout as Leland. I always found Dorothy Comingore a bit too cartoonish as Susan, the character inspired by real-life movie star Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress, but more subtle turns by Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother and Ruth Warrick as Emily more than compensate.The 60th Anniversary, two-disc DVD set has enough material to please Kane aficionados beginning with two separate but equally valuable commentary tracks, one by director and Welles confidante Peter Bogdanovich and the other by film critic Roger Ebert. Bogdanovich is more academic in his approach even though he had the personal relationship with Welles, while Ebert can barely contain his enthusiasm with each scene he describes. The first disc also contains the original trailer, a brief newsreel of the film's New York premiere and three sections of intriguing material focusing on the production, post-production and the press book. The second disc contains a fascinating 1996 documentary feature, 'The Battle Over Citizen Kane', which focuses on Hearst's attempts to ruin the film. To put it mildly, this DVD set reflects essential viewing.",10,1,2,24 April 2007
Inglourious Basterds," A Fantastical, Revisionist Look Back at World War II, Tarantino Style
","Polarizing filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's unadulterated love of cinema is really the most pervasive factor in his fantastical 2009 World War II adventure. Running an epic-length 153 minutes, it may appear on the surface like 'The Longest Day', but the director/writer takes inspiration from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Robert Aldrich's 'The Dirty Dozen', Hollywood wartime propaganda B-movies, and his own adrenaline-infused and blackly comic films ('Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill') to tell an audacious 'what-if?' story about a group of guerrilla U.S. soldiers in Nazi-occupied France. The tightly wound plot revolves around three key figures: Colonel Hans Landa, an elegant, seemingly bloodless Nazi officer known as 'The Jew Hunter'; Lt. Aldo Raine, a Tennessee-born resistance fighter who has organized a special squad of Jewish-American soldiers whose goal is scalping and killing Nazis; and Emmanuelle Mimieux (née Shosanna Dreyfus), a pensive young Jewish woman who runs a movie theater in Paris.As presented by Tarantino over the course of five discrete chapters, the three disparate figures converge upon Mimieux's theater for the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film called 'A Nation's Pride'. There in attendance is to be not only Third Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels but also the Fuehrer himself. Needless to say, the filmmaker has carefully set up all his chess pieces for a flamboyant finale that represents a manifestation of some kind of crude moral justice that revisionist history allows only grand storytellers like Tarantino. Riddled with quirky incongruities, some of which border a bit too closely to self-parody, his signature style is evident through a series of set pieces, most heavy on insinuating dialogue, that suddenly explode like the tavern mêlée in La Louisiane.In a turnabout from his Oscar-baiting performance last year as the passive Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt brings cocksure arrogance to Raine in an enjoyably hammy turn. Mélanie Laurent perfectly captures Shosanna's simmering resentment until her cathartic release during the explosive conclusion, while Diane Kruger cuts a somewhat more predictable figure as a Dietrich-like femme fatale actress in cahoots with Raine's battalion. Tarantino fills smaller roles with oddball choices like Mike Myers as a pip-pip British general, Rod Taylor ('The Birds') as Churchill, and 'Hostel' director Eli Roth as a baseball bat-wielding Nazi killer. Regardless, the best work comes Christoph Waltz's nuanced turn as the sadistic Landa. It's a masterfully subtle performance amid a movie that is anything but subtle.Waltz's best scene comes right at the beginning with his unbearably tense conversation with a stoic French farmer suspected of hiding a family of Jews. There is also glorious camera-work from veteran cinematographer Robert Richardson ('JFK'). The extras seem a bit too stretched out for the 2009 two-disc set, especially with no Tarantino commentary being offered in this package. Instead, on the first disc, we get two extended scenes and one alternate, the movie-within-the-movie 'A Nation's Pride', and a few trailers. The second disc offers a half-hour round table discussion among Tarantino, Pitt, and film critic Elvis Mitchell; a faux-making-of featurette for 'A Nation's Pride'; a discussion of the original Italian movie, 'Inglorious Bastards' (upon which this movie bears little similarity); and a few other more obscure extras. Love it or hate it, the film reflects the filmmaker's uniquely audacious style in his most serious effort to date.",8,0,5,3 March 2010
Iron Man 2," Call Him Irony Man.the Name Fits Downey's Clever Approach to a Tortured Superhero
","The inevitable sequel to the 2008 smash proves once again the perfect fit between actor and character as Robert Downey Jr. plays the title role with his rakish wit and deep sense of irony fully intact from the first film. Sharply directed once again by actor Jon Favreau and shrewdly written by another actor, Justin Theroux, the 2010 blockbuster is as much an actors' showcase as it is a special effects-saturated comic book adventure. This precarious balance is what made the first film so ideal, and while the surprise element has been replaced in part by a breezy familiarity in the sequel, the result is still far more entertaining than most in its genre. This is despite the fact that the movie is overpopulated with colorful characters, most worthy of a film of their own.Overkill is a common problem in heavily invested Hollywood studio product like this, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As hedonistic billionaire Tony Stark, the actor has to face off with no less than three villains, two figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in distress depending on the plot machinations. The story picks up Stark six months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life.Meanwhile, taciturn, cockatoo-loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is plotting revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit, while U.S. Senator Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's excessively destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is introduced in an ambivalent manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time. It all comes to a head at the expo where Vanko and Hammer have colluded to produce an aerial battle royale.That's a whole lot of plot to fit into a 124-minute movie, but at least the momentum never flags. The problem for comic fanboys may well be the dearth of action sequences. The showdowns between Stark and Vanko create the necessary tension although the build-ups are rather predictable, and the climactic battle sequence feels more like a swirling meteor shower since it takes place at night. Still, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and art director J. Michael Riva do first-rate work here with the production details. Moreover, the actors do their best even if their characters are given short shrift in the screenplay. Mickey Rourke relies on his own uncomfortably maniacal screen persona and idiosyncratic touches to embody Vanko's two-dimensional motives, while Sam Rockwell is even more cartoonish with a petulant, hammy albeit amusing turn as Hammer.Replacing Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle does what he can as the put-upon best friend and archetypal soldier, but Rhodey has to represent the film's most thankless role. A surprisingly cast Garry Shandling brings a nice edge to the avuncular senator, and Favreau himself repeats his role as Stark's loyal chauffeur Happy Hogan. No fool as a director, he gets to face off to primarily comic effect with Scarlett Johansson, properly feline and physically adroit in her black catsuit, as Natalie. Her ball-breaking 'Charlie's Angels'-style fight sequence is entertaining if a bit derivative. As Pepper, Gwyneth Paltrow gets more to do this time around, bantering with Downey with Nick-and-Nora-level élan, but the character is near-impossible to believe. Fans, however, will have no problem loving and believing in the sequel, but the pervasive one-liners and the wild zigzags between hubris and insecurity make a strong case to redub the hero Irony Man.",8,1,2,19 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," The Judd Apatow Factory Produces a Genial Though Meandering Break-Up Comedy
","As the latest offering from the prolific Judd Apatow stable, this meandering but amusing 2008 comedy probably had one of the most irritating advertising campaigns ever for a wide release movie as cryptic billboards were posted everywhere with nasty diatribes written to the title character. Having enjoyed Apatow's 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up' a lot, I am starting to realize there is a bit more of a potluck feel when Apatow isn't in the director's chair. This time, first-time director Nicholas Stoller is at the helm working from a script written by the film's star, Jason Segel. Granted the comic premise is not as fresh here as in the earlier films, but it is entertaining in a ramshackle sort of way with some moments of surprising nuance. Segel plays Peter Bretter, a typical nice-guy type who writes the music (or more accurately, the sonic tones) of a network TV series that looks very much like 'CSI'. The show stars his hot-babe girlfriend Sarah, and they've been together for five years, an eternity at least by Hollywood standards.The film wastes no time in setting up the central problem - Sarah abruptly dumps Peter for Brit rock star Aldous Snow, and through the plot's key contrivance, the three of them end up in the same resort in Hawaii. Naturally, Peter is devastated by the break-up, especially when he has to watch Sarah and Aldous in post-coital euphoria in a tropical honeymoon setting. Peter does find solace in the shapely form and understanding heart of Rachel Jansen, the hotel's front desk manager. All of this is fairly by-the-numbers and reminds me of the tropical shenanigans in the inferior remake of 'The Heartbreak Kid', except Segel as a writer makes all the characters likable to varying degrees. Aldous, as played dexterously by comedian Russell Brand, is a hilarious comic creation, a sexed-up, non-sequitur-spouting cast-off from Spinal Tap. Even Sarah comes across less as a vicious harpy and more as someone who felt she tried to salvage the relationship (although obviously, interpersonal communication must not be one of her strong suits).As Peter, Segel has a doughy, affable appeal though not particularly arresting for a main character. When he's not being teary-eyed over Sarah or just plain naked, he has a tendency to throw away lines in a casual manner rather than deliver them. Saddled with the toughest part, Kristen Bell ('Veronica Mars') acquits herself well enough as Sarah to make her character's fate more of a concern than one would expect. Late of 'That 70's Show', the saucy Mila Kunis provides a down-to-earth sexiness to Rachel. Of course, several members of the Apatow repertory company are present and accounted for - Bill Hader as Peter's sarcastic brother, Jonah Hill as a waiter with a severe man-crush on Aldous (perhaps a tweak to his role in 'Superbad'), and Paul Rudd as a stoned surfing instructor (Seth Rogen is conspicuously absent). Funny bits are also provided by Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on '30 Rock') as a petrified honeymooner and comic Steve Landesberg as a helpful pediatrician. As usual for an Apatow movie, the movie goes on for too long, and the scenes with the competing couples, while funny, play on the predictable side, as does the inevitable ending. It's all funny enough but just not as focused as I wish it could have been.",6,3,11,23 April 2008
The Hunger Games," Survivalist Adventure with Satirical Reality TV Sensibilities Benefits from Lawrence's Star Turn
","Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga's 'The Burning Plain' (2008), Drake Doremus's 'Like Crazy' (2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik's 'Winter's Bone' (2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of the 'X-Men: First Class' in the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in 'Winter's Bone' that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, 'Survivor'-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two 'tributes' from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' ('Seabiscuit') surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray ('Shattered Glass'); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in 'The Grapes of Wrath'. Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district 'tribute' at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the 'tributes', they are groomed and trained in a style akin to 'American Idol'. This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underrated 'The Truman Show'. However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the 'tributes' meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the hand-held camera-work by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.Josh Hutcherson ('The Kids Are All Right') doesn't make as vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the 'tributes', Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley ('American Beauty') as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films like 'The Running Man' and even ancient relics like 'The Most Dangerous Game'. It's a pretty effective start to the trilogy.",7,4,15,12 April 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Shiver Me Timbers! Captain Jack Returns in a Lumbering Adventure That Improves in the Second Half
","Johnny Depp's preening cheekiness as Captain Jack Sparrow continues to be the invaluable glue that holds together this action-packed, over-the-top movie, the second in a trilogy inspired by the well-loved, nearly forty year-old ride in Disneyland. The jam-packed story picks up relatively soon after the point where the last one left off with spunky Elizabeth Swann about to marry adventurer Will Turner. Complications come in the form of British East India Trading Company's Lord Cutler Beckett, who charges the couple with conspiring to help Sparrow escape from the company's clutches. Death is their fate unless they can secure Sparrow's magical compass for Beckett. Sparrow has troubles of his own as he has sold his soul to the legendary dawn-of-the-dead pirate, Davy Jones, fabled captain of the Flying Dutchman, in exchange for the right to command his vessel, the Black Pearl. Sparrow's one option is to find the key to a chest containing Jones' still-beating heart.The story lines eventually collide but not before the main characters run into a voodoo woman, Tia Dalma, full of mystical advice on how to get the key; Elizabeth's jilted swain, Commodore James Norrington, out for revenge against Will; Will's lost-soul father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, somewhere between life and death; and a mammoth, octopus-like sea monster named Kraker. After a shaky start with far too much exposition, director Gore Verbinski gets the momentum finally going in the second hour with heart-racing action escalating in both scope and absurdity, although screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio tend to layer all the developments in a most convoluted manner. Despite the pacing problems, what I do like about the film is its persistently irreverent tone and the way death is treated not as the final end but as a relative inconvenience. From my perspective, this is what makes the movie's spirit come alive for a contemporary viewer.Beyond Depp's devilishly clever performance, the real star is unsurprisingly the CGI-generated special effects, whether it's Jones and his ocean-morphed crew of half men/half sea creatures (the hammerhead shark is a particularly creepy figure to watch); Kraker and its engulfing destruction (though this gets repetitive in the story); or the variety of memorable action set pieces, such as the Black Pearl crew swinging in a ravine to escape their suspended spherical cages, or concurrently, Sparrow precariously maneuvering a pole where he inadvertently becomes part of a fruit shish kebob. My favorite set piece is the runaway waterwheel on the island where Will, Norrington and Sparrow are preoccupied with their swashbuckling and the search for the chest. The audacious silliness of these action sequences is what keeps the movie afloat.Both Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom return from the first film as Elizabeth and Will. Looking beautiful, even disguised as a boy, Knightley has been promoted into more of an action role here and handles her part with aplomb. Bloom is still a relatively colorless presence but fulfills the heroic dimensions of the part almost by default. As Davy Jones, Bill Nighy is able to create an intriguing character underneath the CGI-generated visage of octopus tentacles, and in a tribute to Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea', has a great scene where he plays the numerous keys of a pipe organ all at once. Granted, at 150 minutes, the epic movie does run too long for the story it tells, and the lumbering series of climaxes seems excessive. Regardless, it's still grand fun thanks to Depp and the oozing, barnacle-encrusted realism of the CGI effects.",7,1,4,9 July 2006
Argo," Affleck the Filmmaker Soars on His Third Effort with an Evocative Historic Thriller
","Ben Affleck the actor has never impressed me much, a journeyman who has made some real stinkers ('Gigli', 'Surviving Christmas'), but Ben Affleck the filmmaker has really come into his own. His third film as a director ('Gone Baby Gone', 'The Town') is a first-rate political thriller with a pulpish fervor and keen intelligence. The Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81 takes on revitalized life in this engrossing 2012 movie with great period detail and a well-turned screenplay by first- timer Chris Terrio. The recent Benghazi killings only makes this story resonate more with an event hidden from history prior to 1997 propulsively dramatized here as a turning point in the precarious state of U.S. relations with the entire Arab world. It's fascinating to consider the truth behind the 'best bad idea' the CIA could concoct to rescue six U.S. embassy workers who managed to escape the compound. There's a blessedly brief prologue chronicling the events that led to the Shah's exile to the U.S. and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini and fundamentalist Islam in Iran leading to the tense hostage situation.The six workers found refuge at the Canadian embassy. With the CIA at a loss to figure out how to sneak them out of Iran, exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez is inspired a bit of 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes' to come up with an incredulous plot to have the six pose as a Canadian film crew who were flown to Teheran to scout locations for a phony sci-fi film that gives this movie its name. Mendez enlists prosthetics expert, real-life makeup artist John Chambers, to help convince veteran producer Lester Siegel to get studio backing for the fake epic. Siegel insists the picture look credible, so he buys an existing script, holds a reading with real actors at the Beverly Hilton, and starts an advertising campaign in the trade papers. All the gears are set in motion as Mendez's boss Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan. Mendez flies to Teheran with doctored passports in hand and tries to convince the six to act out their roles with precise detail before they get recognized by Iranian officials as escapees from the embassy. This race against the clock provides the tension in the film's final act, which comes down to a rather implausible albeit extremely thrilling chase scene at the airport. With Affleck in mostly stoic mode as Mendez, the cast is solidly effective with three unsurprising standouts – John Goodman as the avuncular Chambers, Bryan Cranston as the acerbic O'Donnell, and Alan Arkin who steals all his scenes with ease as Siegel. All the period detail is excellent from the tacky clothes to the Turkish locations standing in for Iran. The slightly washed-out documentary- style of Rodrigo Prieto's ('Brokeback Mountain') cinematography perfectly captures the crowded, often squalid atmosphere. There's also an evocative use of vintage TV news clips featuring Mike Wallace's infamous interview with Khomeini. The final explanation of how the real story of the mission unfolded is provided in a voice-over by Jimmy Carter, who was President when it all took place up until the rest of the hostages were released. The film is a genre picture at heart but a historically evocative and emotionally powerful one thanks to Affleck's impressive work behind the camera.",9,0,0,2 November 2012
12 Angry Men," Powerful Ensemble Performance in Still Potent Jury Room Drama
","With the recent deaths of Jack Warden (just this past week) and John Fiedler, only Jack Klugman survives from the original 1957 movie cast of this blistering, uncommonly well acted drama, a triumphant first feature for now-revered director Sidney Lumet. Written by veteran TV scribe Reginald Rose, the story takes place almost entirely within the confines of a Manhattan jury room. Already overheated by the scorching weather, the twelve men are locked in heated debate over the fate of a ghetto youth accused of murdering his father. Over the course of ninety minutes, we get to know the individual personalities of the jurors in ways that surprise even themselves in a most claustrophobic setting.The chief battle occurs between Juror #8, who believes a comprehensive discussion of the evidence is necessary before coming to a verdict, and Juror #3, who is convinced it is an open-and-shut case. The drama unfolds as the others move from one side to the other, as questions of objectivity and neutrality are put to the test with each character. It certainly helps to have a sterling cast of familiar faces inhabit the roles of the nameless jurors. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8 with his becalming dignity constantly stretched by the ongoing pressure of a fast verdict. Never the most subtle of actors, Lee J. Cobb is a blustery force as Juror #3 as he slowly reveals his own personal issues leading to his seemingly intractable guilty verdict.E.G. Marshall plays the cold-blooded elitist stockbroker, while Edward Binns is the inarticulate house painter intent on maintaining a sense of fair play in the room. Warden is a small-time hustler only interested in making the baseball game, Fiedler (later memorable as the meek Mr. Peterson on 'The Bob Newhart Show') is the eager bank teller who demands to be heard, Martin Balsam is the overly accommodating foreman uncomfortable in his role as the foreman and Robert Webber is the glad-hand pre-yuppie willing to go with the crowd.The most vivid impressions are left by Ed Begley's unapologetic racist, George Voskovec's dignified watch maker, Joseph Sweeney's seemingly befuddled senior; and Klugman's shy juror who more than anyone else, comes to empathize with the accused. The film's one slight flaw is that it tips its hand at the outset with the tone of passivity emanating from the judge and the wide-eyed fear in the accused's face. The black-and-white film comes in a clean print on the 2001 DVD but little else except the original theatrical trailer. A masterful work of economy and escalating dramatic tension.",9,0,0,1 August 2006
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Smart, Dexterous Roundelay of Love's Labor Lost
","I tend to underestimate Steve Carell on the big screen probably because of titles like 'Dinner with Schmucks', 'Evan Almighty', and of course, 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin', but when given the opportunity as he did in 2007's 'Dan in Real Life' and as he does in this grown-up 2011 comedy, he can provide unexpected dimension to an otherwise put-upon, sad-sack character. Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman, this movie is overlong at 118 minutes and has contrivances galore, but it's also smart, shrewdly observed, and richly character-driven. These qualities override the flaws primarily due to a well-assembled cast that also includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei. Fogelman's screenplay punctuates big life lessons with clever scenes and ensemble set pieces that really snap and play like a Shakespearean roundelay.The plot centers on nebbish suburbanite Cal Weaver, who after two decades of seemingly content marriage, finds out his wife Emily has been unfaithful with her co-worker and wants a divorce. As the reality of his situation settles in, he moves from comatose to resentful to relentlessly morose at which point he has a chance meeting in a trendy bar with a self-confident womanizer named Jacob Palmer. Through reasons that go unexplained, Jacob decides to make Cal his pet project and make him over into a smooth-talking dating machine in an amusing montage that climaxes with a date with Kate, a jittery middle schoolteacher who turns out to be something of a nymphomaniac. Emily stumbles in her newly liberated state, while her and Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie grapples with a long-standing crush on his high-school-age babysitter Jessica who is smitten with someone substantially older. Meanwhile, Jacob goes through a transformation of his own as he falls for a sassy-smart young lawyer named Hannah who initially doesn't succumb to his fool-proof pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.Ficarra and Requa have a nice way of shaping Fogelman's dialogue into the pacing of the scenes, but they spend far too long in the middle of the story making the loose ends look more pronounced toward the end. Dexterous performances which effortlessly balance the comic and humane elements are essential to making the shenanigans work, and they're here in spades. Carell mines his character Cal in unexpected ways but doesn't lose his keen sense of comedy. As Jacob, Gosling is a nice surprise as he breezes through a role that could have been far more repellent had love not befuddled him so completely. Stone, currently Hollywood's 'It' girl, nicely complements him as the acerbic Hannah, and their extended sequence at his elegant home is really well played by both actors. As Emily, Moore is the rare actress who can play a character who commits an unforgivable act and still can elicit viewer sympathy. Jonah Bobo plays Robbie with deadpan precociousness, while the too-thin Analeigh Tipton fluently brings out all the awkward gawkiness in Jessica. Tomei's turn as Kate is brief albeit a memorable one highlighted by a very funny classroom scene, while Kevin Bacon plays Emily's co-worker with his character's smarminess in check. This is one of the better comedies released this year.",8,1,2,27 August 2011
Madagascar," A Blitzkrieg of Colorful Images and One-Liners Covers a Soft-Centered Core
","I was not that interested in seeing this latest animated DreamWorks concoction until I saw an 11-minute short, 'A Christmas Caper' just before the wondrous Wallace and Gromit feature, 'The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'. In expertly rendered computer animation, it starred four physically adroit penguins who not coincidentally steal the feature-length film from which they originate. At 86 minutes, 'Madagascar' has several entertaining scenes, brightly colored images and a kinetic pace that doesn't flag, but somehow the film falls short of the Pixar features to which the creators seem to aspire. A lot of it has to do with co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath trying too hard and co-screenwriters Mark Burton and Billy Frolick cramming a lot of story within its comparatively brief running time. They provide some sharp lines and winking references to other movies, but the movie lacks an ironic punch that would have made it truly memorable.The plot focuses on two animals, best friends in spite of their different species - a curiously dissatisfied zebra named Marty, who dreams of what life must be like outside his admittedly comfortable digs at the Central Park Zoo in New York, and an egocentric lion named Alex, who enjoys the limelight at the zoo but comes to terms with his natural tendencies amid the wilds of the jungle. It is both a blessing and a curse to have Chris Rock and Ben Stiller provide the voices for Marty and Alex respectively. While they provide some expectedly funny moments, their motor-mouthed presence makes the film pretty exhausting to sit through without fidgeting, especially as Rock seems to be imitating Eddie Murphy's Donkey in the 'Shrek' series. Neither seems to be directed to develop characters but rather magnify their personalities. Faring marginally better on the sidelines are Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria, the no-nonsense hippopotamus, and David Schwimmer in Ross Geller overdrive as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe.Once the setting moves to the Rousseau-like tableaux of Madagascar, the movie improves considerably with the addition of comical lemurs in thrall of the crate-wrecked visitors - Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G, plays the hilariously despotic King Julien XIII with a heavy dollop of Indian curry, Cedric the Entertainer is the put-upon Maurice and Andy Richter makes the saucer-eyed Mort sound like the first cousin of a Spielberg gremlin. There is even a nod to the actual 'Born Free' movie not only in the use of the theme song in the opening but in a relatively somber sequence that has Alex coming back to his natural tendencies among the feared fossas to the increasing fear of his lifelong friends. But the movie's brightest spots are provided by the four penguins (voiced by members of the crew) and two erudite monkeys who are used mostly as transitional cues in the story.The DVD has a fairly standard set of extras, though I liked the alternate audio commentary track provided by the penguins. The deleted scenes, 'Mad Mishaps', are fairly incompressible for their deletion other than the fact that they aren't in finished form, and 'The Tech of Madagascar' is quite dry as is usual for seeing the mechanics behind computer animation. For the kids, there is the video for the inescapable 'I Like to Move It, Move It' song by the lemurs and video games galore, as well as 'Enchanted Island', a genuine educational featurette on the real Madagascar.",5,1,2,12 December 2005
The Other Boleyn Girl," Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselvesand Their Greedy Families in 16th-Century Tudor England
","When they were publicizing the theatrical release of this film during a fluffy interview with Matt Lauer on 'The Today Show', Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman came across as two attractive, sensible young women who admired each other to no end. Ironically, that bonding is exactly what works against the movie, specifically the lack of a sharp edge in their characters' intractable relationship which dilutes how far sibling rivalry can go in shaping fates and destroying lives. Granted there's a palpably pulpish tone to this fanciful 2008 historical fiction based on Phillipa Gregory's 2002 novel, but the royal intrigue in the House of Tudor is overwhelmed by melodramatic flourishes and transparent character development. First-time feature director Justin Chadwick (BBC's 'Bleak House') has made a handsome film with an attractive trio of stars, but he places most of his focus on the soap opera elements of the book's adaptation by Peter Morgan, a specialist in merging fiction with truth ('The Queen', 'The Last King of Scotland'), and lays waste to what could have been a more fully rounded historical drama.The overstuffed story begins with a cursory portrayal of the Boleyn sisters, headstrong Anne and diffident Mary. Even though Mary is married to wealthy courtier William Carey, the sisters soon find themselves in a competition for the affections of King Henry VIII, thanks to the machinations of their weak-willed father Thomas and their Machiavellian uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Henry is initially drawn toward Mary's gentle nature, siring an illegitimate son as he is still married to the barren Catherine of Aragon. However, Mary's difficult pregnancy and mandatory bedrest opens an opportunity for Anne, who uses all her cunning wiles to land the King. At the expense of Mary's happiness, Anne succeeds but not before the creation of the Church of England and her own ascension to England's Queen. Meanwhile, Henry evolves from gregarious womanizer to haunted despot, and everyone already knows what becomes of Anne at the end. The film's perspective alternates between the sisters, thus reducing Henry to a convenient plot device. Thanks to the film's broad brush strokes, the challenge for the viewer is to monitor the imbalance between the sisters. For instance, Mary is rather bland in her virtue but her story is affecting, while Anne is comparatively intriguing in her blind ambition but her fate feels less than tragic.I still think Johansson is the more natural temptress on screen, but she actually plays Mary and manages to elicit sympathy to her character with surprising ease. However, Portman gets the lion's share of meaty scenes and runs with them, especially a couple of effective face-offs with Henry. As expected, both are alluring in period costume even as their accents waver a bit. As Henry, Eric Bana seems to have been hired for his brooding persona and beefcake appeal, while the character's lightning-fast transitions make Henry an elliptical figure at best in Morgan's truncated script. Kristin Scott Thomas again brings her innate chilliness to the abbreviated role of Boleyn's mother, while there are mildly interesting turns by Jim Sturgess ('Across the Universe') as devoted brother George, Mark Rylance as Thomas, and David Morrissey (Sharon Stone's befuddled paramour in the execrable 'Basic Instinct II') as the Duke of Norfolk. Spanish actress Ana Torrent brings conviction to her few scenes as Catherine of Aragon. Sandy Powell, no stranger to the period ('Shakespeare in Love'), designed the exquisite costumes, while John Paul Kelly's sumptuous production design feels authentic. Kieran McGuigan's richly colorful cinematography is undermined by his recurring tendency to use a side-swipe effect to transition shots. Production details aside, the film remains stubbornly hollow at its core.Starting with Chadwick's zealous albeit sometimes overly technical commentary track, the 2008 DVD has a robust set of extras. Thumbnail sketches of the film's historical figures are provided in brief video snippets with insight provided by scholars and various members of the cast. Two featurettes are also included - a ten-minute short, 'To Be a Lady', which discusses the severely limited role of women in the 16th century, a theme addressed pretty well in the film; and another ten-minute short, 'Translating History to Screen', which prominently features Gregory and focuses on how a voluminous bodice-ripper of a book had to be pared down to a running time of 115 minutes. Separately, there are twelve scenes presented, mostly expanded versions of the ones that ended up in the film and none I would consider indispensable to the final cut. Rounding out the extras is a brief reel of a test used to calibrate the HD cameras used during the shoot, as well as eight previews of other films.",5,3,5,11 June 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Bruckheimer and CGI Effects Dominate a Paper-Thin, Fleet-Footed Video Game-Derived Epic
","The sight of Jake Gyllenhaal in a defiantly heroic pose with his imposing dagger on the poster of this 2010 fantasy adventure would seem to portend a film filled with self-parody, but alas, the actor takes the Aladdin-like title role semi-seriously. He's actually better than expected in the over-the-top derring-do role, but the movie itself is absurdly convoluted and overly ridiculous, even by the standards of the 2003 video game which inspired this CGI-saturated production. It should come as no surprise that the executive producer is action-schlock master Jerry Bruckheimer, whose commercial track record extends from 'Beverly Hills Cop' to the 'National Treasure' franchise. What did surprise me is that the director is Mike Newell, better known for soft, female-oriented fare such as 'Enchanted April' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. However, both he and Gyllenhaal give themselves almost entirely to Bruckheimer's more commercial, comic-book sensibilities.The fanciful plot takes place in the sixth century B.C. where we find a Persian street urchin named Dastan being adopted by King Sharaman for his courageous acrobatics in a crowded marketplace. He grows up with his loyal foster brothers Garsiv and Tus, the rightful heirs to the throne who lead the Persian army in an attack on the sacred city of Alamut. In a none-too-subtle allusion to current-day Iraq, the siege on Alamut comes from a wrongful assumption that the city's people are selling weapons to their enemies. Behind the assault is the King's brother and trusted adviser, the Dick Cheney-like Nizam. Elsewhere in the city, Dashan leads a swashbuckling rogue effort that leads him to the comely Princess Tamina who holds the secret behind the mythical Dagger of Time. The dagger has time-bending powers that allow the user to undo any mistake and redo any moment. In short order, Dashan gets framed for murder and escapes with Tamina and the dagger.All sorts of contrived shenanigans subsequently follow with the addition of Sheik Amar, an ostrich-racing thief who amusingly hates both taxes and the confining role of government, as the dagger elusively changes hands and a fatalistic sinkhole yields an ending that may remind you of Pam's unexpected discovery of Bobby in the shower on 'Dallas'. Aside from Gyllenhaal's muscular performance, Gemma Arterton (a memorable bit as Strawberry Fields in 'Quantum of Solace') makes a fetching princess with plenty of predictable moxy. As Nizam, Ben Kingsley is not nearly as embarrassing here as he was in 'The Love Guru', but his Oscar will continue collecting dust by itself with his string of disappointing movie choices. The ethnically versatile Alfred Molina steals the film in an act of petty larceny as the comical sheik. With so many special effects coming at the viewer uninterrupted, it was extremely difficult to find a core of humanity in this whole venture. But that's Bruckheimer's objective after all - to overwhelm your senses until you turn into the exact same pulp he chooses to present to all the fanboys and fangirls who will flock to this paper-thin extravaganza.",5,40,75,2 June 2010
"I Love You, Man"," The Comical Fate of the Sensitive Male
","At the core of what looks on the surface to be a standard summer buddy movie is an intriguing premise: What does become of the overly sensitized male when confronted with the reality that all his closest friends are female and that he is at a complete loss to find any groomsmen, in particular, a best man, for his wedding? It's not an earth-shattering dilemma to address, yet the situation gives rise to a lot of amusing questions about what constitutes masculine behavior in our supposedly evolved society. Fortunately, director/co-writer John Hamburg ('Along Came Polly') has fashioned a 2009 comedy (with co-writer Larry Levin) full of shrewd observations and hilarious gags that transcend formula and elevate the story into something fresh and genuinely likable.When sweet-natured L.A. real estate broker Peter Klaven decides to marry Zooey, his girlfriend of eight months, it dawns on both of them that he has no close male friends. Whispers about his manhood and her fear of him being too clingy as a husband lead Peter to set up a series of disastrous man-dates, one being the predictable mistaken gay date. However, it's at an open house at Lou Ferrigno's manse that he meets his personality opposite  Sydney Fife, a slovenly, blunt albeit socially observant slacker. As it turns out, their differences complement one another in a way that makes them best buddies almost from the get-go  that and a common obsession for the 1970's power band Rush. Naturally, Zooey starts to resent Sydney's burgeoning role in Peter's life - and things get complicated before the inevitable conclusion.Two of Judd Apatow's familiar rep company star. Finally at the center of a major movie, Paul Rudd is ideally cast as Peter since the role takes advantage of how he combines his boyish charm and unpredictable nebbishness into a memorable character. In fact, he makes Peter's awkward attempts to overcome his social anxiety a certain emotional resonance. We feel every painful step he takes in replicating Sydney's free spirit, and it becomes easy to root for his success. Much better cast here than as the self-conscious lead in last year's 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', Jason Segel offers his doughy likability to a role that suits his casual, lumbering personality, even when he exposes an intimate secret between Peter and Zooey in a wedding party dinner toast.If the interplay between Rudd and Segel feels familiar from Apatow comedies like 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up', it is a coincidence that Hamburg takes full advantage of to keep the movie comically involving. Rashida Jones brings a raspy appeal to Zooey, although she is kept mostly at the sidelines. Also underused are Jaime Pressly as Zooey's tart-tongued friend Denise and as Peter's parents, J.K. Simmons (playing the same wiseass father he played in 'Juno') and especially Jane Curtin. Jon Favreau has a thankless role as Denise's alpha-male jerk of a husband, while Andy Samberg makes a most unconvincing gay as Peter's sleep-around, personal trainer brother. There are plenty of laughs throughout its slightly long 105-minute running time, but what may surprise you is the number of insightful moments that this affectionate, satirical comedy provides.",8,2,5,30 March 2009
Superbad," Frequently Hilarious Teen Comedy Somewhat More Inconsequential Than Expected
","I have to agree that this 2007 comedy is ribald and frequently hilarious, but I'm not quite as taken as others by what they see as a paean to male bonding and friendship. That's because there is too stark a contrast between the over-the-top hi-jinks that prevail over most of the running time and the almost whimsically co-dependent way the relationship between the two best friends reveals itself to be. My expectations ran high given that filmmaker Judd Apatow produced the film, and as he proved with 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up', he can bring unexpected heart into the most absurdly comical of situations. However, this delicate balancing act is what seems missing here since he let director Greg Motolla take over the reins this time. Aspiring to be more like 'American Graffiti' than 'American Pie', the result is a film with plenty of laughs but fares less in terms of lasting emotional resonance. From a script penned by best friends Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (based on their own awkward adolescent years), the movie has a slim premise  chubby, potty-mouthed Seth and shy, geeky Evan are best friends about to graduate from high school and go to different colleges. Evan got accepted to Dartmouth, while Seth is going to the local community college. Seth, however, has a twist of good luck when he is partnered in home economics class with Jules, one of the school's coolest girls, who invites him and Evan to a big graduation blow-out at her parents' house. So hopped up by his sexual fantasies about Jules, Seth volunteers to take her food allowance and buy liquor for the party. Evan goes along with the shenanigans because he has a crush on Jules' best friend Becca, a good girl who actually likes him. Getting the alcohol is not easy because it means bringing nerdy Fogell into the mix since he has a fake ID that says he is 25, lives in Hawaii and his name is McLovin (just one name please). Needless to say, everything that could go wrong does, and the story splinters between Fogell's adventure with two irresponsible policemen and Seth and Evan's search for alcohol when they think Fogell has been arrested.A spirited cast displays crack comic timing. Jonah Hill, already familiar as one of the slacker housemates in 'Knocked Up', plays Seth with hormonally-driven brio, while Michael Cera (the put-upon son George-Michael in 'Arrested Development' and now shining in 'Juno') makes Evan a quietly affecting dweeb. In his film debut, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is a hilarious scene stealer as Fogell. Rogen (with a Fu Manchu moustache) and SNL's Bill Hader display a playful rapport as the police officers who show Fogell how to have a good time, and among the three actresses playing the girls the nerd brigade desires, Emma Stone is a particular standout as the sensible Jules. The drawings reflecting Seth's obsession are hysterically funny, as is the entire liquor store episode. It's too bad that the film feels overlong at nearly two hours, but I do applaud the sheer audacity and emotional transparency of the last scenes.Plenty of extras come with the two-disc Unrated and Extended DVD set in a format that will be familiar to anyone who has bought the DVDs of Apatow's megahits. An entertaining though surprisingly vituperative commentary track is on Disc One with the cast and crew split between LA and New York. Disc Two has all the other extras including deleted scenes, a gag reel and the familiar line-o-rama clip (which shows quick alternative takes with different variations on lines improvised by the actors). There is also a thirteen-minute making-of featurette, video diaries, audition tapes, a short about the dancing opening title sequence, and video footage of early table readings going back to 2002 with different actors. The rest of the extras are targeted to true die-hard fans, such as videotape of a prank pulled on Hill related to his phobia of snakes and a half-hour series of clips called 'Cop Car Confessions' with various actors in the back seat improvising with Rogen and Hader in the front.",6,0,3,4 January 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Convoluted and Wearing Flick Despite Jackman's Familiar Seething and Clawing
","I don't think this strenuous 2009 offshoot of the 'X-Men' series should be dismissed entirely, but it really doesn't contribute much to the genre the way 'Iron Man' and 'Batman Returns' did last year. Both of those films set a high water mark for comic book franchises, and unfortunately director Gavin Hood ('Tsotsi') can't seem to get his film-making arms around what would make Wolverine a compelling character over the course of 107 minutes. Don't blame Hugh Jackman, who puts in a valiant effort now in his fourth familiar turn in the title role. Addressing the inner demons of a conflicted character should have been within Hood's oeuvre given his previous serious-minded work, but he seems overwhelmed by the film's persistent blockbuster aspects. Fight scenes seem identical with each other, and there are lots of them here, so much so that the net result is more wearing than enthralling with the choreography and special effects looking the same from scene to scene. There are also new characters constantly introduced, each with some unique superpower of dubious distinction, so the story starts to feel like a springboard for yet more franchises.Given that I am not familiar with the X-Men series, I will trust that screenwriters David Benioff ('The Kite Runner') and Skip Woods have remained faithful to the comic book with the convoluted storyline, a true chore to follow for the uninitiated like myself. The opening sequence shows Wolverine as a sickly child sometime in the middle of the 19th century. Along with his brother Victor, he has apparently fought every major war since the Civil War, both getting killed and resuscitated for their next enlistment. The immortality aspect is probably the most problematic aspect of the story since it really doesn't give the viewer any legitimate reason to be concerned with Wolverine's ultimate fate. Consequently, the story focuses the conflict more on Wolverine's soldiering for the government and his growing identification as a mutant. This inner turmoil tears the brothers apart since Victor cannot forgive his brother for deserting the military. However, living peacefully as a poor lumberjack in Canada with his comely schoolteacher girlfriend Kayla does not prevent him from being drawn back to the cause as a member of an elite mutant unit due to the persistent efforts of Colonel Stryker.Even if abject alienation is still not his forte, Jackman does what he can with a rage-filled cardboard role that requires him to alternate between vindictive and sympathetic in lightning flashes. In an exasperating turn, Liev Schreiber has even less latitude as Victor (a.k.a. Sabretooth) since we never figure out why he turns so completely malevolent. Danny Huston fares better as Stryker since the character is rich in Machiavellian tendencies that are easy to root against. Lynn Collins plays an ambiguously dichotomous role similar to Eva Green's in the James Bond vehicle, 'Casino Royale', and Ryan Reynolds has a near-cameo role as yet another comic book franchise in the making. He provides some much needed comic relief, but it's not enough to offset the constant mayhem. The explosion-driven helicopter chase and the relentless fight atop the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor are the only set pieces that linger in the memory. The rest of the movie will have greater resonance for devoted fans of the comic book.",5,0,2,31 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," A Smart, Silly and Genuinely Exciting Tribute to All-American Testosterone in the Movies
","Having never seen 2004's 'Shaun of the Dead', I didn't know what to expect from director/co-screenwriter Edgar Wright's latest movie, which plays out like an Ealing Studios only-in-Britain comedy amplified on Tarantino-level steroids. The 2007 action farce achieves the impressive feat of being silly and smart, quite often at the same time, as Wright and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pegg show themselves to be cineastes with a sharp eye and nimble ear for satire. There are lots of derivative plot turns to track in this fish-out-of-water story, which shifts into a blazing, gun-toting thriller as a tribute to testosterone-driven, Jerry Bruckheimer-genre buddy movies like 'Point Break' and 'Bad Boys II'. Even the intentionally exploitative title fits the tone of this eminently enjoyable popcorn flick perfectly.With laser-sharp precision, Pegg stars as a straight-arrow aptly named Nicholas Angel, inarguably the best police officer in London. However, he is so good that he makes the rest of the force look ineffectual, which leads to his unceremonious transfer to a sleepy hamlet named Sandford. There he carries his duties quite seriously, which naturally puts him at odds with the casual townsfolk. But then a suspicious car accident occurs, and the plot escalates into a wild ride of contrived but often hilarious developments leading to an ambitious, cartoon-like series of exciting finales. Angel naturally needs a partner to succeed, and Nick Frost (looking a lot like Mark Addy from 'The Full Monty') winningly plays schlubby Danny, a wannabe action hero who happens to be the devoted son of Frank Butterman, the village police chief. Together they uncover a plot that upends the entire community.There are lots of familiar faces in funny supporting turns - Timothy Dalton at his smarmy best (and looking well prepared to inherit Christopher Plummer's villain roles) as the suspicious supermarket owner; Jim Broadbent as the seemingly benevolent Frank; Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as a couple of sarcastic, mustachioed detectives; and in bit parts, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan as a couple of London's befuddled finest and an uncredited Cate Blanchett as Angel's put-upon girlfriend Jeanine conveniently hidden by a forensic mask. The one-liners are funny enough, but what really resonate are the subtle, often throwaway shots that make fun of American movie conventions. Even though the film runs for over two hours, Wright and Pegg have paced the story with a dexterous mix of thrills, intelligence and laughs. Much of this successful hat trick is due to Chris Dickens' propulsive editing and a nifty combination of over-the-top stunts and visual effects. This film is quite an unexpected kick.",8,1,2,24 April 2007
Just Go with It," Deception-Based Farce Gone Through the Sandler Blender
","There is no getting around the fact that Jennifer Aniston is likable. In the past, she has attempted to be versatile with mixed results (effective in 'The Good Girl', less so as a temptress in 'Derailed'), but she remains most successful within a limited proximity of her Rachel Green character from the long-running 'Friends' TV series. She's playing another variation of her in this rambunctious 2011 comedy ever so loosely based on the amiable 1969 farce, 'Cactus Flower' starring Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman, and Goldie Hawn in her Oscar-winning debut. Believe it or not, Aniston is playing the Bergman role of Katherine, a single mom working as an assistant to Danny, a successful LA plastic surgeon played by Adam Sandler. The fact that Sandler is playing the Matthau role appears to be the primary joke here since he turns the excessively inventive single doctor into one of his standard wiseacre man-boy characters.The movie opens with a flashback scene in which a pre-nose-job Danny discovers he is about to marry a shrew but soon realizes his gold band is a magnet for hot chicks. He then decides to avoid what he thinks is the inevitable disappointment of commitment by telling every girl he hooks up with that he's married. That ploy changes when he meets a blonde stunner named Palmer. He falls for her, but things start to fall apart when she discovers Danny's gold band in his pocket and assumes he's married. Convinced that Palmer is the one, Danny persuades Katherine to pretend to be his soon-to-be-ex-wife and uses her two manipulative kids as part of the charade. Things go according to formula, including a contrived trip to Hawaii where Katherine runs into a college sorority rival named Devlin, who has been the subject of Katherine's passive-aggressive hostilities all these years. In a bit of stunt casting, Nicole Kidman plays the ultra-competitive Devlin in a comically imperious fashion, while singer/musician Dave Matthews is arbitrarily thrown in the mix as her equally shallow, butt-clenching husband.Even though this comedy is neither as consistently funny nor tightly structured as 'Cactus Flower', I have to admit there is a bit of a Cary Grant/Irene Dunne-type of banter between Aniston and Sandler, at least during the first half when Katherine is introduced to Palmer as Danny's confident, materialistic wife (she names herself 'Devlin'). These are the scenes that hew closest to the original movie and consequently work the best. Where it flounders is when the two actors need to show they are falling in love. Sandler is a relative blank slate during these more serious moments, and the lack of credibility in their characters' romantic relationship undermines the film. In the Goldie Hawn role, Brooklyn Decker fulfills the physical requirements as Palmer but is unlikely to be up for any Oscars this time next year. Nick Swardson wins my award for the year's most irritating best buddy in a Sandler comedy, especially when he pretends to be Katherine's lover, an Austrian sheep buyer. Sandler's former SNL colleagues Rachel Dratch and an almost unrecognizable Kevin Nealon show up in cameos as two comically unfortunate victims of plastic surgery.",6,1,4,5 March 2011
Brokeback Mountain," A Soaring Ledger Emboldens Lee's Powerful, Evocative Portrait of Self-Limited Destiny
","It shouldn't surprise anyone that the opening weekend in San Francisco was completely sold out for this much anticipated film. I just read the brief, wondrous novella by Annie Proulx a couple of weeks ago, and despite its wellspring of emotion, the 55-page book didn't seem like a natural candidate for screen treatment, especially one with a running time of 134 minutes. What is most intriguing about director Ang Lee's 2005 cinematic adaptation is how it builds upon the elliptical nature of Proulx's narrative into something quite transcendent and relevant beyond urban, flavor-of-the-month movie audiences.Thanks primarily to an extremely perceptive screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, the much-discussed gay romance is not what separates this film from others but rather the penetrating depiction of the barriers that keep the two cowboys apart. As Lee has proved in previous films that go beyond his cultural identity, he can take what seems to be a niche subject and turn it into a love story with universal appeal to anyone facing an inhospitable environment. I join the chorus who feels it would be shame if potential viewers skip this movie on the preconceived and misbegotten notion that it is simply a 'gay cowboy' romance.Initially set on the mountain of the movie's title in Wyoming, the plot focuses on taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar and animated bull-rider Jack Twist, both hired for low wages to herd sheep during the summer of 1963. One cold night, after we see several scenes where they get to know each other and acclimate themselves to their roles, they enter reluctantly into a passionate tryst. While the more open-minded Jack is excited by the feeling of liberation, Ennis is steadfast in his self-inflicted shame and rejects Jack's dream to own a ranch together. Having witnessed as a child the remains of a man lynched for carrying on a gay relationship, Ennis is afraid of the same fate. However, they both recognize an intractable bond that they try to ignore with great futility.Four years elapse, during which time both get married and have children. Ennis marries longtime sweetheart Alma and raises two daughters. Jack has since moved to Texas and married Lureen, the daughter of a big-time farm equipment dealer. He decides to come back and visit Ennis, and their pent-up passion is sparked and becomes unbridled. They begin to take romantic getaways together for the next two decades under the guise of fishing trips. A twist of fate brings Ennis an open resignation to his unresolved feelings even as his now-grown up daughter attempts to get to know him.The performances are uniformly strong. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Jack in his familiar, wide-eyed manner since it fits his character's more idealistic personality, though he becomes marginally less convincing when he ages. As the wives, both actresses are removing the shackles of previously limiting roles. A graduate of the TV teen-angst soap opera, 'Dawson's Creek', Michelle Williams continues the promise she showed in Thomas McCarthy's 'The Station Agent' by revealing the increasing pain and unrelenting sadness in Alma, alternately realizing and denying what is going on between Jack and her husband. Anne Hathaway seems to be jettisoning her goody image from Garry Marshall's 'The Princess Diaries' in a hurry as Lureen - first as a feisty rodeo girl not afraid to get sexually aggressive with Jack and then in a series of unfortunate blond wigs (from Farrah to Loni Anderson), as a savvy businesswoman growing indifferent to her husband's lack of attention. It's the smallest, least developed part of the four principals, but she makes her moments count.However, it is Heath Ledger who amazes as Ennis. This heretofore almost strictly commercial actor has tapped deeply into the agony of his character's soul with authentic force and poignancy. It's a career-defining performance of a man who cannot let his internal stirrings affect his outward appearance. It's Ledger who makes the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jack seem so desperately charged with emotion and regret. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Randy Quaid as the suspicious sheepherder boss; Linda Cardellini - completely unrecognizable as bespectacled Velma from the 'Scooby Doo' movies - as the waitress who tries hard to bring out Ennis' heart; and Kate Mara as Ennis's loving daughter. The panoramic vistas of Wyoming (actually Canada) are provided by Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography, and the evocative music score is by Gustavo Santaolalla, who did similarly stellar work in Walter Salles's 'The Motorcycle Diaries'. I am hopeful there is a broader audience than the enraptured critics, as the rest of us are also being rewarded with a superbly executed film.",10,53,74,12 December 2005
500 Days of Summer," Fresh, Thoughtful Rom-Com Challenges One Man's Profound Faith in Love
","Many critics are already describing this 2009 indie romantic comedy as this generation's 'Annie Hall', but the comparison is apt only to the point where both movies surprise and delight with their persistently unpredictable approaches to well-worn themes of love gone awry over the course of a relationship. I still don't think that this film, directed by feature-film neophyte Marc Webb and scripted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webb, achieves the emotional resonance of the earlier Woody Allen classic, probably because there have been so many attempts in the intervening three decades to copy it, but this fresh-faced film is certainly not without its moments of charm and genuine revelation about the principal characters.The time-jumping story follows the course of the rocky, five-hundred-day relationship between two LA-based twenty-somethings – Tom, an underachieving greeting-card writer who has not quite given up on his dreams to become an architect, and Summer, a recent Michigan transplant who is not looking for any long-term commitments. She is definitely the object of his growing affection, while she remains steadfastly a Holly Golightly-like fantasy figure. For a stretch, the movie feels somewhat facile and light-hearted in sketching the beginning of their courtship with the halted dialogue after a drunken karaoke night and a walk through IKEA as they pretend to be happy marrieds. The plot gets more interesting as their defining moments become jumbled from Tom's own sense of recollection, including Webb's use of film-school gimmicks like a split-screen treatment of a real-versus-imagined reunion and full-on tributes to Fellini and Bergman movies. The film's funniest bit is also the most unoriginal – a post-coital musical number set to Hall & Oates' 'You Make My Dreams' that looks a lot like the Dr. Pepper 'Be a Pepper' commercial from the 1970s.Joseph Gordon-Levitt ('Brick') really comes into his own as Tom, providing a thoughtful depth to his portrayal of the likable but pained protagonist. As Summer, Zooey Deschanel has the more difficult role since we don't get a view of her inner feelings the way we see Tom's. However, she uses her big blue eyes and malleable, off-kilter manner to great effect here. More importantly, she makes Tom's emotional free-fall completely understandable. Other roles are filled out more predictably – Chloe Moretz as Tom's too-wise-for-her-years younger sister Rachel, and Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler as his two semi-slacker buddies. Still, this movie feels a lot fresher than most of the Hollywood product out there thanks to Webb's prodigious approach. He uses the ambiguous ending to Mike Nichols' 'The Graduate' very well here, and there is a nice appreciation for Los Angeles architecture capped by a last scene in the legendary Bradbury Building.",8,1,4,16 August 2009
Juno," Uniquely Eccentric Tale of Teen Pregnancy Elevated by a Sharp Script and a Strong Ensemble
","I have to admit that when I see a preview for a movie about a pregnant teenager, my first thought always goes back to conventional Lifetime TV soapers like 'Fifteen and Pregnant' and 'Mom at Sixteen'. However, director Jason Reitman (who proved to have a wry, ironic eye with 'Thank You for Smoking') and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody, who previously worked as a stripper and phone sex operator, have concocted a genuinely quirky, surprisingly tender dramedy that takes the cliché-ridden story idea and fleshes it out with so many recognizable idiosyncrasies and so much insightful wit that the subgenre feels reborn.The plot centers on a suburban Minneapolis sixteen-year old named Juno MacGuff, who finds herself pregnant after an experiment in chair-bound seduction with her shy classmate, a geeky, Tic-Tac-popping runner named Paulie Bleeker. Instead of focusing on dramatic confrontations with the parents or morphing into a diatribe on the right-to-life-or-choose debate, Reitman and Cody follow Juno's natural emotional impulses as she awkwardly attempts to figure out the best course of action to take. Things start to look promising when Juno finds a young upscale couple to adopt her baby - Vanessa is a controlling professional with perfectionist tendencies, while her husband Mark is an easy-going composer of commercial jingles, an aging Peter Pan-type whom Juno sees as a kindred spirit with a mutual fondness for rock music, slasher movies and comic books.What I particularly like about the movie is how it portrays Juno as someone who holds no illusion of becoming a mother and yet discovers the emotional intelligence to match her maddeningly clever smart-mouthing. In fact, I had concerns about the persistence of the slang-heavy dialogue at the outset but was relieved to find the movie settle into sharp bantering exchanges that make way for more human dimensions. As proved with 'Little Miss Sunshine' and 'Lars and the Real Girl', a perfectly compatible ensemble can make all the difference with a movie as character-rich as this one. Fortunately, the cast is terrific starting with Ellen Page's prodigious turn in the title role. As a follow-up to her knockout work in 'Hard Candy', she is impressive in revealing a fearless vulnerability under her character's disconcerting self-possession. As Bleeker, Michael Cera nicely provides a quiet gravity in response to Juno's volatility.There is great work by J.K. Simmons as Juno's no-nonsense dad and especially Allison Janney as her acid-tongued, dog-loving stepmother (her verbal teardown of the patronizing ultrasound technician is classic). The surprise comes from the sturdy work by Jason Bateman, bringing palpable, almost wistful regret to Mark, and the gorgeous Jennifer Garner truly affecting in conveying Vanessa's unfulfilled state. More predictable are Olivia Thirlby as Juno's teacher-obsessed best friend Leah and Rainn Wilson in a cameo as a smart-alecky convenience store clerk. Indie folk singer Kimya Dawson composed and performs the amusing songs that bridge the seasonal changes in the story. This film is a genuine winner strongly recommended.",9,4,16,17 December 2007
Spider-Man 3," What a Tangled Web Raimi Weaves...
","The epic hubris displayed by director Sam Raimi in this latest (and one would hope final) installment of his phenomenally successful Spider-Man series is what frustrates me the most about this overlong, CGI-saturated 2007 movie. It feels like he was given free reign to do whatever he wanted without the intrusion of common sense. The result is a megalomaniacal failure leavened by scattered moments of levity. Written by Raimi, along with his brother Ivan and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the story begins promisingly with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, regaling in his celebrity status and mustering up enough courage up to propose to longtime love Mary-Jane Watson, who is incredibly making her Broadway musical debut.The film wastes little time in establishing that Peter's ego has run amok - obviously an ironic parallel to Raimi's situation - and that he will be forced to face a crisis of conscience amid the shenanigans of not one but three villains. Spelling out the motivations of each of these characters takes time, as does the resuscitation of the love triangle between Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn and Peter's guilt over how he responded to his Uncle Ben's murder. Consequently, the movie feels overstuffed by the multiple story lines that only coalesce through pat plot conventions executed toward the end in order for the movie to have an acceptable running time. Moreover, the novelty of the special effects has tangibly worn out since the initial outing, and there is a surprising technical laziness found in some of the action sequences, especially with the overuse of nighttime shots to camouflage some of the battles.A key problem also lies in the divergent yet predictable ways the villains have been developed. The resuscitated Green Goblin represents the result of revenge, while Flint Marko is a petty criminal caught in a radiation field that turns him into Sandman, a burgeoning creature made of sand (probably the film's best CGI sequence). The most skimpily developed villain is Venom, a gloopy, fast-moving black parasite that takes hold of Peter first before it takes control of professional rival Eddie Brock. If this was not enough, the story also introduces another key female character, model Gwen Stacy who happens to be the daughter of the police chief and Mary-Jane's competition for Peter's affections. All these detours serve to bring Peter to his original sensibilities about being Spider-Man and of course, to the big climactic battle. This is perhaps the most disappointing portion of the movie as at least two far-fetched plot points undermine the dramatic tension and seem to emphasize the silliness of the entire venture.In keeping with its comic book origins, Raimi infuses the movie with a sense of humor, but the resulting variability in tone threatens to submerge the movie into camp. The principal actors - Tobey Maguire as Peter, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane and James Franco as Harry - are back but give us little additional depth or texture to their characters. Broadway luminary Rosemary Harris is also back lending sage advice as Aunt May, as are J.K. Simmons as blowhard editor J. Jonah Jameson, Elizabeth Banks as saucy Miss Brant and Dylan Baker as the all-knowing Dr. Connors. Thomas Haden Church plays Marko stoically, while Topher Grace is simply irritating as the obnoxious Brock. Bryce Dallas Howard lends the right vacuity to air-headed Gwen, while Theresa Russell is wasted in a cameo as Marko's defeated wife. This is one dismal blockbuster worth skipping.",4,2,3,10 June 2007
Match Point," Luck and Fate at an Unlikely Crossroads in an Elegant, Crafty Movie by Woody Allen
","While it's true that Woody Allen has had an erratic record as a filmmaker of late, there are definite pleasures to be had from his recent work such as 1999's 'Sweet and Lowdown', 2000's 'Small Time Crooks' and 2005's 'Melinda and Melinda'. However, what makes 2005's 'Match Point' different from the usual Allen product is that it is an incessantly addictive film ripe with melodrama and suspense with little of Allen's angst-driven comedy. There are elements that will remind long-time Allen aficionados of 1989's 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 1993's 'Manhattan Murder Mystery', but at the same time, the film seems also inspired by Anthony Minghella's 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', George Stevens's 1951 'A Place in the Sun' based on Theodore Dreiser's 'An American Tragedy', and Adrian Lyne's 1987 'Fatal Attraction'.Set in contemporary London, a first for Allen, the intricate plot focuses on a failed pro tennis player, Chris Wilton, who lands a rather cushy job as a coach at a fancy private club. Through sheer luck - a consistent theme throughout for Chris - he befriends wealthy Tom Hewett and by way of an evening in the family's opera box, begins dating his guileless sister Chloe. Insinuating himself into the family with ease, including securing a nice job at one of the companies owned by Tom and Chloe's father, Chris becomes obsessed with Nola Rice, Tom's seductive American fiancée, a failing actress of whom Tom and Chloe's mother vehemently disapproves. How they all intertwine is what makes up most of the action, and the story works like an ever-tightening noose around Chris's actions. Even though it plays out like a smart thriller, Allen brings a decidedly fatalistic tone that introduces greater issues of fate, retribution and justice. The themes don't weigh the film down unnecessarily, and in fact, the film's last half-hour brings all the higher-level issues together in a way that makes the conclusion resonate with unpredictable force.As Chris, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers brings an effectively opaque manner to his character that makes him neither sympathetic nor villainous but rather leaves him precariously off-balance to the viewer. It's a smartly rendered performance that teeters toward the predictable only toward the very end. Although her first scene at the ping-pong table seems a bit excessive in introducing her character, Scarlett Johansson plays Nola with sensual fervor and palpable emotionalism, especially as her character spirals into darker psychological territory. Their scenes together are surprisingly carnal for an Allen film. Since they carry out the greater themes of moral vacuity, the remaining actors seem to be there simply to support the other end of the spectrum though not in predictable ways. For example, Emily Mortimer manages to play the unsuspecting Chloe not as a victim but as someone unwilling to confront her own unhappiness given her aggressive and rather selfish desire to become pregnant.As embodied expertly by Brian Cox as the overly generous father, Penelope Wilton as the overbearing mother and Matthew Goode as carefree Tom, the rest of the Hewett family are equally clueless about what is going on around them. However, that's exactly Allen's point in his parable-like script as he makes shrewd observations about the power of luck and our profound inability to control our destinies in making one's way toward a desired life. In a manner that recalls Gordon Willis's work in Allen's 'Interiors', Remi Adefarasin lends an immaculately cool sheen to the cinematography, and the upscale world among the London social elite is captured almost too adroitly with Jim Clay's manicured production design and Caroline Smith's tasteful set decorations. In place of his usual jazz-infused soundtrack, Allen uses old opera recordings of Caruso singing Bizet, Donizetti, Rossini and especially Verdi as a smartly evocative background. This is strong work from film auteur Allen well worth viewing.",8,5,9,30 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," Allen Finds Another Purple Rose in Paris
","Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition 'Si Tu Vois Ma Mere' much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose 'Rhapsody in Blue' in his 1979 masterwork. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fiancée Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene in 'Annie Hall'. Gil – as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.Thankfully, I just saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, so I received a primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over. Back in 'Mean Girls' mode, Rachel McAdams isn't given that much to do as Inez except to express constant frustration. Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in 'Thor') and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.",6,2,5,9 July 2011
Zodiac," Overlong But Still Involving Story of the Pursuit of the Elusive Zodiac Killer
","Even though I was a child, I distinctly recall the news coverage of the Zodiac killer manhunt nearly forty years ago, which served as the inspiration for Clint Eastwood's epochal film, 1971's Dirty Harry. David Fincher's meticulous 2007 film, however, is not a standard action shoot-'em-up. In tone and pacing, it seems to have been inspired by Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men (1976). Both movies take on the guise of a suspenseful, character-rich detective story that highlights the obsession that takes over the police and the press in uncovering high-profile crimes. Unlike Pakula, however, Fincher does not propel James Vanderbilt's time-spanning script (based on Robert Graysmith's 1986 book, Zodiac) as forcefully and lets the story go on far too long to be consistently compelling, especially as he is forced by facts to leave the resolution open-ended.The story traces three main protagonists over several years - San Francisco police detective Dave Toschi and two of the staff at the San Francisco Chronicle, veteran crime beat reporter Paul Avery and young cartoonist-turned-writer Graysmith. It is ironically Graysmith who is the most tenacious in finding the murderer as the encrypted letters sent to the newspaper offices feed into his natural interest in puzzles. As one would expect from the maker of Se7en and Fight Club, Fincher does not shy away from the details of the graphic killings, but the movie is far more about the frustrating pursuit by the three men separately and together. The cat-and-mouse tension works best albeit most predictably when Toschi and his fellow law enforcement officers are involved. The journalistic pursuit is comparatively less interesting because Avery's self-destructive tendencies and Graysmith's mounting preoccupation do not measure up dramatically to the palpable idea of the killer being caught and punished by the law.Typical of this genre, the performances for the most part are workmanlike. Playing a character that inspired not only Eastwood but Steve Mc Queen's Bullitt, Mark Ruffalo lends his familiar ramshackle persona to the sardonic character of Toschi - more like Columbo than Callahan. As the alcoholic, drug-addled Avery, Robert Downey Jr. shows an obvious affinity to his character, and he makes the most of it, even if it all feels a little too familiar. Jake Gyllenhaal grabs the most screen time and provides an effective portrait of Graysmith as he evolves from naïve and impressionable to haunted and indiscriminately desperate. Smaller roles are filled by Anthony Edwards as Toschi's upstanding partner, Chloë Sevigny as Graysmith's increasingly alienated wife, Brian Cox in a ham-fisted turn as attorney Melvin Belli, and best of all, John Carroll Lynch in a subtle performance as prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen with only a hint of malevolence.The marathon 156-minute running time helps create an almost mini-series feel to the whole venture, but Fincher's dark, supple film-making style compensates to a great degree. The period detail is evocative without resorting to kitsch or heavy nostalgia, for example, the primitive state of telecommunications is conveyed perfectly in a scene where the various city police departments try to coordinate the sharing of evidence. I happened upon the filming at the San Francisco Chronicle building on the way to work last year since I live just a few blocks away and was able to witness first-hand the meticulous attention to historical detail in the vehicles and the characters' wardrobe. The 2007 DVD is bereft of extras apparently in preparation for a two-disc Special Edition DVD set that will include the commentary tracks and featurettes one would have expected here.",7,0,0,5 August 2007
Milk," Penn Soars in Van Sant's Intimate Biopic of an Unlikely Hero
","The combination of Sean Penn's fully immersed performance in the title role and Gus Van Sant's ('Good Will Hunting') assured, almost understated direction transforms first-timer Dustin Lance Black's episodic screenplay into an emotionally riveting film that does the subject justice. This 2008 biopic could have been timelier only if it was released prior to the November defeat of Proposition 8, which eliminated the legality of same-sex marriage in California. Now there is a melancholy twist to the way the film documents the triumph in failing to pass the Briggs Initiative, a ballot proposition that would have outlawed gays from teaching in the state's public school system. The champion behind its defeat was a former insurance actuarial statistician named Harvey Milk, who moved with his much-younger lover Scott Smith from New York to San Francisco where they hoped to find acceptance of their lifestyle.Using as a running narrative device a tape recording that Milk made nine days before his assassination and interspersing archival footage, the film's plot follows Milk's growing political consciousness in face of the pervasive discrimination and violence against gays in the 1970's. He opens a camera shop in what was only beginning to be known as the Castro. Although Smith tires of his partner's obsessive activism and leaves him, Milk himself finds success as an openly gay city supervisor after two previous failed attempts. While on the Board, he meets the highly conservative Dan White, a family man struggling with his finances and personal demons. Things come to a head when White feels betrayed by Milk for his lack of support over banning a psychiatric hospital in White's district. At the same time, Milk was facing the daunting task of curtailing a burgeoning conservative movement led by former beauty queen Anita Bryant (whose newsreel appearances lend an eerie virulence to the story).The fight over the Briggs Initiative provides the film's eruptive climax, and the subsequent tragic events are all too familiar  especially to those of us who lived through them exactly thirty years ago. Van Sant wisely plays down the sensationalism in favor of a more human portrait of White during those times. Josh Brolin ('No Country for Old Men') gives an impressively textured performance as the embattled White conveying the inner conflict of a man who could never reconcile his traditional family values with the radical acceptance of the gay movement. Although he has less to do, James Franco is effective in showing Smith's ambivalence toward Milk's increasingly high profile. Also surprisingly good are Emile Hirsch ('Into the Wild') as street punk-turned-gay rights activist Cleve Jones and former child actress Alison Pill as lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg. The one fly in the ointment is Diego Luna ('Mister Lonely') who plays Milk's lover Jack Lira as a pathetic co-dependent.Nonetheless, it is Penn who brings his chameleonic skill to the fore as Milk. His natural intensity is offset by an affability that is at once compelling and heartbreaking. More importantly, he provides the gravitas necessary to the tragedy of a voice that was silenced far too soon. Van Sant and Black do provide moments that seep into manipulation, such as the opera leitmotif and the inspiration provided by a wheelchair-bound teenager, but the resulting excesses are forgivable given the power and relevance of the subject. Strongly recommended.",9,2,6,23 December 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Human Face on Little Known Genocide...Devastating Viewing
","The thought of almost a million people killed over a 100-day period is beyond imagination, but that is exactly what happened a mere ten years ago in Rwanda when the dominant Hutu tribe slaughtered the minority Tutsi tribe in a civil war that drew little media attention, and much worse, minimal help from the United Nations peacekeeping forces. The killings were the most brutal possible, as the Tutsis were murdered one person at a time. Just like Oskar Schindler, Paul Rusesabagina is the unlikeliest of heroes, as this soft-spoken family man and savvy negotiator is put to the test in the posh HÃ´tel des Milles Collines, which he manages in the capital city of Kigali. Against absurd odds, he is able to provide refuge for nearly 1,300 Tutsis and consequently saved their lives. Written by Kier Pearson and Terry George, this remarkable story has been directed powerfully by George, who makes the wise decision to focus on the plight of Rusesabagina and his family rather than take a more epic approach to what would have been too overwhelming to view in full force. Their situation is compelling enough given that Paul is a Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. Consequently, there is less emphasis on the actual killings and the political leaders involved, though enough is shown to leave a lasting impression. The prospect of death always feels imminent as the story whittles away all the parties who could have helped the Tutsis but chose not to.Generally a dependable supporting player in grade-A Hollywood pictures, Don Cheadle is an inspired choice to play this reluctant hero, as the actor economically portrays a man used to making deals to get what he needs for the hotel and then uses this skill in response to the shocking events to pacify the Hutu general in charge. In fact, most of the film consists of his increasingly desperate negotiations as the stakes continue to climb, including making a devastating choice to stay at the war-torn hotel while pushing his family onto a truck that could mean their escape. Cheadle plays these key scenes with minimum fuss and makes them all the more emotionally resonant, in particular, when he has a delayed reaction to seeing corpses strewn on a fog-blanketed road and weeps uncontrollably as he is dressing to bargain yet again. Matching him every step of the way is the superb Sophie Okonedo, who transforms the standard wife-and-mother role of Tatiana into something quite transcendent. Effective in much smaller roles are Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force; Joaquin Phoenix as a cynical photojournalist; Cara Seymour as a compassionate Red Cross worker; and Hakeem Kae-Kazim as the wily Hutu general George Rutanganda.The DVD has two excellent documentaries. The first is 'A Message for Peace: Making Hotel Rwanda', one of the better making-of featurettes given the participation of the real Paul Rusesabagina, who reasons that the lack of global, specifically American, support in 1994 for the Tutsis had to do with the devastating U.S. losses suffered in Somalia and the fact that Rwanda has no bargaining chip of economic value, i.e., no oil, no natural resources other than coffee and tea. The second, 'Return to Rwanda', movingly follows Paul and Tatiana Rusesabagina back to their native land after living years in exile in Belgium. He even participates in the audio commentary along with George and singer Wyclef Jean. Strongly recommended, in fact, essential viewing of a reenactment of a massive genocide swept under the rug by the Western media.",10,0,0,20 February 2006
Once," Boy Meets Girland They Meet the Music in a Low Budget Charmer
","I doubt if I've seen a film more unabashedly romantic in the past five years, and this small-scale 2007 film is a musical to boot. Even with its Dublin-set working-class veneer, the story is basic boy-meets-girl formula, but director/screenwriter John Carney's real-world treatment manages to transcend the conventions, even if only fleetingly, through the aching pop ballads which make up most of the soundtrack and the sincerity of the two leads. The plot focuses on an Irish street musician who plays Van Morrison hits for change during the day but reverts to his original compositions at night. Written for a long-established girlfriend who has moved away to London, his open yearning and musicianship attracts the persistent attention of a young Czech girl. Despite his initial hesitation, they bond quickly over music. There is a lovely scene in a piano shop where he sings and plays his well-worn guitar to one of his songs, a stunning heartbreaker called 'Falling Slowly', while she tentatively accompanies him on the piano. The story simply goes from one number to the next while uncovering facts about the characters that guide their fate.It's been sixteen years since his memorable turn as guitarist Outspan Foster in Alan Parker's 'The Commitments', but Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish rock group, the Frames, plays the forlorn busker with a searching intensity befitting a man not only broken-hearted from a fading long-distance relationship but also worried he will end up repairing vacuum cleaners just like his stoic father. Markéta Irglová has the quirky, endearing quality necessary to play the girl. But as musicians whose compositions supply the soundtrack, their acting is secondary to the music they play. Hansard's deeply felt music immediately brings to mind Damien Rice's and David Gray's melancholy folk-rock ballads, while Irglová provides a nice complement with a voice similar to Björk's plaintive style. I have to admit the low-budget production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock. But all in all, if you are a fan of any of the musicians mentioned and remain undemanding in cinematic story lines, chances are pretty good that you will enjoy this little film enormously.",8,5,7,25 June 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Still Great Contemporary-Feeling Western Classic in a Robust DVD Package Heavy on Extras
","It amazes me how incredibly well this 1969 western has held up after all these years. At once classically structured and satirically executed, director George Roy Hill and screenwriter William Goldman have pulled together a supremely entertaining period picture that caters to contemporary sensibilities to this day. It is to their credit that the film remains true to the characters and never gets too broad during its quickly paced 110-minute running time. The story naturally revolves around the legendary outlaws who robbed banks at the turn of the last century. Their escapades are divided roughly into three sections in the film. The first is the introductory set-up where their opposite yet complementary personalities are established. Leading the motley Hole in the Wall Gang, they ultimately pull off a train robbery with an excess of dynamite. The second part is an extended chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are chased relentlessly by a group of unknown bounty hunters.The third and final part details their escape to Bolivia where they are determined to go straight but get caught up with local bandits and find their infamous past catching up with them. It seems inconceivable to have anyone other than Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the title roles. As the more established star at the time, Newman is characteristically laconic as Butch. His innate likability is enhanced by his rascally manner and crack comedy timing. In the more traditional gunslinger role, Redford provides the ideal partner with his flinty manner and unavoidable charisma. In between them is Katharine Ross, fresh from 'The Graduate', who plays Etta with sensual Ã©lan, though she does not figure in the most critical scenes. Of course, Burt Bacharach's instantly recognizable musical score is here, and while there is an anachronistic feel to such 1960's-sounding pop music over a western, it somehow works because the attitude of the film seems so modern. Even the comically romantic bicycle sequence manages to preserve its buoyancy thanks to the inane but undeniably catchy 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'.Conrad Hall's vibrant, burnished cinematography deserves special mention as it has been preserved well in the 2006 Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD package. The rest of the two-disc package is robust though bordering on overkill, adding on to the features that were already included in the previous 2000 Special Edition DVD. Retained from that edition is the interesting combination of perspectives provided by Hill, Hall, lyricist Hal David and associate producer Bob Crawford in their joint commentary track. New is separate and equally insightful commentary from Goldman. Another holdover from the previous edition is the forty-minute vintage documentary, 'The Making of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid', a still terrific featurette from 1970 with participation from Newman, Goldman, Hill and Redford.There are three new documentaries - a 2005 retrospective look at the film called 'All of What Follows is True: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'; a fact-check featurette called 'The Wild Bunch: The True Tale of Butch & Sundance'; and the somewhat repetitive 'History Through the Lens: Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time', a cumulative effort which combines elements of all the other documentaries into one ninety-minute feature. Lots of great insight is provided on the 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, Goldman and Bacharach. A deleted scene is also included with Hill's commentary (since the audio had been lost) - it is a disposable transitional scene where Butch and Sundance are watching newsreel footage of themselves in a Bolivian theater while Etta quietly leaves to the train station. Lastly, there are trailers for eight of Newman's vintage films. This is definitely a robust package for one of the great films of the 1960's.",9,0,2,30 June 2006
Crash," Truthful Anger Expressed Through Stellar Acting But Thwarted by Contrivance
","This omnibus fable is as provocative as its daring concept - thirty-six successive hours of hostile, racially charged activity intertwining diverse characters in contemporary Los Angeles - and contains some powerful acting. But at the end of it all, I was left rather hollow by the experience. Steeped in allegory with scenes that start with a key assumption (either on the character's part or ours) and end with some unexpected redemption, the novelty of first-time director Paul Haggis' 2005 film is initially powerful but gets wearing over its running time.Haggis ambitiously presents a multi-ethnic city full of unremorseful anger - where the inhabitants without exception eye each other with suspicion and ignorance to the point where the familiar epithets fly. Much of the early dialogue is uncomfortable to hear at first, but Haggis and co-screenwriter Bobby Moresco derive the shock value from the innate familiarity one has with the pent-up feelings expressed in such an unfettered and sometimes blackly humorous manner. The intense honesty of the dialogue is the film's chief virtue, as it is rare for Hollywood to acknowledge any race problem in its backyard. More often, filmmakers pontificate about it from an antiseptic soapbox (consider 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' as a prime example).A labyrinth plot has been constructed entirely out of the fabric of humanity torn mercilessly by racism, and the travails of over a dozen interconnecting characters make for quite a chess game. An ambitious young and white DA and his ice-cold wife are the victims of a carjacking at gunpoint that leads the wife into a state of hostile paranoia. She has the locks changed at their house by a Latino whom she myopically suspects is a gang member. In truth, the locksmith is a devoted family man who must face daily prejudices in his customer-oriented job. The carjackers are two young, seemingly educated black men who commit the crime out of an uncontrollable rage.A black TV director faces the humiliation of seeing his wife groped by a racist white cop, while his young, naïve partner watches with equal helplessness. A Persian store owner, constantly labeled an Arab, has his daughter help him buy a gun for protection. A black detective, saddled with his drug-addicted mother and criminal brother, is partnered professionally and personally with a Latina, as they to solve the mystery of a dead body in the road. They all collide in ways that are alternately compelling and manipulative.Most of the acting is stellar, but accommodating the complex plot with an expansive cast does not allow much screen time on an individual basis. Cast against type are two actors more famous for their light comedy roles - Brendan Fraser and an especially unsympathetic Sandra Bullock as the DA and his wife. With this brief role, actually with one confrontation scene, Bullock may just have overcome the hurdle that constantly befalls Meg Ryan - her perky likability has convincingly been subverted by a sharper, nastier edge of anger. I hope she does more such adventurous work in the future. Michael Peña plays the locksmith with dignity and provides one of the film's most primal moments when an angry customer blindly seeks restitution from him. Larenz Tate and a particularly impressive Ludicrous play the carjackers with intelligence and fury.Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton sharply delineate a marriage where they straddle precariously between their black identities and the white power base that keeps them living in style. Matt Dillon does some of his best work in the challenging role of the racist cop, while a surprisingly effective Ryan Phillippe embodies the moral ambiguity of Dillon's partner with élan. As the detective, Don Cheadle - who also served as producer - provides the authority to bring it all together. Even an out-of-character Tony Danza shows up in a cameo as a racist actor complaining that another actor is not sounding 'black' enough.But there is an evolving contrivance to the story, especially toward the end when plot threads are sewn up in an almost too circular fashion. For example, there is no denying the power of scenes such as the second encounter between Dillon's and Newton's characters or the revelation of the dead body's identity, but there is also a sense of parable that undercuts the credibility of the situations. The fates of key characters seem to follow a similarly moralizing pattern as previously deplorable bigots show their courage and compassion under emotional duress or dyed-in-the-wool liberals tap almost too easily into their inner misogynist. Everything just seems too neatly thought out to make the movie truly transcendent.The DVD is surprisingly skimpy on extras - a throwaway introduction by Haggis, a by-the-numbers making-of featurette that focuses more on how the actors desperately wanted to be part of the film, a music video and several trailers that I fast-forwarded through. Haggis, Moresco and Cheadle provide concise though informative commentary on an alternate audio track.",6,2,5,12 December 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," An Audacious, Magical and Eye-Wincing Epic of Emotional Power
","The remnants of the bloody, three-year Spanish Civil War were still deeply felt in the throes of WWII, and Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro captures the virulence of the country's relentlessly oppressive state in no uncertain terms in his beautifully realized 2006 film, a powerful combination of vivid history and fantastical allegory. Be forewarned that this movie is not for the faint-hearted, as it contains some of the most grisly images I have seen on screen. However, they are truly essential to the story that del Toro unfolds with emotional precision since they reflect and echo the brutalizing violence during that time when Franco's armies were still eliminating what was left of the Republican rebels in hiding five years after the war's end.Set around D-Day in 1944 as the Allies are turning the tide of the war, the film takes place in a remote area of northern Spain where ten-year old Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen come to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal, the deceptive and sadistic commander of the local outpost. Steeped in her fantasy books, Ofelia is a child often lost in her imagination, and she is drawn to a mysterious stone labyrinth on the property. It is here that she meets the Pale Man, a pedantic faun who assigns three onerous tasks which she must complete by the next full moon in order for her to realize her throne as a princess of the underworld. While this sounds like the trappings of an optimistic fairy tale in 'The Wizard of Oz' mode, it turns out to be far from it, as del Toro creates a purely Gothic world of eye-wincing creatures and actions not far removed from those found in mainstream American sci-fi horror movies. The genuine power of the film comes from the way he juxtaposes this fanciful, scarifying world with the persecution of the resistance fighters and the absolutist, ego-driven domain Vidal has established at the outpost. Each distinctive piece of the movie brings resonance to the other, all the way to the climactic point where they collide in an inevitable way at the end.Looking a bit like the pre-adolescent Natalie Portman, Ivana Baquero brings a plaintive, yearning quality to Ofelia that is thankfully free of precociousness. As Vidal, Sergi López effectively brings steely resolve to his role while hinting at the paternal approval his character never received. Maribel Verdú, memorable as the older woman in Alfonso Cuarón's 'Y tu mamá también', brings coiled power to the pivotal role of Vidal's house servant Mercedes. Also solid are Ariadna Gil as the frail Carmen who acquiesced to Vidal's need for a son, Álex Angulo as a kindly doctor, and Doug Jones as the special effects-laden Pale Man. Special kudos need to go to Guillermo Navarro's striking, moody cinematography; Eugenio Caballero's imaginative set designs; and the special visual and sound effects crucial in creating such an otherworldly mood. Unafraid to show scenes of unrelenting horror, Del Toro has created what ultimately is a magical film so audacious in execution that it defies description. Along with Cuarón's 'Children of Men' and Alejandro González Iñárritu's 'Babel', this film shows a true renaissance among Mexican filmmakers on a global landscape.",9,2,4,25 January 2007
Knocked Up," No Pregnant Pauses in A Sharp, Often Hilarious Character-Driven Comedy with Loads of Heart
","Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's 'Love With the Proper Stranger', about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane 2007 comedy, the latest work from writer/director Judd Apatow ('The 40-Year-Old Virgin'). In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plot line to the point where each makes the other more resonant.Familiar faces from 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' return in this movie beginning with Seth Rogen, who proves he can carry a movie as Ben. Despite outward appearances to the contrary, his shaggy-dog demeanor and sometimes piercing self-deprecation provide much of the heart in the picture. As a last-minute substitute for Anne Hathaway, Katherine Heigl proves she can translate her natural likability on 'Grey's Anatomy' to the big screen with ease. As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in 'Virgin', is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with 'Virgin'. A running time of 129 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant are the deliberate references to 'Virgin' in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations.",8,86,158,2 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Powerful Combination of Sondheim and Burton Makes the Demon Barber Come to Bloody Life
","It's been nearly thirty years since a Stephen Sondheim musical has been translated from Broadway to the big screen (the last time was 1978's dismal 'A Little Night Music' starring Elizabeth Taylor), and judging from the previews of this dark 2007 musical, the producers don't seem very anxious to publicize the fact that most of this film is sung in verse. That's too bad because it's really Sondheim's evocative and powerfully haunting music that drives and ironically humanizes the chilling storyline. It also helps to have director Tim Burton's visionary talent guiding this audacious venture since the horrific and heartrending subject matter ideally suits his idiosyncratic film-making style. I was fortunate enough to see the original 1979 Broadway production with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury, and screenwriter John Logan does an admirable job of streamlining the original musical to the core story of Sweeney's relentless vengeance.Sondheim-loving purists may balk at the fact that certain characters are gone in the screen version, as well as several songs with some of the remaining score switched around from one character's voice to another to serve distinctly different purposes in the story. It's also true that Burton does not hold back on what is an uncompromising gore-fest, but luckily, he doesn't dwell on the barber's bloody acts. Instead, he fixates on establishing the moody, nearly colorless atmosphere of nineteenth-century London and how the key characters become entrenched in the pervasive grayness of an urban purgatory from which no one can escape. All the production values on display are top-notch with stellar work from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (all three 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films), production designer Dante Ferretti ('Gangs of New York') and costume designer Colleen Atwood ('Memoirs of a Geisha'). The technical virtues of this production are undeniable even if it does become somewhat wearing to experience the constant dankness.Burton did not venture far in casting the leads since his frequent leading man Johnny Depp plays the title role and the director's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter is the smitten Mrs. Lovett. Both make their roles work within the contours of their recognizable screen personas. Depp lends his almost feline-like brand of menace to a role more often played by more robust, operatic-style actor-singers a decade or so older, while Carter eschews Lansbury's comically buffoonish performance for a more sinewy, cynical approach. Their singing may lack range and nuance, prerequisites for mastering Sondheim's complex lyrics, but they perform with vigor and certainly within character. Alan Rickman is his usual villainous self as Judge Turpin, whose act of jealousy provides the impetus for the blood-soaked plot; and in genuine callow fashion, Jamie Campbell Bower plays the aptly named sailor, Anthony Hope, the devoted suitor of Johanna, Sweeney's long-lost daughter now Turpin's ward. Orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick, the soundtrack does not suffer for the marginality of the star voices, as he brings the full potency and epic grandeur of Sondheim's music to the fore.Several of the musical numbers are quite effective. There is 'Pirelli's Miracle Elixir', which introduces Sweeney's preening competitor, Adolfo Pirelli (a nice bravura turn by Borat himself, Sacha Baron Cohen), at a medicine sideshow accompanied by a gin-loving orphan named Toby (affectingly played by Ed Sanders), who becomes intractably involved with Sweeney's and Mrs. Lovett's affairs. Bower sings the ballad, 'Johanna', with proper yearning as the purity of his intentions is contrasted sharply with Sweeney's murderous deeds. Depp gets his moment in the sun with 'Epiphany', in which he spells out the inevitably tragic fate of London under his switchblade, and he duets with a tentative Rickman on the haunting 'Pretty Women'. My favorite ballad from the show, 'Not While I'm Around', has been turned into a lullaby Mrs. Lovett sings to Toby, and while Carter sings with conviction, she is actually at her best on the lighter numbers like the self-effacing 'The Worst Pies in London', the deceptively coy 'A Little Priest', and the sunny 'By the Sea', which cues the film's only splash of life-affirming color. But above all else, this film is a triumph of Sondheim's musical genius and Burton's craftsmanship.",8,4,7,23 December 2007
Closer," Nichols and the Four Principals Overcome the Film's Hopeless Misogyny
","It is unlikely I have seen a more misogynistic film since Neil LaBute's 'In the Company of Men', but director Mike Nichols uses his uncanny ability to delve deep into the human condition to come up with a challenging, superbly acted and at times surprisingly empathetic film about four self-absorbed, unsympathetic people. I'm not sure what other director could have been better qualified to translate Patrick Marber's stinging, cynical play set in an urban chic London. As he has proved from his 1966 debut, 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' through 1971's 'Carnal Knowledge' to 'Angels in America' last year, Nichols knows how to humanize the brutality and emotional pain that people can inflict on each other. This master's skill is what prevents this 2004 drama from shriveling up into a wearing exercise in manipulation and deceit.Writing the screenplay from his own play, Marber provides dialogue that is alternately sharp, observant and harshly erotic. At times, his acerbic work reminds me of Frederic Raphael's superb 1960's screenplays for 'Darling' and 'Two for the Road'. The story that brings the four characters into a sexual intersection of tête-à-têtes and one-upmanship does get rather convoluted. The film covers about four years in elapsed time but takes liberties with scene transitions, focusing on the beginnings and endings of relationships and consequently complicating the chronology and timing of events, sometimes unnecessarily. Suffice it to say that each character figures out his or her capacity for hurting someone else and then goes about feeling empowered, guilty or some combination of both. It is telling that there are hints and often threats of physical abuse in the dialogue, but nothing is executed until a final, defining slap, filmed in slow motion, of course.The acting is uniformly strong, though I believe the 'beautiful people' aspect of the casting does distance the actors from the audience, perhaps intentionally. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but she surprises as Anna, the photographer who becomes the focal point of a shark-infested triangle. Looking rather sallow and absurdly thin, Roberts doesn't come across as all that attractive here, but her sullen demeanor seems to free her from the contrivances Hollywood has offered her for the past fifteen years. It seems inevitable that she is now playing the older woman archetype now, and she accepts her fate with a seasoned truthfulness that propels the rest of the characters. That she gives the weakest performance among this quartet is a tribute to the high caliber of the talent involved. At first, the overexposed Jude Law plays Dan, the ethically challenged writer who fails as a novelist, as a hopeless romantic, but what he gradually uncovers is a tormented soul weakening under the burden of his deceptions. It's a brave performance especially since his character is the one most willing to hurt the others deeply for his own selfish motives.Playing Larry, the equally manipulative and sexually insecure dermatologist, Clive Owen finally sinks his teeth into a role that makes the most of his swarthy on screen persona. His emotional nakedness and bull-in-a-china-shop approach to his problems make a brutishly affecting counterpoint to Law's rather effete character. And in what amounts to a revelation, Natalie Portman is alternately vulnerable and bruising as Alice, the stripper who falls hard for Dan and won't give Larry the intimacy he needs when he is rejected by Anna. Eschewing any trace of the child actor she was, Portman tantalizes with her flighty sexuality and then grounds her character deeply when she is subject to an excruciating break-up from Dan. Her character's evolution, however sketchily it is presented, is the only one that achieves a poignancy that nearly transcends the story's cynicism. I have to admit the unrelenting tone does induce a numbing effect that makes you wonder why you should care about the fate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them. The only significant extra in the 2005 DVD is a music video of Damien Rice's 'The Blower's Daughter', which is used effectively as a musical bridge for their comings and goings. Highly recommended though don't expect to feel life-affirmed afterward.",7,2,3,31 March 2008
Capote," Startling Hoffman Performance Emblazons Intense Treatment of Capote's Life-Changing Episode
","Although he was a celebrated author, I have to admit my initial familiarity with Truman Capote came from his frequent appearances during the 1970's on 'The Tonight Show' with Johnny Carson, as well as his silly appearance as duplicitous millionaire Lionel Twain in Neil Simon's 1978 'Murder by Death'. Capote's effete manner and often patronizing comments (e.g., he opined that all actors were basically stupid) made such a strong impression on me that it was not until much later that I realized he wrote such gems such as 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', 'The Grass Harp', 'The Thanksgiving Visitor', and of course, his seemingly atypical masterwork, 'In Cold Blood'. It is the intensive research and writing of this latter work, a self-proclaimed 'non-fiction novel' published to great acclaim in 1965, which is the basis of this well-crafted though sometimes slowly paced movie.For those who have not read 'In Cold Blood' or seen the stark 1967 film adaptation directed by Richard Brooks, the true-life story focuses on Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, a pair of drifters who break into the home of a Kansas farm family in November 1959 based on a rumor that they had $10,000 stashed away. Upon discovering that the family had no money on hand, Smith and Hickock systematically killed the four members of the family. First-time director Bennett Miller recreates much of the book's plot, including the gory crime, within the context of the movie. On a broader level, this film focuses on Capote's journey of over four years in chronicling the story until the inevitable ending, and in the meantime getting to know the killers intimately, especially the more enigmatic Smith. Actor Dan Futterman, familiar from his guest turns on 'Will and Grace' and 'Sex in the City', has written a delicately balanced screenplay that highlights the contradictory forces with which Capote was grappling in getting his story on paper.Although Miller's direction and Futterman's script are both strong for rookie efforts, the key to the film's effectiveness lies in the performances. In a startling transformation, Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabits Capote from the most subtle mannerism to his inner soul. Always a fine character actor, Hoffman brings his dead-on impersonation to a level of consciousness that exudes just the right shadings of narcissism, vulnerability and self-destruction. From the snippets of Capote regaling cocktail party guests in Manhattan with his stories to his useless wardrobe name-dropping in Kansas, there is no question in Hoffman's performance that Capote is a man in love with himself. As author Harper Lee, Capote's closest confidante and research partner on the killings, the always watchable Catherine Keener unaffectedly presents the sturdiness of her plain-spoken character, and their close, painfully honest relationship is believable.The other striking performance is provided by Clifton Collins Jr., who brings out the alternating coldness and vulnerability in Smith, especially as his character naively and desperately comes to regard Capote as his friend. The prison cell scenes between Hoffman and Collins have an intriguing, disturbing charge that subconsciously seems to point to the homo-erotic nature of their relationship. Smaller roles are filled expertly  Chris Cooper in familiar territory as Sheriff Alvin Dewey and Bruce Greenwood as Capote's patient lover, author Jack Dunphy  though their scenes feel truncated compared to the rest of the story. In fact, the film feels rushed toward the end as Capote is obviously deeply affected by the events and his own culpability in the killers' fate. I only wish there was a greater sense of a denouement to the film, but regardless, the film is certainly worth seeing for Hoffman's masterful performance.",8,0,0,24 December 2005
Life of Pi," Sumptuous, CGI-Generated Images Bring Martel's Book Vividly to Life
","Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee ('Brokeback Mountain'). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki ('Howl's Moving Castle'). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.Adapted by David Magee ('Finding Neverland'), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda ('The Curious Case of Benjamin Button') and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.Similarities to Robert Zemeckis' 'Cast Away' and Alfred Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' are probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan ('The Namesake') plays Pi in the present with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel. Khan's movie wife from 'The Namesake', Tabu, shows up as Pi's understanding mother, and Gérard Depardieu appears inexplicably in a cameo as the freighter ship's nasty cook. Rafe Spall ('One Day') plays Martel in a rather nondescript manner. It's not a perfect film, but many of the sumptuous images will likely stick with you for a long while afterward.",8,11,21,16 December 2012
The Devil Wears Prada," Magnificent Meryl Completely Elevates a Sharp Look at the World of Predatory Fashionistas
","Even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989's 'She-Devil' and 1992's 'Death Becomes Her', Meryl Streep truly nails it in this smart, creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments. As Miranda Priestly, the despotic editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Streep simply singes the screen every time she appears with her perfectly upswept hair; arrogant couture opinions and frequently unreasonable demands on her staff.Fortunately, director David Frankel has come along well since his 1995 Woody Allen knockoff, the irritatingly unctuous 'Miami Rhapsody', and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of 'Sex in the City' and 'Entourage'. He moves the film at such a sharp, fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture. The one-line zingers also come fast and furious thanks to Aline Brosh McKenna's deep-dish script based on Lauren Weisberger's best-selling novel, but the vitriol does not come at the expense of character development and a shrewdly observed storyline about all-or-nothing careers when working for media royals and courtiers.The plot's protagonist is not Priestly but Andy Sachs, a young idealist and aspiring journalist who just graduated from Northwestern. Even though she has no interest in fashion, she lands an interview at Runway. Because she is not a typically bootlicking, anorexic fashionista toady, Priestly hires her as her second assistant. It becomes a nightmarish trial by fire, as Andy slowly earns the trust of Priestly much to the chagrin of the haughty first assistant Emily. And despite the derision of her circle of friends, including her live-in boyfriend, Sachs starts to respect Priestly's style and power, which leads to the decision to have Andy go to Paris for Fashion Week. Further complications ensue when a hotshot writer takes an interest in her and a power struggle erupts at Runway.It really takes someone of Streep's caliber to pull off the impossible character of Priestly because when she does have a moment of vulnerability, it resonates so much more than it should. Although she is far too pretty to be considered frumpy by anyone's standards, the naturally likable Anne Hathaway plays Sachs serviceably and looks sensational in a series of Chanel outfits. She brings the necessary heart to the story, even though the character arc is rather predictable. It does seem a shame that we are supposed to cheer the character's reduction from size 6 to 4, but that is probably as accurate as anything else in the film.There is terrific work from the reliable Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Runway's no-nonsense fashion director, especially as he patiently works under Priestly's shadow and gives Sachs hard-to-take survival advice, and from Emily Blunt, who plays first assistant Emily with the ideal combination of vitriol and desperation. Overly metrosexualized with the strangest blond eyebrows I have ever seen, Simon Baker lends an appropriately smarmy edge to his writer Christian Thompson. Far less interesting are Sachs' judgmental friends, in particular Adrian Granier as Sachs' sous-chef boyfriend and Tracie Thoms as art gallery owner Lilly. The ending is inevitable, but it moves in a creative way that makes neither Sachs overly heroic nor Priestly absolutely villainous. This is solid entertainment elevated by the artistry of Streep.",8,69,104,3 July 2006
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The Legendary Falconetti Anchors Dreyer Silent Classic
","I was completely floored when I first saw this movie in the basement of the San Jose Main Library sometime in the early seventies. The mesmerizing performance of Maria (Renée) Falconetti, filmed primarily as a series of brutalizing close-ups, is still the main reason to revisit Carl Theodor Dreyer's austere and claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. There is little provided in the way of background or context, as Dreyer made an intentional decision to use the original trial records as the basis of his dialogue. Using a minimum of sets, almost abstract in orientation, he uses the camera frame as his canvas by showing the bullying interrogation of Joan by her inquisitors in a series of face shots against a white backdrop. The actors had to use their make-up-free faces as their sole means of expression. There are never any establishing shots, so the viewer never knows where the characters are in relationship to each other. Instead, Dreyer uses dramatic camera angles to convey people's position in the story. As the film builds to its climax, graphic footage of Joan being burned at the stake alternates with sequences of angry French peasants being brutally driven out of Rouen Castle by club-wielding English soldiers. Many of the shots feel abstract and out of proportion to convey a world turned upside down.The overall effect of these creative and daring techniques gives the film a more contemporary feeling than a standard silent, and luckily, adding to the freshness of the treatment is a pristine print found in Copenhagen, the basis of the transfer in this Criterion Collection DVD. An effectively stirring enhancement is Richard Einhorn's beautiful 'Voices of Light', an oratorio specifically written to accompany the film decades after its release. Falconetti was 35 when she played the 19-year old peasant girl, but she is entirely convincing using her large eyes and facial plains to build her character's spirit as it dwindles under the pressure of the French clergymen who rule her fate. One truly believes her assertion that she is a messenger for God. Never to act on screen again, she gives a truly legendary performance deserving of the hosannas received over the years. The DVD contains an interesting commentary track on which Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg provides a wealth of information. It also contains features on the film's unusually stylized production design, Einhorn's music, and the checkered history of the many versions that 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' has gone through over the years. In spite of its unrelenting tone and some scenes that will make you wince, it's a masterwork that still resonates 77 years later.",10,7,9,14 December 2005
Captain America: The First Avenger," Seemingly Old-Fashioned Superhero Epic Gives the Marvel Franchise More Life Than Expected
","It should come as no surprise that this mid-summer 2011 entry into the Marvel Comics-originated series would be the most unabashedly old-fashioned of all the Avengers-related sagas, but what is admirable about this particular epic adventure is how committed director Joe Johnston ('October Sky') and co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely ('The Chronicles of Narnia') appear to be in telling their somewhat revisionist story with such patriotic, good-versus-evil fervor on its own comic-book terms. There is nothing emotionally complex about the tale of this familiar superhero beyond a standard-issue time-travel element to bring all the Avengers story lines together. Bookended by present-day scenes, the bulk of the story focuses on our stalwart hero and his primary adversary, and how they confront each other during the height of World War II. In many respects, the film has a spiritual kinship with earlier retro-style epics like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and the 1977 version of 'Superman'.The historical part of the story begins in Norway where we see renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt uncovering an extraordinary power source which he plans to use for global domination. Meanwhile back in the US, diminutive and physically weak Steve Rogers is trying desperately to serve his country in the military, but he can't get past his 4-F status. His plucky tenacity does not go unnoticed as émigré military scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine selects him for a highly risky experiment that will transform him into a muscular soldier with superhuman strength and speed. He performs a heroic act of derring-do against a Nazi spy that throws him immediately into the spotlight, and the US government decides to use him to sell savings bonds at patriotic USO revues. However, when Steve finds out his best buddy 'Bucky' Barnes is lost behind enemy lines, Captain America is truly born complete with his indestructible Vibranium shield. Naturally, he not only saves 'Bucky' but the entire battalion who were given up for dead. All of this merely sets up the final showdown with the evil Schmidt, who has transformed himself into Red Skull, the super-powered head of HYDRA, the Nazi's occult research arm.While the action in the second half is well-paced and impressively choreographed, it also feels increasingly overblown when you consider how Captain America steadfastly remains a beacon of service and loyalty as a direct contrast to the megalomania of Red Skull. The finale feels anti-climactic in many ways. Already familiar to Marvel fans as the hot-headed Johnny Storm/'The Human Torch' in the 'Fantastic Four' movies, Chris Evans does surprisingly well playing such an earnest character, especially the first part where CGI effects turn him into the classic 98-pound weakling. Hugo Weaving has a field day as Schmidt, even if his character's motivations start to come across as simplistic. Other actors fare just as well if somewhat predictably given the lack of true dimension they are given to play - Toby Jones (Truman Capote in 'Infamous') as HYDRA's No. 2, Dr. Arnim Zola; Stanley Tucci as the slyly supportive Erskine; and Tommy Lee Jones in full military bluster as Colonel Chester Phillips. Only Hayley Atwell comes across as too wan to play the tough-acting strategic officer Peggy Carter, Steve's romantic interest which the filmmakers barely have time to explore. No matter since the whole venture has obviously been designed as a springboard for 2012's 'Avengers' sequel.",7,5,11,1 August 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Breathless, Suspenseful Action Really Shows Greengrass' Mastery of this Genre
","As director Paul Greengrass proved with United 93 last year, he has an uncanny ability to tap into something viscerally powerful with his films. His extensive background in documentary film-making really comes to the fore when it comes to the ultra-lean storytelling, propulsive pacing and superbly rendered action sequences in this genuinely suspenseful 2007 film. Densely conceived plot turns are swift and sometimes contrived enough for eye-rolling, but Greengrass knows how to keep a viewer enraptured with his pure cinematic technique. As the third and presumably final entry in the Bourne series, which update Robert Ludlum's nail-biting novels from post-Vietnam War to the far more ambiguous post-9/11 era, this one picks up immediately where 2004's The Bourne Supremacy left off with CIA assassin Jason Bourne still struggling to recollect his past as he dismantles conspiracies emanating from the senior operatives within the agency.Bourne has become the CIA's most-wanted. Regardless, despite a number of cunning assassins on his trail, he is intent on finding out who he is amid muddled flashbacks of mysterious interrogations. He gets help from fellow CIA agent Nicky Parsons, his former Paris contact, in Madrid where they end up in a diabolical chase through the alleys and rooftops of Tangiers. Both returning from Supremacy, Christopher Rouse's kinetic editing and Oliver Wood's hand-held camera-work make a powerful impact on this scene by making the action feel compellingly claustrophobic. The action all works toward a head-turning series of twists that bring Bourne closer to his real identity. The elaborately constructed screenplay is credited to three writers - Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi - who know how to play off our own paranoia about security and U.S. intelligence. Playwright Tom Stoppard apparently also had a hand in the final script. A sharp, Grade-A cast has been assembled, though this movie is obviously not an actor's showcase. Matt Damon returns as Bourne, all cool physicality with enough non-ironic humanity to allow us a rooting interest in his fate.Bringing her natural authority to the role, Joan Allen also makes an effortless return as Deputy CIS Director Pamela Landy. Her philosophical adversary at the agency is the Machiavellian CIA official Noah Vosen played with surprising relish by the usually low-key David Straithairn. Paddy Considine makes the most of his few scenes as the understandably confused Ross, while an avuncular Albert Finney shows up late in the film with menacing subtlety as the key to Bourne's memory. The one weak link continues to be Julia Stiles, who maintains her poker-faced petulance as Parsons from the previous films and remains only marginally interesting as Bourne's female foil by default in this go-around. However, it's really Greengrass' craftsmanship that shines brightest here. A perfect example can be seen in the extended breathtaking chase sequence with a British journalist Simon Ross being tracked through London's particularly busy Waterloo Station for a planned rendezvous with Bourne. If there is one drawback to the third film, it is the presumption of some understanding of what happened in the first two installments. It just makes some of the set-up a little harder to follow. Otherwise, this is bracing, often enthralling entertainment for anyone who loves this genre of cinema.",8,0,1,27 August 2007
The Aviator," Hughes at His Peak But Epic Biopic Not Quite a Masterpiece
","This is an audacious, surprisingly amusing piece of Hollywood film-making by a veteran craftsman of the first magnitude, yet for a number of reasons, not necessarily of Martin Scorsese's sole doing, the movie does not resonate as much as you wish it would. In staying true to the spirit of multimillionaire magnate Howard Hughes between the late 1920's and the late 40's, Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan are stuck with the facts as they happened, and consequently, the film feels episodic with a great, sometimes dazzling story in the first 2/3 of its epic 166-minute running time and a pedantic, only occasionally involving last hour.You need to have some familiarity with Hughes' life to understand his halcyon years proving himself as a Hollywood tycoon worthy of respect, and his legendary excess during the three-year production of the now-forgotten 'Hell's Angels' is captured perfectly here with truly thrilling aviation sequences. Scorsese then focuses on Hughes' romance with Katharine Hepburn and captures the oddball chemistry of burgeoning eccentrics amid the frenzied environment of studio-owned Hollywood, in particular, the Cocoanut Grove nightclub. These sequences remind me a lot of Scorsese's failed musical, 'New York, New York', but this time he seems far more assured. Ava Gardner enters the picture in the forties, as Hughes builds luxury airplanes that can't fly and his obsessions and paranoia start to take over. There's a magnificently filmed sequence of Hughes crashing his XF-11 plane in the middle of Beverly Hills.Once he recovers from this incident, the film starts to drag, as the story shifts focus to the power struggles in positioning Hughes' airline TWA against the European-route monopoly of Pan Am and the machinations of Pan Am CEO Juan Trippe and the corrupt Maine senator Owen Brewster who investigates Hughes' WWII government contracts. Even the legendary mini-flight of the Spruce Goose fails to excite this late in the story. Only Scorsese's famous 'Taxi Driver'-like, mind-bending touch brings off the surrealism of the sequences where Hughes locks himself up in his room. The film ends rather anticlimactically with Hughes' successful 1947 appearance before Brewster's committee before he drowns in his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Leonardo DiCaprio's chief asset as an actor is his intensity of purpose, and as Hughes, he has plenty of opportunities to display this attribute with his character's obsessions with aviation, movie-making, glamorous movie stars and ultimately germs. What he is missing is a level of gravitas that would have made his character's increasing eccentricities more bearable to watch. Even though the reed-thin Texas-tinged voice is accurate, there is something perpetually juvenile about DiCaprio's appearance regardless of the twenty-year span of the story. This unfortunately compromises the chemistry between him and the obviously more mature Cate Blanchett, who initially seems to be crossing the border into parody as Hepburn. She displays the familiar brusque manner without caution and even affects the recognizable voice but with an inaccurate throatiness that belies the legendary actress' high, fluttery pitch at the time. Nevertheless, she eventually finds her grounding, especially as she recognizes their too-similar personalities and softens during the Hepburn family gathering scene.With less to do, the too-patrician Kate Beckinsale is in over her head as Ava Gardner, unable to convey the real actress' palpable sultriness or predatory voraciousness without posturing. On the other hand, Alec Baldwin is becoming a stronger character actor with every new film, and he plays Trippe with disquieting authority. John C. Reilly plays assistant Noah Dietrich in his typically hangdog fashion as he subsists more in the shadows. Alan Alda plays Brewster with Hawkeye's familiar mannerisms unafraid to show the underlying sliminess of his character. All the externals are impressive - Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing (the pacing never drags...just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes. Yet for all of this, the movie falls short as a masterwork in Scorsese's filmography. This is a film to respect and not to love.The first disc has an excellent commentary track by Scorsese, Schoonover and producer Michael Mann - all full of insights without being pedantic. The number of extras on the second disc of the two-DVD set is staggering, really too much for anyone except for those deeply interested in Hughes. There is one deleted scene and twelve separate featurettes and documentaries covering everything from the production to Hughes' role in aviation to OCD to the music. Beyond the sheer number, my complaint about the set is that it's hard to maneuver around the decidedly viewer-unfriendly menus.",8,2,3,2 June 2006
Watchmen," Visual Dazzle Not Enough to Elevate the Revered Graphic Novel
","I should preface my review by admitting I have never read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 1987 graphic novel upon which this movie is based, and from my understanding, quite faithfully, at least until the end. Without such context, much less the fan-boy enthusiasm, this 2009 comic-book extravaganza is hamstrung by the limitations of conventional film-making despite a marathon 155-minute running time. The story is quite dense and multi-layered at first exposure, and while the alternate universe presented has strong entertainment value, there is less of a case for the frequent use of gratuitous violence to punctuate the nihilism of the story. Director Zack Snyder is an inspired choice to lead the character-driven mayhem given the visual invention he brought to the Battle of Thermopylae in 2007's '300'. His sharp eye for detail is evident throughout this elaborate production, but the movie has problems with pacing and more critically, a palpable absence of soul that would have made it more directly comparable to Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.Set in an alternate-reality 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term, the story has the Cold War moving into high gear with the Soviets willing to test our country's resolve with the potential of a nuclear strike. The opening credits effectively trace the semi-familiar history that brings the plot to this point with golden-era, costumed crime-fighters giving way to the next generation of superheroes in the 1970's. Snyder goes as far as recreating the Zapruder video of the Kennedy assassination with the smoking gun held by the morally bankrupt Comedian, one of the Watchmen who moved from WWII-era pop icon to reviled vigilante three decades later. Looking like the dark side of DC Comics' Justice League of America, the Watchmen had long disbanded by the time the Comedian is murdered in his apartment. This sparks at least some of the confederation to reunite albeit with trepidation. They turn out to be a motley group of psychological misfits beginning with Laurie Jupiter, a.k.a. Silk Spectre II, hesitant about wearing her latex suit again to fight for justice like her now-alcoholic mother, and Nite Owl, a fallen man reduced to impotence by retirement.More interesting are Dr. Manhattan, blue-skinned and nude with the power of a god thanks to a Hulk-like paranormal lab accident; and Ozymandias, now known as Adrian Viedt, the world's smartest man and a billionaire captain of industry. However, the most intriguing Watchman is the appropriately named Rorschach, who wears a face mask with constantly shifting ink blots. A true loner in the tradition of Travis Bickle in 'Taxi Driver', he expresses a visceral loathing for mankind's dissoluteness that manifests itself into the film's goriest scenes. All the characters feel disconnected from humanity, and their warped perspectives drive the story. While Snyder pulls few punches in his depiction of them, the primary problem with the film is that he can't seem to pull it all together to make a dark-hearted adventure that can soar. Except for a clever use of Bob Dylan's 'The Times, They Are A-Changin'' over the opening credits, Snyder's use of period music simply feels intrusive and out-of-sync without adding any texture to the film.Much of the comic-book-level dialogue also feels stilted, and unfortunately, few in the cast seem to know how to deliver it with conviction. The best of the bunch are Billy Crudup as the eerily becalming Dr. Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley constantly seething with Eastwood-level rage as Rorschach. Jeffrey Dean Morgan registers with conviction in just a few scenes as the Comedian. However, their contributions are offset by the miscalculated performances of a too-bland Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Matthew Goode looking overly metrosexual as Ozymandia, and Malin Ackerman who plays Laurie in a petulant manner that trivializes her character's ambivalence about being a superhero. Granted there are good set-pieces like the bravura fight scene right at the beginning. Unfortunately, saddled with some surprisingly substandard CGI, the final scenes wring dramatically flat given the build-up to them, and they dampen my appetite for a sequel with the survivors. Even with all its flaws, the film boasts a visual audacity that is hard to pass up, especially if your appetite has been whetted by the novel. Clearly, Snyder has put greater priority in maintaining fidelity to the source material rather than making a movie that could resonate for the rest of us.",6,1,4,10 March 2009
Grease," Nostalgic Nostalgia Fest Maintains Its Superficial Bounce
","It's hard to think of a bigger slice of 1970's Hollywood kitsch than this candy-coated, mega-successful 1978 musical comedy. Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse.Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo.All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited 'Summer Nights' and the stylized 'Jailhouse Rock' knock-off, 'Greased Lightning'. Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, 'You're the One That I Want'. John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here.The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking 'Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee' and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching 'There Are Worse Things I Could Do'. Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading 'Beauty School Dropout' to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy.Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 'Rockin' Rydell Edition' DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic 'Grease Day' featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast.",6,2,5,24 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," A Bumpy Ride for the Hoovers Makes for a Thorough Enjoyable Character-Driven Comedy
","Road movies are a particular weakness for me, and this out-of-left-field 2006 movie is no exception. It's a charmer written by first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt about a dysfunctional family that you end up liking in spite of how they often act. Co-directed by the husband and wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, this uproarious comedy obviously benefits from both perspectives in balancing the satirical elements with the subtleties of the character arcs in the Hoover family as we follow them in their dilapidated Volkswagen van.The plot revolves around seven-year old Olive, who finds out that she is a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach, California in two days. Her father Richard is a motivational speaker who wants the world to think he is the next Tony Robbins. Her grandfather has been thrown out of his retirement home for shouting expletives and snorting heroin. Her brother Dwayne reads Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he gets accepted for flight training into the Air Force Academy. Her Uncle Frank, a gay academic expert at Proust, has just been released from a hospital after trying to commit suicide over his lover's abandonment. Her no-nonsense mother Sheryl tries to hold the family together through sheer will but often finds herself lost under the strained circumstances.Eerie visions of JonBenet Ramsey will come back to you when you see the pageant climax itself but not before the actors inject a great deal of humanity into their performances. Reunited after playing a divorcing couple in 2001's 'Dinner with Friends', Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette show their expertise in portraying a marriage in trouble. With a wariness corrupting his usual preppy veneer, Kinnear brings out the nasty edge of a resentful man unable to fulfill his ambitions. Collette continues to impress with her unique combination of sharp intelligence and visceral emotionalism. As Frank, Steve Carell shows a surprising ability for gravitas that his Frat Pack cronies have not yet exhibited. Veteran actor Alan Arkin is a welcome presence as Grandpa, and looking appropriately Goth-like, Paul Dano is hilariously dead-eyed as Dwayne.Abigail Breslin is an unaffected joy as Olive, and she makes the most of the talent competition in the film's most winning moments. There are also memorable bits from Paula Newsome as a curt grief counselor; Beth Grant as a snippy, bouffant-headed pageant official; and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe from '24') showing her trademark perturbed look as a contest assistant. There are some contrived moments, for example, the chance encounter between Frank and his lover in the convenience store or the free-wheeling freeway exit contortions, when reality is sacrificed for dramatic effect. On the whole, however, this idiosyncratic road movie is well worth the ride share.",8,1,4,6 August 2006
Hugo," A Tribute to Scorsese's Cinematic Virtuosity Despite Clear Flaws
","If a movie was judged solely by its cinematic dazzle and sheer appreciation of the wonders of the medium, then Martin Scorsese's virtuosic 2011 adventure drama should have taken home the Best Picture Oscar hands down. However, there is something overly meticulous and dramatically inert in the execution that somehow makes the film miss its mark for me emotionally. As much as I admired all the technical achievements presented here, I felt a bit of a chill when it came to the emotional elements. Adapted by John Logan ('The Aviator') from Brian Selznick's historic fiction novel, 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' (2007), the fanciful story centers on Hugo, a twelve-year-old urchin who lives within the walls of Paris' Gare Montparnasse railway station in 1931. His father was a master clockmaker who took Hugo to see the early films of cinematic pioneer Georges Méliès (1902's 'A Trip to the Moon) and was working on his most ambitious project, repairing a mechanical robot who could write with a pen, when he died suddenly in a fire.Hugo is taken away by his drunkard uncle, who took care of the main railway clock until he disappeared one night. All the while, the boy obsesses over finishing his father's project by pilfering gears and other parts he finds in the station toy shop run by none other than Méliès who has fallen on hard times. Now an embittered man, he take's Hugo's prized notebook with all his father's notes and threatens to burn it as punishment. However, Méliès decides to let the boy earn back the parts he stole by working in the shop. Hugo also meets Méliès' precocious goddaughter, an orphan named Isabelle who is a bit older than him. They bond immediately with he taking her to the movies for the first time and she leading him to the key that unlocks the mechanical man's programmed capabilities. Through quite a few convolutions in the plot, including an elaborate dream sequence, the connection between Méliès and his earlier groundbreaking work is finally recognized and celebrated.Finally back in a top-grade production, Ben Kingsley plays the gruff and mysterious filmmaker-turned-toyshop owner with the ideal mix of austerity and frustration. Chloë Grace Moretz ('Kick-Ass') is also winning and immensely likable as Isabelle. The same can't be quite said about Asa Butterfield's ('The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas') sullen performance in the title role. The young actor has the immense weight of the story on his shoulders, but he doesn't provide enough conviction to gravitate the heart to Hugo's plight. The most problematic performance is Sacha Baron Cohen's ('Borat') slapstick-driven turn as the station inspector. It's not so much the stunt-casting aspect as it is the anomalous approach he takes in making the character strangely menacing with little redeeming value. Much smaller roles are taken by Jude Law as Hugo's father and Emily Mortimer as a flower girl. Scorsese's visual team has done near-flawless work here, starting with production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, both of whom bring 1930's Paris to vivid life with exacting detail and burnished brushstrokes.",7,1,2,18 March 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," Essential Courtroom Drama Questions the Accountability of WWII War Crimes Via a Powerful Cast
","Screenwriter Abby Mann and actor Richard Widmark died within a day of each other just this past week, which makes a revisit with this eminently powerful 1961 courtroom drama all the more appropriate. At an epic-length 186 minutes, the movie is a fictionalized account of one of the many trials held after WWII before the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal, this one the 1948 trial of four Nazi judges who used their power to enable the Third Reich to conduct experiments upon Jewish prisoners, and had accountability for murder, brutalities, torture, and other atrocities directed toward the Jews. Directed by Stanley Kramer ('The Defiant Ones', 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'), the king of socially conscious cinema in the late fifties and sixties, the film digs deeply into the ethics of assigning war crimes responsibility to individuals.The heavyweight cast is the primary draw here. With his quiet authority, Spencer Tracy plays Chief Judge Dan Haywood who has the unenviable task of presiding over the tribunal. For the prosecution is attorney Col. Tad Lawson, who shows actual footage from the devastating remains of the German concentration camps when they were liberated. Widmark plays Lawson with equal parts grit and petulance. Defense attorney Hans Rolfe is portrayed by a young Maximilian Schell in a volcanic performance as his character raises valid questions on the degree of the defendants' accountability. As the trial moves along, two key episodes dominate the proceedings with two icons playing near-cameo roles. A fidgety Montgomery Clift plays a mentally unstable victim of Nazi sterility measures, and a downcast Judy Garland is an Aryan hausfrau accused of having sexual relations with a Jew, a crime punishable by death for the Jew guilty of 'racial pollution'. Kramer draws out brilliant turns on the stand by both actors.Burt Lancaster plays Ernst Janning, the only one Among the four defendants who shows a trace of a conscience given his aristocratic background and known early resistance to the Third Reich. Even with aging make-up, the strapping actor appears physically wrong for the mostly passive role, but he manages to deliver his final testimony with knowing conviction. One of the other judges is a surprisingly vituperative Werner Klemperer memorable later as the befuddled Col. Klink on TV's 'Hogan's Heroes', and also in the supporting cast is a young William Shatner, well before 'Star Trek', as Haywood's aide. The legendary Marlene Dietrich plays a somewhat ancillary role as German widow Frau Bertholt, whose husband was put to death by Haywood for war crimes. In their key scene together, she and Tracy provide the film's most humane moments amid the unrelenting tension of the trial.Mann's script is superbly drawn out even if Kramer's ponderous direction can get a bit sluggish at times. The extras on the 2004 DVD are most worthwhile. First up is a twenty-minute conversation between Mann and Schell ('In Conversation with Abby Mann and Maximilian Schell'), where they talk extensively about not only the film but also the earlier 'Playhouse 90' TV version and the 2001 Broadway production (in which Schell played Janning). There are two other shorts  a six-minute dissection of the script by Mann ('The Value of a Single Human Being') and a 14-minute featurette about Kramer consisting primarily of interviews with his widow Karen ('A Tribute to Stanley Kramer'). There is also a photo gallery and the original theatrical trailer. I wish the DVD included the original TV version, but this is a superb telling of a most devastating episode in mankind's recent history.",9,0,1,7 April 2008
Disturbia," Teen-Oriented Voyeuristic Tale Unravels Hitchcock's Inspiration in Favor of Cheap Scares
","First things first, the only similarity this 2007 movie has with Alfred Hitchcock's classic voyeuristic thriller, 1954's Rear Window, is the basic concept of a temporarily immobile protagonist who sees highly suspicious activity from a distance only to find he may be endangered by what he may have witnessed. Other than the central plot device, the comparison falls apart since director D.J. Caruso (The Salton Sea) seems intent on making a teen-oriented thrill ride driven by angst and hormones. The focal point is teenaged Kale Brecht who has to spend his summer under police surveillance through a motion-detection ankle bracelet. The laborious set-up for this situation takes a good half-hour, though this is likely the best part of the film as it begins with a car crash visceral in impact and impressive in technical execution.Reeling from the tragic results of the accident, Kale punches his Spanish teacher in the face, for which the bracelet is his punishment. Increasingly bored and incorrigible, he has his electronic toys taken away by his exasperated mother, leaving him nothing to do but watch his neighbors with binoculars. Two figures new to the neighborhood come into focus - Ashley, a comely neighbor who becomes Kale's object of pubescent desire, and Mr. Turner, a taciturn bachelor whose suspicious behavior peaks Kale's interest and imagination. What happens next is unfortunately predictable and downright lazy, as screenwriters Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon eschew much of the psychological elements of the supposedly tense situation in favor of overly familiar, crowd-pleasing scare tactics.The violent, drawn-out finale is beyond absurd and further saddled by the restrictions of the film's PG-13 rating. In a role almost identical to the one he plays in Transformers, Shia LaBeouf brings energy and at times surprising gravity to Kale though not enough to compensate for the script's shortcomings. Sarah Roemer, looking like a cross between Kate Hudson and Jessica Biel, plays Ashley as a stock Lolita figure at least until she is called on conveniently to become resourceful. Even though he has the funniest lines, Aaron Yoo's role as goofball best pal Ronnie is poorly conceived to fit the plot machinations, and bereft of her Matrix coolness factor, Carrie-Anne Moss seems ill-used as Kale's put-upon mother. With his soft voice and unshakable manner, David Morse looks like he is having a good time playing Turner, but the character's revelations toward the end unravel any momentum of fear he was able to muster before.",4,0,2,6 September 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," A Different Kind of a Romcom with Quirkily Effective, Seriocomic Touches
","Portraying mental illness on screen usually means you'll see bravura scenes set in an asylum like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', but iconoclastic filmmaker David O. Russell ('The Fighter') deals with the edges of emotional disequilibrium in this compellingly quirky 2012 dramedy. Based on the same-name 2008 novel by Matthew Quick, this film reminds me a bit of Russell's 1999 dysfunctional family comedy, 'Flirting with Disaster', as the seriocomically volatile dynamics here are amplified by the central character's precarious psychological state. High school teacher Pat Solitano Jr. is a man with bipolar disorder who has spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric hospital for a violent episode caused by seeing his wife Nikki cheating with a fellow teacher. He's released into the care of his parents and determined to win back his estranged wife.As he strives to improve himself, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell facing her own level of mental instability since becoming widowed, turning to indiscriminate sex with her co-workers, and most recently losing her job. Eventually they strike a deal where she will help him win back his wife if he enters a dance competition with her, both coping with their disorders at the same time. At first, I really didn't buy Bradley Cooper ('The Hangover') as Solitano since his idea of showing manically obsessive behavior is to speak loudly in a monotone without much nuance, but his performance grew on me as Russell's screenplay had him show more layers to a character that has a hard time eliciting sympathy from anyone much less the audience. At 21, Jennifer Lawrence ('Winter's Bone') would appear too young to play a sex-addicted cop widow like Tiffany, but she excels with her preternatural ability to convey unforced maturity and conviction without losing touch with the character's deep-seeded vulnerability.Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of the Fockers franchise. Exhibiting his character's obsessive-compulsive disorder in powerful, brief scenes, De Niro vividly shows how the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Completely submerging her Australian roots in favor of a convincing Mid-Atlantic accent, Jacki Weaver ('Animal Kingdom') effectively plays the lone voice of sanity as Pat's mother constantly fretting over her son and preparing 'crabby snacks and homemades' for home viewing of the family's beloved Philadelphia Eagles. As Pat's best friend Danny, a fellow patient constantly escaping from the hospital, motor-mouthed, high-pitched Chris Tucker ('Rush Hour') is surprisingly good even if his soulful dance moves came across as a convenient plot device. Julia Stiles ('Mona Lisa Smile') shows up in a smallish role as Tiffany's patronizing, status- conscious sister Veronica. The climax induces the right emotions even if it means the uncertainties in the plot get wrapped up all too neatly.",8,2,3,2 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Complex, Propulsive Thriller Feels Chilled but a Superb Turn by Mara Kicks It into High Gear
","Having never read the late Stieg Larsson's 2005 source novel, an unforgivable oversight I know, I didn't know what quite to expect with this 2011 crime drama beyond what I already knew of director David Fincher's generally dark-hued work ('Fight Club', 'The Social Network'). For instance, I didn't know the film's narrative would be bifurcated until the midpoint of its 158-minute running time. One side of the movie belongs to the girl of the title, Lisbeth Salander, a deadened goth-punk computer genius, and the other side belongs to Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist whose latest exposé of corporate evil about a billionaire Swedish magnate has been declared libelous. Disgraced and broke, he accepts a private investigation job offered by Henrik Vanger, an elderly industrialist who would like to resolve the 40-year-old mystery of his murdered niece Harriet in the Swedish hinterlands up north. The list of suspects, Blomkvist is told, includes several members of Vanger's dysfunctional family, eccentric fascists and Nazis still living within walking distance from his manor.Obviously, as Blomkvist gets closer to the truth, his life becomes more endangered. Juxtaposed with Blomkvist's investigation is Lisbeth's unenviable existence back in Stockholm. Having just compiled an extensive background check on Blomkvist for Vanger, she has just been appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, due to her state-declared mental incompetency. Bjurman abuses his authority by forcibly raping her. Lisbeth eventually regains control of her life by blackmailing him in the most degrading manner possible, an act of revenge both horrifying and satisfying. Blomkvist decides to hire Lisbeth to help him uncover the connection between a cryptic message written in a notebook and a series of murders that occurred from the late 1940s to the mid- 1960s. The labyrinth plot escalates into a series of increasingly revealing connections between Harriet's disappearance and the entire Vanger dynasty, in particular, Harriet's brother Martin, now the CEO of the Vanger Corporation, and their estranged sister Anita, living in London with no desire to reunite with what remains of her family in Sweden.At the same time, Lisbeth and Blomkvist become romantically involved, which naturally brings its own set of complications but also provides the impetus for a final act of revenge. I assume screenwriter Steve Zaillian's adaptation of the source novel remains faithful, but just as important, he manages to present an elaborately plotted thriller with most of the necessary details presented intact. Fincher does an impressive job propelling this complicated story with dazzling cinematic technique and handles the more lurid moments with the same professional ease he displayed in 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac'. However, the meticulous emphasis on procedure sometimes disinfects the movie to the point of making the principals feel more like plot devices racing toward the resolution. At certain points, the plot developments feel as cold as the wintry Scandinavian setting. Despite this tonal discord, the cast works effectively within the story's convolutions and conventions. Even with a variable Swedish accent, Daniel Craig is able to submerge his cool Bond persona just enough to play the wry, middle-aged investigative reporter in a compellingly human manner.Christopher Plummer as Vanger, Joely Richardson as Anita, and Robin Wright as Blomkvist's married editor Erika all play their roles with precise authority and surprisingly convincing Swedish accents. In more challenging roles, Yorick van Wageningen as Lisbeth's abusive guardian and Stellan Skarsgård as Martin are even better. However, it's Rooney Mara (Mark Zuckerberg's scabrous girlfriend in the opening scene of 'The Social Network') who really gives the movie both its mystique and emotional wallop. With pale eyebrows, shapeless clothing, and awkward manner, Mara's Lisbeth concurrently craves attention and deflects it with almost every movement. The actress makes her character's savant skills and photographic memory perfectly believable and most of all, makes Lisbeth's seeming passivity quietly heartbreaking with a modicum of expression. It's a superb, star-making performance. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth deserves mention for capturing the severity of the chilled images needed to convey the story, while the original music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provides an appropriately haunting undercurrent.",8,1,6,5 July 2012
Dreamgirls," Dazzling Broadway Hit Becomes Top-Notch Cinematic Entertainment with a Superb Cast
","Like many others, I vividly recall how Jennifer Holliday sent shivers down my neck when she ripped through her defiant anthem, 'And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going', in the original Broadway production nearly a quarter century ago. It is the kind of transcendent moment in the theater that had exponentially raised my anticipation of the much-delayed 2006 screen adaptation. The great news is that director/screenwriter Bill Condon has pulled together a top-notch entertainment piece full of ceaseless energy and eye-filling dazzle. Even if the narrative deficiencies of Tom Eyen's original musical have not been resolved here, Condon compensates by bringing more historical context to the story and making even more pointed references to the characters' real-life counterparts. More importantly, he recognizes that the episodic human drama really takes a back seat to the early Motown-to-disco musical pastiche brought forth by Henry Krieger's sturdy, crescendo-heavy score and Eyen's constantly engaging lyrics.The time-spanning plot focuses on a girl group in Detroit, three childhood friends - vocal powerhouse Effie backed up by good-girl Deena and chatty Lorrell  who are together known as the Dreamettes. Showing promise but failing to win a local amateur contest, they are corralled by smooth-talking Cadillac huckster Curtis Taylor to sing back-up for local R&B star James Thunder Early. They become a hit on the chitlin' circuit, but Taylor wants broader fame. Along with Effie's ambitious, soft-spoken songwriting brother C.C., Taylor launches a new label, Rainbow Records, right out of his car dealership. They record a song that starts to move on the charts but not before it is lifted by a white group in an antiseptic cover version. Taylor turns to payola to ensure Early and the Dreamettes achieve pop success on their own. He also tries to tone down Early for white audiences and makeover the girls into the Dreams. The latter strategy means pushing Effie into the background and Deena upfront, a move that causes friction and resentment in spite of the group's burgeoning success. Eventually, Effie's diva behavior gets her kicked out of the Dreams, and Early's star fades into addiction and irrelevance. Meanwhile, Taylor has built a media empire with plans to make Deena a movie star. His Svengali-level of control reaches a breaking point when he takes back a song C.C. wrote for Effie's resuscitating solo career in order to make it a disco hit for the Dreams.It's most fortunate that casting is exemplary here because that could have easily been the film's downfall. Even though it is an ensemble piece, the lion's share of the press has been going to Jennifer Hudson's blazing debut performance as Effie. Standing in the shadow of the startlingly overwhelming Jennifer Holliday is no picnic, but with her zaftig figure and huge voice, Hudson effortlessly captures the character's sassy self-confidence and eventual emotional deconstruction. Musically, she clearly has the vocal chops and technique to nail all of Effie's numbers, especially 'And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going', the film's crowning moment. As Early, Eddie Murphy finally has a role that takes advantage of his gift for mimicry (this time an amalgam of Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson and James Brown  who sadly just died this morning), adds darker colors and textures to his established screen persona and dares him to try singing again. The result is nothing short of a revelation.As Deena, the obvious Diana Ross doppelganger, Beyoncé Knowles manages to hold her own, even though her character has not been sharpened into a stronger personality. A stunning woman by anyone's measure, she manages to capture her progenitor's breathy, slinky singing style, while lending a naturalistic quality to her portrayal. She has one shining musical moment, a new song called 'Listen', though ironically, her powerful vocal delivery seems at odds with Deena's supposedly limited talents. With the unenviable task of playing Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like figure of Machiavellian villainy, Jaime Foxx begins solid even as the character becomes more cardboard as the story progresses. With a beautifully soulful voice of her own, Anika Noni Rose shines as Lorrell moving fluidly from ditzy back-up singer to resigned mistress. Keith Robinson also displays a fine voice and brings gravitas to his subtle performance as C.C, while Danny Glover provides his welcome seasoned presence as Early's manager, Marty.There are several moments that are plain wonderful. One in particular is when Early starts to rehearse the Dreamettes on 'Fake Your Way to the Top', and as he gyrates, it turns into the actual stage show. Another is the near-operatic histrionics on 'It's All Over' when most of the principals take flashy, fiery turns to illuminate the story's turning point. I like some of the movie's more overt send-ups like Early wearing Marvin Gaye's knit cap as he sings his civil rights-themed ballad, 'Patience', or when Deena comes floating down the theater aisles blowing air kisses just like Diana Ross at the Motown reunion concert. All the production values are first-class from Tobias A. Schliessler's dazzling, color-saturated cinematography to Sharen Davis' va-va-voom costumes to Virginia Katz's kinetic film editing to John Myhre's evocative production design which includes recreations of the 1967 Detroit riots. Despite a smattering of weakly contrived dramatic moments in the second half, this is knockout entertainment for anyone who enjoys the musical genre.",9,3,6,25 December 2006
Being John Malkovich," One of the Most Wildly Inventive American Movies Shows Film-making Brio and Genuine Heart
","If anything, I enjoy the audacity and manic creativity of this 1999 black comedy more now than when it was first released. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who sends up the creative block he experienced after writing the film's script in 2002's 'Adaptation', plainly refuses to use any accepted cinematic convention to tell the wildly eccentric story of Craig Schwartz, a downtrodden puppeteer who has a must-be-seen-to-be-believed adventure. An uncompromising artiste who cannot find work within his craft, he decides to accept a job as a file clerk to please his frumpy, animal-loving wife, Lotte. Things immediately go awry when he sees his place of employment is on the dwarf-sized 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan office building. He becomes drawn to an ice-cold co-worker, an apparent femme fatale named Maxine, but the story really escalates into high gear when he discovers a secret passageway that turns out to be the consciousness of actor John Malkovich.The plot convolutions only get weirder yet strangely more resonant as Craig and others get to experience 'being John Malkovich', including the actor himself. What subsequently happens is constantly off-kilter, but Kaufman brings perceptive insight into all the major characters in ways that are completely unpredictable. The beauty is that repeated viewings only bring out plot nuances that were not as apparent the previous times. Director (and sometime actor) Spike Jonze is an inspired choice to lead the proceedings since he lends an almost verité-style to the film making the lunacy seem human-sized. Casting is pure gold with a bedraggled-looking John Cusack appropriately awestruck as Craig, a cast-against-type Cameron Diaz energized by her curiosity as Lotte and Catherine Keener sharply feline as Maxine. Orson Bean brings out all the eccentricities of Craig's oddly deranged boss, and no one is better cast than Malkovich as a wildly narcissistic version of himself, especially as the plot spins further into a Freudian fantasy of monstrous proportions.This is wildly inventive film-making that may alienate several viewers, but it really should be embraced as the kind of bold experimentation that mainstream Hollywood rarely attempts. The 2002 DVD extras are also pure gold, including an interview with Jones conducted under mock-stress; a brief featurette, 'An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering,' that spotlights the behind-the-scenes work performed by puppet master Phil Huber; and a short called 'Intimate Portrait of the Art of Background Driving', which purportedly documents the experiences of extras driving cars in the New Jersey Turnpike scenes where all of the Malkovich travelers end up. Along with the original theatrical trailer and several TV promotional spots, there are also two played-straight videos, excerpts of which are shown in the film - one the '7 ½ Floor Orientation' and the other the vaunted pseudo-documentary, 'American Arts and Culture Presents: John Horatio Malkovich, Dance of Despair and Disillusionment'. A genuinely entertaining package overall.",10,8,18,11 September 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Sharp Script and Carell's Skillful Underplaying Make for a Hilarious, Humane Comedy
","The very concept of this movie sent a chill up my spine, as I was preparing myself for the return of Pee Wee Herman and the inevitable man-child clichés that would come with a character bearing the movie's title. Contrary to my expectations, this film is a frequently hilarious, surprisingly humane comedy that goes well beyond the inevitable deflowering process. First-time director Judd Apatow smartly averts the movie from being a one-joke premise and provides instead a perceptive overview of the romantic anxieties and social pressures faced by those looking unsuccessfully for intimacy. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of crude humor and graphic sex jokes, but more importantly, it has a heart thanks primarily to a thoughtful script by Apatow and Steve Carell.In a sharply comic performance, Carell plays the title character, Andy Stitzer, as a socially clueless, emotionally inert loner in a paralyzing state of arrested development. Surrounded by his exhaustive action figure collection and working in a Circuit City-type electronics store, he rides a bike, doesn't know how to drive and doesn't seem to want to despite living in LA (the one plot contrivance) and can talk endlessly about making egg salad as the highlight of his weekend. Andy works with a trio of co-workers who all think of themselves erroneously as wise in the ways of love, and upon discovering Andy's virginity, they are determined to help him get a woman.But the film doesn't focus so much on the pursuit as it does in peeling off the layers of Andy's personality - the fundamental terror that has kept him from women, a constant need for order and logic to fill the void, and finally an eagerness for life to stay simple and uncomplicated so that he can live without confronting his fear. In short, he has rationalized sex and intimacy out of his life, that is, until he meets Trish, a nice, eccentric single mom running an eBay transaction store. Their burgeoning relationship is the heart of the story, and it certainly helps to have the always wonderful Catherine Keener play Trish in such a warm, loopy fashion that it's easy to believe the mutual attraction.The supporting performances are terrific - Paul Rudd portrays Andy's closest colleague David, who cannot get over his failed relationship which he faces again in a chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend at a speed dating event; Romany Malco plays Jay, a married philanderer who eventually gets caught; Seth Rogen as Cal, who thinks he's a ladies' man despite all the evidence to the contrary; and Jane Lynch from 'Best in Show' as their manager, a power-driven woman who in a very funny scene, discreetly offers herself to Andy and serenades him with a Guatemalan folk song.There are several great scenes, including the poker scene where Andy awkwardly talks about women knowingly, the already famous chest hair-waxing where Andy yells out a series of Tourette-like epithets, and the surreal musical production number at the end, which will get any baby boomer giggling with abandon. Truth be told, it runs a bit too long and sags toward the last third, but I doubt if I have laughed at a film so much in the past year.",8,2,4,20 December 2005
Jarhead," Gulf War Frustrations Vividly Captured Even Though Characters Remain Distant
","Some films work more effectively on a visceral level than a logical one, and this 2005 film adaptation of U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 biting memoir is one of them. Chronicling the author's time from boot camp through the brief 1991 Gulf War, director Sam Mendes fills his sometimes blackly comic film with brutalizing images that give it a consistently propulsive urgency. Written by William Broyles Jr. (who had wartime duty in Vietnam as a pilot), it is not really a combat film as the focus of the story is the incessant waiting that the ground troops endured before realizing the conflict was over almost as soon as it began. Mendes and Broyles have us look at the preparation for the ground war within an episodic structure that keeps everything at arm's length emotionally. Moreover, they borrow liberally from previous military-themed films  not only obvious references to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' and Brian DePalma's 'Casualties of War' but also paeans to the group dynamics in WWII-era movies with each of the Marines representing familiar wartime archetypes.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the fresh-faced Swofford and does an admirable job here as he outwardly expresses his enthusiasm, especially when he gets chosen to be a surveillance sniper, but inwardly has gnawing misgivings about his tour of duty. His becalmed voice-over is what ties the loose connective tissue of the story, as well as the constant punishment Swofford receives from his superiors, including a humiliating demotion from lance corporal to private for covering an act of false bravado by a fellow recruit. Peter Sarsgaard plays Swofford's scouting partner Troy in his trademark elliptical manner given that his character's motivations remain suspect until revelations come to light toward the end. Due to the nature of the film, other characters are not as fully realized, including Jamie Foxx doing commendable work in a relatively small role as the unyielding Staff Sgt. Sykes (his one personal scene when he discusses his life at home seems shoehorned in), Dennis Haysbert in a couple of scenes as the arrogant Major Lincoln, Chris Cooper effectively Schwartzkopf-like as Lt Colonel Kazinski, and the young actors portraying Swofford's fellow recruits. It took me a while to recognize Lucas Black, who plays the horny redneck Kruger, as the young boy in Billy Bob Thornton's 'Sling Blade'.Performances aside, the standout work is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which captures the surreal atmosphere of the deserts with the mirage-inducing heat during the day and the burning oil wells at night. There are few scenes more painfully evocative of the war than the one where the Marines come upon the charred remains of locals frozen as if caught in an A-bomb attack. The overall realism of the movie is what makes this noteworthy, and to the filmmakers' credit, it has no political agenda beyond showing the agonies of serving in prospect of a war. The soundtrack has period-appropriate music that runs the gamut from Nirvana to Naughty by Nature to C+C Music Factory. The obvious comparison the film engenders is with David O. Russell's 1999 'Three Kings', which shares the same setting and a similar orientation toward black comedy, though I have to say that Russell's film is more inventive. Still, Mendes is an individualistic director whose work is always worth experiencing.The DVD has several solid extras, including two separate commentary tracks. Interestingly, the one with Swofford and Broyles, both familiar with military service firsthand, is more informative than the one provided by Mendes, who focuses more on the themes and his inspirations. There are a handful of deleted scenes which were understandably excised, including one with Sam Rockwell playing Swofford's gung-ho military uncle talking to the camera (actually to Swofford in a flashback), a seeming rip-off of a Christopher Walken's scene in 'Pulp Fiction'. There is another set of scenes under the umbrella of Swofford's fantasies, also deleted, but intriguing for the black comedy aspect that they seemed to serve. Also included is a longer version of the interview sequence where the media volleys questions to the recruits in documentary style. Veteran film editor Walter Murch adds his commentary to Mendes' on all the deleted scenes.",7,0,1,9 April 2006
Collateral," Stylish Action Built on Character and Mann's Bravura
","For the most part, this is one sharp crime thriller that doubles as a character study of two lonely men. If that premise does not appeal to you, then you probably can't appreciate director Michael Mann's unique film-making style, which is an intoxicating mix of nocturnal urban sleekness and characters that peel off layers of their psyche to drive the plot. This is not a standard action film, not by a long shot, as it is really about the relationship between a hit man named Vincent and a cab driver named Max, thrown together by chance and becoming more inextricably connected as the convoluted story unfolds. Vincent is as mono-maniacally cold-blooded as one can expect in this type of film, but Stuart Beattie's script reveals a well-educated, rather erudite man who may have been triggered by an abusive childhood to follow this line of work. In salt-and-pepper hair and without his trademark smile, Tom Cruise is relatively good as Vincent, though as with most of his films, there is an air of posturing about his performance that negates the malice of his character. At the same time, when it comes to his character's profession, he is convincing as an expert at his craft, who has mastered a clear method of killing that absolves him of blame and conscience.The focal point of this 2004 film, however, is Max, who represents the story's moral conscience. He is also a complex figure, a man who has deluded himself with dreams of running his own limousine service. Max makes it sound convincing at first, but then his credibility starts to unravel under Vincent's astute microscope and as the immediate situation becomes more desperate. Consequently, he is forced not only to drive Vincent around LA but also to look at himself for what he is. Were it not for his uncanny impersonation of Ray Charles, this is the performance that would have pushed Jamie Foxx to the front ranks. As Max, he captures all the inner conflict showing surprising pockets of courage when he realizes he has nothing to lose. The interplay between Vincent and Max is what makes this film uniquely intriguing, as it is just not about a villain holding a reluctant victim hostage but about two men who leverage each other's blind spots and weaknesses to fulfill their immediate goals.Too infrequent on the screen recently, Jada Pinkett-Smith is sharp and memorable in a small but pivotal role as Annie, a federal prosecutor who gets drawn to Max at the beginning. Mark Ruffalo, taking a break from indies, is effective as the slicked-back LA detective who is not sure who his suspect is. Irma P. Hall has a briefly comic scene as Max's bedridden mother. Special mention needs to be given to the wondrous Javier Bardem, who takes a 180-degree turn from his recent saintly roles to play a single scene as the drug kingpin Felix, coolly menacing as he talks facetiously about Humpty Dumpty, Santa Claus and Black Peter. The scene between Foxx and Bardem is superbly played out as Max gradually steels himself into Vincent's identity. Mann's set pieces - in a scary Latin bar, in a frenzied Koreatown dance club - show the director at the height of his stylized creativity, and nighttime in LA has never looked more terrifyingly hypnotic than in the excellent camera-work by cinematographers Paul Cameron and Dion Beebe.It's a shame that the film gets more predictable toward the end when Vincent becomes his most nihilistic and Terminator-like and Max unconditionally heroic. In a fit of derivativeness, the story suddenly borrows heavily from 'Rear Window' and 'Speed' with a touch of 'The French Connection'. Although the cumulative effect is still suspenseful, the familiarity of the climax left me feeling a little empty especially after the plot was unfolding in such an audaciously creative manner. But I still recommend this movie for its overall originality. The two-disc set has plenty of extras - Mann's informative commentary, a feature-length making-of documentary, an interesting prep reel of Cruise and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene. Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.",7,1,3,5 March 2006
Ratatouille," Foodies Can Rejoice...Also Rodents...at a Charmer with Pixar's Trademark Craftsmanship
","The craftsmanship in a Pixar film is so startling that it's easy to take the genuine artistry behind it for granted given the studio's consistent run of hits since 'Toy Story' over a dozen years ago. Like 'The Incredibles' and 'Cars', this 2007 confection runs nearly two hours, comparatively long for an animated film, with a story that demands more attention than most. Unlike the animated films under Disney's banner, this one doesn't offer any musical numbers as story breaks. Director/co-screenwriter Brad Bird, who was also behind the 'The Incredibles', returns with a charmer that is as much a sumptuous treat for the Food Network generation as it is a parable about self-fulfillment and tolerance. Except for a few set pieces, especially toward the end, the movie is not quite as exhilarating as previous efforts, but there is no getting around its sheer entertainment value.The dense plot focuses primarily on Remy, an intellectually curious rat with a heightened sense of smell. He lives in a rodent colony in the French countryside headed by his wizened father Django, who uses Remy to smell everyone's food for possible poison. However, Remy has bigger dreams of becoming a chef like Gusteau, the recently deceased guiding light behind Paris' finest restaurant. While escaping from an old crone whose kitchen he has been using, Remy fittingly ends up at Gusteau's where he meets a bumbling garbage boy named Linguini. By hiding under Linguini's chef hat and pulling on his scalp like a puppeteer, Remy is now able to fulfill his dream of becoming a world-class chef. Thanks to Remy's culinary wizardry, Linguini becomes the talk of the town. Naturally, Linguini has to take credit for Remy's dishes and attracts the attention of fellow sous-chef Colette who has dreams of becoming a chef herself. No fanciful story like this would be complete without a villain, and this time, it is Skinner, the small, self-centered sous-chef who took over the restaurant after Gusteau's death only to cheapen the master chef's name by developing a line of microwavable food products to mass market.The rest of the story plays itself out in inevitable fashion but with plenty of clever twists and turns thanks to the perceptive screenplay by Bird, Jan Pinkava and Jim Capobianco, which focuses on the human qualities in the rodents. Needless to say, the CGI work is impressive, especially when the rats literally take over the kitchen. However, the visual realism of seeing the rats swarm in multiple battalions is a bit daunting to watch no matter how human Bird tries to make them. Despite the appearance of marquee names, the vocal casting is for the most part, merely serviceable. Comedian Patton Oswalt brings the right level of enthusiastic optimism to Remy's voice, while Brad Garrett (Gusteau's spirit), Ian Holm (Skinner), Janeane Garofalo (Colette) and Will Arnett (fellow sous-chef Horst) lose much of their individual personalities to their thick French accents. Lou Romano lends a fumbling callowness to Linguini, while Brian Dennehy is certainly recognizable as Django. The true standout, however, is Peter O'Toole who voices intimidating food critic Anton Ego with his usual theatrical flair.I'm surprised the extras on the 2007 DVD are relatively sparse for a major Pixar release. There is no commentary track from Bird, but instead, a 14-minute featurette with him and master chef Thomas Keller, who opened his kitchen at the legendary French Laundry restaurant to the animation team. This isn't Keller's first foray into cinema since he helped prepare Adam Sandler for his role as a celebrity chef in the execrable 'Spanglish'. The two best extras are the animation shorts. The first is the five-minute 'Lifted' that preceded the movie in many theaters. It's an amusing take on the abduction scene in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. The second is the clever, ten-minute 'Your Friend the Rat' which features Remy and his chubby brother Emile carrying on about the joys of being a rat and why we should love them, too. There are also three deleted scenes with introductions and plenty of previews from both Pixar and Disney.",8,0,0,22 May 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," Garfield and Stone Shine in a Franchise Reboot That Has Arrived Far Too Soon
","A reboot of the Spider-Man franchise feels awfully premature given it's only been a decade since the first Sam Raimi-directed epic hit the big screen with Tobey Maguire in the title role, and it's been just five years since the release of 'Spider-Man 3'. Moreover, some of us have had the misfortune of seeing the bombastic Broadway debacle that is 'Spider- Man: Turn Off the Dark' this past year complete with an unmemorably deafening score by Bono. Here is yet another version of the superhero's familiar origin story presented in this 2012 adventure epic from director Marc Webb ('(500) Days of Summer') and a trio of accomplished screenwriters - James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who co-wrote 2 and 3 of the previous trilogy as well as several classic films), and Steve Kloves (who adapted most of the 'Harry Potter' series). Although they go back to Peter Parker's tragic childhood in the prologue, the set-up is otherwise identical to the previous iterations except aspiring actress Mary Jane Watson is nowhere to be seen. Instead, there is spunky Gwen Stacy, a police captain's daughter, the chief intern at the OsCorp Corporation, and Peter's high school crush.Webb focuses much of his movie, especially the first half, to the burgeoning relationship between Peter and Gwen, and this turns out to be a smart move since the screenwriters appear otherwise strait-jacketed by the recognizable constraints of the back story. Raised by his kindly Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Peter is the same brilliant geek and social outcast in this movie, but he's given a more brooding sense of anguish by Andrew Garfield ('The Social Network') - who at 28, can still get away with playing a teen. The plot starts to accelerate when Peter stumbles upon his father's old briefcase filled with complex formulas that lead him to an old colleague of his father's, Dr. Curt Connors, now a top scientist at OsCorp. Connors' focus is on cross-species genetics which he hopes will produce 'a world without weakness', a personal cause to him since losing his right arm. While at OsCorp, Peter gets bitten by a spider that gives birth to his super powers. When Uncle Ben is later killed by a thief during a sidewalk scuffle, Peter decides to become a vigilante hero who is at odds with the police, which of course, means butting heads with Gwen's by-the-book father.However, things really come to a head with the appearance of the Lizard, who causes havoc first in a fatalistic traffic jam on the Williamsburg Bridge and then at Peter's high school. The inevitable battle of good versus evil takes its toll on the city and on our beleaguered hero with the requisite special effects given a full showcase to bring the movie to a rousing finish. That finish occurs over a wearying 136-minute running time, fairly excessive given the familiarity of the story. Perhaps if the Lizard represented something more interesting than a straight-up Jekyll-and-Hyde metamorphosis, it wouldn't have felt quite as long. Although Webb handles the numerous action scenes with surprising acuity given this is only his second feature film as a director, he brings a level of personal intimacy to the movie that a typical action director would likely have bypassed so as not to alienate the fanboy audience. It's also a good thing that Webb hired two bright actors to bring human scale to the love story at the center of this comic book adventure. Beyond Garfield's solid work, a blonde Emma Stone brings her innately sharp manner to a character that could have easily turned into a simplistic damsel in distress.Together the two attractive leads have a palpable chemistry that bodes well for the inevitable sequels. Last seen as the suspicious academic in 'The Five-Year Engagement', Rhys Ifans plays Connors with similar caginess and with the help of CGI effects, fulfills his villainous quotient fitfully. The rest of the stellar supporting cast feels somewhat underserved within the story's dimensions. Denis Leary plays Gwen's father with his trademark casual authority but perhaps at the expense of the character's needed gravitas toward the end. With two Oscars, Sally Field can certainly do more than look constantly concerned, the basic requirement here, but leave it to the veteran actress to provide more depth to the fretful Aunt May. Martin Sheen seems to have the best grasp on his character's blue-collar sensibilities as Uncle Ben. James Horner's music struck me as overly bombastic for the stealth-like movements of Spider-Man, while John Schwartzman's cinematography is a bit on the murky side during the nighttime shots, especially during the climax. I just wish the whole venture could have enthralled me more, but despite some clear virtues with this latest installment, Sam Raimi still casts too foreboding a shadow from my perspective.",6,1,4,9 July 2012
No Strings Attached," Portman Elevates a Formulaic Rom-Com with Provocative Possibilities
","When actresses of a certain caliber and age reach a certain level of potential bankability and critical respect, it appears inevitable that they do a standard-issue Hollywood romantic comedy. Talent becomes a less critical factor in these casting selections. Early last year, Amy Adams did one between 'Doubt' and 'The Fighter', a silly one set in Ireland called 'Leap Year', and now it's Natalie Portman's turn. This 2011 film has a more provocative premise and a snappier tone, but the sensibilities are still very much in rom-com territory. As written by first-time screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether and directed by industry veteran Ivan Reitman (whose last film was the overdone 'My Super Ex-Girlfriend'), the movie deftly asks a less than earth-shattering question: can two friends sustain a commitment-free sexual relationship without any emotional expectations? In an age when text messaging makes anyone instantly available, the answer naturally looks to be yes, but Hollywood convention intervenes.Set conveniently in LA, the plot centers on the friendship between Emma, an overworked medical resident, and Adam, an overlooked production assistant on a 'High School Musical'-type show who longs to be a writer. Moving fleetly from summer camp to a frat party to an accidental run-in at an outdoor market, they definitely have a connection but never act upon it. In the meantime, their personalities take shape as adults nearing thirty. She is an unromantic pragmatist who has convinced herself that she doesn't need a relationship to have sex, while he is a pushover whose airheaded girlfriend dumps him for his father, a self-infatuated former sitcom TV celebrity. After an all-night drunken binge lands a naked Adam in Emma's apartment, she proposes they take advantage of their mutual attraction and start a purely physical relationship with no expectation of commitment. She's in charge, and he agrees to play along. Needless to say, both start to have feelings that pull them in predictable directions with Adam also dealing with his unresolved anger toward his father. There is no real tension to the central dilemma since we all know how the movie will end, especially with stars as attractive and laid-back as Portman and Ashton Kutcher playing the leads.What I do like is how Portman doesn't subterfuge her own sensibilities as an actress to play Emma within formula. She plays a workaholic but on her terms as a sensible professional who needs to manage her schedule carefully. Unlike rom-com contemporaries like Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway or Kristin Bell, Portman comes across as too smart to go through much humiliating shtick to get her inevitable comeuppance beyond devouring a box of donut holes. Even though Kutcher has more experience in this genre, he comes across a bit more substantive this time around and shows a natural rapport with Portman that makes the movie breeze along with aplomb. A solid supporting cast helps with Greta Gerwig ('Greenberg') and Mindy Kaling ('The Office') as Emma's sharp-tongued roommates; Lake Bell ('It's Complicated') as Adam's dithering, sweet-natured associate; Jake Johnson and a low-key Ludicrous as his horndog buddies; and Kevin Kline as his vainglorious father. I didn't even recognize Cary Elwes as the veteran doctor whom Emma fawns over. Special mention should go to Rogier Stoffers whose bright-colored cinematography brings contemporary LA to vivid life.",7,4,9,23 January 2011
Enchanted," Clever Throwback to Disney's Better Days Provides an Ebullient Breakthrough for Adams
","For those fortunate enough to have seen Amy Adams in Phil Morrison's 'Junebug' (2005), you saw a genuinely guileless actress who is capable of conveying sincerity without a hint of irony. As the perennially sunny and interminably pregnant Ashley, she stole that picture easily, and the same holds true for this far more extravagant 2007 Disney production directed by Disney stalwart Kevin Lima ('102 Dalmations', 'Tarzan'). This time, she provides the voice for Giselle, a fair maiden in bucolic woodland where the animals sing and dance as she dreams of kissing her prince. Fortunately, the handsome, self-absorbed Prince Edward shows up with his Marty Feldman-like sidekick Nathaniel in the nick of time as a gigantic troll is about to pounce on Giselle. They fall in love and decide to marry the next day.However, Edward's stepmother, the evil Queen Narissa, does not want Giselle in line for the throne, so she plots to be rid of Giselle by pushing her into a portal that ends up in the middle of Manhattan's Times Square. It's at this point that the film turns to live action, and Giselle is fully embodied by Adams as a wedding ball-gowned fish-out-of-water. Bill Kelly's amusing though somewhat erratic screenplay has her going through the predictable shenanigans, including a chance encounter with Robert, a pragmatic divorce lawyer and a single father to Morgan, an Abigail Breslin-look-alike moppet who wonders if Giselle could be really a fairy princess. Of course, complications ensue with not only Robert's suspicious fiancée Nancy but also Nathaniel, who has come after Giselle upon Narissa's orders. Edward also shows up, and consequently a romantic quadrangle develops with Giselle in an unfettered search for true love.Most of the musical numbers by Disney veteran Alan Menken and Broadway composer Steven Schwartz are catchy and true to the spirit of the story. 'Happy Working Song', a vermin-infested paean to Snow White's 'Whistle While You Work', and 'That's How You Know', which mimics the calypso beat of The Little Mermaid's 'Under the Sea', benefit from witty staging and Adams' surprisingly clear soprano. The only exception is the turgid love ballad near the end, 'So Close', sung by Michael Bolton-wannabe Jon McLaughlin. Beyond Adams, James Marsden plays the hilariously misguided prince with gleeful panache, and Timothy Spall dances easily between malevolent and befuddled as the conflicted Nathaniel. Susan Sarandon is slumming as the Queen, but once she finally shows up in human form, she puts her authoritative spin and killer rack into the character. Perhaps because his character is scripted as such a downer, Patrick Dempsey makes for a lifeless romantic lead for the ebullient Adams. A couple of familiar Broadway performers show up  Idina Menzel ('Wicked', 'Rent') as Nancy, and Tonya Pinkins ('Caroline or Change') as an embittered wife facing a nasty divorce.The one problem I had with the movie is the drastic shift in tone during the overdone, CGI-saturated finale. While I can appreciate the female empowerment orientation being conveyed, the story could have easily ended about ten minutes earlier. Fortunately, the hand-drawn animation in the opening sequence is a fine tribute to Disney's pre-Pixar glory. Given it is from Disney, the 2008 DVD has plenty of extras beginning with a behind-the-scenes featurette, 'Fantasy Comes to Life'. Divided into three parts, it shows how the production numbers for 'Happy Working Song' and 'That's How You Know' came together, as well as the finale. There are six deleted scenes, all introduced by Lima, which includes a storyboard-only alternative to the opening sequence. A two-minute blooper reel is included, as well as a five-minute short for the kiddies called 'Pip's Predicament: A Pop-up Adventure' about the daredevil chipmunk and a music video of Carrie Underwood's 'Ever Ever After'. Definitely better than I expected.",7,0,1,27 March 2008
No Country for Old Men," Heart-stopping Chase Drama Inhabited by Lived-In Characters and a Plot Focused on Accountability
","The unpredictable storytelling route at the heart of this intensely driven and thickly plotted 2007 film is what makes the ride a fascinating, often involving one. I had never read the acclaimed 2005 novel by author Cormac McCarthy, the basis of the film, but it's obvious that the story ambiguities, philosophizing tone and eccentric side characters were key draws for the idiosyncratic Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, who again wrote and directed together as a team. Immediately familiar are the dark sensibilities that make an arid-looking West Texas a most unlikely place for a noir-type thriller, but the Coens' rich sense of character and place are certainly evident. At the same time, the relentless chase in the movie is so dominant that there is little time for them to showcase the quirky sense of humor that makes 1996's 'Fargo' a modern classic. There are a few refreshingly amusing moments here and there, especially those involving the sheriff, but I have to admit that the lurid, heart-stopping scenes are what sear in my memory.Set around 1980 (a point that isn't that clear until there is mention of Vietnam) near the Mexican border, Llewelyn Moss is out hunting in the sagebrush and comes upon the bloody aftermath of a failed drug deal. In the back of a pickup truck are a sizable payload of heroin and two million dollars. He makes off with the money, but through an act of unexpected and belated conscience, he becomes a man on the run by a number of different parties. Chief among them is Anton Chigurh, an unconscionable hit-man who escapes local police custody and closes in on Moss with unfettered conviction and unnerving calm. Surrounding both men is soon-to-retire Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, whose county is where the initial crime scene occurs. The characters' fates collide as the plot twists and turns, but the focus becomes less on the storyline and more on how they bring on their own dire situations through their own machinations. Given how the Coens end the movie (which apparently mirrors McCarthy's book) and some holes in the plot, the movie gains its emotional resonance as a tale of self-accountability.The performances of the three leads are excellent. Sporting a hideous mop-top haircut, the versatile Javier Bardem manages to play Chigurh as the heartless killer he is by emphasizing the warped sense of honor that makes his acts reasonable to him. His manner is so discomforting that I was conflicted as to whether I should cringe vulnerably or avert my eyes entirely every time Chigurh shows up on the screen. Cast perfectly to type as the laconic Bell, Tommy Lee Jones is an assuring presence despite the drug-trading malevolence engulfing his territory, a development that makes his character realize that he has become a man out of his time (thus the movie's title). Usually a journeyman actor (with a famous wife, Diane Lane, and an even more famous mother-in-law), Josh Brolin conveys the precarious balance between opportunistic and decent with minimum fuss. As his worried wife Clara Jean, Kelly MacDonald has just a few effective scenes, and her final one attains a becalming power. The only fly in the ointment is Woody Harrelson, just too familiar a presence to be entirely convincing as a talkative bounty hunter who would be a compelling match for Chigurh. Of special note is Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography, which perfectly captures the rural setting.",8,1,3,13 January 2008
The Love Guru," Myers Flails as a Chopak Wannabe in a Comic Misfire
","Star and co-writer Mike Myers is far too clever to be dismissed entirely for a film burdened by his kitchen-sink approach to comedy. However, this 2008 film comes closest to making him downright intolerable despite a smattering of smart one-liners that barely save it from landing in the junk bin. The concept would seem ripe with possibilities as the film lampoons the commercial intentions of self-help gurus like Deepak Chopra, but Myers and his writing partner Graham Gordy appear more interested in bodily functions, gross-out humor, repetitive gags ('Mariska Hargitay'), Canadian in-jokes, and celebrity walk-ons rather than keep the satirical aspects focused enough to make a point. Unfortunately, first-time director Marco Schnabel simply lets the star and the rest of the lackluster cast flounder without lending a perspective that could have balanced the lowbrow shenanigans with the highbrow aspirations. As unsatisfying as the film is, I wonder if Judd Apatow could have saved this material.The overextended plot revolves around self-help guru Maurice Pitka, who was born in America but raised in India. With his long hair and beard and traditional Hindu garb, Pitka is known as a second-rate Chopra, but he is aggressively looking for an opportunity to change that and get on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Enter Darren Roanoke, star player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who goes into a scoring slump just as the team makes the Stanley Cup playoffs. Team owner Jane Bullard and coach Punch Cherkov seek out Pitka to help Roanoke reconcile with his wife Prudence, who has caused his beleaguered lack of self-esteem. She has decided to leave him for the conjugal joys to be had with Jacques 'Le Coq' Grande, the goalie for the opposing Los Angeles Kings known for his elephantine endowment. Pitka espouses his radical 'DRAMA' method of enlightenment to alleviate Roanoke's stress and lead him on a journey toward self-love. Apparently that's the only chance that the Maple Leafs have in winning the Cup. At the same time, Pitka realizes his goal to usurp Chopak is a hollow one when he becomes romantically drawn to the comely Bullard.Myers may have gone to the well one too many times with his smarmy, overly self-aware performance as Pitka. What goodwill he generated as Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers has almost evaporated here. As Bullard, Jessica Alba is a pretty but unavoidably wooden foil to Myers, and her character's attraction to Pitka remains one of the film's bigger mysteries. Somewhat better is Romany Malco as Roanoke and Justin Timberlake as Grande, though neither is imposing enough to be particularly believable as professional hockey players. As a more verbal version of Mini-Me, Verne Troyer plays Cherkov in constant foul-mouthed agitation. The most embarrassing performance, however, belongs to a cross-eyed Ben Kingsley as Pitka's spiritual mentor, Guru Tugginmypudha. I doubt if any other Oscar winner has taken quite as discreet a fall from grace. On the other hand, I have to admit I liked the sitar revamp of Dolly Parton's '9 to 5' as the irrelevant opening theme, as well as Stephen Colbert's funny bits with Jim Gaffigan as the play-by-play commentators. But that's about it.The extras are abundant on the 2008 DVD if you care to view them. First, there is a standard making-of featurette, 'Mike Myers and The Love Guru - An Inside Look' that runs ten minutes with comments from Myers, Alba, Troyer, and Schnabel. There is a six-minute short, 'One Helluva Elephant', showing how special effects specialist Ron Stefaniuk built an animatronic elephant and ostrich for the movie. More interesting is 'Hockey Training for Actors' which has sports coordinator Mark Ellis explaining how the actors learned to play hockey. Rounding out the extras are eleven deleted/extended scenes, a four-minute blooper reel, a separate five-minute compilation of deleted takes with Colbert and Gaffigan (the best of the extras and even better than the movie), ten minutes more of general outtakes, and the original theatrical trailer.",3,0,6,22 October 2008
District 9," Role-Reversal Alien Thriller is One Part Documentary, One Part Allegory and One Part Horror Film
","It's strange to call a science-fiction thriller eerily captivating, but first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp has somehow managed to earn that description with a most unexpected twist on the alien invasion genre of films. Based on a six-minute short, 'Alive in Joburg', he made back in 2005, director/co-screenwriter Neill Blomkamp has fashioned a propulsive, corking adventure film that manages to be a thoughtful allegory on xenophobia, corporate greed, and due to its South African location, apartheid. What is most fascinating about the screenplay co-written by Terri Tatchell is that the aliens are not positioned to the viewer as an unknown force ready to destroy mankind, as is usually the case, but rather as an escalating socio-political 'situation' to which the South African government respond by assigning a multinational corporation to transport them from a ramshackle, inner-city shantytown called District 9 to another area outside of Johannesburg.Turning our expectations upside down, Blomkamp reveals an obviously powerful alien species rendered helpless on earth by their refugee status and relegated to criminal acts. In mock-documentary style, the story begins with a series of interviews explaining the back story for the aliens. A gigantic spaceship hovers over Johannesburg in 1982 (shades of Roland Emmerich's 1996 'Independence Day') where an exploratory team discovers over a million malnourished aliens onboard without a leader. They are tall bipeds with insect-like faces and crustacean-like bodies (looking very much like Jeff Goldblum's fully transformed title character in David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of 'The Fly'). Over the next two decades, the aliens conform to their squalid surroundings and engage in destructive behavior that raises the ire of the local residents who call them derogatorily 'prawns'. An officious Afrikaan field operative named Wikus Van De Merwe has been assigned the unenviable task of serving eviction notices to the aliens and confiscating their weaponry.On one particular raid, Van De Merwe inadvertently sprays himself with a mysterious liquid that mutates his DNA to take on alien characteristics. He is shunted to District 9 where he relies on a more thoughtful alien named Christopher Johnson to help him reverse the transformation process. Before that can happen, the multinational corporation wants Van De Merwe for his new-found ability to handle alien weaponry (which humans cannot operate). There is also trouble brewing with Nigerian gangs eventually leading to a violent mêlée that decides the fate of not only Van De Merwe but also the aliens on earth. Blomkamp decided to cast a first-time feature actor, Sharlto Copley, as Van De Merwe, and he is quite effective in the role. At first, he appears to be a geeky corporate lackey married to the boss's daughter and intent on carrying forth his undesirable mission with little trepidation. Copley manages to show his character's arc in not only the manifestation of graphic effects but also through the sinking dejection he experiences as an evolving alien.All the aliens are CGI-generated, and kudos belong to the visual effects team headed by Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, and Matt Aitken for giving them a scarifying look to contrast their increasingly vulnerable state. Make no mistake that despite the film's grander statements regarding the detrimental impact of social segregation, it turns primarily into a man-on-the-run (or should I say 'alien-on-the-run') B-style thriller with eye-wincing horror elements. There is a robust set of extras with the two-disc 2010 DVD set. The first disc contains 25 minutes of deleted scenes, a strong making-of documentary, and an engaging commentary track from Blomkamp. The second disc is on the light side, offering four featurettes which detail various aspects of the production, but unfortunately, there is no sign of the original short, 'Alive in Joburg'.",8,4,8,9 February 2010
Mamma Mia!," Bollywood-Style Jukebox Musical Benefits from Streep and a Game Cast
","Let's face it. If Meryl Streep was cast in a Fruit of the Loom commercial, she would still be the standout piece of produce, lending conviction to a one-dimensional part others would easily dismiss as too superficial. That's the way to view this ebullient, featherweight 2008 confection based on the long-running jukebox musical from the prolific songbook of 1970's super-pop group ABBA, all of which were written by bandmates Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it was Sophie Zawistowski, Karen Blixen, or Miranda Priestly. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce called 'Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell', you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark, which is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant film-making experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic 'Dancing Queen' number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and 'Money, Money, Money', as well as the more emotive ballads like 'Slipping Through My Fingers' and 'The Winner Takes It All'. She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on 'S.O.S.' (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsgård as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry  are also likable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, 'I Have a Dream'. The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of 'Dancing Queen' complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of 'Waterloo' (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook). Go at your own riskyou may love it.",7,2,3,28 July 2008
Batman Begins," A Darker Caped Crusader Caught in the Imbalance of Nolan's Treatment
","As much as I wanted to love the newest incarnation of Batman, especially under the direction of the sharply talented Christopher Nolan, there is a gnawing imbalance to the film that makes the overall experience less than enthralling to me. In what looks obviously like the start of a new franchise, the 2005 movie spends an inordinate amount of time on the myth creation, and the first hour feels so solemn and methodical that the more interesting second hour or so in Gotham City feels rushed and telegraphed with arcane explanations of panic-inducing hallucinogens.The problematic pacing makes the 141-minute running time seem interminable when it needs to sprint. The movie then ends almost too quickly for the dense plot that Nolan and co-writer David S. Goyer present in sometimes frustratingly cryptic strokes. Although they provide moments of deadpan humor reminiscent of 'The Terminator' films, what is missing is the satirical sense and ironic nihilism that Tim Burton brought to the 1989 and 1992 Batman films. At the same time, Nolan imbues a true focused sense of dramatic purpose and atmosphere to his treatment that easily eclipses the subsequent Joel Schumacher movies.Fortunately, Christian Bale is ideally cast in the title role primarily because he is an actor who emits a searing presence by not divulging too much about his interior life. That is exactly the quality needed to portray a loner driven by the horrific murder of his parents to penetrate the criminal mind and then ironically become a reluctant, clandestine hero. Under his cowl, he takes on Clint Eastwood's raspy vocal inflections to add to his mystique, and he brings a sinewy intelligence and quiet reserve to the conflicted millionaire Bruce Wayne. The combination works.With a virtual Who's Who of A-listers, the supporting cast is almost too overwhelming to utilize their individual talents effectively. In a rather dastardly variation on his Jedi Master in 'Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace', Liam Neeson plays Henri Ducard, another intimidating mentor who this time, acts as an operative for a ninja vigilante group trained somewhere in the Himalayas. Neeson exhibits a palpable sense of malice in the role, though his character's return late in the film has a foreboding sense of predictable inevitability about it.Gary Oldman, who usually specializes in screen villains, does an about-face and with genuine goodwill, plays put-upon Lt. Jim Gordon, who will become Gotham City's police commissioner someday. In his usual impeccable form, Morgan Freeman portrays Lucius Fox, the brilliant staff scientist at Wayne Enterprises who invents Batman's wardrobe and gadgetry. As Wayne's manservant Alfred, Michael Caine seems to be enjoying the humorous asides and unyielding British sense of duty in his relatively constrained role. As if he walked right off the comic-level 'Dick Tracy' set, Tom Wilkinson chews a lot of scenery as the Jersey-accented crime boss Carmine Falcone.The normally charismatic Ken Watanabe, however, is wasted in a small role as Ra's Al Ghul, the meditative head of the ninja group spouting all sorts of incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo. Cillian Murphy turns in the film's most chilling performance as the creepy psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, evoking the perfect portions of fear and loathing in a character that makes my skin crawl. Last and truly least, Katie Holmes fails to rise to the caliber of her cast mates as her perpetually girlish manner belies the driving conviction of an assistant D.A. struggling with her lifelong attraction to Wayne.The film is not as visually resplendent as previous Batmans, though the old-meets-new vision of Gotham City is compelling thanks to Nathan Crowley's impressive set designs. Also thrilling are the scary visual effects conjured up for the hallucinogens. Not as effective is Nolan's liberal use of close-ups and quick edits, especially in the numerous fight scenes sometimes impinging on the clarity of the action presented. I just wish Nolan and Goyer were not intent on overstuffing the screenplay with so many plot threads as it became a challenge to keep everything straight by the end.",6,1,2,12 December 2005
Bridesmaids," Wiig and Company Deliver Honest Laughs in a Freewheeling, Character-Driven Farce
","What I appreciate most about Kristen Wiig's comedy style on SNL is her refusal to pander to an audience. Portraying her gallery of solipsistic eccentrics week after week, she's never afraid to be unsympathetic because she exposes a truth that is smart and funny. Translating her gift to the big screen proves to be surprisingly fortuitous with her breakout 2011 comedy, which has already been dubbed the distaff version of the alpha-male mega-hit, 2009's 'The Hangover'. They share an ensemble approach, a sometimes raunchy sense of humor, and the context of an upcoming wedding but little else. What you won't mistake this movie for is one of those dreary rom-coms starring invariably Katherine Heigl, Kate Hudson, or Jennifer Aniston.Co-written by Wiig and fellow Groundlings alumnus Annie Mumolo and breezily directed by Paul Feig ('The Office'), this is a sharp, character-driven farce freed from chick-flick predictability and showing the unmistakable fingerprints of co-producer Judd Apatow all over it. The plot centers on thirtysomething Annie Walker who is not in the best place in her life. Deep into debt after losing the cake shop she owned with a boyfriend who subsequently abandoned her, she is already a bit unstrung when her childhood best friend Lillian gets engaged. She names Annie her maid of honor, but there's competition for the coveted role from Lillian's new bestie, the wealthy and pretentious Helen. Much of the storyline focuses on the tension between Annie and Helen over Lillian's preferential attention until the wedding day. Within this context, much of the humor comes from the preposterous excesses that come from the 'wedding industrial complex' with Helen obviously having the resources to fund them including a ludicrously over-the-top Paris-themed shower.Along for the ride are the three other bridesmaids - Lillian's cousin Rita, a sex-starved mother of three; Becca, a newlywed who pities Annie for her single state; and Megan, the groom's unfiltered, adventure-seeking sister. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan (the diuretic bridal shop scene is a hoot), and the shenanigans are underlined by the obvious rift occurring between two best friends when one moves on with her life. Beyond her comedy set pieces (e.g., her increasingly hilarious efforts in attempting to get a traffic citation), Wiig turns out to be a resourceful actress as Annie and dials back her trademark neurotic lunacy just enough to make Annie's dilemmas humanly relatable. As Lillian, SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph ('Away We Go') has less to do but does it with warmth and wit. Rose Byrne, who showed deft comic chops in 'Get Him to the Greek', captures the haughtiness and insecurity in Helen with élan.However, stealing scenes with sheer abandon is a makeup-free Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan with such balls-to-the-wall force that it's hard not to respond to her uncompromised honesty. Her character is arguably the most mentally stable of the bunch. Wendy McLendon-Covey ('Reno 911') and Ellie Kemper ('The Office') have their moments as sarcastic Rita and naive Becca, but they aren't given much screen time to flesh out their funnier bits. Jon Hamm ('Mad Men') really nails the blistering albeit charming indifference that his character Ted shows toward Annie's romantic longings, while Irish actor Chris O'Dowd proves likeably puppyish as her burgeoning love interest, a traffic cop constantly reprimanding her for not fixing her brake lights. In her final film appearance, the wonderful Jill Clayburgh is sweetly amusing as Annie's whimsically off-kilter mother. It all runs a bit too long at 125 minutes with the resolutions a bit pat, but still, this is one of the funniest movies of the year.",8,2,5,16 May 2011
Meet the Fockers," Streisand and Hoffman Lend Buoyancy as Mother and Father Focker in a Minor League Comedy
","It shouldn't be too big a surprise that this movie is a fairly mediocre Hollywood confection, but I did have a whimper of a hope that this was going to be an edgier social commentary given the comedy potential of the situation. Alas, it would be too much to expect director Jay Roach to be in the same league as David O. Russell or Alexander Payne given that his track record is mostly made up of Austin Powers movies. I never saw the original 'Meet the Parents', so luckily I don't have that point of comparison, but one can easily fill in the blanks with this soft-centered sequel. Written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, the plot seems ready-made from an instant pudding mix. Having given permission to Gaylord Focker to marry their daughter Pam, the white-bread Byrnes family from Oyster Bay now prepares to meet their new in-laws in Florida (of course).Simple enough, but the big surprise is that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand (third and fourth-billed, no less) seem to be having such a great time playing Bernie and Roz Focker that you can almost overlook the script deficiencies. Each had auspicious film debuts over 35 years ago (he in 'The Graduate', she in 'Funny Girl'), and they have known each other since their struggling New York days in the early sixties. That history is helpful in explaining their natural chemistry here, and you're left wondering why these two never worked together before. Streisand, in particular, seems relaxed as a free-wheeling, caftan-wearing, opinionated sex therapist, which seems like a send-up of her self-important psychiatrist in her own 'The Prince of Tides'. For once, she's not bathed in candlelight in some Harlequin romance with a blonde gentile unable to commit. Rather, she lends credibility to a grounded character in an often hilariously passionate marriage to a physical and intellectual equal, and at certain moments in this film, I don't think I've liked Streisand more on screen.If Hoffman seems less surprising, it's only because he has already proved to be a masterful comic actor with 'Tootsie' and 'Wag the Dog'. Even when the running gags (a passion for capoeira, overzealous displays of affection) get tired, he still imbues his caricature with a zestful spirit. The remaining elements of the film seem tired in comparison, and unfortunately I have to include the original stars. Perhaps it's because they are recycling behavior that would be hard to refresh a second time. Robert DeNiro's tiresome portrayal of Jack Byrnes, the intimidating ex-CIA spook, is particularly disappointing and not so much because the actor is slumming (which he is) but because his character works on only one motivation, to humiliate and eventually eject his future son-in-law from the 'circle of trust'. There are hints that the summit meeting of Hoffman, DeNiro and Streisand would turn into something more substantial, but the sitcom dimensions of the script quickly extinguish the possibilities. Ben Stiller, who is the actual protagonist of this comedy, seems to be sitting back as his character, Gaylord, recedes into the background. He has exactly one funny scene on his own, when he spouts his honest feelings after being injected with a 'truth serum'.The whole subplot with Gaylord being accused of fathering his former family housekeeper's son seems tired and superfluous. I like Blythe Danner as Jack's wife, Dina, looking to resuscitate some spark in their marriage, and Teri Polo, who actually seems sharp and worthwhile as the fiancée at the center of the story. But neither is given much to do except a funny scene where Roz uses hand puppets to teach Dina how to get sex out of Jack. If seeing DeNiro wearing a homemade rubber 'manary gland' sounds hilarious, by all means go see this movie. For me, it just made me think how it would be great to see Hoffman and Streisand re-team in a James Brooks comedy, how DeNiro should go back to Scorsese for career guidance and how Stiller may want to take a break before he plays yet another nebbish character. By the way, I'm guessing Streisand's 'A Star Is Born'-era hairdo is an in-joke to her partner since her character's name was Esther Hoffman. Now that's the kind of subtlety this comedy needed.The 2005 DVD features two versions of the film - the theatrical cut and a completely unnecessary extended cut, which edits in several deleted scenes. Like the DVD treatment for 'Ray', the additions are announced to the viewer through a blinking gimmick and consequently inhibit the flow of the narrative. It's better to see these understandably excised scenes separate from the film. Roach and editor/co-producer Jon Poll provide a so-so commentary track, and there is also a fitfully funny blooper reel. Several disposable shorts are included, among them 'Fockers' Family Portrait' featuring brief snippets from Hoffman, Streisand and Stiller; a behind-the-scenes look at Jinx the Cat ('Inside the Litter Box'); another behind-the-scenes look, this time at the infant ('The Adventures of a Baby Wrangler'); a five-minute featurette on 'The Manary Gland'; and a Today Show interview with the entire cast.",5,0,0,17 April 2008
Before Sunset," Soulmates Intersect and Wallow in Thoughtful What-Ifs
","I never thought 1995's 'Before Sunrise' was any great shakes perhaps because the concept felt like a romantic conceit albeit an intelligently scripted one especially for a film about a couple of kids in their early twenties. Time has probably mellowed me, as I find director Richard Linklater's 2004 sequel an entertaining talkfest that pierces with certain life truths. Nine years after their life-altering brief encounter in Vienna, Jesse and Celine meet again in Paris. Now a successful first-time novelist on a book tour, he sees her show up at his final book signing at the famous Shakespeare & Co. bookstore, and after some hesitation, they pick up where they left off. Celine is now an environmental activist, and their conversation continues for nearly an hour and a half in real time, before Jesse is scheduled to catch a plane home to his wife and son. Linklater follows the lovers -- who had promised to reunite in Vienna in six months and never did -- from café to park to boat to an intense car ride to Celine's apartment. In a manner that seems even closer to Louis Malle's 'My Dinner With Andre' than the first one, they spend the time talking about the passage of time, shifting ideals both political and romantic, harbored ambitions, unfulfilled desire, religion, sex and monogamy and inconsistent memories.Looking particularly aged compared to the flashbacks from the first movie, Ethan Hawke effortlessly captures the frustrated ennui of an unfulfilled artist, his romantic ideals reborn by this unexpected encounter. But it's Julie Delpy who more dexterously shows the subtle impact of her diminished expectations against her luminous former self, peaking with her visceral emotional breakdown in the car. She also shows herself to be a fine singer as she performs a plaintive waltz for Jesse at the end. The film is quite brief, just eighty minutes long, but it feels like the right length given the story's limited focus. Truth be told, there is still an air of self-indulgent pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together. The fact that there is an easy, unforced air about their dialogue has a lot to do with Hawke's and Delpy's contributions to the script (they receive co-screen writing credit) and with the real rapport between the two actors. The DVD is relatively short on extras, for instance, there is surprisingly no audio commentary track, but there is a brief making-of featurette that helps provide the context of the story relative to the previous movie.",7,0,1,5 March 2006
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Bird Brings Visual Zing and Cruise Again Delivers in the Exciting Fourth Installment
","I honestly didn't know which number sequel this was before watching the 2011 entry into the franchise. In fact, I had only seen the original 1996 'Mission: Impossible' prior to this viewing and heard rumors that the two previous sequels in 2000 and 2006 were simply retreads of the first movie, which was in itself a reimagining of the popular 1960's TV series, granted an extravagant, multi-million-dollar reimagining directed by Brian DePalma. This one showcases an older yet still agile Tom Cruise returning to the role of intrepid IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even as he closes in on fifty, he demonstrates the same unparalleled commitment to dangerous, high-flying derring-do he displayed in the first one fifteen years ago. This time, the reins have been handed over to Brad Bird who makes his live-action directorial debut after scoring with a couple of Pixar's megahits, 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille'. The results are fortuitous because Bird brings great visual flair to a film that demands gasp-worthy action sequences.In fact, the action is so propulsive that the convoluted plot takes a decided backseat. Written by André Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, the story feels like a throwback to the days of Soviet spy-versus-spy intrigue and A-bomb secrets. This time, it all revolves around a briefcase with Russian launch codes that are prized by a brilliant Russian madman named Kurt Hendricks, code name Cobalt, who wants nothing less than using them to destroy the world. He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry. The CIA points the finger at the IMF team for the disaster and invokes the dreaded Ghost Protocol.The now-rogue agents make their way to the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, where Hunt has to scale the outside of the building to manipulate the building's computer system. A botched transaction with the assassin leads to mayhem and then a final stop in Mumbai where there is the inevitable race against the clock to save the world. The movie is really all about the set pieces – the Russian prison escape, the Kremlin break-in and explosion (an excellent special effect), Hunt's gravity-defying climb in Dubai and an overwhelming sandstorm, and the movable multi-level parking lot in Mumbai which sets that stage for the final showdown. Performance are secondary in this kind of movie, but they are mostly workmanlike. Cruise is inarguably in his element as an action hero, and he appears to perform most of his death-defying stunts. Jeremy Renner ('The Hurt Locker') also shows the necessary chops as the initially mysterious Brandt, and it is clear he will be playing a larger role in the next installment.Paula Patton, a long way from the inspirational teacher she played in 'Precious', brings the requisite sexy strength to Carter, in particular, in a no-holds-barred fight scene with the assassin played by Léa Seydoux (whom I was surprised to discover is the same actress who played the shy antiques dealer in 'Midnight in Paris'). Simon Pegg ('Hot Fuzz') initially tries too hard for laughs as Dunn until he finally settles into the film's more tongue-in-cheek tone. Michael Nyqvist only has to convey relentless menace as Hendricks, which he does just fine. Anil Kapoor ('Slumdog Millionaire') shows up as a wealthy Indian tycoon, as does Tom Wilkinson quite briefly as the IMF Secretary. The actor who plays the Russian intelligence operative, Vladimir Mashkov, bears such a striking resemblance to SNL's Fred Armisen that for the longest time, I thought it was Armisen in an impressive change-of-pace. Veteran cinematographer Robert Elswit ('There Will Be Blood') does excellent camera-work in the various locales – Budapest, Moscow, Dubai and Mumbai. Fans of the franchise shouldn't be disappointed.",8,2,6,29 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," Desultory Look at Eisenhower-Era Marital Discord Showcases Sharp Work from Winslet and Shannon
","It took 47 years to adapt for the screen Richard Yates' celebrated novel of the struggles that a young suburban couple faces living within the constraints of Eisenhower-era conformity. Even now, the resulting 2008 film, as meticulously directed by Sam Mendes, feels so internally driven that the story may be better suited for the stage or even TV. In fact, it often feels a bit like an extended episode of the 1950's-set AMC series, 'Mad Men', although the arguments between the protagonists bring to mind similarly visceral set pieces from Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Adapted by screenwriter Justin Haythe ('The Clearing'), the plot focuses on Frank and April Wheeler, an attractive couple settled in a Connecticut suburb with two young children and seven years into a dysfunctional marriage. The time is 1955 well before professional counseling and divorce were viable options. The one attribute that the couple shares is the disillusionment each experiences with their daily lives, a far cry from the worldly aspirations they had when they first met at a Manhattan cocktail party.Initially a frustrated actress, April is a creative person who is suffocating from her suburban domestic duties, while Frank is an even more aimless dreamer who hates his sales job at an IBM-like company. The story turns on April's sudden idea to move the family to Paris, where she plans to work as a government agency secretary while Frank figures out what he wants to do. He tentatively agrees, but it is her mounting desperation to hold onto her dream of living a bohemian life abroad that points to their emotional unraveling. Extramarital affairs prove to be the least of their problems, as each becomes entrenched in a deepening inability to empathize with or support the another. Communication between them turns into mutual provocations of emotional abuse. Mendes returns to familiar territory here, as there are vestiges of his debut film, 'American Beauty', in the often uncomfortable-to-watch marital discord he etches here. However, the tone is even more desultory this time with nary a trace of black humor to provide a counterbalance. All the period touches feel authentic with Roger Deakins' cinematography and Kristi Zea's production design contributing to an evocative feel that doesn't feel overly contrived. Thomas Newman's haunting score is another asset that enhances the dramatic elements.This is the type of movie that provides a showcase for its principal actors. As April, Kate Winslet (Mendes' wife) manages to make a fundamentally selfish character sympathetic by throwing herself fearlessly and honestly into the role. Her former 'Titanic' co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio has proved to be an arresting actor in 'The Departed', but his baby face and youthful demeanor really seem at odds with Frank's weakening emotional state and diminishing sense of self-worth. He comes to life during the many confrontation scenes, but he can't match Winslet's affinity with the heavy material. The supporting cast is solid - Kathy Bates (another 'Titanic' veteran) as unctuous real estate agent Helen Givings, Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers' chipper neighbor Milly, David Harbour as her deceptively contemplative husband Shep, Zoe Kazan as Frank's gullible secretary, and in just two sharply rendered scenes, Michael Shannon makes Helen's mentally ill son a powerfully uncomfortable harbinger for the tragedy to follow. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a mostly interesting audio commentary track from Mendes and Haythe, five deleted scenes, and principal cast and crew members contributing to an adequate half-hour making-of featurette, 'Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road'.",6,2,3,6 July 2009
The Lives of Others," Suspenseful, Nuanced Character Study Puts a Spotlight on a Little Known Aspect of the Cold War
","Five long years before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was at the height of its infiltrative power with one in every fifty citizens cooperating with them in sniffing out any scent of political dissidence. To the Western world, it's a relatively unknown piece of Cold War history, but the Stasi's repressive force permeated all aspects of German society. First-time director and screenwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmark makes a most auspicious debut with this mesmerizing, epic-length 2006 study of the Stasi's devastating impact on a trio of characters in pre-glasnost East Berlin.The protagonist is Captain Gerd Wiesler, who is initially a rigid, humorless master of relentless, soul-baring interrogation techniques highly prized by the regime. He seems so utterly uncompromising that one would have expected a story to evolve that is closer in spirit to a classic Cold War espionage thriller like John LeCarre's The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. However, von Donnersmark digs deeper into the conflicted psyche of this seemingly Machiavellian character by placing him in a situation where he is constantly monitoring the activities of renowned playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, in their shared apartment.Although Dreyman has shown no signs of defying the current regime, Wiesler is ordered by his old classmate Grubitz, now the head of the Stasi's Culture Department, to put the couple under surveillance. What then evolves as the plot thickens is an unspoken bonding of spirits among Wiesler, Dreyman and Sieland as the inherent contradictions between artistic and political expression become more and more pronounced. Wiesler becomes disillusioned when he realizes that the motivation for monitoring the artistic couple is Minister Hempf's unsavory interest in Sieland. Meanwhile, Dreyman ironically does have his political consciousness raised after his blacklisted playwriting mentor kills himself. What transpires is surprising yet most fitting.The performances are uniformly solid beginning with Ulrich Mühe's implosively searing portrayal of Wiesler. For the most part, it's a subtle turn highlighted by powerfully cathartic moments such as his response to Dreyman's playing of a piece called 'Sonata for a Good Man'. It does beg comparisons to Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola's classic surveillance thriller, The Conversation. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are equally riveting as the conflicted Dreyman and the increasingly desperate Sieland, who haltingly faces her own dilemma of betrayal. Adding immeasurably to the fatalistic, Orwellian atmosphere that von Donnersmark creates are Gabriel Yared's evocative music (including the beautiful sonata) and Hagen Bogdanski's burnished cinematography.The one drawback is the 137-minute length, which I found slightly excessive, especially toward the end, for the relatively intimate story being told. The filmmaker provides an informative and often enthusiastic commentary track on the 2007 DVD, though most of the major points are captured in the half-hour featurette, 'Interview with Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark'. There is also a twenty-minute making-of short which includes interviews with the producers and principal cast, as well as eight deleted scenes.",9,3,4,23 September 2007
P.S. I Love You," Overlong Look at the Grieving Process Spotlighting an Uncharacteristically Miscast Swank
","Grief can be a painfully long process, but does that mean a movie needs to capture that experience in real time? Actually a year elapses in this marathon 126-minute film, but director Richard LaGravenese's episodic treatment is so sluggish that the end didn't come soon enough for me. This is the first of several problems with this 2007 romantic dramedy and co-written by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers and actually not the biggest. That dubious distinction belongs to star Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy, a high-strung Manhattan real estate agent closing in on thirty and married nearly a decade to Gerry, a hunky, free-wheeling Irish musician. Physically angular with a performance pitched between severely pinched and gawkily awkward, Swank lacks the innate malleability to carry off the role. It's the type that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock can do in their sleep, but obviously the torch has to be passed. Despite moments of genuine likability and vulnerability, Swank lets it drop.The movie opens with a lengthy and extremely contrived marital squabble between Holly and Gerry and then wastes no time in flashing forward months later to Gerry's wake at the Irish bar that Holly's mother runs. Throughout the rest of the movie, Holly grieves by having frequent flashbacks to the happier days with Gerry, that is, when she is not fantasizing about Gerry still being alive. The plot turns on the conceit that he wrote a series of letters before his death that he intends to be delivered to Holly at key moments during her first year without him, and Holly's responses to the letters make up what constitutes the impetus of the storyline. There are some poorly developed turns, but there are some good moments primarily courtesy of an unusually stellar supporting cast starting with Kathy Bates as Holly's straight-shooting mother whose own husband left her in a less tragic manner; Gina Gershon as Sharon, one of Holly's best friends; and Lisa Kudrow as her other friend, the more hedonistic Denise. In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.The men fare somewhat better. A genuinely charismatic actor, Gerard Butler plays Gerry with such unfettered joy that it really is a wonder why he is attracted to Holly in the first place. Their 'cute' first encounter on an isolated Irish road is painful to watch not because of Gerry's impending doom but because Swank overdoes her impersonation of a naïve college student. As potential paramour Billy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, an American actor who actually does a better Irish accent than Butler (a Scotsman) lends the necessary smoldering presence, but he is painted too ideally to be that compelling. Harry Connick, Jr., on the other hand, plays a genuinely idiosyncratic suitor, Daniel, a somewhat off-kilter bartender who may have Asperger's Syndrome. It's an oddly discomforting ploy, but at least it's different, and Connick shows he still has a good comedy sense. Rural Ireland certainly looks idyllic thanks to Terry Stacey's cinematography, although I have to say the musical soundtrack comes across as too predictably coy to help complement scenes. I recommend skipping this one for more worthwhile treatments on grieving like Anthony Minghella's 'Truly Madly Deeply' or even Jerry Zucker's 'Ghost'.",4,5,9,22 January 2008
Across the Universe," A Surreal, War-Torn Love Story Bridges 33 Beatles Songs in a Most Erratic Manner
","When I saw the eye-popping clips of this 2007 movie in a preview earlier this year, it became readily apparent that director Julie Taymor has lost none of the visual invention that informs her vivid staging of The Lion King and her Baroque-level approach to 1999's Titus. What I feared most from what I saw was that it would be more like an extended fantasy-laden musical video with the classic Beatles songbook basically providing most of the dialogue. It turns out I am mostly right, though there is a somewhat trite and rather predictable narrative, provided by Taymor and co-screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, at the core of the movie. Building a story around thirty-three unrelated Beatles songs is no easy task, and the contrivances are gratefully not as exaggerated as one would expect. At the same time, the characters feel hastily developed to fit the contours of the diverse songs, and most of the resulting performances are not compelling enough to bring it all together in a cohesive manner.Set in the 1960's, the plot revolves around Jude, a working-class bloke from Liverpool going stateside to visit the father he's never met, and Lucy, a product of East Coast privilege who becomes increasingly radicalized after her high school sweetheart dies overseas as the Vietnam War keeps raging on. Jude and Lucy meet through her brother Max, a Princeton undergrad who drops out to live in bohemian style in Greenwich Village but then gets drafted into the military. No surprise that a romance between Jude and Lucy evolves amid the anti-war countercultural movement, including a bus trip through psychedelia. There are other characters in the mix with equally familiar names - Sadie, a raspy-voiced Janis Joplin doppelganger about to break big on the rock music scene; Jo-Jo, her lover and competitor who evokes Jimi Hendrix's looks and individualistic guitar style; and Prudence, a sexually confused Ohio cheerleader who literally comes in through the bathroom window.The love story is strictly by the numbers, but the musical performances can be infectious. Evan Rachel Wood continues to impress even in a role as self-contained as Lucy, and her plaintive rendition of 'If I Fell' is surprisingly affecting. The rest are definitely more singers than actors. Jim Sturgess appears to have been cast for his vocal resemblance to Paul McCartney, not a bad reason though he does manage to capture Jude's plot-driven angst with convincing abandon. He gets the lion's share of the classic ballads - 'Girl', 'I've Just Seen a Face', 'Something', 'All My Loving', 'All You Need Is Love'. Joe Anderson delivers a party-hearty 'With a Little Help from My Friends' with his Princeton frat brothers and later a somber 'Hey Jude' as a postwar-traumatized Max. As budding lesbian Prudence, T.V. Carpio does a doleful version of 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' crossing through acrobatic football players during practice. Dana Fuchs brings a soulful thrust to 'Helter Skelter', 'Why Don't We Do It in the Road?', and 'Don't Let Me Down', while Martin Luther McCoy poignantly covers 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'.A few of the sequences don't work as well as others, for example, Jude's extended trashing of the protesters' office to the strains of 'Revolution', the pin-cushioned strawberries transforming into bombs during the dual-perspective montage of 'Strawberry Fields', and the drug-hazed antics of Bono as a Timothy Leary figure on 'I Am the Walrus'. Some of the more interesting performances come from the surprise guest appearances, such as Eddie Izzard as the ringmaster of a weirdly psychedelic 'For the Benefit of Mr. Kite', Carol Woods and Timothy T. Mitchum delivering a powerful 'Let It Be' set against the 1967 Detroit riots, and Joe Cocker showing his unmistakable vocal style under three different guises on a rollicking 'Come Together'. Even Salma Hayek shows up as a coterie of nurses in a roulette-style hospital during 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun'. There is a very defined audience for this type of confection, and there are more definitive performances of these classic songs elsewhere. At the same time, Taymor has an audacious visual sense well worth experiencing. Proceed with caution.",6,1,6,12 October 2007
Stardust," A Witty Fantasy and a Soaring Romantic Adventure Combine Seamlessly
","This 2007 Victorian-era fantasy took me by surprise and most pleasantly, as the ads make it sound like it would be a CGI-saturated conglomeration of The Brothers Grimm and The Princess Bride with a little Time Bandits thrown in for good measure. What it turns out to be is an adult fairy tale that doesn't make the mistake of taking itself too seriously. Even though much of the credit belongs to the source, the highly acclaimed 1997 graphic novel by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess, director and co-screenwriter Matthew Vaughan (along with co-writer Jane Goldman) does an impressive job balancing the comically ribald and pitch-black elements into a compelling albeit rather convoluted plot gift-wrapped in a romantic adventure.The fanciful tale centers on Tristan, a gawky shop boy who is completely smitten with the beauteous Victoria, who is naturally to be engaged to the more dashing Humphrey within the week. Tristan and Victoria strike a deal whereby she will marry him only if he can deliver a falling star to her before Humphrey proposes. In order to do so, Tristan must pass through the sacred wall into the magical kingdom of Stronghold, his birthplace and where his mother may still be held captive. There in a newly formed crater, he finds Yvaine, a star that has fallen out of the firmament against her will. Now vulnerably earthbound, Yvaine also elicits the attention of two unsavory characters - Prince Septimus, Stronghold's remaining heir, who wants a jewel necklace she wears in order to ensure his ascendancy to the throne, and Lamia, a 400-year old witch looking to reclaim her youth and beauty by taking out Yvaine's heart...literally. Their paths criss-cross throughout the film in ways both dazzling and scarifying.To Vaughan's credit, the movie never feels overwhelmed by the special effects necessary to sustain the fantasy, including airborne galleons, mystical creatures, and all the magical shape transformations due to witchcraft. Moreover, it's the sharp wit of his and Goldman's script and the quicksilver pacing that really keeps the story aloft in an unexpected manner. The casting is close to ideal. As Tristan, the reluctant hero, Charlie Cox elevates a potentially callow role into one with genuine romance and indiscriminate vigor. At first, with her contemporary sensibilities, Claire Danes' ironic take on Yvaine feels a bit off, but she transitions nicely into the heartfelt aspects of her ethereal role. Making her venal Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray look like a suburban amateur by comparison, Michelle Pfeiffer has a grand time playing Lamia switching back and forth from her stunning beauty to decaying harridan, all the while plotting and conniving her way to her end goal. She has obviously entered a phase of her career where she feels comfortable acting malicious without remorse and sending up her incredible looks.In brief roles, Sienna Miller perfectly captures Victoria's capricious and superficial nature, Rupert Everett epitomizes gallows wit as the splattered Secundus, and Ricky Gervais goes for the funny bone as the opportunistic Ferdy the Fence. Even Peter O'Toole shows up as a dying king (perhaps coincidentally, he played an actor playing a similar part in last year's Venus), and Ian McKellan provides the stentorian narration. However, the real scene stealer is Robert DeNiro, doing little to hide his Bronx accent, as Captain Shakespeare, who maintains a surprising dual identity to keep up appearances for his crew. It's hardly his finest hour, but he is far more amusing here than in Meet The Fockers. The technical aspects of this sprawling, imaginative world are first-rate, in particular, Gavin Bocquet's meticulous production design (he was responsible for the design of the latest Star Wars trilogy) and Ben Davis's dazzling cinematography. This is superb entertainment for fans of this genre.",9,1,1,13 August 2007
The Hurt Locker," Bigelow Viscerally Captures the Intense Effects of Wartime Anguish and Ambiguity
","Director Kathryn Bigelow ('Point Break') has an uncanny ability to capture the adrenaline in an unbearably tense situation, and she displays this unique skill throughout this propulsive 2009 battlefield drama. In fact, Mark Boal's blunt, economic screenplay (based on his own experiences embedded in a bomb squad) largely eschews the politics around the Iraqi conflict in favor of the escalating madness infiltrating an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their unenviable job is to dispose of undetonated bombs in the war-torn streets of Baghdad during the post-invasion period in 2004. The story's focus is on the new team leader, Sergeant First Class William James, who depends on the support of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge who are assigned to communicate with James via a radio inside his bomb-suit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Sanborn and Eldridge are still reeling from the sudden death of their previous leader, Staff Sergeant Thompson, when the far more reckless James upsets their established procedures with his extraordinary resolve. James turns out to be a more complex figure than his original bravado indicates, and Sanborn and Eldridge respond by questioning their own perspective on risk versus responsibility. A key factor in understanding James' psyche is his relationship with a local boy who calls himself Beckham because of his love of soccer. This leads James to acts that endanger his team and stretch them beyond wartime bravery and into James' obsessive mission. With visual flair and kinetic editing, Bigelow seems far less concerned with sustaining a narrative, although in this case, her own singular sense of film-making bravado overshadows the more conventional plot directions she introduces later in the story. Jeremy Renner is a terrific find as James because he manages to deepen the character's cocksure attitude with every traumatizing episode and without the need for sentiment.That's because he conveys both the uncompromising concentration and the resulting adrenaline rush James feels within the desperation of a free-for-all combat zone. Illustrating their characters' inner conflict in different ways, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty play Eldridge and Sanborn skillfully. Mackie accurately shows Eldridge struggling to be the professional soldier, while Geraghty reflects a more humanistic perspective, the one to which we civilian viewers can probably most relate, and he is especially affecting in his climactic confessional scene. Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes show up for brief but surprisingly effective cameos. Barry Ackroyd ('United 93') is responsible for the vivid, burnished cinematography. The extras on the 2010 DVD are sparse but quite good. The most informative feature is the commentary track from Bigelow and Boal, who both discuss production details and historical context to allow for a greater appreciation of the story being told. There is also a twelve-minute making-of featurette, which is pretty standard as these extras go. Lastly, an image gallery accompanies a 23-minute Q&A session with Boal and Bigelow recorded at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.",9,3,11,31 January 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Stunning Craftsmanship and a Heartfelt Approach Lend Resonance to an Elaborate Adult Fairy Tale
","Taken as an elaborate, adult-oriented fairy tale, there is much to savor in director David Fincher's 2008 time-spanning magnum opus. The sheer craftsmanship in his nearly three-hour film is second to none from Claudio Miranda's masterful cinematography to Alexandre Desplat's grandiose music to Donald Graham Burt's meticulous production design. Nearly every image feels like a beautiful tableau perfect in the depiction of the specific period that the filmmaker had meant to evoke. Where the film misses the mark somewhat is in its center. The passivity of the title character - while understandable given the passage of 20th-century history he witnesses and the extraordinary changes he experiences - does not provide as compelling an impetus for the plot as one would hope. Co-written by Eric Roth ('Forrest Gump') and Robin Swicord ('The Jane Austen Book Club'), the story takes a 'Gump'-like approach to Benjamin making him an observer of the sweeping events around him. With the usually sober-minded, action-oriented Fincher ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'Zodiac') at the helm, the surprise is that he pulls off the movie without sacrificing his dark-edged, soulful film-making style.Based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald ('The Great Gatsby'), the fanciful story centers on Benjamin Button, who is born in New Orleans on the night of that World War I officially ends. His mother dies after childbirth, and upon seeing his age-withered son, the father leaves Benjamin on the back steps of a local retirement home. The barren caretaker Queenie takes the baby in without condition even though Benjamin has the symptoms of an elderly man - arthritis, cataracts, deafness. Defying the odds, he continues to live as an old man growing younger by the day. In the midst of this odd existence enters Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the residents, who is immediately drawn to the aged Benjamin. Realizing they are destined for each other despite the initially discomfiting circumstances, they move in completely different directions for the next several years. Daisy becomes a promising dancer in New York City, while Benjamin becomes a tugboat sailor experiencing war, romance, and his budding manhood. It's inevitable that they intersect, but given that their life paths are moving them in opposite, intractable directions, the issue becomes how long can they truly stay together.While Brad Pitt fits the physical dimensions of the part well, especially with the assistance of expert make-up and CGI effects, I think he falls a bit short in conveying the nuance of his watchful character. There is an opaqueness in his performance that makes me wonder if there is much to the character beyond his extraordinary medical circumstances. Cate Blanchett, on the other hand, captures the restless vigor of Daisy well and effectively shows the evolving resignation her character faces as she grows older and he younger. On opposing timelines, both actors are required to age from 20 to over 80, and neither displays the predictable affectation that would otherwise mar their work here. There is standout work on the sidelines - Tilda Swinton as the lonely, wealthy wife of a British diplomat who embarks on a clandestine affair with Benjamin while he is stationed in Moscow, and best of all, Taraji P. Henson (memorable as the simpering Shug in 'Hustle and Flow'), who plays Queenie well beyond stereotype into a genuinely heartwarming character. There are some amazing scenes such as the wartime sequence at sea, as well as humorous interludes like the lightning-prone man. The ending feels a bit rushed, though the framing device with the reverse-clockmaker lends surprising resonance to the central love story.",8,1,3,27 January 2009
Transformers," Clang! Clang! Clang! Went the Shape-Shifting Robots With a Helpful Dose of Comedy to Boot
","Director Michael Bay will never win any awards for subtlety with his industrial-strength, testosterone-heavy popcorn movies. His prevalent use of quick cuts and hand-held shots, compounded by car chases, explosions and other CGI-saturated effects, are all accounted for in this juvenile-oriented 2007 action picture, but I have to admit that there is a welcome sense of humor in the screenplay by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci that manages to bring this one a cut above Bay's previous endeavors like The Island. Humor is a smart approach in tackling potentially unfamiliar terrain such as Hasbro's Transformers franchise, which had its heyday in the 1980's, before much of the film's audience was born. Yet, at the same time, there is a need to remain true to the spirit of the original premise without changing it in order to pacify baby boomers who would not accept anything less than the myth. In meeting both those objectives, the film meets expectations as an intermittently entertaining summer film.The convoluted story has to do with two warring factions of shape-changing robots - the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons - who both depend on a monolithic entity known as the Cube for sustaining their races. Just how it does it is beyond my comprehension, as do most of the plot details having to do with the Transformers and their planet Cybertron. What make marginally more sense is the main storyline around an awkward, huckstering teenager named Sam Witwicky, who is the descendant of an explorer whose glasses hold the key to the Cube. Sam wants a car badly and gets a beat-up Camaro which naturally turns out to be an Autobot. He also wants Mikaela, a girl who seems way out of his league until her mechanical skills and checkered past come to the fore. While this boy-meets-car-and-girl story is simmering, there are other subplots involving an army unit in the Middle East battling the Decepticons, a computer hacker who frustrates the Secretary of Defense with her complex yet undeniable deductive reasoning, and a group of X-Files-type agents, led by an overbearing zealot, who try to take Sam and Mikaela into custody.There doesn't seem to be great priority placed on resolving the various plot lines, except for the first one and only after twenty minutes of quick-action destruction held mostly in medium shots in an assumed attempt to exaggerate the parameters of the action. Oddly, the climax has more of a benumbing effect since it's difficult to tell the scope of the action with much of it feeling clunky and repetitive until the exhausting finish. Before that, many scenes come across as inexplicable, over-explained or just too drawn out to enjoy fully, for example, the comically clumsy Autobots hiding around Sam's parents' house. Emphasizing the derivative nature of Bay's approach here are snatches of film classics like The Terminator and especially King Kong used throughout, and the influence of executive producer Steven Spielberg can be felt in Sam's responsibility-driven storyline.Bay and the screenwriters deserve credit for humanizing the robots just enough to make them compelling to the viewer, though honestly not enough to empathize that much with their fates. It's not for lack of trying, as for example, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime, provides stentorian fervor and palpable dignity to the role. The human performances are in line with a comic-book-style franchise. Shia LaBeouf has the most screen time as Sam. The young actor makes Sam a likable reluctant hero, though he's fairly limited beyond his constant look of amazement. The real scene stealers are John Turturro as the unctuous agent, Anthony Anderson as a squealing hacker and recent Tony winner Julie White as Sam's overprotective mother. Barely registering is Josh Duhamel as the heroic head of the army unit and Megan Fox in form-fitting wear as Mikaela. All in all, it's pretty clear that the movie defies logic and relies heavily on sensory overload to sustain itself. The unexpected comedy elements are what make it better than at least what I expected.",6,1,5,2 August 2007
Lincoln," Masterful Filmmaking and a Stellar Cast Capture Lincoln During One Pivotal Month
","To say that Daniel Day-Lewis inhabits the title role feels like such a total understatement. The iconic role has been the career-peaking touchstone for dozens of esteemed actors since the dawn of cinema including Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey (who earned an Oscar nomination in 1940 for his Lincoln), Gregory Peck, and even cast member Hal Holbrook (who plays Republican leader Francis Preston Blair here), but none have come across with the deceptively casual verisimilitude of Day-Lewis in Steven Spielberg's masterful 2012 historical drama. The versatile actor is able to bring multiple layers of human dimension to a public figure known to us only through books, marble statues, or perhaps a childhood trip to Disneyland where he remains an animatronic mannequin in 'Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln'. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner ('Angels in America') wisely do not attempt an episodic treatment of Lincoln's life but rather focus on January 1865, a critical month at the beginning of the President's second term when he was undergoing the most important event of his life.Based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's superb treatise, 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln', the 150-minute film focuses on the conundrum he faced in pushing the 13th amendment, the abolition of slavery, through the House of Representatives toward legislation while facing immense pressure among all factions to end the now-four-year-old Civil War and reclaim the Confederacy into the Union. The movie's deliberately narrow focus allows us to see Lincoln as a relatable human being, someone with a determined sense of mission but also less than ideal with a surprising albeit understandable streak of opportunism that a broader biopic would have glossed over. It also means the story consists of subtle moments rather than milestone events that would signal the next historical battle. Although Spielberg bookends the film with unblinking scenes of carnage true to the period, the film relies primarily on the human drama that comes from the argument of opposing ideas and the minutiae of political strategy used to win favor among influential politicosIt's a story that has obvious relevance to the Washington political scene of today. The movie also examines the additional burden Lincoln was experiencing with his fractious home life. He struggles to keep the peace with his tempestuous wife Mary still grieving over the death of their third son Willie three years earlier, as well as their first-born Robert who becomes desperate to enlist in the Union Army against his parents' wishes. Kushner's superbly understated screenplay lets the plot lines intertwine organically and keeps Spielberg's tendency toward bravura filmmaking in check. Only toward the end when we recognize what is about to happen to Lincoln did I feel Spielberg's use of unspoken prescience a bit too heightened. The performances are stunning examples of what great filmmaking can generate with the right cast. Day-Lewis' Lincoln is for the ages. It amazes me that Liam Neeson was attached to the project for six years before generously abandoning it because Day- Lewis appears born to play the role. With a choked Midwestern tenor, he vividly evokes a man gifted at conflict resolution and oratory splendor but not above manipulating information to achieve the greater good.Two other performances are nearly as stellar. Tommy Lee Jones hones in on his particular brand of irascibility to bring fiery abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens to life, and Kushner gives him the lion's share of clever vitriol in the script. As Mary, Sally Field is a constant presence but has probably about three showy scenes where she is able to show her considerable talent to the full. Nearly a half-century since Gidget and more than a decade older than Day-Lewis, this diminutive actress gained 25 pounds and defies the odds by immersing herself completely into all the conflicting impulses that made Mary such a complicated, controversial historical figure. There are five Oscars among this accomplished trio, and more could very well be forthcoming. Many other actors in the expansive cast are worthy of mention, including James Spader's surprisingly amusing turn as a Republican lobbyist, Hal Holbrook's avuncular bluster as Blair, Gloria Reuben's quiet fortitude as Mary's confidant Elizabeth Keckley, and David Straitharn providing a jittery voice of reason as Secretary of State William Seward. A few actors like the omnipresent Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert are not given enough time to flesh out their characters. Regardless, it's a masterful film that captures lightning in a bottle.",10,3,13,26 November 2012
Children of Men," Precarious Balance Between Nihilism and Hope Captured with Bravado by Cuarón
","Director Alfonso Cuarón lends both scarifying grit and unexpected heart to this propulsive, rewarding 2006 screen adaptation of P.D. James' 1992 dystopian sci-fi novel about a hopeless future with no children. There have been many apocalyptic films that deal with Armageddon in many different forms, yet this one reverberates from a most plangent storyline of global collapse as Cuarón thoughtfully brings it down to a human-size scale. Set in England only twenty years hence, the film shows a relentlessly bleak landscape not too far imagined from the present. Cuarón manages to tether us to the fantastical story by making 2027 London look realistically desultory and shell-shocked with its faded double-deckers and Bangkok-style tuk-tuks. In turn, the Bexhill refugee camp later in the film has a startling resemblance to the Abu Ghraib prison and the surrounding streets a dead ringer for the shots of violent warfare we are used to seeing in Iraq on CNN.The plot centers on Theo Faron, a former political activist who has been numbed into apathy by the increasingly nihilistic state of the planet. Because its isolated island geography has ensured the success of an emerging fascist government, Great Britain has become the only nation to survive the worldwide nuclear terrorism. Foreigners are automatically labeled illegal immigrants and placed in brutalizing internment camps, and at 18, the youngest person on the planet has just been stabbed to death. The news is devastating to the masses because infertility has plagued the planet for nearly two decades with no hope for the human race to survive. Kidnapped by the Fishes, a revolutionary group supporting the foreigners' human rights, Theo finds out the dastardly act was masterminded by his ex-wife Julian, who heads the group. Her motivation becomes clear as they are holding a West African girl named Kee, who happens to be eight months pregnant. The rest of the film focuses on the clandestine effort to transport Kee to the Human Project, an offshore organization dedicated to reversing the global infertility.There are so many strong visual cues and unexpected plot turns that it is impossible to be bored by the story penned by no less than five screenwriters including Cuarón. A powerful example is the meticulous portrayal of Theo's cousin Nigel, the one official who can secure travel documents for Kee's passage, as the curator of the world's surviving masterworks (including Michelangelo's damaged David and Picasso's Guernica) in the reconverted Tate Modern. Another is the superb cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, richly textured in establishing the bombed-out, authoritarian universe and documentary-like once the more violent aspects take over the movie. Particularly impressive is the extended scene where the Fishes attempt to escape an aggressive ambush in a speeding car, as well as the concluding battle scenes which culminate into an unexpected religious allegory.After his scene-stealing turns in 'Closer' and 'Inside Man', Clive Owen really owns this movie from start to finish with a richly complex portrait of a man who discovers his sense of purpose against seemingly insurmountable odds. In fact, his committed performance holds together some of the more far-fetched plot developments like Theo's too-easy escape from the safe house. Claire-Hope Ashitey provides a striking presence as the vulnerable but amazingly resilient Kee. Also making vivid impressions are the reliable Julianne Moore as Julian, Chiwetel Ejiofor as fellow revolutionary Luke, Danny Huston as Nigel, Pam Ferris as Kee's self-appointed guardian Miriam (who provides an essential back story behind the infertility), Peter Mullan as the corrupt policeman Syd, and an especially colorful Michael Caine as Theo's perpetually quixotic friend Jasper. This is nicely audacious film-making, a creative masterstroke that marks Cuarón as an important creative force in cinema.",9,6,11,5 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Three-Disc DVD Set Highlights An Eastwood Masterwork With a Powerful Turn by Swank
","It has been quite a few years since Clint Eastwood was reamed by critics for starring and sometimes directing ultra-violent vigilante action thrillers. What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his film-making techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in this acclaimed 2004 film, a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary. The only significant thing miscalculated is the movie's title, which seems almost too comically ironic for such an enriching film.Written by Paul Haggis ('Crash'), the basic story is simple, almost deceptively corny sounding a bit like the distaff version of 'Rocky'. A spunky female fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, Maggie Fitzgerald, wants a grizzled old trainer, Frankie Dunn, to guide her to become a professional boxer. Of course, the trainer owns a third-rate gym with an array of male fighters encompassing all the stereotypes. He also has an aged assistant, Scrap, who is of course, willing to champion Maggie's potential more than Frankie, at least at the beginning. Eastwood, however, belies the predictability and takes his story to a far deeper and more nuanced level than one would presume from this set-up. It turns out that Maggie is pushing 32 and considered over-the-hill for getting into the game. Frankie is estranged from his daughter, reads Yeats, studies Gaelic and goes to Mass every day mostly to annoy the young priest. Scrap was a contender trained by Frankie but lost an eye and his boxing future when a match went awry.How these three characters interact with each other supplies the film's main pleasure, not really the obligatory boxing scenes that will assuredly make one wince by their realism. In fact, one of the more painful scenes in the movie is not in the boxing ring but in a new house that Maggie buys for her ungrateful mother, when Maggie comes to the revelation that she has no one but Frankie to provide emotional support in her life. This is not to say the film lacks humor, as Eastwood infuses a clever sensibility that subtly draws you into these characters' lives without hesitation. The story follows Maggie's ascension in the boxing world, and what happens beyond that development is devastating. While it is enough to say there is tragedy involved, leave it to Eastwood, in his straightforward, confident directorial approach, to make the last part of the story surprisingly life-affirming and not at all exploitative. Only a film-making master could pull off such a feat in such an honest and emotionally affecting manner.As an actor, Eastwood continues to impress primarily by his innate connection to Frankie. Probably not since his surprisingly open-hearted turn in 'The Bridges of Madison County' has he made himself so vulnerable on screen, granted this time under the veneer of his hard-earned, leather-faced machismo. His sense of authority is never in question here, and he shows it off with great relish, especially as his character realizes how much more complicated life becomes as he grows older. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap with his customary humanistic skill. In fact, he provides the narration as a voice-over letter to Frankie's daughter in a manner that will remind you of his similar turn in 'The Shawshank Redemption'. That's not to say his performance is unsurprising, as he and Eastwood have an easy rapport that plays to both actors' strengths. But the standout is Hilary Swank portraying Maggie with an emotional directness and piercing vulnerability that cuts right to the heart. Not only is she physically impressive in the gym and in the ring, but she elevates what could have been a one-note character into someone far more complex, intelligent and affecting. The film is wonderfully profound with superlative acting.The three-disc 2005 DVD set is solid but rather light on extras. Disc One contains a pristine print transfer of the film but no commentaries from Eastwood or the cast. There are three extras on Disc Two. The first is an 18-minute featurette, 'Born to Fight', which features interviews with the three stars and three other cast members, in particular, boxer/actor Lucia Rijker (who plays Maggie's fatalistic opponent) who discusses the ways in which the film parallels her career in boxing. The second is 'The Producers' Round 15', a 13-minute short on the film's production process featuring Haggis, as well as producers Albert Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg. The last extra is a roundtable discussion, 'James Lipton Takes on Three' with the three stars being interviewed in typical sequestered fashion by the erudite host of 'Inside the Actors' Studio'. Disc Three is the soundtrack CD of Eastwood's atmospheric musical score orchestrated by Lennie Niehaus conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony.",9,2,3,31 March 2008
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Clooney Proves to Be an Observant and Urgent Filmmaker Recreating Murrow-McCarthy Showdown
","David Strathairn's uncanny impersonation of legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow is the centerpiece of George Clooney's sophomore venture as a feature film director. Granted it comes across a bit like a stylized civics lesson on free speech and responsible journalism, the movie is also sharply focused and extremely evocative in recreating the claustrophobic atmosphere of TV journalism in the 1950's. It's obvious that Clooney did his homework as you see all the details of the production from the smoke-filled sets to the extensive use of historic video from that period, whether it's Murrow's 'Face to Face' program or the Congressional hearings identifying possible Communists.Shot in crisp black and white by Robert Elswit, the story co-written by Clooney and Grant Heslov is driven by the infamous Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist witch-hunts when in 1953, McCarthy bullies the US Air Force into discharging one of its young officers based on a vague allegation that the man's father was a leftist. This outrages the otherwise reserved Murrow who, with the assistance of producer Fred Friendly, uses their CBS News program 'See It Now' to expose McCarthy's egregious act. Of course, this brings down the heat of the brass at the network, in particular, president William Paley, but Murrow and Friendly are allowed to continue, even allowing McCarthy to respond to the allegations.Clooney smartly uses archived footage of McCarthy rather than cast an actor to play the ruthless senator, but he has assembled a top-notch cast to fill out the remaining roles. Frank Langella brings his trademark authoritative malevolence to the intimidating Paley but with hints of humanity that make him seem more vulnerable. Clooney himself takes on the rather pedestrian role of Friendly with his usual panache. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson easily play secretly married CBS News co-workers, but their subplot is dispensable. Jeff Daniels makes a welcome return as a mid-level CBS executive trying to convince Murrow to pursue the relatively safe target of Joe Kennedy.There are in-studio performances by jazz singer Dianne Reeves that act like a chorus to the story, but as expert as her singing is, these are the only false steps the film makes. The film's most intriguing performance actually comes from Ray Wise as CBS anchor Don Hollenbeck, displaying a frozen smile and fragile psyche as a powerful New York Post columnist regularly accuses him of being a Communist sympathizer. The movie, however, belongs to Straithairn in an elliptical performance that shows Murrow's evolving position between drags of his constant cigarettes and to Clooney who has directed a piercing history lesson that does not ambitiously portend any present-day relevance. Yet, the message that we should not confuse dissent with disloyalty rings just as true today.",8,3,5,12 December 2005
World Trade Center," Stone Offers Both a Moving Personal Account and a Safe Perspective of 9/11
","Compared to the visceral power of the documentary-like 'United 93', maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone atypically goes a more traditional route in focusing his 2006 film on the two police officers who were able to survive the collapse of the World Trade Center at Ground Zero. Instead of going for an emotional gut-punch on a broad canvas, the controversial filmmaker plays it safe by depoliticizing the film from possible conspiracy theories and emphasizing far more on the personal impact. The result still works powerfully, but the movie sometimes feels myopic in making the rest of the day's tragedies a mere backdrop for the central story. Moreover, screenwriter Andrea Berloff, working from the remembrances of the real people, brings a certain TV-movie-level predictability to the narrow focus of the plot despite the devastating power of key scenes.The movie takes advantage of the audience's knowing anticipation of the events at the beginning, but Stone blessedly doesn't exploit the tragedies more than necessary. While he incorporates global reaction to the events, the story quickly hones in on John McLoughlin, who leads a volunteer brigade of four Port Authority officers to the site. In the midst of their evacuation efforts, they find themselves buried in the rubble with McLoughlin and Will Jimeno the only two who survive under several feet of debris. The film then alternates between the dark desperation of the two immobilized men and the agonizing waiting game experienced by their families. There is no getting around the harrowing personal drama unfolding, and Stone is careful not to step out of bounds when it comes to the heroism displayed that day by all the real-life characters shown.The acting is quite sturdy and well-grounded. After a long drought since 'Adaptation', Nicolas Cage plays the taciturn McLoughlin economically, while Michael Peña, who provided the most riveting moments in the otherwise manipulative 'Crash' last year, brings an honest combination of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno. Even though the wives are decidedly secondary roles here, Maria Bello continues to gain stature in her gritty portrayal of McLoughlin's wife Donna, while Maggie Gyllenhaal plays closer to the vest as Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison. As the rescuers, Michael Shannon plays former Marine Dave Karnes with steely, singular resolve, and Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley make vivid impressions as fireman Scott Strauss and reactivated paramedic Chuck Serieka, respectively. Seamus McGarvey contributed the evocative cinematography, and Jan Roelfs' production design is piercingly accurate to our collective memories of how Ground Zero looked on that fateful day. It's a fine, moving drama in many ways but in certain respects, too safe in Stone's hands.",7,2,5,28 August 2006
Black Snake Moan," Absurd, Southern-Fried Melodrama Never Transcends Its Audacious Premise
","It would be too easy to dismiss this strangely unsatisfying 2007 film entirely because I can't tell whether director/writer Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow) is trying to satirize the Southern Gothic sensibilities of a Tennessee Williams potboiler or replicate the excesses of an early 1970's blaxploitation movie. Either way, he cannot seem to pull off his audacious premise which involves a cuckolded blues guitarist appropriately named Lazarus who enchains a nymphomaniac to his radiator. If the film was played out as over-the-top as the premise, then it might have had a fighting chance, but as it stands, Brewer is too ensconced in his chicken-fried fable to mine the potential black comedy in this hilariously preposterous exercise.The hackneyed plot centers on Lazarus, a self-righteous man stinging from his wife's decision to leave him for his younger brother. Meanwhile, a skeletal nymphomaniac, Rae, is so distraught over her boyfriend Ronnie leaving for the army that she goes on a hedonistic meltdown involving alcohol, prescription drugs and indiscriminate sex. A violent episode leaves her unconscious on the road where Lazarus finds her limp body. The rest of the film focuses on how the principals change from the ordeal but not before facing a lot of inner demons along the way. However, unlike Hustle & Flow, I cannot really say that I cared about the fate of these misbegotten characters at the end. Brewer just can't seem to connect the absurdity of the central situation with anything resembling real life, which ironically may be exactly his point here.The actors try hard to breathe empathetic life into the overripe characters, but they are ultimately defeated by the lurid dimensions of the story. As Lazarus, Samuel L. Jackson almost makes the situation palatable and even sings several blues numbers with surprising conviction, but Christina Ricci makes Rae a primal stockpile of white trash clichés on top of a condescending back story. Justin Timberlake is completely out of his league as Ronnie and neutralizes every scene he's in with his amateur standing as an actor. Look for former child star Kim Richards (Escape to Witch Mountain) as Rae's defeated mother and a doozy of a fight scene between the two in a grocery store. The 2007 DVD has plenty of extras including an enthusiastic commentary track by Brewer and a half-hour making-of documentary, 'Conflicted: The Making of Black Snake Moan'. There are a couple of shorter featurettes about the music and five deleted scenes.",3,20,40,27 August 2007
The Dark Knight," Post-9/11 Accountability and a Darker Shade of Justice Make This Batman Soar
","Among the many satisfying surprises within this elaborately produced 2008 film, the primary one is that it is at heart, a first-rate, character-driven psychological thriller that uses the familiar franchise to ask hard questions about our individual accountability at a time when anarchy and terrorism are running rampant. With this propulsive sequel, director/co-writer Christopher Nolan far surpasses the stoic murkiness that plagued most of 2005's 'Batman Begins' because myth exposition is not necessary this time. Moreover, he doesn't forget this is also a derring-do adventure and wastes no time in establishing the tone with one of the most Machiavellian of bank robberies. The meticulously planned heist was masterminded by Batman's anarchic adversary, the Joker, a villain so wrapped up in his own psychosis of evil that he is without fear of repercussion. However, this is just the tip of a moral iceberg as Gotham City is cloaked in a crime spree by the city's major syndicates.On the side of justice is not only the Batman but also the city's charismatic district attorney, Harvey Dent, who symbolically plays the story's white knight. Under the guise of his billionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne, Batman is quite impressed with Dent's seemingly intractable sense of decency. So is assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, Wayne's lifelong friend whose office romance with Dent gets serious. Of course, a romantic triangle ensues, but this is only one component of the complex storyline that has the Joker taking over the city with his merciless acts of destruction, while Batman becomes a more ambiguous figure teetering between heroic and vengeful. With his brother Jonathan as co-scenarist, Nolan provides a boldly intellectual perspective to this movie that never gives into easy answers, and the complexities are compounded by the intense feelings that fluctuate between what we expect our heroes to do and what we should expect from ourselves.It's a precarious line that Nolan balances with edgy conviction, and the classic good-versus-evil dynamics become upended for something that cuts much deeper. Without giving much else away, the pivotal scene with the ferries perfectly epitomizes the slippery slope all of us find ourselves in a post-9/11 world. Four of the key actors from the first film return starting with Christian Bale's covertly charged performance in the elusive title role. Not only does the character present physically demanding challenges but emotional ones as well since Batman remains a stubbornly recessive figure hiding under a familiar costume. Yet, in his innate resistance to court audience sympathy, Bale manages to cut a far more compelling character in which his internal struggles shift most uneasily to the outside. Ironically, it's his moments as Wayne that seem comparatively prosaic in conveying his outward cynicism.Had the film been made fifteen years earlier, I have a feeling that Gary Oldman would have been cast as the Joker. However, he submerges his natural edginess to play Lt. James Gordon as an island of decency. Michael Caine returns as Wayne's devote manservant Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as gadgetry whiz Lucius Fox, who helps Wayne build all the technology hardware the Batman needs to stave off the bad guys. Neither is particularly challenged here, but both perform with their usual authority. There are three new faces among the principals. As Dent, Aaron Eckhardt effectively manages the film's biggest character arc, and he is really the one whose inevitable transformation most clearly illustrates the story's central themes. With a more no-nonsense manner that nicely counterbalances her standard damsel-in-distress situation, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a marked improvement over Katie Holmes' girlish turn as Dawes.The tabloid frenzy around the late Heath Ledger has somewhat obscured what makes his performance as the Joker so effective. With his fearsome scar-faced grin, it's a grandly idiosyncratic performance full of shrewd wit and opera-level flourish. The tortured soul that the press would lead you to believe is on screen is not as evident to me. I see a sharply talented actor having the time of his life. Not surprisingly, all the production values are great with the architectural splendor of Chicago more obviously subbing for Gotham City this time out. Flaws are relatively minimal and actually carry over from the first film. The film is almost too oppressively dark, at least visually, and in the action sequences, Nolan still uses too many close-ups and quick edits that impinge on the clarity of the action presented. Regardless, the film is an impressive achievement, and along with Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man' earlier this year, may represent the pinnacle of DC and Marvel Comics on celluloid.",9,3,8,27 July 2008
Annie Hall," 'Polymorphously Perverse'....and One of the Best Romantic Comedies Ever
","It's great to see how timeless this 1977 movie still is after nearly thirty years especially after seeing Woody Allen's more challenging later work in the interim. But nothing beats a perfectly written script (courtesy of Allen and frequent collaborator Marshall Brickman) and the undeniable chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton in the title role. Scene for scene, it represents the most consistently engaging comedy Allen ever directed, and his wonderfully creative stream-of-consciousness narrative is filled to the brim with detours into flashbacks, animation, split-screens, fantasy scenes and speaking to the camera. It all blends into a movie that remains emotionally resonant and even bittersweet behind all the laughs.There is little plot to speak of as it focuses on the evolving relationship between Alvy Singer, a successful stand-up comedian, and Annie Hall, an aspiring singer. Interspersed throughout are episodes in Alvy's angst-driven life - his shaky childhood next to the Coney Island roller-coaster, his desultory days as a comedy writer, his previous failures in relationships and marriages, his ongoing resistance to the West Coast. No longer playing just the romantic loser of 'Play It Again, Sam', Allen is constantly kvetching in his search for intellectual fulfillment but finally finds his first true love in his diametric opposite, an unaffected, self-deprecating girl from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Their relationship is played out in clever episodes, none more so than their first meeting at a tennis game followed by Annie's reckless driving and a subtitled conversation on her terrace. It is really the contrast in their approach to life that brings them together and provides the impetus for their dissolution.Whether she is playing herself or not, Keaton is an unadulterated joy even as her character sadly grows apart from Alvy. Allen is himself or at least his public persona and even manages a sense of unexpected pathos toward the end, especially when he desperately proposes marriage at the health food restaurant. There are so many memorable moments that it's difficult to choose a favorite - Marshall McLuhan at the movies, the lobsters, the sneeze into the cocaine, Christopher Walken's bit as Annie's headlight-obsessed brother Duane. A movie as perfect as this deserves a deluxe DVD treatment, but the 2000 release has simply a decent print transfer and unfortunately only the original trailer as an extra. The title of my review was actually the phrase Alvy used to describe to Annie her bodily pleasure in lovemaking.",10,0,0,1 June 2006
The Graduate," Still a Funny, Perceptive Classic Forty Years Later and in a DVD Package Worthy of Its Reputation
","If there is one film deserving of a full-blown renaissance, it is this seminal 1967 social alienation comedy, and this 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD presents an especially pristine print, as well as several extras that will please die-hard fans. Based on the wry 1963 Charles Webb novel, the film itself holds a special affection among its original audience even now, the aging Vietnam War-era population who championed anarchy and the people who revise their personal histories, so they can think they were members of the now-fashionable counter-cultural movement. At the same time, it has a timeless quality for new generations simply because it's a consistently witty, observant piece of cinema targeted to anyone who has experienced that sense of post-academic confusion when the responsibilities of real life inevitably intrude.This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film. But then again, judging from his subsequent work all the way to Angels in America and Closer, Mike Nichols seems to have come into film-making fully understanding the frailties of the human condition and knowing how to convey them in a way that audiences could empathize. It is a testament to Nichols and screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that the social comedy aspects of this film do not seem at all dated. In fact, despite its provocative veneer, it's really old-fashioned in key ways from the protagonist's moralistic tendencies to his romantically compulsive motivations toward the end. Dustin Hoffman was pulled out of complete obscurity to play Benjamin, the alienated, recent college graduate drifting amid his parents' Southern California upper-middle class, swimming pool-centered ennui.As Benjamin figures out what to do with his life and faces unwanted advice from his parents' friends, enter Mrs. Robinson, a bored, restless wife, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth. It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life. She gives a masterful performance. The hotel sequence where Benjamin awkwardly asks Mrs. Robinson for a drink is shrewdly observed and downright hilarious - the suspicious hotel clerk (Henry, the film's co-screenwriter) eyeing Benjamin's every move; the reception line which Benjamin pretends to know (TV veterans Alice Ghostley and Marion Lorne, Esmeralda and Aunt Clara from Bewitched, make indelible marks here); and the predatory Mrs. Robinson's business-like approach to seduction.Complicating matters exorbitantly is Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played with relative nonchalance by Katharine Ross. The film then turns into a revenge comedy with Mrs. Robinson trying to prevent the inevitable coupling of Benjamin and Elaine. She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus. Some of the comedy and characterizations seem a bit extreme, for example, Hoffman seems to amplify his character's nebbishness a few too many times, and Elaine's fiancée appears like a textbook 1960's TV stereotype. There are also a few forgivable geographic gaffes - most of the campus scenes are not filmed at Berkeley as portrayed in the film but at USC, and Benjamin crosses the Bay Bridge in the wrong direction to hunt for Elaine.The 2007 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD contains two separate commentary tracks, both insightful but for different reasons - the first is an anecdotal remembrance with Hoffman and Ross quite engaged with details of the filming (Hoffman apparently had quite a crush on Ross and still does), and the second has Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh discussing all aspects of the production from casting to camera set-ups within specific scenes. The main featurette is the new 25-minute 'Students of 'The Graduate'', which amounts to an extended appreciation of the film from Henry; producer Lawrence Turman; two film scholars; various directors (Harold Ramis, Marc Forster, Valerie Faris & Jonathan Dayton, David O. Russell); and film critics (Newsweek's David Ansen, Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman). The second new short, 'The Seduction', is a nine-minute retrospective look at the famous scene where Mrs. Robinson nonchalantly pounces on Benjamin. The participants from the first featurette are involved here as well, and it provides a good dissection of not only the scene but the sexual mores prevalent at the time of filming.There are two holdovers from the 1999 DVD release. The first is the 22-minute ''The Graduate' at 25' produced in 1992 for the laserdisc release. It has the advantage of participation from Hoffman and Ross but otherwise echoes the information presented in the newer retrospective featurette. The second is a 22-minute interview with Hoffman done in quick takes. He lends invaluable and often amusing insight into his selection for the role and the film-making experience. He also talks about the proposed sequel which one can assume eventually turned into 2005's execrable Rumor Has It.... Beyond the original theatrical trailer, the DVD contains a print of the film that makes it look as good as it did in its original release. There is a bonus soundtrack sampler CD with four of the distinctive Simon and Garfunkel songs featured in the movie - 'The Sound of Silence', 'Scarborough Fair/Canticle', 'April Come She Will', and of course, 'Mrs. Robinson'. Lastly, there is a helpful six-page booklet that fills in the rest of the blanks on the production. This is a great package for a classic film.",10,1,2,13 September 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Robust Adaptation of Familiar Austen Novel Is One First-Class Production
","You would think that Jane Austen's most famous novel is not in need of another cinematic treatment given the definitive BBC version of a decade ago and the classic 1940 MGM version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, not to mention a contemporary 2004 Bollywood-style musical and according to IMDb, at least six other versions. However, first-time feature director Joe Wright and first-time screenwriter Deborah Moggach (with uncredited assistance from Austen adaptation veteran Emma Thompson) have brought youthful vigor and a wild, Thomas Hardy-like element to the movie, and as a whole, it works very well. It almost makes the overly familiar novel feel revitalized.For those who have forgotten their required high school reading, the story focuses on the downscale Bennet family - a passive father and a domineering mother, the latter intent on marrying off their five daughters to wealthy families. Eldest daughter Jane becomes smitten with rich but somewhat weak-willed Mr. Bingley and the bookish Mary keeps to her piano, while the two youngest daughters, Kitty and Lydia, are giggly and boy-crazy. On the other hand, the headstrong Elizabeth wants marriage on her terms with an intellectual equal, and she becomes alternately repelled and drawn to the brooding Mr. Darcy. There are several plot lines that interweave precariously toward the inevitable conclusion, but Austen's witty, often insightful dialogue holds the story together organically with grace and humor.Twenty-year old Keira Knightley is the youthful embodiment of Elizabeth, as her predecessors, Garson in particular, always strike me as too mature for the role. With her beauty subdued in casual period fashion, she manages to convey all the necessary facets of her personality with a natural élan. As Darcy, Matthew Macfayden captures the moody character's insolence and growing romanticism with little affectation. Most all of the supporting players shine with Brenda Blethyn as the exasperating Mrs. Bennet, Donald Sutherland as her introspective husband, Tom Hollander as the priggish Mr. Collins, Rosamund Pike as beautiful and likable Jane, Jena Malone convincingly British as the impulsive Lydia, and of course, in all her scene stealing glory, Judi Dench lends acidic vinegar as Lady Catherine, Darcy's disapproving aunt.Parts of the film have a subtly stylized quality, such as the way the camera seems to track uninterrupted during the Assembly Hall ball sequence or when Elizabeth's head spins symbolically as she sits on a swing. There are also many well-turned tableaux-style shots that imbue the spirit of the period with vivid but unobtrusive detail. Credit should go to Roman Osin's textured and sumptuous cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's authentic-feeling costumes and Dario Marianelli's flavorful music, all of which capture a decidedly realistic though ultimately romanticized 16th-century England.The DVD package has several too-short features that provide some background into the production and Austen's characters but hardly enough to provide meaningful insight. Wright provides sometimes interesting commentary on an alternate track that borders a bit on the effusive, and there is an alternative and thankfully excised ending which spells out the plot resolutions unnecessarily. This movie is a joyous celebration of Austen's artistry as a writer whose story themes resonate today.",9,1,3,20 March 2006
Singin' in the Rain," The Forecast Is Only Bright and Sunny for This Unparalleled MGM Classic
","Only the cloudiest of curmudgeons could possibly begrudge a musical as pervasively buoyant and consistently inventive as this 1952 classic. Thanks to the unstoppable creative energy of Gene Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen and the sharp writing of the redoubtable team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, what could have been just another MGM confection is really a non-stop singing and dancing entertainment and a clever satire on the talkie revolution that transformed Hollywood's movie industry in the late 1920's. Fortunately, the 50th Anniversary, two-disc set released in 2002 is an appropriate tribute to this film since it includes a pristine print, clear audio and plentiful extras.Kelly's athleticism and natural braggadocio manner are put to optimal use in the fictionalized story of silent screen stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, both of whom make a particularly bumptious transition to sound with their romantic costume epic, 'The Dueling Cavalier'. Thanks to the introduction of primitive and awkwardly placed microphones, the stars' mute over-emoting looks and sounds ludicrous, in particular, Lina's Bronx-accented helium squealing. Off-screen, Don can barely stand Lina, and what's more, he becomes smitten with young ingénue Kathy Selden much to the consternation of Lina. After the movie's disastrous preview, Don's best friend and piano accompanist Cosmo Brown comes up with the idea of turning the potential fiasco into a musical, 'The Dancing Cavalier', with Lina's unbearably comic voice dubbed by Kathy.While Lina uses blackmail to keep Kathy under wraps, the plot still comes to its inevitable conclusion but not before an elaborate and rather anachronistic production number, the fourteen-minute 'Broadway Melody Ballet'. Although not as enthralling as Kelly's similarly lengthy tribute to the French master artists in 'An American in Paris' the year before, this number has all the razzle-dazzle one could possibly hope for in a single number, including the leggy Cyd Charisse dancing flawlessly as a coin-flipping femme fatale. In fact, the whole film is so energetic and saturated with color that it's hard not to be enraptured.Most every musical number is a memorable classic from the classroom antics of Kelly and O'Connor in 'Moses Supposes' to the ebullient furniture prancing of 'Good Morning' to O'Connor's acrobatic turns on 'Make 'Em Laugh' to Kelly's classic rain-drenched solo set to the title tune. Kelly is inarguably at his peak here, and so is the youthful O'Connor who proves even more than the females, to be Kelly's most compatible dance partner. Nineteen-year old Debbie Reynolds is kewpie doll-adorable as Kathy and dances with hard-earned ease with her veteran colleagues. The scene stealer, however, is Jean Hagen who plays the not-so-dumb Lina with genuine comic élan. You will also notice twenty-year old Rita Moreno playing a Clara Bow-like movie star named Zelma Zanders.The DVD comes with a wonderfully insightful if somewhat crowded commentary track with participation from O'Connor, Reynolds, Donen, Comden, Green, Charisse, and co-star Kathleen Freeman (who plays Lina's failed elocution teacher), as well as film historian Rudy Behlmer and director Baz Luhrmann. Most of them also participate and repeat their recollections in a thirty-minute featurette on the second disc, 'What a Glorious Feeling' made specifically for the DVD. There are two other shorts - one on the first disc called 'Reel Sounds' which details the evolution of the sound picture during the setting of the movie, and the other is a lengthier 1996 documentary, 'Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM', which provides a broader view of the classic MGM musicals of the period.There are also trailers, some outtakes and antiquated movie excerpts of songs written by Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, who penned 'Singin' in the Rain'. All in all, this is a terrific package for a most deserving Hollywood classic well worth repeated viewings.",10,1,4,24 January 2007
Alice in Wonderland," Burton Doesn't Lose His 'Muchness' with His Darkly Fanciful Take on the Lewis Carroll Classic
","Mad as a hatter and wildly audacious, this fantastical 2010 adventure turns Lewis Carroll's classic tale of surreal logic displacement on its ear. Who better to translate this story into a female empowerment parable than the master of quirky darkness, director Tim Burton, and his favorite muse Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter? The excesses of Burton's imagination, guided by Linda Woolverton's ('The Lion King') sharp-tongued screenplay, result in a particularly idiosyncratic adaptation. Yet, as dazzling and sometimes scarifying as the computer-generated images are, the film is not overwhelmed by the visual elements and retains the basic themes of the original stories.Combining elements of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' with its sequel, 'Through the Looking Glass', the movie begins when a young Alice awakens from a nightmare in which she has visited Wonderland. The obviously precocious child questions her sanity to which her father assures her that it's fine to be 'bonkers', all the best people are. Flash forward several years later, and Alice has become a rebellious nineteen-year-old on her way to a garden party where all the guests are to witness her being engaged to a patronizing fop named Hamish. She hesitates and asks for a moment at which point she chases a rabbit from her earlier dream into a hole. Perpetually shrinking and enlarging, she finds herself in not Wonderland but Underland where she sees all the talking creatures from her dream, but this time, they all question whether she is the real Alice. They all need the Alice of their collective memory, the one who would have no trouble defeating the monstrous Jabberwocky and ending the reign of the evil Red Queen.Once Alice joins the Mad Hatter's party, it becomes clear she is not in a dream of her making, that she is being signaled to make her own way in life and within Underland, ensure that the virtuous White Queen be restored to the throne, even donning Joan of Arc-like armor for the climactic battle scene. Australian actress Mia Wasikowska ('The Evening Sun', 'Amelia') makes a terrifically wary Alice whose sense of wonder is tempered by her palpable search for self-confidence. As you would expect, Depp has the showiest role as the Mad Hatter, all leering smiles and electro-shock orange hair, and he makes the most of it despite an incongruous dance solo toward the end. With her head blown up three times its normal size, Helena Bonham Carter has a field day as the decapitation-crazed Red Queen as she barks orders at her lackeys and demands to be pampered with pigs being used as footrests.The rest of the cast make the impressions needed within the dimensions of the story - Stephen Fry as the dapper but cowardly Cheshire Cat; Crispin Glover as the villainous Knave of Hearts tending to the Red Queen's absurd orders; Alan Rickman as the surly, hookah-smoking Caterpillar; and English comedian Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, perhaps the most Disneyesque of the characters conceived here. Only Anne Hathaway disappoints in an arch turn as the White Queen, appearing to channel her Princess Diaries co-star, Julie Andrews, in accentuated 'Mary Poppins' mode. All the production values are first-class from Robert Stromberg's wildly varied production design to Dariusz Wolski's rich cinematography and Danny Elfman's bombastic music score. The movie does meander at various points, primarily to establish the next story turn, but fans of Burton's and Depp's work shouldn't be too disappointed.",8,3,4,4 April 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," Hopkins in Peak Form as New Zealand's Legendary Speed Demon
","This 2005 film directed and written by Roger Donaldson is quite a charmer, a true family film with a genuinely heroic protagonist in a compelling story of triumph against the odds. Motorcycle enthusiast Burt Munro has fascinated Donaldson since he made a documentary about the New Zealand folk hero in 1973, 'Offerings to the Gods of Speed', which is an invaluable extra in the 2006 DVD package. I can see why as this unassuming eccentric with MacGyver-level ingenuity is such a likable codger with his singular purpose of racing his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle during 'Speed Week' on the pitch white desolation of the Bonneville Speedway.Fortunately, Anthony Hopkins brings a great deal of heart to Munro and portrays this unique personality with economy and dexterity, even though his Munro-mimicking mumbled tones can make him hard to understand at times. The film follows his journey from Invercargill at the southern tip of New Zealand through the urban jungle of Hollywood to the wide expanses of the salt flats in Utah. It feels like four films combined into one with the first part establishing Munro's eccentricities and local celebrity relative to a watchful boy who lives next door and idolizes the old man. When Munro makes it to California, it becomes a bit like 'Crocodile Dundee' or any fish-out-of-water comedy with Munro surviving by his wits in spite of his inbred trust in people. The third part is a more standard road movie that echoes 'Transamerica' and 'The Motorcycle Diaries' for the stereotypical characters Munro runs into en route to Bonneville.The fourth and final part of the film is the best, as it converts into a Rocky-like episode in Munro's challenging quest to compete and his ultimate victory. Donaldson makes the four sections feel relatively seamless, though I feel he could have edited the second and third parts more given how the pacing starts to lag. There are also some contrived plot elements that could have been jettisoned entirely like the youthful motorcycle gang who switch from threatening hooligans to Munro's financial supporters or the sequence with Diane Ladd as a woman who shares his bed for a night. Other than the Vietnam War soldier talking positively about Agent Orange, the movie actually romanticizes the U.S. of the 1960's in a way that's quite refreshing.The race sequences near the end of the picture are powerfully executed. But it's really Hopkins who completely inhabits Munro and makes the whole movie work emotionally, and to his immense credit, he does it with a minimum of fuss. The DVD package is chock full of extras all due to the fact that Donaldson has so much passion about his subject. Beyond his original 1973 half-hour documentary on Munro, he lends expert commentary on an alternate track and is also the chief participant in the extensive 45-minute making-of featurette. There are also four deleted scenes plus a brief musical travelogue of New Zealand's Southland. The movie's theatrical run was shamefully limited last December, so hopefully the DVD package will give the movie the greater audience it deserves.",7,0,0,15 June 2006
Avatar," Cameron the Director Luckily Trumps Cameron the Screenwriter on His Dazzling Green-Friendly Epic
","As a director, James Cameron dazzles magnificently with his green-friendly 2009 mega-opus. As his first full-fledged feature since 'Titanic', it's a CGI-generated extravaganza of 3-D and motion-capture technologies that overwhelms the senses. Give him credit for making a film that runs an epic-length 162 minutes without a hint of a yawn in the visual execution. However, as a screenwriter, Cameron resorts to familiar clichés and often corny dialogue in this unwieldy amalgamation of 'Land of the Lost' and 'Dancing with Wolves'. Character development and original dialogue have never been his strong suits, and fortunately, these shortcomings are not as pronounced as they were with 'Titanic'. At the same time, I really wish he could have seen the benefit of a writing collaborator who could have made something more provocative out of the arresting science-fantasy premise and ultimately push this movie toward the echelon of being one for the ages.Set in 2154, the fanciful story focuses on Jake Scully, a paraplegic former Marine who has been recruited for a special mission by the U. S. Armed Forces because he's a genetic match for his dead identical twin. The mission is to Pandora, an earth-sized moon in orbit around a massive star, which gives life to minerals that the Earth needs after centuries of abuse and desecration. Pandora's native inhabitants deep in the planetary forest are the blue-skinned Na'vi, a race of slender, agile twelve-foot giants who are at one with their natural environment. In order for humans to connect with the Na'vi, avatars have been created from their DNA, which allows select humans to become Na'vi look-alikes on Pandora, while still being mind-controlled by the original humans wired up on the hovering ship. Physically, there is no difference between the avatars and the Na'vi, but their inner selves reflect a great divide in sensibilities and priorities of which only Scully seems to know how to traverse the deep spiritual chasm.From that premise comes the inevitable love story (Scully falls for the brave, soulful Neytiri) and of course, the equally inevitable showdown between the Na'vi and the increasingly aggressive military forces led by the gung-ho Colonel Miles Quaritch. The similarities between the peace-loving Na'vi and Native Americans are purely intentional down to the earthly wisdom and the yelping battle cries. Horses have been replaced with pterodactyl-like flying creatures with which the Na'vi connect through intriguingly sensual tubes of dancing cilia. There are other layers of allegory, but Cameron focuses more on the story's visceral thrills rather than bothering to elucidate the government's motivation behind the avatar program, especially since the program director, Dr. Grace Augustine, appears completely out of sync with the corporate-military brain trust almost from the outset. It's pretty clear that none of these nuances matter once the climactic battle occurs, a genuinely masterful sequence that brings the digital technology to a whole new level.For a movie like this to work, the characters are merely presented to support the action and supply a recognizable set of emotions which an audience doesn't have to think about. Toward that end, the cast is effective in a workman-like manner. Sam Worthington ('Terminator Salvation') plays Scully appropriately like a young Clint Eastwood type, never complicating the character more than Cameron allows. Zoe Saldaña's ('Star Trek') role consists primarily of digital performance capture since her character doesn't have a human counterpart. She lends a palpable voice to Neytiri even though the Na'vi facial expressions remind me of those of the aliens at the end of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Michelle Rodriguez ('Fast & Furious') is on the sidelines playing a too-cool Marine fighter pilot, and there are predictably villainous turns by Stephen Lang ('Last Exit to Brooklyn') as Quaritch and Giovanni Ribisi ('The Gift') as a corporate administrator pushing relentlessly for the mining operation. Sigourney Weaver, who starred in Cameron's 'Aliens' 23 years earlier, contributes a few, sassy scene-stealing scenes as Grace. James Horner's bombastic music score will sound familiar to 'Titanic' fans down to the treacly ballad sung Celine-style by Leona Lewis. Mauro Fiore's cinematography and the elaborate production design led by Rick Carter and Robert Stromberg reflect world-class work.",8,1,5,3 January 2010
The Artist," Dujardin is Extraordinary in a Silent Screen Tribute Made from the Heart
","To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinée idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in 'Sunset Boulevard', 'We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then.' And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a 'meet-cute' run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another 'meet-cute' run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard 'A Star Is Born' storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's 'Sunrise' and King Vidor's 'The Crowd' and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. Bérénice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as 'Singin' in the Rain'. By the way, that's Uggie who plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to Asta from 'The Thin Man' series. Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's 'Vertigo' score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not a film for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.",8,6,10,5 December 2011
Up," Human-Sized Pixar Adventure Impressively Balances Character Depth and Genuine Thrills
","I have to admit there are two reasons I took an immediate personal liking to Pixar's 2009 sure-fire contribution to the box office, the Emeryville studio's impressive computer-generated artistry reflecting the most dependable cash cow in the industry. The first is the unique casting of an Asian lead character, a cherubic, hyper-curious nine-year-old Japanese-American Wilderness Explorer stowaway named Russell. The second is the reference to Fenton's Creamery, which is a two-minute walk from my former home in Oakland. Beyond those two points is a surprisingly mature, sometimes melancholy comedy adventure that focuses on a 78-year-old protagonist whose self-proclaimed destiny is to visit a mythical place that he and his wife have dreamed about ever since they first met. Before the kids start moaning, you should also be aware that there are more than enough exotic animals, talking dogs, acts of aerial derring-do, and miscellaneous Indiana Jones-type thrills to counterbalance the film's more sentimental moments.Co-directed and scripted by Bob Peterson and Pete Docter, the movie opens during the Great Depression when a young, shy boy named Carl Fredricksen meets tomboyish Ellie in an abandoned house that she has turned into a clubhouse. They discover they are both aspiring adventurers who dream of meeting intrepid explorer Charles F. Muntz and going to Paradise Falls in South America. An impressively executed montage follows as we watch Carl and Ellie grow up, get married, and grow old together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes a solitary curmudgeon unwilling to sell his home, which is the same house where he met Ellie, amid the high-rises being built all around him. An unexpected altercation occurs after a construction worker accidentally knocks over Carl's mailbox. Forced to move into a retirement home, he hatches a plan to tie thousands of helium-filled balloons (a dazzling effect) to his house and float away to Paradise Falls. What he doesn't count on is the appearance of Russell on his porch early in the flight, and together, they face a series of adventures involving a large flightless bird in iridescent colors searching for her chicks, a lovable golden retriever named Dug who expresses his thoughts by way of a voice-activating collar, and Muntz himself, who has become a Captain Nemo-like figure deep in the jungle with his massive zeppelin.There is a refreshing emotional economy to the story. That's why the 96-minute film doesn't feel as ambitious as 'Ratatouille' or last year's 'WALL-E', but at the same time, there is a deeper emotional resonance in the dilemmas presented since they feel so human-sized. Even as the film becomes more formulaic in the second half, it maintains the limited perspective of its main character as the rudder. I feel that's the key difference between this and other more populated Pixar confections. The vocal work is terrific, especially since Ed Asner ('The Mary Tyler Moore Show') perfectly captures Carl's gruff exterior without resorting to cheap sentiment to reveal his vulnerability. Nine-year-old Jordan Nagai provides the right energetic bounce for Russell, while Christopher Plummer has a field day playing all the various shades of Muntz. Peterson himself does stellar vocal work as both Dug and the squeaky-voiced Alpha, the German shepherd leader of the dog pack. Younger children may be bored by the film's more deliberate pacing and even at the idea of cheering a septuagenarian, but the more patient ones will be well rewarded.The 2009 DVD is chock full of extras beginning with the obligatory short that that preceded screenings of the movie, 'Partly Cloudy', a charming concoction in which clouds fancifully give birth to animals. Another five-minute short focuses on Dug's misadventures. Several pieces deal with individual components of the film, for instance, each character's development from inception to on screen character, how Carl and Ellie's house evolved, and how all the balloons and Muntz's zeppelin came to being. There are alternate endings dealing with what to do with Muntz at the end, as well as one that expands on Carl and Ellie's backstory. Also included are an interesting making-of featurette, a documentary of the filmmakers' visit to the Tepuis Mountains in South America to research the film's overall design and storyline, a piece about composer Michael Giacchino's score, and the various trailers for the film.",9,0,0,17 December 2009
Departures," Lyrical Film About Finding Passion in an Unlikely Profession
","Without irony, there is a funereal grace to this 2009 dramedy, so much so that one can sometimes hear the distinct echoes of film master Yasujiro Ozu ('Tokyo Story') in director Yojiro Takita's subtle yet stately look at the business of preparing deceased bodies for their caskets. Ozu's influence can be felt most in the quietude of tone that reveals the inevitability of death with both grim humor and spiritual awakening. The film's lyricism rests on the mournful cello accompaniment of the protagonist, Daigo Kobayashi, a young cellist who finds himself jobless after his Tokyo-based orchestra is disbanded. Out of economic necessity, he and his sunny, supportive wife Mika move back to his late mother's house up north in Yamagata.As outlined in Kundo Koyama's somewhat methodical screenplay, the story focuses on the challenge Daigo faces in finding one's place in life, no matter how dubious it may seem to others. Daigo, bereft of his passion, answers a job ad involving 'departures', which leads him to believe the company is a travel agency. However, he quickly realizes the two-person operation is actually about preparing bodies for burial, ritually cleansing and cloaking them while the mourners watch. Initially aghast, he is convinced by the taciturn owner Mr. Sasaki that he is ideal for the role of assistant and offers him the job. He has to fight his own prejudices as well as others about the supposed unseemliness of his profession, including Mika, who finds out her husband's new profession and pronounces him unclean. Daigo, however, realizes he has found his passion in the pre-burial ceremony, and Sasaki teaches him the ropes in a way that recalls Juzo Itami's beloved 1985 comedy, 'Tampopo'.Former boy-band singer Masahiro Motoki is genuinely affecting as Daigo, while Ryoko Hirosue brings a surprising layer of complexity to the perennially sunny Mika. The deadpan Tsutomu Yamazaki makes Sasaki the film's key gravitational element with a minimum of effort, while Kimiko Yo shows an offbeat quality as his office manager Yuriko. The cinematography by Takeshi Hamada is top-notch with some memorable images offered along the way (like Daigo playing his cello on a hilltop), and Joe Hisaishi's ('Kikujiro') music score allows dramatic sweep without getting too epic. On the downside, the film runs too long at 130 minutes, and there are moments when the comedy is played too broadly and the sentiment laid on too thick. Still, the movie shows Japanese cinema still exudes a unique identity, and there is global vitality still in that country's film industry. A brief interview with Takita is the major bonus on the 2010 DVD.",8,10,11,13 March 2010
Inside Man," Spike, a Sharp Cast and Crafty Script Bring Dimension to Tense Hostage Drama
","It's good to see filmmaker Spike Lee come back to form with this highly entertaining popcorn movie that transcends the tense hostage crisis portrayed with a clever plot of psychological gamesmanship and duplicity. At first, the film feels like it's going to be a new millennium update of Sidney Lumet's 1975 classic, 'Dog Day Afternoon', complete with Terence Blanchard's jazzy, 1970's-sounding score. Lee, however, spices the story with his own sensibilities around urban survival and post-9/11 racial tensions, and the movie benefits greatly from the perspective of a director not known for such predictable genre pictures. While it runs a bit long at 125 minutes, there is so much zigzag to the proceedings that the length is forgivable.Impressively written by first-time screenwriter Russell Gewirtz, the plot meticulously unfolds on a precise, need-to-know basis as it focuses on the mano-a-mano game between coolly confident criminal Dalton Russell and cynical NYPD detective Keith Frazier after Russell and his crew hold up a Lower Manhattan bank and keep fifty hostages at gunpoint. This is no standard good-versus-evil melodrama, as Gewirtz and Lee give both characters a lot of intriguing texture which make them fascinating adversaries in an unlikely search for a common bond. Audaciously, Lee chooses not to spotlight so much on the suspense elements of the tense situation at hand since the movie includes flash-forward interviews with freed hostages. Rather, the film is far more involved with the characters' motivations and what they are willing to do to move toward resolution.An additional wrinkle is the bank chairman Arthur Case, who is worried about securing the confidential contents of his safe-deposit box once the robbery is underway. At this point, he hires Madeline White, a coolly calculating, designer-outfitted power broker willing to negotiate with Russell to get the box. How all four characters dance around each other is the primary pleasure to be derived from the movie, as one keeps guessing what each will do to get to his or her objective. Moreover, Lee's trademark touches are everywhere from the unexpected sparks of comedy - some piercing in their political incorrectness but no less funny - to the artificial backward zooms that make characters look like they are on conveyor belts to the idiosyncratic behavior of the hostages.Casting is just about ideal here. It's no surprise that longtime Lee muse Denzel Washington is terrific as Frazier, showing the character's flaws, ambition and moxie with maximum fluency. Clive Owen has the most cryptic role as Russell, but he manages to exude supreme confidence and a conflicted conscience with minimal fuss. Leave it to Lee to capitalize on Jodie Foster's inherently chilly intellect and subvert it to make the patronizing White a curiously ambiguous and utterly fascinating figure. There is nice supporting work by Christopher Plummer expertly shifting between benign and treacherous as Case, Willem Dafoe surprisingly non-villainous as the head of the SWAT Team, and especially British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor a completely convincing New Yorker as Frazier's enthusiastic partner. There is a nice twist at the end, but Gewirtz's script makes it satisfying within the context of the entire plot. This is a deft, character-driven thriller most welcome during the typical late winter/early spring movie-going doldrums.",8,2,3,2 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Some Nice Visual Flourishes in a Muddled Adaptation of Dan Brown's Religion-Fueled Thriller
","The dense plot complexities of Dan Brown's novel around the pursuit of the Holy Grail made it a thoroughly entertaining read, but the unending plethora of detail looks contrived and ultimately predictable when translated on screen, especially if you have already read the book. Having Ron Howard helm this 2006 production certainly assures a mainstream-oriented consciousness would predominate, but unfortunately, it also means a lack of pervasive invention when it comes to conveying the dramatic twists and turns of Brown's story. Moreover, Akiva Goldsman's screenplay requires scenes of lengthy exposition which Howard tries mightily to offset with fantasy visualizations of speculative religious history. However, the core problem is that the filmmakers' diligent attempts at remaining faithful to the book make the movie feel overstuffed within its lengthy running time of 149 minutes.For those who don't know, the focus of the plot is on the hunt for the secrets hidden by the Priory of Sion including the Holy Grail. Some want to protect it, some want to expose it, and some want to destroy it. Harvard professor Robert Langdon and Paris police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, equipped with secrets shared by the murdered curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniére, are a step ahead of the police, assassins, and churchmen in full pursuit. After what looks to be a standard murder mystery set-up, the story finally gains momentum in the second hour with the creatively handled explanation for the hidden meanings behind Da Vinci's 'Last Supper'. A historical labyrinth is presented piecemeal, incorporating the origins of the gospels and the assimilation of pagan rituals and symbols into the early church's practices, all of which showcases the revelatory role of Mary Magdalene in scripture. While Langdon is the nominal protagonist, Sophie emerges as the pivotal character here, especially as they recognize how her past provides keys to vital information that could change history and religion.Casting is a challenge here since the actors are really there merely to support the convoluted storyline. As dazzling as she has been in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films, Audrey Tautou of 'Amelie' fame is comparatively constrained as Sophie, though she also seems a bit burdened by the verbosity of the role. As Langdon, a lank-haired Tom Hanks is more problematic as his versatility is sorely tested by playing an academically-oriented sleuth. Stealing scenes easily is Ian McKellan as erudite, Grail-obsessed Sir Leigh Teabing. On the other hand, Paul Bettany merely exhibits a fairly one-note malignancy as the murdering albino monk Silas. Also left to their own elliptical devices are Jean Reno as the secretive Captain Fache and Alfred Molina as Opus Dei's designated kingpin, Bishop Sringarosa. The film's plodding pace is offset somewhat by Salvatore Totino's superb cinematography, especially at the Louvre and other European locales.Thinking back on the film, I keep wondering if it could have benefited more from a fresher director like Darren Aronofsky or Christopher Nolan, or even Quentin Tarantino's pulpish approach since the kinetic thriller elements are ripe enough for his cinematic audacity. The two-disc 2006 DVD set is certainly full of extras. Disc One contains the movie and several previews for upcoming theatrical releases. Disc Two has all the extras, which consist mainly of ten featurettes on various aspects of the production and its translation from Brown's hugely successful novel. The best of the bunch is 'The Codes of the Da Vinci Code', which has Howard and Brown explain much of the symbolism used specifically in the film.",6,1,2,23 November 2006
Thor," Combination of Norse Mythology, CGI Effects and Dry Humor Makes for a Comic Book Epic Worth a Look
","Among the Marvel Comics characters that have come to the silver screen, the biggest stretch to the imagination may be this elaborate 2011 fantasy adventure because the story is rooted in Norse mythology rather than technology and science fiction like 'Iron Man' or 'Spider-man'. That's probably why producer Kevin Feige chose actor Kenneth Branagh to direct since his erudite touch, showcased in his numerous Shakespearean adaptations, is what the epic film needs to ground the more human elements into something more relatable to the audience. That's no small feat considering the amount of exposition needed at the beginning to give a brief history of Asgard where its king Odin has been waging war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim led by their malevolent king Laufey. Odin has raised two sons, Thor and Loki, opposites in disposition as the arrogant Thor prepares to ascend the throne while Loki seethes in jealousy. Thor's fate is interrupted when the Frost Giants attempt to seize the Casket of Ancient Winters.Seeking revenge, Thor recruits his band of warriors to enter battle in Jotunheim, an act of defiance which causes Odin to banish Thor to Earth where he becomes mortal without his all-powerful hammer Mjolnir, which is stuck in a rock in the middle of the New Mexican desert. There he meets scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig and their assistant Darcy, where the movie diverges into a fish-out-of-water tale, while back in Asgard, Loki learns of his true identity as the son of Laufey and consequently attempts to take over the throne as Odin lies in a deep sleep. There are plenty of battle sequences to tie the story together and keep the momentum going, including an impressive, darkly lit fight with the Frost Giants and a classic 'High Noon'-style confrontation with a nearly indestructible automaton. However, in the screenplay by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, what really makes the movie great fun is its sense of humor during the New Mexico scenes, certainly enough to offset the more austere, good-versus-evil drama occurring back in Asgard.Ideally fitting the imposing physical dimensions of the title role, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth plays the stalwart, uncomplicated hero with aplomb. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston brings out the villain's veiled smarminess with ease. In danger of overexposure by now (this is the fourth movie of hers I've seen in four months), Natalie Portman manages to make the most of a wafer-thin role as the plucky Jane as we are meant to believe she is a master astrophysicist. Her comic interplay with Kat Demmings, amusingly acidic as ever as Darcy, provides nice relief from the action. Anthony Hopkins isn't really challenged much by the role of Odin, but he brings his trademark authority nonetheless. Idris Elba is hardly recognizable as a stoic sentry, while Rene Russo is given little to do as Odin's wife Frigga. As Selvig, Stellan Skarsgård gets to play the unadventurous voice of reason on Earth, although he has an intriguing encounter with Samuel L. Jackson after the credits. All the production values and CGI effects are what you would expect from a $150 million film, and surprisingly, Branagh manages to tell the story in less time than 'Bridesmaids'.",7,1,3,17 May 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Supremely Attractive Leads on a Crash-and-Burn Marital Obstacle Course
","This clanging, crashing 2005 superstar coupling seems to aspire to be a new millennium retake on John Huston's 'Prizzi's Honor' and Danny DeVito's 'War of the Roses', but it turns out to be a gadget-oriented action flick with grand pretensions about how a seemingly ideal couple handle marital discord. It certainly helps that director Doug Liman (who did a superb job on the underrated 'Go' in 1999) has cast two ludicrously attractive leads whose intertwining personal lives would eventually overshadow their on screen shenanigans. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in the title roles, John and Jane Smith, and things start promisingly with Simon Kinberg's scattershot screenplay setting them up as typically upscale married suburbanites who both try to manage professional demands in light of a sagging marriage.As it turns out, they are both highly paid assassins who of course, are hired to rub the other out. This revelation is hardly surprising, but I didn't know it would signal a significant decrease in creativity for the rest of the film even as the fireworks get more explosive. The special effects and swift gunplay can be dazzling but are left on overkill mode, but by far, the worst scene is an overextended fight scene between the two that eschews its black comedy elements in favor of a commercial for domestic violence. But even this would be forgivable if Liman and Kinberg could figure out how to end the story. It seems to breathe on high-octane but strangely remains devoid of any real suspense and then abruptly stops with no real denouement.Pacing is a major problem with the movie as it feels like it goes on for far too long. Luckily, the stars have enough charisma to maintain some interest throughout. Both often lend a nice comic spark to their performances, though neither knows how to convey irony without an irritating wink-wink manner. As Eddie, Mr. Smith's cohort, Vince Vaughan seems to be the only one who seems completely adept at black comedy. Kerry Washington, on the other hand, makes virtually no impression as Mrs. Smith's task force colleague. Even though he shows off an impressive set of six-pack abs, Pitt seems particularly lost at times, but Jolie manages to dominate the pairing with her stunning beauty and take-no-prisoners attitude. It's too bad the story serves merely as a vehicle for their mutual posturing.",4,2,4,11 August 2006
The Departed," Scorsese Back in Top Form with a Stunning Cast for an Unbelievably Taut Thriller
","Filmmaker extraordinaire Martin Scorsese finally brings back the dazzling intensity of his earlier films such as 'Taxi Driver' and 'Goodfellas' with his latest offering, a driving Americanized update of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller, 'Infernal Affairs'. Adapted with intelligence by screenwriter William Monahan, the now Boston-based story focuses in parallel fashion on two young police detectives who are leading deceptive existences, one is sharing the department's goings-on with local mob boss Frank Costello, while the other is undercover inside Costello's organization and secretly informing the police of their plans. The informant is Colin Sullivan, who impresses his supervisors with his savvy and unfettered ambition. The other detective is coiled-to-the bone Billy Costigan recruited by Captain Queenan and his hot-headed assistant, Sgt. Dignam, to infiltrate Costello's gang.Both detectives are loners in one way or the other because they are moles always looking over their shoulder lest they get caught and killed. The movie dexterously goes back and forth between the characters with the linchpins being not only Costello but also a department psychiatrist named Madolyn. She becomes Sullivan's girlfriend and also Costigan's doctor. As you can guess, the destinies of Costigan and Sullivan intertwine like a tightening vise but not without several interrelated story lines battling for our attention. One of the key reasons that this approach works so effectively is the kinetic, time-jumping editing by longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, infusing Scorsese's masterful direction and the adept unraveling-by-necessity character development.A stellar cast is in peak form here starting with Leonardo DiCaprio's riveting turn as Costigan. Under Scorsese's tutelage for the third time, he has finally matured into a role that capitalizes on his visceral intensity and delivers easily the best work I have seen him do. If Matt Damon's solid work is slightly less electrifying (with a vocal resemblance to the southie he played in 'Good Will Hunting'), it's primarily because the character is designed to be unapologetically covert and a braggadocio to boot. Of course, Jack Nicholson is getting the lion's share of the media attention because he is back in a showy role as Costello. Whether making subtly threatening non-sequiturs to the hapless in his neighborhood or sharing Costello's path to success with his young cohorts, Nicholson blazes without resorting to the scenery chewing we have seen in past roles.As Madolyn, indie darling Vera Farmiga brings an unexpectedly idiosyncratic quality to what could have been the standard girl-support stereotype, bringing not only vulnerability but a guarded sense of adventurousness to her character. In supporting roles, Martin Sheen is solid as Queenan, but it's the rapid-fire profanity spewing out of Marc Wahlberg as Dignam that remains more memorable. Ray Winstone brings his trademark menace to Costello's amusingly named henchman, Mr. French, and Alec Baldwin shines in the smallish role of department head Ellerby. It should come as no surprise that there are moments of shocking violence as the movie culminates into a series of scenes quite graphic in nature yet thematically resonant to the core story. Scorsese has thankfully let go of the wearying pretensions of his last two movies, 'The Aviator' and 'Gangs of New York', to produce an incredibly taut, character-driven police thriller. It's aces for this kind of work.",9,0,0,11 October 2006
The Holiday," Three Out of Four Stars Charm in an Overlong, Formulaic Comedy That Gets It Right Half the Time
","After about 45 minutes of overdone laborious set-up, at least half of this overlong, dual-track 2006 romantic comedy takes flight, while the other half remains stubbornly contrived. More problems occur when three of the four principals show an affinity for screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers' brand of breezy but manipulative farce, while the fourth seems like he doesn't belong in the movie at all. A calculated throwback to golden-era Hollywood in more ways than one, the stacked-deck premise is simple enough - two women, Amanda in LA and Iris in England, both unlucky in love, decide impulsively to switch houses during the Christmas holiday with the intent of celebrating their emancipation from men bad for them.Amanda's side of the story is the more pleasurable of the two because ironically, it doesn't veer too much from formula. At first, Cameron Diaz's performance as Amanda seems heavily exaggerated, but once she meets Jude Law, very Grant-like (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) as Iris' smooth-talking brother Graham, she settles down as he is the epitome of the Sensitive Man for reasons that become clear soon enough. Probably because the actors are such striking people, their chemistry is palpable and unforced, as their characters pretend not to fall in love when it is obvious they are. Iris' LA adventure does not fare as well. Although Kate Winslet is dependably winning as Iris, her natural vibrancy and beauty seem at odds with her role as a doormat to an ex-boyfriend who keeps stringing her along.The stateside romance is also more convoluted as it involves her almost-instant friendship with an aged Hollywood screenwriter who refuses to be the subject of an industry tribute. It's nice to see 91-year old Eli Wallach play the curmudgeonly writer with old-world charm and a wry sense of humor, but the subplot feels forced as an excuse to provide a more direct connection to the Hollywood film classics. Even worse, Jack Black is completely out of his element as Miles, a sardonic film composer already in a shaky relationship with an actress. That Iris and Miles get together seems more like an afterthought since there is zero chemistry between Winslet and Black. The resulting imbalance between the two story lines adds to the interminable feel of the movie's 136-minute running time.Even though there are a handful of funny sight gags (mostly spotlighting Diaz) and a clever three-way phone conversation with Iris at the center, the film is burdened by its leisurely pacing and Meyers' indulgent approach to the material. Thanks to Jon Hutman's picture-postcard sets, especially of the English countryside, and Hans Zimmer's appropriately romantic score, it certainly feels like the Hollywood confection that she was trying to replicate. The 2007 DVD has a robust commentary track courtesy of Meyers and several of her crew like Zimmer, Hutman and editor Joe Hutshing but featuring none of the stars. There is also an eighteen-minute making-of featurette, pretty standard, along with a number of previews for current and upcoming theatrical releases like 'Spider-Man 3'.",5,2,4,17 March 2007
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," An 'After Hours' Revamp as a Smart, Affecting Teen Comedy with an Indie Rock Beat
","I was all prepared to trivialize this movie for what I expected to be another hipster teen comedy taking advantage of the success of 'Juno' and 'Superbad', especially given that Michael Cera is the co-star of all three films. However, this 2008 movie is really a quirky, sharply played variation on Martin Scorsese's 1985 'After Hours', this time focusing on two misfit teens, kindred spirits when it comes to their taste in music, who find themselves traipsing through New York's indie rock scene for one hilariously sleepless night. Their chemistry is predestined by their names, a tribute to the scintillating married couple played by William Powell and Myrna Loy in 'The Thin Man' series of golden-era Hollywood classics. Their nocturnal misadventures are driven by Nora's search for her hard-partying best friend Caroline, who escaped in a fit of paranoia out of a van, while gay-band bassist Nick is nursing a broken heart over Tris, the shallow, man-baiting ex-girlfriend who continues to play him.If the movie simply limited itself to the odyssey, it would have been satisfying enough for its intended audience, but what director Peter Sollett and screenwriter Lorene Scarfaria have done to transcend the genre is make the lead characters' mutual passion for music the focal emotional point of their growing attraction for one another. Nick keeps sending Tris idiosyncratic mix CDs (like 'Road to Closure, Vol. 12'), which she tosses into the trash only to provide Nora an opportunity to retrieve them and listen to reflections of his broken heart. Neither is able to articulate their feelings otherwise, as shown by their comically bumbling conversations, so the music plays a vital part of their burgeoning relationship. I still don't find Cera terribly versatile, but he has been resourceful in using his now-familiar screen persona of a dweebish sad-sack in suitably well-turned material.Familiar as Catherine Keener's edgy but ultimately caring daughter in 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin', Kat Dennings comes into her own as Norah, capturing the insecurity of a character who leaves herself wide open to the pain inflicted by those around her. There are scene-stealing turns by Ari Graynor as the constantly drunken Caroline, Alexis Dziena as self-appointed goddess Tris, and Rafi Gavron and Aaron Yoo as Nick's club-friendly gay bandmates. There are a couple of 'Saturday Night Live' cast cameos thrown in - 'newscaster' Seth Meyers as the horned-up passenger mistaking Nick's yellow Yugo as a cab (with Scarfaria as his girlfriend) and Andy Samberg as a bum lurking on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral. The alt-rock music is appropriately underground to fit the story. There really isn't that much more to the movie since the fate of these characters is clear from the outset.It's simply that the film has good energy fueled by the constant barrage of music and smart dialogue to fill the love story that emerges from their long night's journey into morning. There are a surprising number of extras with the 2009 DVD starting with two separate commentaries, the first with Sollett, Cera, Dennings and Graynor discussing the production details, and the second with Sollett and the source novel's writers, Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, in which they discuss more of the story and screen adaptation. There are deleted scenes and outtakes, some quite funny but understandably excised, and an amusingly off-kilter Nick & Norah puppet show by Dennings. Rounding out the extras are storyboards, photo galleries, Graynor's video diary, a music video, and a funny faux-interview with Cera and Dennings.",7,0,0,13 September 2009
Wedding Crashers," Wiseguy Rapport Sharpened for Funny, Post-Frat House Comedy With an Original Premise
","A great premise drives a hybrid comedy that mixes the 'buddy' picture with 'American Pie' hijinks and more conventional romantic comedy elements. It doesn't always work, but director David Dobkin and co-screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher get a lot of mileage out of the idea of two horndog divorce lawyers who crash weddings in their native D.C. area to lure sexually available women. Originating from a Big Kahuna of wedding crashing (who shows up late in the movie to offer an updated approach), the strategy of the partners in crime, John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, is to abide by their incessant rulebook and show up at events like they were invited and be prepared to present themselves with creatively concocted bios as tangible connections to either the bride or the groom.It all sounds like a prime opportunity for tasteless, vulgar humor and at various points, it is, but the film can also be surprisingly clever and even insightful. The set-up is actually more interesting than the ensuing plot, which relies much more on convention as it focuses on the high-profile nuptials of a US senator's daughter and the predictable romantic complications therein. As the smoother of the two, Owen Wilson plays John with his trademark glibness and laid-back manner. In romancing the senator's middle daughter Claire, he even manages to eke out sincerity in measured doses, although he lacks the gravitas to be a truly effective romantic lead. As Jeremy, whether egging John about his exposure to the available breasts of the senator's wife, fending off the advances of Claire's sister and brother, or confessing profusely to a somewhat titillated minister, Vince Vaughn is a motor-mouthed riot, as he suffers an escalating number of indignities in order to keep up the guises while John woos Claire. Together, they are like a post-frat house version of Crosby and Hope in one of their Road movies.Christopher Walken plays the strait-laced senator with just a hint of his potential lunacy, though I was wishing he could break free more like he does in his 'Saturday Night Live' skits. In a role that begs for the effortless savvy of Joan Allen or Jean Smart, the still-beautiful Jane Seymour just seems sadly misused as his wife. The current 'it' girl, Rachel McAdams has the presence of mind and spirit to make more of the lackluster role of romantically confused Claire than there really is, though it's Isla Fisher who steals her scenes with abandon as Claire's alternately smitten and psychotic baby sister Gloria. Truth be told, the film starts to drag in the home stretch as it takes its time toward the inevitable conclusion, but the cleverly tasteless take on funerals is a nice jab. Regardless, Wilson and especially Vaughn, with his non-stop stream-of-consciousness wit, generate enough goodwill and laughs to compensate for the occasional lapses along the way.The 'Uncorked' DVD package is somewhat disappointing. It contains two versions of the film, the original theatrical one and another billed as 'uncorked', though the difference amounts to a few additional moments and lines here and there. There are two commentary tracks  an informative albeit by-the-numbers one by Dobkin and a looser though rather lazy and low-key one by Wilson and Vaughn. Neither is essential. There are four deleted scenes, including a karaoke scene with the two guys endlessly singing Nena's '99 Luftballoons'. The extras just prove that the final film was edited correctly when it was released.",7,0,0,18 January 2006
Burlesque," A Well Preserved Cher Keeps This Predictable Pile of Showbiz Clichés Afloat
","Despite an eye-catching veneer that appears like a stylistic cross between Bob Fosse ('Cabaret') and Rob Marshall ('Chicago'), this 2010 backstage musical written and directed by former actor Steve Antin is pure Hollywood hokum repackaged for the 'American Idol' generation. Rather than being remotely provocative in subject or treatment, the film is actually a slapdash, new-millennium update of '42nd Street' in which the classic 1933 movie's most famous line, 'You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!', applies perfectly here. The youngster in this case is pop star Christina Aguilera in her feature film debut as Ali Rose, a plucky Iowa waitress described scabrously by an alcohol-fueled rival named Nikki as a 'slut with mutant lungs'. Your reaction to that comment will depend on how much you like Aguilera's throaty, blues-inspired holler of a singing voice. You would have to enjoy it a lot to sit through the several production numbers she performs in the movie.The story is trite. Ali leaves Iowa for LA on a bus and faces exactly one day of unemployment during our current economic malaise when she discovers the Burlesque Lounge on the Sunset Strip. Talking her way into a waitress job thanks to sympathetic bartender Jack, she desperately tries to persuade the club's owner Tess that she belongs on the stage with all the leggy, lip-synching dancers. A dancer's unplanned pregnancy gives Ali the chance to audition and take her place, and then conveniently, Tess picks Ali to substitute for a drunken Nikki to take the lead one night. Out of spite, Nikki cuts off the recorded music at which point Ali sings in her own voice. In perhaps the most patronizing scene, the awestruck reactions of customers and colleagues insure her immediate stardom and Nikki's vengeful wrath. As Ali's star ascends, she is also caught in a romantic triangle between Jack and a wealthy opportunist named Marcus.Meanwhile, Tess faces the prospect of losing her club despite the good fortune brought forth by Ali's emerging fame. If you can't figure out the rest of the by-the-numbers plot, clearly you don't get out much. Even though the film is a showcase for Aguilera, it is really Cher who anchors it with her dry insouciance and sheer professionalism. At 64, she looks great in a highly cosmeticized way, but it's really her natural likability and her two standout numbers that linger in the memory. The first is a teasing nod to 'Cabaret' called 'Welcome to Burlesque' and the second is a Diane Warren-penned power ballad, 'You Haven't Seen the Last of Me', which she sings with the same emotional fervor Jennifer Hudson did with her big 'Dreamgirls' number, 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going'. Aguilera acquits herself well as Ali. It's just that the role is such a predictable set of clichés when she's offstage.As Tess' loyal confidante, Stanley Tucci plays almost exactly the same role he played in 'The Devil Wears Prada' and in the same wry manner that works just as well here. Cam Gigandet as Jack and Eric Dane as Marcus aren't given much opportunity to make memorable impressions. Kristen Bell has a few choice moments showing her talons as Nikki. Shallow entertainment for those in the mood for it. Extras are plentiful but not indispensable on the 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray. There is a talky but none too insightful commentary track from Antin, an alternate opening sequence that extends the Iowa setting, a five-minute blooper reel, and footage of six uncut musical numbers. The Blue-Ray additionally offers a five-part making-of featurette for true fans of the film.",5,1,1,7 March 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," A Cinematic Masterwork About Human Fallibility in a World of Wearying Intolerance
","Having just read Charles Shields' biography of Harper Lee, 'Mockingbird', and re-read her classic (and only) novel for at least the third time, I was able recently to watch Robert Mulligan's 1962 classic film adaptation with fresh eyes, and the 2005 Legacy Series Edition DVD fortunately contains a pristine print transfer and a bundle of extras that make repeated viewings more than worthwhile. Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, 'Boo', whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as 'Boo' in an unexpected heroic act.Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as 'Boo' Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voice-over for the grown-up Scout neé Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, 'Fearful Symmetry', filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's 'A Conversation with Gregory Peck', directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute. Providing revealing glimpses of the private man, it originally aired on PBS's 'American Masters' series.",10,0,2,17 September 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Still Stirring Wartime Adventure and Compelling Psychological Drama Exhibit David Lean at His Peak
","After years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's 'Summertime', master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate 'Lawrence of Arabia', but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of 'Colonel Bogey March' is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel story lines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two story lines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exude natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then added a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to 'Summertime', Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, 'The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai', produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden. Director John Milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short.",10,70,80,1 June 2006
Downfall," Hitler's Last Hours in Excruciating, Desultory Detail
","Spending over 2 ½ hours witnessing the last hours of Adolf Hitler's life doesn't sound like an exhilarating time, and director Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2004 German-language film has to be one of the more deflating experiences I've had at the movies recently. But that's not to say there aren't moments of great power and passionate, truthful performances. In fact, it feels like quite a breakthrough to have the story actually done in German as it seems targeted to the German populace versus the rest of us interested only in the historical details from the outside. Regardless, the overall effect is enervating from the intentionally methodical approach the filmmaker takes in chronicling the waning moments of the Third Reich. The focal point obviously is the Führer, and Bruno Ganz is powerfully persuasive in alternating between gentility and irrationality but all the while descending into a palpable dementia. It's a vividly rendered performance, which captures all his seeping paranoia and despicable philosophies. The trick for Hirschbiegel and Ganz is not to humanize him to the point of having the viewer feel compassion for this mass murderer because even sixty years after the end of World War II, he continues to exert a powerful fascination. We are intrigued by the psychological forces that gave rise to German National Socialism and shaped its leader, and they successfully pull off the queasy balance of presenting a man who -- before he commits suicide -- speaks with pride about his annihilation of the Jews in Europe. For Hitler and his immediate supporters, the idea of facing the opposition and accounting for those war crimes was unthinkable.Despite Hitler's dominance in the story, it is mostly viewed from the perspective of his personal secretary Traudl Junge, who was just 22 when the Führer hired her in 1942. For example, the anticipated suicide scene is done behind a closed door as Junge realizes what is happening from the outside. Alexandra Maria Lara portrays Junge with an open naïveté that makes her blind devotion understandable to a great degree, but her character is not interesting enough to hold our interest throughout. Consequently, there is a gallery of characters, Hitler's inner circle, who experiences the end of the war on their own terms. Of course, there is Eva Braun, Hitler's infamous mistress whom he married in the last moments of their lives. As portrayed ebulliently by Juliane Köhler, she is a caretaker for the whole bunker, attempting to get everyone's spirits up with liquor, tabletop dancing and the occasional walk outside for a cigarette. She gradually reveals a more tortured soul worrying about her pregnant sister and confessing her increasing discomfort but remaining steadfast in her devotion to the Führer. But the most fascinating and frightening character is Magda Goebbels, portrayed with a cold veneer of calm by Corinna Harfouch. In certain ways, it's an even gutsier performance than Ganz's. Her real-life character's dedication to the Führer reaches such pathological levels that in the movie's most shocking scene, she forces ampoules of cyanide into the mouths of her sleeping children rather than subject them to the grim prospect of 'a world without National Socialism'.Aside from these elements and the shock-inducing recreation of the bombings, the movie is rather dull visually lacking, for example, the panache that Jean-Pierre Jeunet displays in his recent 'A Very Long Engagement'. Mostly, it has the unimaginative feel of a TV-movie, or given its excessive length, more accurately a miniseries completely driven by dialogue often focused on military tactics and sometimes on the human plight involved. The downbeat tone is relentless, as Hirschbiegel shifts his story between the increasingly desperate military situation above ground in Berlin and the oddly eccentric situation in the bunker underneath it. Perhaps the film's greatest value is the implicit absolution of the German people in blindly following Hitler. When he refuses to express compassion for the civilians, and declares that the Germans have brought their fate upon themselves, the movie is conveying that ordinary Germans were as much victims of Nazism as anyone else, a point raised and refuted 44 years ago in Stanley Kramer's 'Judgment at Nuremberg'. It's a valid perspective but unfortunately it's buried in an overlong and desultory film.",4,6,24,14 December 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Whitaker's Towering Portrayal of the Mesmerizing Ugandan Dictator Lifts This Historical Fiction
","Forest Whitaker's ferociously charismatic turn as Idi Amin so dominates this intense historical fiction that it is honestly difficult to pay attention to anything else in this 2006 political thriller. Even though he is definitively the emotional locus, he is intriguingly not the protagonist of the story. That role belongs to young James McAvoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, a precocious Scottish doctor who ventures to Uganda to satisfy his need for adventure after graduating medical school. By happenstance, Garrigan is called upon to help Amin with a minor sprain after his private car plows into a cow. Impressed by the young man's lack of hesitancy to take action, Amin appoints Garrigan to be his personal physician, a post that seduces the impressed doctor into the Ugandan dictator's political inner circle and extravagant lifestyle.Scottish director Kevin MacDonald brings his extensive documentary film-making skills to the fore here, as he creates a most realistic-feeling atmosphere in capturing the oppressive Uganda of the 1970's. Helping considerably with this image are the vibrant color contrasts in Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and the propulsive action induced by Justine Wright's sharp editing. Screenwriters Peter Morgan (who also wrote 'The Queen') and Jeremy Brock have developed a sharply delineated character study of Amin, who evolves from a magnetic leader giving hope to his people to a scarifying tyrant conducting murders on an imaginable scale (at least until the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur). It is impossible to over-praise Whitaker's towering performance here. He conveys the dictator's playfulness as well as his unmitigated rage moving from simmering to full boil with a power that is at once bravura and subtle. His relationship with the fictionalized Garrigan turns out to be the plot's essential pivot point, although the contrast between the two can be almost too extreme at times.While McAvoy admirably captures the boyish naiveté of Garrigan, the character is drawn out in rather broad strokes that make his self-delusion all the more contrived as the story progresses. To intensify the political upheaval portrayed, the plot takes a melodramatic turn into an adulterous affair and even folds in the infamous 1976 Entebbe hijacking incident to illustrate Garrigan's increasingly precarious situation. It's all exciting and even downright brutalizing toward the end, but it also starts to feel a bit too Hollywood in execution. Kerry Washington shows genuine versatility as Amin's cloistered third wife Kay, while Simon McBurney oozes cynical suspicion with ease as a British operative. A convincingly Brit-accented Gillian Anderson makes her few scenes count as a weary clinic worker who proves to have better instincts than Garrigan. But see the movie for Whitaker's magnificent work. He is that good.",8,104,118,2 February 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Life and Art Clash for a Sad Sack Tax Auditor in a Kaufman-Lite Fantasy Dramedy
","Put-upon protagonist Harold Crick appears to exist in the same absurdist universe as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's off-center characters in 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation'. It is not Kaufman, however, who penned the creative script here but rather Zach Helm, whose fertile imagination drives this fatalistic 2006 dramedy. Directed with a nice contemporary panache by the increasingly versatile Marc Forster, the fantasy-driven film focuses on Harold's sadly mundane existence as an emotionally unavailable, anal-retentive tax auditor for the IRS.One morning, he hears a particularly erudite voice describe his life with real-time precision and zealous literacy. Harold desperately seeks out the source, first by speaking with the unctuous office psychiatrist and then by eliciting the help of an eccentric literature professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert. It turns out to be the voice of author Karen Eiffel, who has been undergoing writer's block for nearly a decade, a situation alarming enough to her publishing company that they send a foolproof assistant to ensure a final manuscript is delivered. In the meantime, Harold finds himself drawn to a high-spirited, non-conformist bakery owner named Ana in the middle of a testy, confrontational audit. But the more serious problem is that Harold is the main character in Eiffel's nearly completed novel, and she always kills off her heroes in her books.How Helm and Forster resolve this fanciful dilemma is the best part of the movie because they build the far-fetched convolutions toward a satisfying emotional resonance. If the rest of the set-up doesn't reach the dizzying high-wire act of Kaufman's best work, the film still has genuinely clever plot turns and moments of creative momentum. In a reflective seriocomic performance, Will Ferrell proves he has the acting chops to handle the gravity of Harold's dilemma, even if he has to act constrained most of the time. Emma Thompson manages to capture Eiffel's angst-ridden reclusive nature with her familiar sardonic aplomb.As Ana, Maggie Gyllenhaal finally has a role worthy of her ripened, effortlessly coquettish persona. Playing a more deadpan variation of his bumbling sleuth in 'I Heart Huckabees', Dustin Hoffman nicely underplays Hilbert. Queen Latifah has relatively little to do as Eiffel's assistant Penny, but she does it with authority. With this accomplished film, Forster really shows a flair for balancing the whimsical with the tangible that drive Helm's charmingly inventive story.",7,0,1,12 December 2006
The Reader," Haunting Post-Holocaust Drama Falls Short Despite Solid Work from Winslet and Kross
","If you mixed Robert Mulligan's 'Summer of '42' with Stanley Kramer's 'Judgment at Nuremberg', you could likely come up with a melodramatic hybrid as lugubrious as this 2008 drama about post-WWII moral ambiguity and obsession. Adapted by playwright David Hare ('Plenty') from Bernhard Schlink's critically acclaimed 1995 novel, the film directed by Stephen Daldry ('The Hours') offers the veneer of an important subject in reflecting upon the years-later psychological aftermath of the Holocaust. The source book deals with the difficulties which subsequent generations have in comprehending the scope and magnitude of the war crimes However, the screenplay focuses more squarely on the passionate affair that develops between Hanna Schmitz, an enigmatic, controlling woman in her mid-thirties, and Michael Berg, an impressionable fifteen-year-old student in 1958 Berlin.The film begins well enough when the focus is primarily on these two characters with Hanna calling upon Michael to read to her during their discreet afternoon meetings. The affair ends abruptly, and he doesn't see her again until six years later when she goes on trial with several other women for contributing to the murder of 300 Jews while she was serving as an SS guard at Auschwitz. The plot turns on a key revelation that is quite obvious from the early scenes, yet it is at this point when the film loses momentum considerably. Daldry's excessive jumbling of the timeline does not help either in overcoming the increasingly convoluted storyline which has the older Michael conveying a deep sense of conflict over Hanna when she is found guilty and serves a life sentence.Making good cinema out of such introspection poses a challenge. We are meant to empathize with a man who is torn between protecting the subject of his youthful ardor and withdrawing from the horror of the crime for which she accepts accountability. When the plot threads wrap together with the characters' fates sealed, there is a pervasive sense of emptiness since Daldry and Hare cannot move us emotionally beyond the elliptical nature of Hanna and Michael's relationship. This leaves the principal actors to fill in the gaping holes. In response, Kate Winslet gives a strong, nuanced performance as Hanna, foregoing much of her glamour to track the oblique character over three decades of stoic concealment. German actor David Kross is genuinely affecting as Michael, and he brings the necessary vulnerability and eagerness to make more palatable the controversial sex scenes with Winslet. Ralph Fiennes has the diabolically difficult role of the older, haunted Michael, who must come to terms with his unresolved feelings toward Hanna. He is given precious little latitude to flesh out an obviously pained character.Give credit to Daldry and Hare, however, for attempting to tread a fine morality line in presenting a character whose sense of duty to the Nazis did not end up defining her life. At the same time, they fall short in dramatically connecting her lack of rehabilitation with the broader question of responsibility and culpability for the Holocaust. There are plenty of extras on the 2009 DVD beginning with five separate featurettes. The first is the standard 'making of' puff piece with the cast and crew discussing the characters and the production, while another is a ten-minute interview with Kross and Daldry about the young actor's casting. Winslet is spotlighted primarily for the make-up and prosthetics she had to don as the aging Hanna. Two shorts focus on Nico Muhly's haunting soundtrack and Brigitte Broch's meticulous production design. The theatrical trailer is also included, although the best extra is a run of deleted scenes, 42 minutes in total, which provide added context for some of the more elliptical turns of the story.",6,0,1,2 August 2009
The Wrestler," Take a Ringside Seat for Rourke's Galvanizing Comeback
","It's hard to imagine any actor but the thoroughly embattled Mickey Rourke in the title role of this unremittingly bleak 2008 character study of a pro wrestling star well past his prime and trying to figure out if he can have a life outside the ring. Unlike the heavily stylized work for which he is known ('Pi', 'Requiem for a Dream'), director Darren Aronofsky takes a refreshingly straightforward approach here, and Roarke responds with a galvanizing performance that appears to blur the line between reality and fiction. A talented actor ('Sin City') with a tattered career of early highs and all-too-many lows, much of them his own doing, he has such a firm grasp on his character's fatal flaws one can't help wondering how much art is imitating life. Regardless, the symbiotic result makes for an often powerful film-watching experience.Rourke plays blond-maned Randy 'The Ram' Robinson whose professional glory peaked back in the 1980's. Two decades later, he finds his career relegated to small-time matches on the independent circuit in venues attended by only the most fanatical of his diminishing fan base. Living in a trailer he can barely afford, Randy lives on the edge of life, using a pharmacy of meds to hold his broken body together and going to a strip club where he finds himself drawn to a veteran lap dancer named Cassidy. Even in such desperate straits, he proves to be a decent man wracked with not only physical pain but a foreboding sense of his own mortality once he is hospitalized after a grueling match. The story focuses on his fumbling attempts to come to terms with what he wants from what's left of his life.That includes reconciling with his long-estranged daughter Stephanie who has grown bitter over years of being ignored, forming a lasting relationship with Cassidy beyond the next sixty dollars, and even quitting the ring entirely by working the deli counter at a local grocery store. However, the draw of a twentieth anniversary rematch with another iconic wrestler, the Ayatollah, pulls hard at him with the dream of recapturing his former glory. The storyline sounds predictable, and it is if you just take into account Robert Siegel's bare-bones screenplay, but it falls on Rourke's deeply felt work to thwart the clichés. Only allowed to show the character in terms of his succession of failures, the actor brings aching heart and surprising sensitivity to a role that could have easily been mired in stereotype. His confessional at the deserted amusement park is heartbreaking.At the same time, with his physique made to look ravaged by steroids and ringside abuse, he is completely convincing in the ring as he orchestrates the elaborate moves to give his fans their money's worth. As the self-protective Cassidy, Marisa Tomei ('Before the Devil Knows You're Dead') again proves what a fine, underrated character actress she can be as her character uneasily keeps Randy at arm's length when his need for intimacy threatens her insulated world. Evan Rachel Wood ('Across the Universe') has less to do as Stephanie, but she punctuates her scenes with both visceral anger and poignant wariness. The film has an almost documentary feel about it thanks to Aronofsky's no-frills direction and Maryse Alberti's washed-out cinematography, but the approach is fitting given the gritty subject.",8,3,5,30 December 2008
Ray," Superlative Performances Elevate Solid, Episodic Biopic
","At this point, it seems superfluous to say Jamie Foxx gives a brilliant, surprisingly nuanced performance as Ray Charles, as he not only mimics the singer's mannerisms flawlessly but also provides texture and depth to the pained man underneath. It's startling to see Foxx perform at the piano in that idiosyncratic spasmodic style that Charles had, as the actor very often becomes indistinguishable from the legend. In the private moments also depicted here, Foxx is amazingly perceptive about the troubled, hard-shelled, often nasty man Charles apparently was in real life. Hardly the image one remembers from the Pepsi commercials or his other frequent, sometimes ridiculous TV appearances...anyone remember he was in several episodes of 'The Nanny'? But the movie is not about the deconstruction of Ray Charles. In fact, director/writer Taylor Hackford and co-writer James L. White have written a literate, often powerful screenplay that makes us understand the complexity behind Charles' genius and the reasons for his inner demons. The challenge is that in order to remain true to his life story, Hackford and White have overstuffed the movie with so many milestone moments that it becomes episodic and sometimes rather wearing, especially when it comes to the film's depiction of Charles' two-decade heroin addiction. The sight of Charles shooting up and denying his addiction becomes almost a repetitive plot device, as if to provide melodramatic filler between the triumphant moments when he conquers musical frontiers that initially meet with resistance. That's not to say there aren't strong, compelling moments, as there are many. Ironically, one of the most memorable has nothing to do with Foxx but depicts a moment in Charles' hardscrabble Georgia childhood when little Ray trips over a chair and screams for his mother. Wordlessly, he picks himself up and becomes attuned to the sounds around him, picking up a cricket and realizing his mother is right in front of him. It's a transcendent moment.Hackford is not the most subtle of filmmakers (he made the over-the-top 'The Devil's Advocate' among others), and unfortunately his exaggerated sense of melodrama creeps in now and then, in particular, the last section when he decides to go for a 1960's movie-style approach to drug rehabilitation and inserts a fantasy scene back to Charles' childhood that provides pat closure to his long-standing issues. It's an oddly surreal Hollywood-style scene that I feel betrays the honesty of what was presented before. But sometimes Hackford's excessiveness works in his favor, as in the supposedly improvised way that classics like 'What'd I Say?' and 'Hit the Road, Jack' were composed. I also think he does an effective job in making racism an inherent part of the story, not just a pointed plot device, specifically in showing how much of the manipulation Charles experienced in his career was not at the hands of white promoters. The movie also highlights Charles' decision not to play an unsegregated venue in Georgia and revisits that decision in a coda that takes place years later.Beyond Foxx, there is a gallery of superlative performances, especially by a trio of fine actresses. Kerry Washington is superb as Charles' wife Della Bea providing strength and tolerance in the face of her husband's drug addiction and constant adultery. Regina King plays backup singer Margie Hendricks, Charles' on-the-road mistress, with her requisite sass but with a penetrating desperation. Best of all is Sharon Warren, who portrays Charles' proud mother Aretha in flashbacks that make you understand where Charles got his courage and unbridled fury. Also providing excellent support are C.J. Sanders as the young Ray, who witnesses his young brother's accidental drowning and faces his impending blindness, and Clifton Powell as Charles' right-hand man Jeff Brown. The more well-known figures are played gamely though less memorably by Larenz Tate as an ambitious, very young Quincy Jones; Curtis Armstrong as an overly measured Ahmet Ertegun; and Richard Schiff as an anxious Jerry Wexler. At 153 minutes, the movie is rather long, and because of its episodic nature, stops rather abruptly in 1966 when Charles' personal and private lives seem to gain equilibrium. Regardless, the wondrous Foxx elevates this film biopic into something quite extraordinary.The two-disc DVD package has several extras worth noting. On the first disc, the chief addition is fourteen scenes deleted in the theatrical version that have been spliced into the version here and notated accordingly. Some provide interesting context to the story, though they sometimes slow the pacing, a problem coupled by the addition of dead pauses that hurt the overall quality of the viewing experience. All told, the extended version clocks in at a staggering 178 minutes. Taylor Hackford's commentary on the alternate audio track is informative but on the perfunctory side (I only wish Foxx could have added his perspective and can only dream what Charles could have contributed had he lived long enough to 'see' the film's release.) On the second disc, those fourteen deleted scenes show up individually, and there are also three featurettes. The first is the obligatory making-of short, 'A Look Inside Ray', which includes comments by the filmmakers and actors on making the film. The next short, 'Walking in His Shoes', is about the meeting between Foxx and Charles before his death and discusses how Foxx got under the skin of the character. The last, 'Ray Remembered', is a quick tribute to the spirit of Charles by those who loved and admired him.",8,1,2,20 February 2006
Shooter," Testosterone-Driven Revenge Thriller Too Heavy on Polemics and Too Light on Characters
","Surprisingly, for an elaborately staged revenge action piece, this 2007 movie is too politically ambitious for its own good. Director Antoine Fuqua knows how to stage an over-the-top battle and a desperate chase scene with plenty of eye-popping firepower and expert stunt work, but along with screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin, he also wants to make the story a topical commentary on the current political landscape. They are caught in cross purposes that don't mesh well at all, especially toward the end, because the movie is basically a man-on-the-run B-picture with an A-picture budget.Based on 'Point of Impact', a suspense novel by Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter, the densely plotted story focuses on the aptly named Bobby Lee Swagger, a former military sniper who happens to be one of the most expert marksmen ever. Abandoned by the U.S. military during a deadly secret mission in Ethiopia, he has since become a mountain-man survivalist who is recruited three years later by a shadowy figure, Col. Isaac Johnson, to help prevent a predicted assassination attempt on the President. A sudden, Hitchcockian twist occurs a little over the half-hour mark, and the rest of the movie is a series of convolutions that spiral completely out of control by the overblown series of finales.All of this may have had a chance for resonance if the characters were developed beyond the level of action figures. Looking seriously self-possessed, Mark Wahlberg does his best to make Swagger a more dimensional character than the Rambo-constrained script demands, but the film doesn't give him much breathing room beyond his angst over his spotter's death and his burgeoning anger at the U.S. government. On the latter point, he suddenly articulates his perspective like a McLaughlin Group commentator, one of many laughable elements that seem to multiply once Swagger takes charge of his mission of vengeance. As the initially reluctant FBI agent who searches for the truth, Michael Peña brings much needed humanism to the story, but his character's arc is absurdly presented in broad strokes.With a convincing Kentucky accent, Kate Mara looks at first to be playing the spotter's widow as a feisty, vulnerable figure, but she is reduced almost systematically to a nearly mute damsel-in-distress as the story progresses. Similarly, Danny Glover plays Johnson with some interesting texture at the beginning but then quickly moves into Simon Legree territory. The worst casting occurs late in the movie with Ned Beatty as a pompous U.S. senator pivotal in the political conspiracy behind Swagger's set-up. A far cry from the Machiavellian corporate tycoon he played in 'Network', Beatty plays to the rafters with zero subtlety. Still, it is hard not to be impressed with the film's technical aspects, particularly the sharp cinematography of Peter Menzies, Jr. and the propulsive editing by Conrad Buff and Eric Sears. Lemkin's polemic-heavy script, however, cannot begin to elevate the movie beyond its testosterone-driven genre.",5,1,4,11 April 2007
Inception," Artfully Stunning, Ambitiously Complex Sci-Fi Thriller Shows Nolan's Reach May Just Exceed His Grasp
","Empathy turns out to be the biggest challenge that filmmaker Christopher Nolan faces in his audaciously intricate, sometimes confounding 2010 sci-fi action thriller. It's a 148-minute somersault of a ride viscerally engaging in its vivid elaboration of lucid dreaming. Ironically, there is little time to feel for the characters involved when the whole point of the movie is that nothing is meant to feel real. This dramatic dilemma is almost completely shouldered by the main protagonist Dom Cobb, a professional thief specializing in corporate espionage whose sharpened gifts as an 'extractor' allows him to enter the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Heading up a 'Mission: Impossible'-type task force, Cobb has become a 'Shane'-like solitary figure whose talents have cost him his family. He wants nothing more than to see the faces of his two young children.The movie wastes no time in giving Cobb a final mission, his one last shot at redemption which will allow him to reunite with his family back in the states. A Japanese tycoon named Saito wants Cobb to perform an act of 'inception' in which he would plant an idea in the subconscious of Robert Fischer Jr., the son of a corporate rival who is about to inherit his father's energy conglomerate. Saito wants Fischer to dissolve the company to prevent the corporation's inevitable takeover of global energy resources, but Cobb's participation represents a risky maneuver that conjures up memories of his dead wife Mal. She figures in the dream episodes in unexpected ways that invariably cloud Cobb's judgment in executing upon the mission for Saito. A crack team has been assembled to aid Cobb - Arthur, the point man who researches the targets whose dreams will be infiltrated; Eames, a cocky forger who has the ability to change identities inside dreams; Yusuf, a chemist who has developed the powerful sedatives that take Cobb and crew into the dream state; and Ariadne, a preternaturally talented graduate student whom Cobb and Arthur train as their new architect.As both writer and director, Nolan methodically bends the storyline into a labyrinth that turns out to be circular in structure and contains at least four layers of dreams in which the task force must tag team in order to wake up to the next higher level until they each face reality. This is easier said than done since he attempts to show the unconscious as a supremely unruly place where nothing ultimately makes sense, and that's the film's major conundrum since it demands that the narrative must make some amount of sense to make the viewer feel engaged with the story being told. Leonardo DiCaprio brings his trademark intensity to Dom and manages a gravitas that helps ground the story at a human level, even when the plot convolutions get more and more elaborate and far-fetched. There are some impressive CGI set-pieces like the street of Paris folding over like an omelet, a train careening down a busy downtown street, and the eerie sight of a vacant city in a virtual limbo. Other scenes border on the silly like Arthur's fight scene amid a rotating hotel that make him look like he's doing a '2001' riff on Fred Astaire's classic dance routine in 'Royal Wedding', or the way Ariadne precociously diagnoses the solutions to fatalistic dreams like an worldly scholar.By no means does the approach translate into ineffectual performances by the rest of the eclectic cast. It's just that the actors reflect the generally poker-faced manner expected within the sci-fi genre. Joseph Gordon-Levitt ('500 Days of Summer') plays Arthur just that way as does Ken Watanabe ('The Last Samurai') appropriately inscrutable as Saito. Ellen Page ('Juno') neutralizes her naturally sardonic manner to play up Ariadne's naïve curiosity, but to her defense, she has some of the clunkiest dialogue to deliver. Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao fare better as Eames and Yusuf, respectively simply because they play plot devices more than people. Cillian Murphy ('Breakfast on Pluto') channels his usually intimidating intensity into Fischer's deceptively becalming manner, while an almost unrecognizable Tom Berenger manages to play his father's loyal associate with welcome gusto. As Mal, Marion Cotillard ('La Vie en Rose') has by far the film's most challenging role, maintaining a careful balance between a spectral figure of longing for Cobb and a manipulative femme fatale.As one would expect from a Nolan film, all the production details are exquisite. Wally Pfister's astonishing cinematography contributes immeasurably to the film's overall hypnotic effect, and Hans Zimmer's foreboding, percussive score thrusts the drama forward with momentum. This movie is too startling a work to ignore, but it would be disingenuous to say that this venture reflects a grand vision since the story is basically an elaborate heist movie. Everything is so well thought out that Nolan may have inadvertently prevented his audience from feeling the full emotional impact of the ending despite the superb editing job by Lee Smith that juggles all the concurrent dreams together. This is still masterful filmmaking from someone who could have focused a tad less on technique and a tad more on the untamed heart that really alters the order within our dreams.",8,4,11,26 July 2010
The Good Shepherd," The Spy Who Left the Rest of Us in the Cold
","As a filmmaker, Robert DeNiro shows the influence of his generation of great directors like Scorsese and Coppola with this epic-length 2006 film. In fact, there is a certain structural similarity to 'The Godfather' in DeNiro's careful unfolding of the time-spanning story penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. The plot focuses on a fictionalized account of the first twenty years of the CIA as seen through the experiences of one agent named Edward Wilson, an intentionally cryptic study in excessive self-control which makes him ideal for his career. Ironically, the main problem with the film is the stoic coldness of the central character for which DeNiro and Roth cannot seem to find a voice that would make the story resonate. There is little sense of a personal journey for Wilson, even though there are hints of it beginning with his father's suicide, which is used as a leitmotif throughout the story.Another frustration of the film is the constant time-jumping between the fallout over the failed Bay of Pigs mission in 1961 and key episodes in Wilson's earlier years. The technique doesn't make the drama any more interesting than it really is. Unfortunately there is no getting around the fact that despite the handsome production detail, the movie is a slog at 248 minutes and quite often, an amazing bore. DeNiro has assembled a can't-miss cast, including himself as a pre-CIA operative, but for the most part, they are stranded by a script consisting of coded exchanges and predictable dialogue, the latter most prevalent in the domestic scenes. Matt Damon does all he can as the poker-faced Wilson, but he is given little latitude to elicit empathy for his character.While she starts out with her fiery persona intact, Angelina Jolie has a progressively smaller role as Wilson's increasingly embittered wife Clover merely defined by how shut off she is from Wilson's clandestine profession. DeNiro inexplicably does not age either Damon or Jolie with any conviction over the course of the story, and there is an oddly unsettling dynamic when they are shown as the parents of a fully grown son. Better among the huge cast are William Hurt as a lifelong mentor; Tammy Blanchard as Wilson's true love, a hearing-impaired coed with whom he is reunited years later; Billy Crudup as a rather fey British counterspy; Alec Baldwin as a covert FBI agent; and John Turturro as Wilson's no-nonsense colleague. The 2007 DVD is short on extras, as it just contains seven deleted scenes of little additional interest. Unsurprisingly, the taciturn DeNiro does not offer a director's commentary here.",5,3,5,24 July 2007
The Blind Side," Bullock Makes Her Mark as a Steel-Willed Memphis Belle in an Emotionally Driven Football Drama
","This empathetic 2009 sports-oriented drama is what professional critics would call an uplift film, unabashed in pulling all the necessary emotional cords with an undemanding audience. Screenwriter/director John Lee Hancock is no stranger to the genre since his last two films reflected similar against-all-odds story lines, the Texan band of brothers in 'The Alamo' and the over-the-hill pitcher in 'The Rookie'. However, there are two key factors that transcend the potentially manipulative structure of Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' intriguing 2006 fact-based book about the evolution of the left tackle in pro football. The first is the irresistible pull of the true-life story of six-foot-six, 345-pound Michael Oher, plucked out of destitution in the Memphis projects by a well-to-do white family to become the starting left tackle at Ole Miss and now with the Baltimore Ravens. The second is Sandra Bullock, bleached blonde, immensely likable, and heavily into no-bull 'Erin Brockovich' terrain, in a solid performance as Leigh Ann Touhy, the feisty decorator wife and mother who takes Oher into her family home.The film begins when the coach of a private religious school sees the otherwise lumbering Michael display natural athletic ability on the basketball court. The coach sees untapped potential in Michael as a football player because of his huge size, so much so that he gets accepted despite his poor academic record. It also turns out that the taciturn Michael, referred to by everyone as 'Big Mike', is homeless, sleeping wherever he can since the state took him away as a child from his crack-addicted mother. The upscale Touhys have noticed him before since he goes to school with their children, S.J. and Collins, but it isn't until they see Michael wandering in the freezing cold that Leigh Anne impulsively takes him in. Despite some initial hesitation, he quickly becomes a part of the family, and his performance at school improves enough for him to show what he can do on the football field. Once Leigh Ann crystallizes the team-as-family metaphor for Michael, the 345-pound behemoth starts to realize his talent for smashing the defensive line. College football coaches from throughout the South come to the Touhy home to recruit Michael aggressively to play for them. Ole Miss is the Touhys' alma mater, which leads to an unexpected but inevitable dramatic turn.It's not that Bullock does anything all that new in the movie. Rather, it's that she leverages her winning, every-person screen persona so very well within a character that would seem antithetical to her sensibilities as an actress. While it's true that the story probably puts too much emphasis on her character's role in Michael's ascent, Bullock is one of the few film stars today that can generate such an instant rapport with her audience, and she carries the emotional weight of the story with grit and dexterity. As Michael, Quinton Aaron has to be such an impassive presence at the beginning that when he starts to form into his own person, the actor brings a gentle, palpable force to his character's evolution. It's really the scenes between Bullock and Aaron that tug most at the heartstrings (I welled up at least three times during those shrewdly engineered moments). On the sidelines, country singer Tim McGraw plays supportive husband Sean credibly, and there are scene-stealing turns from towheaded Jae Head as the indefatigable S.J. and Kathy Bates in her usual gutsy-broad form as Michael's tutor, Miss Sue. Broadway actress Adriane Lenox - who originated the role of Mrs. Miller in 'Doubt' - provides the film's most heartbreaking moments as Michael's haunted mother. This is far less a sports movie and more of a story of individual need and the power of family. The film is powerful in that respect.",8,2,4,13 December 2009
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Searing Indictment of Military Politics Still Startles and Resonates
","There have been many exceptional anti-war films throughout the years - Lewis Milestone's 'All Quiet on the Western Front', Robert Altman's 'M*A*S*H', Clint Eastwood's 'Letters from Iwo Jima' - but I doubt if there's been one as emotionally devastating and economically dramatized as Stanley Kubrick's searing 1957 classic indictment of military politics among the upper ranks of the French army during WWI. Running a scant 86 minutes, the movie wastes no time in showing the exploitation of military ranks by the French General Staff to participate in a suicide mission on the western front. The objective is to take over 'Ant Hill', a German stronghold of no strategic importance to the French except to the ambitious General Mireau, who is given the incentive of a promotion if the attack is successful. It's oblivious from the outset that the chances of success are practically nil since the men in the trenches are battered and weak from a number of successful advancements into enemy territory. The conscientious Colonel Dax is handed the responsibility of leading the men, but it turns completely fatal due initially to the blunder of one commanding officer's orders and the dominant German forces. Desperate to avoid humiliation, Mireau transfers blame for the failure to the soldiers and accuses them of cowardice.If Mireau had his way, one hundred men would have been publicly executed, but he is ordered to identify three men to be to be executed exemplarily to satisfy the blood thirst of the military command. Dax defends the three men at the court-martial hearing but appears doomed to failure by a kangaroo court. The rest of the story plays out in aching detail until the shattering conclusion. Although he is more famous for his larger-than-life portrayals like Vincent Van Gogh in Vincente Minnelli's 'Lust for Life' or the title role in Kubrick's later 'Spartacus', Kirk Douglas is no less mesmerizing in a comparatively subdues performance as Dax. In hindsight, it seems rather punitive that he never won a competitive Oscar. In a particularly poignant performance, Ralph Meeker, an even undervalued actor most famous for Robert Aldrich's 'Kiss Me Deadly', plays Corporal Paris, one of the three chosen to die specifically because his commanding officer wants to be rid of the only eyewitness to his act of drunken cowardice. With his distinctive facial scar, George Macready plays the fanatical Mireau with uncompromising fury, while Adolphe Menjou, in one of the last roles of a long career, plays the blatantly immoral General Broulard with a slyly sinister panache. It's no wonder the film was banned in France for nearly two decades. The 1999 DVD offers only the original theatrical trailer as an extra. Well beyond Kubrick aficionados, this remains essential viewing for anyone interested in classic cinema.",10,1,3,5 May 2008
The Queen," Surprisingly Dishy Account of a Momentous Week Anchored by Mirren's Superbly Etched Portrayal
","It's reassuring to see an actress of Helen Mirren's caliber finally receiving the top-line recognition she deserves for a role that must have been challenging to tackle without sinking into parody as others before her have. As Queen Elizabeth II, she manages to convey the immaculate decorum of her real-life counterpart without sacrificing the humanism essential in empathizing with her during a trying time. The period in question is the week that felt like an eternity after the death of Princess Diana in 1997 when the world was awaiting an official response from the Queen. With just a wig and glasses to alter her appearance, Mirren is superb in a role that must have been quite constraining given that the subject is not only still the reigning monarch but the model of blank-faced self-possession. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears in a surprisingly dishy manner, the film actually plays out as a witty comedy of manners beset by a tragic event.The 2006 film chronicles that momentous week and prefaces it with Tony Blair's first formal introduction to the Queen in May 1997 after his election as the first Labour Party Prime Minister in nearly two decades. Elizabeth's concerns over Blair's promises of modernity are expressed in small gestures, but obviously their values-based clash come to the fore when Diana is killed in a Paris car accident six months later. Cloistered at the time in their Scottish estate, Balmoral, the royal family does not support a public memorial for Diana since she had divorced Charles the previous year. However, public outcry over their seeming aloofness reaches a level of frenzy that places Blair in the difficult spot of requesting the Queen to speak to her subjects about what she considers a private matter. Exacerbating the situation is the residual animosity that the royal family feels toward Diana, whom they feel had betrayed them in the media.While the story is fact-based, one can't help but believe the private moments are played with a certain amount of exaggerated tabloid-friendly bias, especially the frequently cutting swipes at Diana and the rather fanciful episode with the stag. It makes for some of the film's more entertaining moments, but concurrently they undermine the credibility of the account. Beyond Mirren, there is superbly comic work from James Cromwell as a blustery, unsympathetic Prince Philip; Alex Jennings as a grieving but oddly vacant and paranoid Prince Charles; Helen McCrory as Blair's curtsey-challenged, tough-minded wife Cherie; and Sylvia Syms (not the jazz singer) as the still-alert, eye-rolling Queen Mother. Initially, Michael Sheen looks like he will do a zealous parody of the real Blair, but he gains respectable gravity as the story progresses. Above all else, the film is a personal triumph for Mirren's stellar work in what may turn out to be the role of a lifetime.",8,1,2,8 January 2007
X-Men: First Class," Before They Were X-Men...a Welcome Focus on Character and an Arresting Turn by Fassbender
","For someone who is not an avid fan of the comic book movie genre, I think this prequel to the 'X-Men' series is well done and doesn't require as much of a crash course as I was expecting to understand the set-up. That's because director Matthew Vaughn has chosen to focus heavily on character development rather than just elaborate special effects to make this historical 2011 fantasy adventure truly arresting. He and producer Bryan Singer were also smart to gather a first-rate cast of young actors who lend atypical gravity to the proceedings and cumulatively, they provide the narrative throughput necessary to show how the characters evolve into their more familiar older personas. Having only seen the 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' entry, I am no 'X-Men' follower, so it was helpful to get the back stories for Magneto and Xavier in dramatically economic order.The story begins chronologically in 1944 when a young German boy named Erik Lensherr watches his parents being hauled off to Auschwitz. In a fit of fear and rage, he bends the metal gate separating him from his family, commanding the attention of scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt, who is eager to harness young Erik's telekinetic powers. Meanwhile, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, young telepath Charles Xavier meets homeless young shape-shifter Raven. They bond over their unique powers. Flash forward to 1962, and the grown Erik contemplates his revenge against the man who went on to ruin his life. Schmidt has since changed his name to Sebastian Shaw and heads up a secret society out to take over the world. Xavier and Raven are still together as foster siblings as he earns his doctorate in genetic research at Oxford. Ultimately, Xavier's and Lensherr's destinies become intertwined with the Cuban Missile Crisis, a pivotal opportunity for Shaw to use the full scope of his energy-absorbing mutant powers. Xavier is recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert to help her agency stop Shaw. Xavier brings Lensherr to the CIA's secret 'Division X' facility where they find and recruit mutants for training to stop Shaw.The young mutants end up dividing their loyalties, and the nonstop action ultimately culminates into Shaw's Machiavellian attempts to trigger World War III in the midst of the Soviet movement to arm Cuba with nuclear missiles. The military showdown provides the context for the separate fates of Xavier and Lensherr, which obviously leads to the formation of the X-Men as they are known in the original series. While James McAvoy ('Atonement') is effective as Xavier, even evoking some of Patrick Stewart's erudite manner at times, the film is dominated by Michael Fassbender's ('Inglourious Basterds') laser-sharp intensity as Xavier. A cast-against-type Kevin Bacon has a field day as Schmidt/Shaw to the point where he approaches self-parody. In a nice twist from her role as the spoiled socialite wife in 'Bridesmaids', Rose Byrne brings a nice, no-nonsense proto-feminist sense to MacTaggert. The others, including Jennifer Lawrence ('Winter's Bone') as Raven, acquit themselves nicely in their roles. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the movie works as matinée-level entertainment for the rest of us. The 2011 Blu-Ray contains a hefty number of extras although surprisingly no commentary track. There are twenty minutes of behind-the-scenes clips, fifteen minutes of extended and deleted scenes, an hour-plus making-of documentary, and various interactive features.",7,0,1,14 December 2011
Win Win," Culpability and Personal Responsibility on a Human Scale Handled by an Excellent Cast
","Having been impressed by his last directorial effort, 2007's 'The Visitor' (which netted lead actor Richard Jenkins a well-deserved Oscar nomination), actor-turned-director/screenwriter Thomas McCarthy shows the same idiosyncratic attention to character in this quiet 2011 dramedy. It has the same ramshackle, off-kilter quality, this time focusing on middle-class New Jersey suburbia and the struggles of conscience that occur during economically challenging times. The protagonist is Mike Flaherty, a small-town attorney whose practice is sinking under the weight of mounting bills. He's also a family man with a wife and two daughters, who also moonlights as a high school wrestling coach on a losing streak. While representing Leo Poplar, a man suffering from dementia, he comes up with an unethical plan that has him taking over Leo's guardianship and pocketing $1,500 a month while keeping his client in a nursing home.His plan is not without a certain remorse, and an unexpected turn occurs when Leo's surly 16-year-old grandson Kyle shows up from Ohio to live with his grandfather. Not being a bad guy, Mike takes Kyle into his home where he starts to fit in quite well, especially when it turns out he is a gifted wrestler whose success buoys the spirit of the team. Complicating matters, however, is Kyle's negligent, drug-addicted mother who suddenly shows up to reclaim Kyle and her father. Through it all, McCarthy shows a genuine gift for believable dialogue that unfolds the story without resorting to clichés or big moments that take his actors out of character for the sake of the story. In response, the cast he has assembled is superb. In his best big-screen role since 'Sideways', Paul Giamatti portrays Mike with a fierce passivity that somehow elicits empathy to his character's sketchy behavior. Amy Ryan is his match as his tough-minded wife Jackie lending a moral certitude that Mike clearly lacks. Together they make one of the most credible married couples I have seen in any recent film.Jeffrey Tambor lends his innate weariness to Mike's office mate who also happens to coach the wrestling team, and Bobby Cannavale, who worked with McCarthy on his first film, 2003's 'The Station Agent', provides his particular motor-mouthed energy to Mike's oblivious best friend Terry, a hedge fund manager still manically obsessed with his ex-wife. Burt Young, still best known as Paulie in all the 'Rocky' films, plays Leo in his familiar mumbling manner. Newcomer Alex Shaffer affectingly plays Kyle like a stone-faced version of Sean Penn's Spicoli in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' until his character gradually warms to the Flahertys. As his estranged mom Cindy, Melanie Lynskey is touching as a woman whose sense of uncertainty informs her every move. David W. Thompson provides welcome comic relief as Kyle's hopeless insecure teammate Stemler, and Claire Foley is remarkably assured as the Flahertys' eldest daughter Abby. All the plot threads are so deftly handled by McCarthy and his cast that the larger themes of culpability and responsibility resonate on a very human scale.",8,0,1,29 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan Delivers the Goodsand Just About Everything Else in a Blazing Crescendo
","To state that Christopher Nolan's crescendo-building finale to the Dark Knight trilogy is richly plotted is a gross understatement. There is so much going on in the intricately detailed screenplay co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan that it's a wonder that he pulls it off with not only cinematic gusto but with surprising clarity. In fact, the artistic success of this epic 2012 adventure has primarily to do with Nolan's virtuosic filmmaking style which reflects an uncompromising level of commitment that stubbornly doesn't translate into the level of Cameron-level hubris you would expect from such a surefire studio rainmaker. In fact, as he showed most effectively in 2008's 'The Dark Knight', Nolan can take the most ludicrous material and invest it with so much belief and inflate it with unbounded imagination and intelligence, so much so that he can overcome any lingering skepticism (if not endless critical feedback) that belabors the incredulousness of the venture. Unlike 2010's 'Inception', where he does get carried away with the blinking creativity of its mind-altering concept, the well- grounded myth of Batman tethers him irrevocably to the fastidious demands of an established fan base of not only the 73-year-old comic books but of the movies themselves. He also has a firm grasp on the narrative from an emotional standpoint and can still stage a sharp albeit often far-fetched action scene. Although it's only been four years since the release of 'The Dark Knight', the story has moved forward eight years since the pivotal moment when Batman disappeared after taking the blame for D.A. Harvey Dent's crimes in order to salvage the hope he represented to the populace in the wake of the Joker's rampage. Bruce Wayne's lifelong love Rachel Dawes was killed in a fiery explosion, and he has become a recluse in his manor under the delusion that she was leaving Dent for him. A clever jewel thief named Selina Kyle unexpectedly enters his life stealing his mother's pearls just as Wayne Enterprises begins to crumble due to Wayne's long-standing absence from the board. He retreats from his decision to invest in board member Miranda Tate's clean energy project after he learns that the core could be modified to become a nuclear weapon. At the same time, a brutalizing terrorist named Bane makes his debut in Gotham City attacking the stock exchange and forcing Wayne to liquidate his assets. Although the act appears initiated by the Machiavellian impulses of a rival board member, the ensuing revolution turns out to cut much deeper as a war against the wealthy with the entire city being held hostage and a deeply personal vendetta against Wayne that inevitably goes back to the story in the first film, 2005's 'Batman Begins'. To give away any more would be sacrilegious. Suffice it to say the circumstances become dire leading to powerful images of devastation and visceral showdowns that don't disappoint.If anything, Nolan eschews much of the expected violence in favor of genuine suspense probably due to the pre-release speculation of rabid bloggers who were trying to guess how Nolan would wrap up all the story lines. Obviously if you have some idea of the original comic book story lines, you'll know where the plot is going. Regardless, Nolan has really figured out how to provide the film a climax that is ultimately satisfying. As both Wayne and Batman, Christian Bale proves that he is the actor who best understands the dichotomy of the mythically contrarian role, and in this film, reveals the vulnerability of a fallen public figure with the appropriate gravitas. Several other veteran actors are back for their third round and reveal more depth to their characters – Michael Caine conveying the weight of Alfred's melancholy while witnessing Wayne as he tortuously resuscitates his secret identity, Morgan Freeman erudite as ever as Wayne's armorer Lucius Fox, and an especially effective Gary Oldman, who as the world-weary Commissioner Gordon, agonizes over the guilt of his long-held secret about Batman and Dent. Nolan also scooped up members of his 'Inception' ensemble for key roles – a comparatively pallid Marion Cotillard as Wayne's benefactress and burgeoning love interest Tate, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showing more grit than before as police officer John Blake whose idealism remains unabated despite the grim circumstances, and Tom Hardy virtually unrecognizable as the menacing Bane. In particular, Hardy sharply conveys the imposing physicality and florid pontification of a relentless terrorist leader.The biggest surprise of the cast turns out to be Anne Hathaway who eschews her usually sunny screen persona with infectious abandon as Catwoman (although she is never referred by this moniker in the film). She not only captures her character's slinky amorality and acrobatic moves but also provides clear insight into Selina's nihilistic behavior with welcome economy. In fact, the one storytelling misstep may be an underlying presumption that an anti-Wall Street screed would automatically establish the moral tone of the film when I think more widespread evidence of such villainy is warranted versus the greed- driven acts of a single company's board. But let's not forget this is all based on a comic book, and on that level, it enthralls with impressive set pieces, state-of-the-art gadgetry (the high-flying 'Bat' is cool), and thrilling action sequences. Nolan also doesn't harp on any particular political agenda and never forgets that balance in his cerebrally meticulous approach all the way through its 145-minute running time. This is one of the few occasions when I felt the movie was actually not long enough. The film's production values are superb from Wally Pfister's dark-hued cinematography (he also lensed the first two films) to Hans Zimmer's appropriately stentorian score to the outstanding production design by Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh. Despite my misgivings about the overly expository nature of the first film which comes back somewhat in this one, this is a genuinely spectacular finale to a great trilogy.",9,2,7,23 July 2012
Iron Man," A Superhero Epic with Wit, Heart, True Political Relevance and Downey's Knowing Work
","Casting Robert Downey Jr. ('Chaplin', 'Zodiac') in the title role turns out to be a masterstroke as the beleaguered actor slips easily into all the complexities of a brilliant scientist who also happens to be a billionaire industrialist and a hedonistic playboy whose every pleasure-seeking habit has turned into a death-defying addiction. The textured part of Tony Stark so mirrors Downey's former tabloid-headline-grabbing life that the actor can't help but inform the role with layers of resonance and irony that elevate what could have been a more cookie-cutter superhero epic. At the same time, director Jon Favreau ('Elf', 'Zathura') has more on his mind than creating another heavily stylized comic book myth, as he spends the first part of the film on establishing the realistic context for his hero's circumstances in rugged, war-torn terrain of Afghanistan. No less than four writers were recruited for the screenplay - Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway - on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics. Usually having too many hands is a warning sign of a bad, neutralized movie but not this time - this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.The story has Stark, the head of his own multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of state-of-the-art, mass destruction weaponry, in Afghanistan demonstrating a new guided missile that can launch a multitude of smaller missiles aimed at individual targets. His military convoy is ambushed by insurgents who kill the soldiers escorting him. Stark survives due to the quick-thinking ingenuity of a local Afghan physician who implants a device in Stark's chest to ensure the remaining shrapnel left in his body doesn't travel to his heart. Stark's captors demand that he build a missile like the one he just demonstrated, but instead, he makes an elaborate armored suit and blasts his way out of the cave where he was held hostage. Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story. Transformed by his traumatic, three-month experience overseas, Stark has a change of heart which has detrimental ramifications on his company but also allows him to follow his monomaniacal pursuit of building a sleeker, more powerful version of the suit he built in captivity. Three people, in particular, are impacted by Stark's unpredictable actions - his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim ('Rhodey') Rhodes; Stark's cagey second-in-command at Stark Industries, Obadiah Stone; and Stark's devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts.With impressive agility, the often under-appreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper. Favreau's other casting decisions also pay dividends though some more than others. Shorn of his thick hair and sporting a salt-and-pepper beard, Jeff Bridges, another actor who never seems to get his due, is still recognizable from his trademark grin and plays the avuncular, villainous Stone with great relish. Credit Bridges for not overdoing what could have been an excessive Willem Dafoe-like turn in the first 'Spiderman'. One suspects that Terrence Howard will have more to do in the sequel as Rhodey since he is not called on to do much in this first installment except provide support and official alibis. Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran's 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow', Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines. All the production values are top-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J. Michael Riva's elaborate production design (Stark's Malibu estate is quite an eye-catcher), Matthew Libatique's crisp cinematography, and the dozens involved with the seamless CGI effects. Make sure to stay after the credits in order to see a surprise final scene which gives a hint of what the sequel may be about.",9,1,2,12 May 2008
La Vie En Rose," Cotillard Soars as the Little Sparrow Even When the Film Lets Her Down
","Virtually unrecognizable from her previous film roles, usually as a comely presence in films like 'A Good Year', Marion Cotillard turns in such a viscerally transcendent performance as legendary chanteuse Édith Piaf that she elevates this 2007 French biopic into a worthwhile piece of cinema. Otherwise, the film meanders back and forth through Piaf's life at such an agitated pace that the result, while evocative, is erratic and cliché-driven. Director Olivier Dahan (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Isabelle Sobelman) seems to get carried away with the melodramatic aspects of her life, so much so that Piaf comes across less as a three-dimensional person and more like a predictably self-destructive diva making up for a severely lacking childhood. The archetype is familiar from any number of similar celebrity portraits from 'Coal Miner's Daughter' to 'Ray', though the film reminds me most of Sidney J. Furie's episodic 'Lady Sings the Blues'. That's because Piaf and the equally ill-fated Billie Holiday are kindred spirits, a comparison brought up pointedly in the film. In fact, for a French film, it reflects a distinctively Hollywood-style sensibility, and Dahan punctuates every dramatic moment with such a repetitive sense of crescendo that it becomes wearing over its epic-length running time of 141 minutes.A lot of time in the film is spent on Piaf's miserable childhood when her drunken mother, an aspiring singer, abandons her, and her father, a traveling circus performer, leaves Édith in a brothel run by her business-like grandmother. A prostitute named Titine grows fond of Édith and takes care of her when she is blinded temporarily by keratitis. Following her mother's footsteps and accompanied by her confidante Momone, Édith sings on the streets of Paris, and her remarkable voice impresses local nightclub impresario Louis Leplée. When she takes the stage at his club, her fate is secure. The rest of her story is told through disconnected dramatic episodes, although the film spends some extended time on her fateful affair with world-class boxer Marcel Cerdan. Under the masterful make-up work of Didier Lavergne and Jan Archibald, Cotillard is completely convincing whether as a gawky young teen or as the dying, hunchbacked woman looking decades older than the singer's 47 years. She is true to Piaf's spirit in the musical performances and lip-syncs with emotional precision. She has a particularly impressive five-minute scene - a single, uninterrupted take that ends with her character facing tragic news.Not too surprisingly, the rest of the cast is overshadowed by Cotillard's performance, but a few leave lasting impressions, such as Gérard Depardieu as Leplée, Emmanuelle Seigner as Titine, and Manon Chevallier and Pauline Burlet as Édith at ages five and ten. The same can't be said for the pallid work of Jean-Pierre Martins as Cerdan and Caroline Sihol in a thankless cameo as Marlene Dietrich, one of Piaf's most fervent admirers. However, Piaf's voice is effectively presented for another generation to admire with her most famous songs showcased  'La vie en rose', 'Hymne à l'amour', 'Milord', and the masterpiece of her twilight years, 'Non, je ne regrette rien'. Moreover, most of the production values are first-rate, especially Marit Allen's period costumes and Olivier Raoux's production design. Tetsuo Nagata's cinematography is expert, although the use of low lighting during the childhood sequences seems excessive to me. The 2007 DVD has only one extra, a seven-minute making-of featurette mainly focused on Cotillard's tireless work in transforming herself into Piaf. I would have liked more information on Piaf herself to help elucidate some of the dramatic flourishes that Dahan brought to his film.",6,3,6,28 January 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Allen Finds His Romantic and Artistic Muse in Spain with a Sharp, Eclectic Cast
","From a thematic standpoint, Woody Allen's latest film offers nothing we haven't already seen in his earlier work like 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and Her Sisters'. Like those classics and several lesser efforts, this 2008 romantic dramedy is a distilled examination of why men and women long for romance and how we fluidly fall in and out of love as a result, often with dire consequences and not without personal humiliation. What makes this entry particularly welcome is the full-blooded infusion of Spanish art and architecture that brings an emotional ripeness to the story. It also helps that Allen has gathered a more eclectic cast than usual to inhabit the richly developed characters. This is easily the most enjoyable film he has made since going abroad and probably his funniest since at least 2000's 'Small Time Crooks'.The plot focuses on two American college friends, polar opposites on the subject of love, as they vacation in Barcelona for the summer. As the conservative one who values stability and devotion, Vicky is there to study 'Catalan Identity' as she waits to return to the states to marry Doug, an ambitious young man who maps out their future with a stifling lack of spontaneity. Failed filmmaker Cristina, on the other hand, is a romantic adventurer who craves unbridled passion with no limits. Their differing perspectives on love clash immediately when they both catch the eye of renowned abstract painter Juan Antonio. He makes a supremely self-confident proposition to Vicky and Cristina to join him on a romantic weekend trip to Oviedo, a picturesque town near the northern coast. Naturally, Vicky is appalled and makes no bones in telling him so, but Cristina is excited by the idea of being seduced by him. They agree to go with him and face unexpected consequences. Things get even more complicated when Juan Antonio's tempestuous ex-wife Maria Elena shows up and forces him to face his weaknesses.Part of the resulting roundelay feels like a throwback to Allen's 'A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy', but there is also a palpable sense of melancholy more reminiscent of his mid-period films like 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Husbands and Wives'. What remains consistent throughout is the filmmaker's incurable romanticism, a freshly optimistic viewpoint that makes the film thoroughly pleasurable despite the familiar set-up. The performances are terrific beginning with Rebecca Hall, a surprising find as Vicky, a young woman who thought she knew what she wanted only to find out too late that it's not what she wants at all. As a typical Allen heroine, Hall lets her initially strident manner as Vicky give way to a resonating sadness. As for Scarlett Johansson, the third time's definitely a charm. In 'Match Point', Allen exploited her effortless sensuality, while he tried to make her a fumbling Diane Keaton copy in 'Scoop'. As Cristina, however, she gets to blend together her carnal allure and comic insecurity in a more seamless fashion. She has a wonderfully funny moment when she just can't control her titillation at Juan Antonio's proposal in the restaurant.For those who have only recently been introduced to his mesmerizing work by way of his maniacal killer in the Coen Brothers' 'No Country for Old Men', Javier Bardem is completely convincing as Juan Antonio, a man who effortlessly controls the fates of the three women enraptured by his sensual manner and open soul. Unlike a shallower actor like Antonio Banderas, Bardem manages to move between smoldering and vulnerable with fluency. As Maria Elena, Penélope Cruz finally comes into her own in a non-Almodóvar film. Taking the concept of a tortured artist to an extreme, the actress blazes with dangerous vitality, even though the role is relatively minor. She brings visceral life to the combative relationship between her and Juan Antonio, and at the same time, displays a sharp Allenesque wit, especially when she slyly ridicules Cristina in Spanish during their tension-filled conversations. The always-reliable Patricia Clarkson is quietly effective as a family friend of Vicki's with secrets of her own, while Chris Messina conveys the right level of unctuous smarminess as Doug.The film is beautiful to look at thanks to the luscious, sun-dappled cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe. With Gaudi's most famous work on display, Barcelona could hardly look more appealing on film. Just as evocative is the atmospheric music by a bevy of contemporary Spanish composers. The one aspect that doesn't work quite as well as intended is Christopher Evan Welch's stentorian narration, which lacks the right level of irony to make the ploy worthwhile. Most of the time, it comes across as a conceit to explain parts of the narrative that seem clear enough from the scenes. Regardless, this is a genuine return to form for Allen and well worth seeing for fans.",8,5,12,25 August 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The Virgin Queen Redux in an Odd Mix of Old-Fashioned Melodrama and Romance Novel
","There is something stubbornly old-fashioned about Shekhar Kapur's 2007 sequel to his 1998 art-house triumph, 'Elizabeth'. I don't mean the newer movie is a stodgy historical pageant. Far from it, all the production values are first-rate, including a relatively seamless use of CGI in the Spanish Armada sequence, but beyond all the pomp and circumstance, the mindset of the story is pure 1940's-era studio melodrama. Set in 1585, the film picks up the Queen's life a quarter century after the first film, and what follows in the strangely cautious screenplay by Michael Hirst and William Nicholson is a simplistic portrait of an aging, superstitious woman aware of her power but ironically at a loss to define her own fate. This period of her life is familiar from a number of previous films and miniseries, but this time, the psychological complexity behind such a fascinating historical figure has been downgraded in favor of romance novel plot turns and paper-thin character development.The set-up is rich with possibilities only partially realized on screen. Protestant England is on its knees, as Roman Catholic Spain has become Europe's most powerful country. Now in her early fifties, Elizabeth is vulnerable since Phillip II of Spain is intent on conquering England and especially because she has not married and produced an heir. Next in line is her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, a devout Roman Catholic imprisoned in a castle in Northamptonshire. Elizabeth has proved to be a tolerant ruler as she allows her country's Roman Catholics to maintain their religious beliefs, even though they see Mary as the only rightful Queen. In the meantime, Sir Walter Raleigh has just returned from the New World and stimulated Elizabeth's passion for adventure and her long-dormant desire for romance. Complicating matters is Elizabeth's devoted lady-in-waiting, Bess, a comely beauty who attracts Raleigh's attention. Just as this standard triangle is established, there is a threat on Elizabeth's life known historically as the Babington Plot. Mary is beheaded for her connection to the plot, which gives Philip free rein to gain the Pope's approval to attack England. Elizabeth inspires her troops to face off with the much larger Spanish Armada, and the rest, as they say, is history.It's no surprise that Cate Blanchett commands the screen in the title role and does her best to fill in the blanks left by the routine script. She manages to imbue the Queen with a hidden vulnerability at which comparatively imperious predecessors like Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson merely hint. The one drawback is that she is too young for the role, a point emphasized by the periodic and somewhat conceited use of flashbacks from the previous film in which her appearance has not changed significantly despite the make-up. Geoffrey Rush returns from the first film as Elizabeth's adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, but he has less to do this time. As Raleigh, Clive Owen has no problem playing a dashing figure, but he seems more like a romantic's fabrication of what a bodice-ripping swashbuckler should be. Speaking with a strange burr, Samantha Morton has precious few scenes as the fanatical but forgiving Mary, and her pouty face and petulant manner seem at odds with previous characterizations. As Philip, Jordi Mollà is forced to play the king as a religious zealot, while Abbie Cornish's Bess strikes me as far too contemporary in manner to be credible as a lady-in-waiting, especially with the ongoing hints of lesbianism and a soft porn-like lovemaking scene with Raleigh.Guy Dyas' production design, Alexandra Byrne's costumes and Remi Adefarasin's cinematography are all impressive in their splendor and meticulous detail, though I found the music by Craig Armstrong and A.R. Rahman far too intrusive. There are several extras with the 2008 DVD release starting with Kapur's commentary track, often insightful but excessively verbose. An eleven-minute making-of featurette is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film. Three other shorts are included  one on Dyas' intensive work on the production design, one on the recreation of the climactic battle with a mix of ship replicas and CGI, and one on the actual locations used for the filming. There are nine minutes of deleted and extended scenes including one that too-realistically shows Mary's decapitated head. None of these extras helps make the experience of watching this film any more involving.",6,9,10,5 March 2008
The Producers," Still a Classic with Brooks, Wilder and Zero in Peak Form
","I have seen the smash hit Broadway musical version with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. While I love the update and added music and schtick, I have to say that I still prefer the original 1968 film upon which the show is based, the first movie Mel Brooks ever directed. By now, the story of two producers seeking to profit from a Broadway flop is familiar, but the concept is still priceless. The comedy scenes are original and nonstop, and unlike Brooks' later films, they actually seem to feed a solid, original storyline that does not take its inspiration from other films.Zero Mostel, with his greasy comb-over and heavy-lidded, bugged-out eyes, is the ideal choice to play has-been theatrical producer Max Bialystock. Though larger than life as always, he seems downright subdued at times compared to the sideshow of characters surrounding him. Somehow the thought of Mostel as a paid lothario for wealthy old ladies stretches beyond the bounds of credibility and taste, all the more reason to guffaw at his antics in securing investment money for his big production. With his saucer-eyed innocence and apologetic demeanor, Gene Wilder is equally hilarious as nebbish accountant Leo Bloom. All the familiar mannerisms are there, but in his first major film appearance, he seems just right in expressing first his disdain for Max's unsavory business practices and then his excitement in breaking out of his shell when he realizes he's about to become a big Broadway producer.My favorite scenes are among Brooks' most creative concoctions - the Hitler auditions; the too-close-for-comfort elevator ride with mincing assistant Carmen Giya; the euphoria Leo feels when he becomes corrupted as he skips around the Lincoln Center fountain; and of course, the elaborate opening number of the musical that Max and Leo hope will flop, 'Springtime for Hitler'. I still think the audience response immediately after the number is priceless, among Brooks' best shots, especially when the one guy who applauds is attacked. The entire supporting cast is great - the underrated Kenneth Mars as devoted Führer-loving Franz Liebkind, a pre-'Mr. Belvedere' Christopher Hewitt as the over-dramatic transvestite director Roger DeBris, Lee Meredith as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla (given several unrelated opportunities to go-go dance in a bikini - predating Goldie Hawn on TV's 'Laugh-In') and even Dick Shawn in full hippie-dippy mode as the star of the show, L.S.D. Although there are certain touches that date the film including Shawn's character, there is a sense of quaintness and even sweetness about it that does make you sad it has such a brief running time (90 minutes). There is a film version of the Broadway musical in the works, but I still think this movie stands on its own and continues to get better over the years. A deserved comedy classic.",9,1,1,11 March 2006
Flight," Washington Soars But This Flight Has More Than One Bumpy Landing
","That Denzel Washington is a movie star of the first rank is proved once again in Robert Zemeckis' 2012 crisis-driven character study, a film that starts out very strong but then turns into something of a morality play about addiction and personal accountability. Despite the slowdown in the narrative momentum, the actor lends a chilling honesty and his considerable charisma to his textured portrayal of Whip Whitaker, an ace commercial pilot for a regional Southern airline whose debilitating alcoholism forces him to live in a world of denial and distrust. He's middle-age, divorced, and estranged from his son, but he can still party hard with a sexy flight attendant and fly a jet airliner the morning after with the help of a line of cocaine. Their 9AM flight to Atlanta faces severe turbulence upon take-off, but it's nothing Whip can't handle with his skillful bravado intact. Having achieved momentary calm, he falls asleep at the controls after downing a couple of airline-size bottles of vodka mixed with orange juice. Suddenly the jet loses its hydraulics and descends uncontrollably with its engines on fire.To the shock of his by-the-book co-pilot, Whip decides to invert the plane and fly it upside down to achieve some stability in order to maneuver a last-ditch attempt at an emergency landing in an open field populated with a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Miraculously, only six of 102 passengers and crew perish upon impact, and Whip is hailed as a hero much like Sully Sullenberger after he heroically saved a jet on the Hudson River. This exacting sequence is as thrilling as they come in the movies, and Zemeckis ('Cast Away') brings a propulsive realism to what must have seemed like a fantastical idea in John Gatins' screenplay. What follows this life-changing incident is far less unique as it becomes clear that Whip's blood alcohol count was well over the legal limit during the flight, and the ensuing investigation could easily destroy his career and send him to prison on manslaughter charges. He gets help from former colleague Charlie Anderson, the pilots' union representative for the airline, as well as Hugh Lang, a severely humorless lawyer who is pushing hard to discredit the toxicology reports which prove Whip's unfit condition for flying. The ongoing public pressure of the case sends Whip into isolation at his late father's farm where he begins another downward spiral into alcohol.He gets involved with recovering heroin addict Nicole whose own story of desperation is juxtaposed with his until they meet at the hospital and enter into a relationship. All this leads to a climactic hearing with the National Transportation Safety Board where his fate will be determined. Washington is on screen for nearly the film's entire 139- minute running time, and his impassioned performance is fiercely without vanity. He is unafraid to show Whip's pathetic denial of accountability and brings a palpable face to his character's substance abuse. The supporting cast is solid with Don Cheadle lending a calm Machiavellian spirit to Lang and Bruce Greenwood a stalwart presence as unconditionally supportive Charlie. British actress Kelly Reilly ('Mrs. Henderson Presents') sports a convincing Southern accent, but I found her a bit too languid as Nicole. In pure scene-stealing mode, John Goodman plays Whip's unapologetic drug dealer Harling Mays like he was redoing Walter Sobchak in 'The Big Lebowski'. It's a comically anomalous turn but something of a relief especially during the sturm-und-drang of the film's second half. Speaking of which, Zemeckis and Gatins' unsubtle storytelling approach resuscitates all-too-familiar scenes of alcohol abuse that make the story feel more predictable than it had to be as the inevitable events play themselves out. Regardless, Washington makes the film eminently watchable.",6,0,2,23 November 2012
Rear Window," Voyeurism, Murder, Stewart and Kelly Make for a Hitch High
","It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films, but 1954's 'Rear Window' is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like 'Miss Torso' and 'Miss Lonelyhearts'. But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense, but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script. Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well, especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout, giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in 'Vertigo' but still likable even as he tries to reject his glamorous, sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first, but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella, while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr, pre-Perry Mason, shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character. Robert Burks' probing camera-work makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark film-making style, and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor, even the slow-motion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras, an hour-long documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort, and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes. One of Hitchcock's best in an impressive canon of work.",10,11,17,5 March 2006
Munich," Crisis of Conscience Explored in Vivid, Thrilling Detail by Spielberg in a Moralistic Mode
","Confounding expectations, Steven Spielberg has directed a relentlessly tense thriller based on the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and its aftermath that coalesces its often chilling, suspenseful elements into an almost 'Godfather'-like family saga about the obligation of duty and the crisis of conscience. The epic 2005 film doesn't completely work, but the unpredictable nature of the film keeps the momentum going for most of its 162-minute running time. Spielberg, regardless, should be lauded for taking well-remembered historical events within their context and making them resonate in today's politically charged environment.Co-written by the estimable Tony Kushner ('Angels in America') and Eric Roth from George Jonas's fictionalized book 'Vengeance', the movie opens with the familiar archived footage of ABC sports commentator Jim McKay reporting on the Black September terrorists kidnapping eleven Israeli athletes at Munich's Olympic village only to be gunned down hours later at the airport. The story then focuses on an undercover commando team instigated confidentially by Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir but officially disconnected from the Mossad, Israel's counterpart to the CIA. The motley group led by Avner Kaufman, Meir's former bodyguard and the son of a revered Israeli freedom fighter, is charged with finding the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the massacre and assassinating them one at a time. These are indeed acts of vengeance by a country who felt the need for respect as well as sympathy from a watchful global community, and the bulk of the movie is about how the team goes about with the killings.I have to admit that there is a sense of movie convention in the characters who make up the team  Robert, the guilt-sticken bomb expert; Steve, the sometime intolerably cocky driver; Hans, the ice-cold documents forger; and Carl, the anxious 'clean-up' man who by default, becomes the conscience of the group. However, the actors inhabiting the parts are all quite strong within these constraints, and there is particular standout work by Daniel Craig as Steve (he seems well poised to play James Bond in the roughhewn Connery manner) and Ciarán Hands as Carl. Alternating fluidly between coolly calculated actions and percolating indecisiveness and using his skills in the kitchen as a cathartic release, Eric Bana brings a soulful and increasingly haunting quality to Avner, the designated leader who somehow retains sympathy for his character while going about the business of killing. At times, he seems like an emotional cipher, but I think that helps in the story flow. And in fact, the complexities behind the politically motivated murders, which take place in a variety of exotic locations, are what drive the sometimes convoluted plot line.Geoffrey Rush does a convincing Israeli accent as Avner's by-the-book Mossad contact, Ephraim, and Lynn Cohen  yes, Miranda's Eastern European maid, Magda, on 'Sex in the City'  has a few effective moments at the beginning as the conflicted Meir. The movie, however, is not without its share of flaws. First, there is the red-herring use of a French contact with a father who is apparently legendary in the field of political intrigue and information peddling. While Mathieu Amalric and especially Michael Lonsdale give fine performances as Avner's contact, Louis, and his worldly father, their characters feel more like plot devices from another spy thriller entirely, especially as they expose their dysfunctional family set-up over lunch at a château to which Avner must be taken blindfolded. There is also a beautiful woman of mystery at a bar, which actually feels like it was cribbed from a similar scene in, of all movies, 'The Sting'. There is another flaw in the extended coda where I feel Spielberg misjudges the emotional parallels in the rather contrived cross-cutting between the athletes' killings and a bed scene between Avner and his wife.Nonetheless, Spielberg is a master when it comes to the set-up of the action sequences, whether it's a plan that goes awry with a child returning unexpectedly home or a shooting spree near the docks of Beirut or the killing of a Palestinian passionate about his inextricable need for a homeland. Naturally, the post-9/11 atmosphere lends particular resonance to all these scenes, though credit Spielberg for not making an overtly political statement along these lines. As always, the craftsmanship behind the production is first-rate, in particular, Janusz Kaminski's dramatically lit cinematography and Michael Kahn's blistering editing. Make no mistake that Spielberg has most definitely made a morality picture about the unending cycle of violence in the Middle East and at the end of it, really doesn't take sides on the issue. Certainly the volatility of the topic has prevented a strong film from Hollywoodat least until Spielberg was willing to helm this one. Kudos for that move.",8,2,4,3 January 2006
50_50," Slyly Comic and Ultimately Poignant Take on the Dreaded 'Cancer' Film
","Believe it or not, I wanted to see this movie based on just one line I heard in the trailer. Anna Kendrick's openly naïve therapist character says it to Adam Lerner, the cancer-stricken, 27-year-old protagonist played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - 'You can't change your situation. The only thing you can change is how you deal with the situation.' It's a predictable bromide but one that spoke to me at that very moment since I just got laid off from my job the day prior. Facing life's unexpected twists is what this 2011 dramedy is about, and director Jonathan Levine and screenwriter Will Reiser find a poignant, funny and off-kilter way of handling a standard Lifetime TV-movie subject without losing respect for the characters. The film tows a fine line dramatically, but perhaps because Reiser has first-hand knowledge of spinal cancer from his own personal experience, the story doesn't lose its footing.The film focuses on Adam, a Seattle-based NPR staffer whose comfortable life is turned upside down when he learns he has malignant tumors along his spine. With little empathy, the oncologist tells him he has a 50/50 chance of survival. Buoyed by his boisterous best friend Kyle, Adam tries to remain optimistic despite his overbearing mother Diane, who wants to move in with him right away despite acting as a caretaker for his father, an Alzheimer's victim. Remaining disturbingly distant is Adam's artist girlfriend Rachael who promises to stand by him and nurse him back to health. However, as he goes through his chemotherapy, her commitment to him unravels. The movie addresses the bitter irony of how those one would expect support Adam without condition are the ones who are the most likely to fail. At the same time, he grows closer to two fellow cancer patients, as well as Katherine, the awkward young therapist who utters the line that rings so true for Adam.The acting is effective without excess. As a last-minute replacement for James McAvoy ('X-Men: First Class'), Gordon-Levitt gives a nice, self-effacing performance as Adam that feels right for the passivity needed for the role. Playing a version of his real self since he is Reiser's best buddy and the one who encouraged him to write the script, Seth Rogen provides manic, shaggy-dog energy to Kyle as a direct counterpoint to Adam and then surprises by deepening his character as the story progresses. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Rachael as a more subtle version of the malevolent character she played in 'The Help', but she may be in danger of stereotyping herself in like-minded roles. Kendrick also plays a variation of a previous role as the ambitious careerist in 'Up in the Air', but she does a better job of transcending her character's youthful exuberance this time. Easily stealing her few scenes, Anjelica Huston brings back her much-missed ferocity to Diane. Unlike most, this is a most worthwhile 'cancer' movie.",8,0,1,26 October 2011
Get Him to the Greek," An Unexpected Comic Pairing Brings Laughs and Surprising Resonance to an Apatow Factory Farce
","There are moments that are laugh-out-loud riotous and there are others that are purely head-scratching, but the net effect of this raunchy, often clever 2010 anti-buddy comedy directed by Nicholas Stoller is genuinely positive. This is his second feature after 2008's 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', which served as the introduction to Russell Brand's character, Aldous Snow, a sexed-up, heroin-abusing, non-sequitur-spouting British rock star. In this screenplay co-written by Stoller and Jason Segel (who also co-wrote and starred in 'Sarah Marshall'), Aldous has been on the skids since the release of a publicly reviled album called 'African Child' - denounced as the worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid.What's worse is that Spice Girls-inspired pop star Jackie Q, his longtime girlfriend and mother of his child Naples, has left him for Lars Ulrich, the longtime drummer for Metallica. Meanwhile, Sergio Roma, a megalomaniacal label executive, is about to release Aldous from his contract when puppyish young staffer Aaron Green comes up with the high-risk idea of a comeback concert in LA, marking the 10th anniversary of Aldous' landmark show at the Greek Theater. The rest of the story is a 'Hangover'-type road movie of sorts between Aaron and Aldous, as Aaron has to fetch the rock star in London and get him to LA in time for the concert three days away. Predictably, nothing goes as planned as Aaron, in the throes of a sudden break-up with his overworked hospital intern girlfriend Daphne, gets seduced by Aldous' narcissistic excesses.What becomes less predictable is how Stoller and Segel choose to deepen Aldous enough to give the character a sense of introspection about his besotted life, including a side trip to Vegas where he reunites with his estranged father, a guitarist for a Rat Pack tribute show who is jealous of his son's success. At the same time, Roma is in hot pursuit to make sure Aaron does his job, and everyone gets involved in a drug-fueled mêlée that should serve as the definitive anti-drug commercial. Brand completely stole 'Sarah Marshall' from his cast mates, including Kirsten Bell, who played the title role and shows up in an unexpected cameo. Given this is a vehicle for his character, he manages to show more dimension to Aldous without losing sight of his hilarious comic creation (his opening video is hysterically tasteless). In a comparatively more constrained role, Jonah Hill manages to be regular-guy funny and brings surprising heart to put-upon Aaron.Together Brand and Hill convey a convincing sense of trust between the characters despite their opposite tendencies. On the sidelines, Rose Byrne shows real comic chops as the uninhibited Jackie Q, while Elisabeth Moss of 'Mad Men' makes Daphne far more than the wet rag she is set up to be in the story. Colm Meaney effectively plays Aldous' embittered father during the film's most serious scene, while Sean Combs is quite funny - in a good way - as Roma. It should come as no surprise that this whole venture was produced by Judd Apatow since his fingerprints are everywhere given all the comic and often crass male bonding throughout. Stoller's uneven direction explains the fluctuating variations in the movie's tone, and like every Apatow movie, the film runs about twenty minutes too long for the slight story being told. Brand and Hill, however, make an engaging duo no matter what.",7,0,4,7 June 2010
300," Unleashing a Massive Load of Testosterone in a Fancifully Gory Version of a Real-Life Battle
","In 480 B.C., the Battle of Thermopylae was a precursor of the more familiar Battle of the Alamo in 1836. Both were examples of how a small battalion of men was able to fend off a much larger army by a combination of resourcefulness, fortitude and sheer will. However, the scale of Thermopylae was far more dramatic as 300 Spartans under King Leonidas held at bay for three days over a quarter million Persians under Xerxes the Great. Directed with technical flourish by Zack Snyder, this visually elaborate 2007 action film is a fictionalized retelling of that momentous event as it was vividly envisioned in Frank Miller's 1999 graphic novel. Similar to the 2005 adaptation of Miller's 'Sin City', a constant parade of striking, often gory images is what drives the momentum of the screenplay co-written by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael P. Gordon. However, unlike that story and more similarly, Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator', a coherent narrative flow and a more involving sense of character development are lacking to a significant degree.The net result is a stylish piece of juvenile pop entertainment but hardly more substantive than a typical Italian sword-and-sandal picture from the early 1960's. Things start promisingly as we are presented with a cursory overview of Leonidas' fate as King of Sparta when he is separated from his mother at age seven to undergo the rigorous training necessary to have the courage and bloodlust of a true leader. The problem is that Snyder keeps painting the story's mythological aspects with broader and broader brushstrokes. Dialogue takes on a contemporary, almost comical tone that makes it difficult to take seriously the gravity of the events depicted. The battle scenes, especially an overindulgent use of slow motion, are equally outlandish with the gore so exaggerated and figures so grotesque (like the Uber-Immortal) that it makes it difficult to understand or even care about the motivations behind the characters' actions. Everything is larger than life and so lacking in detail and nuance that all the actors can do is accommodate the over-stylized treatment.The pumped-up, half-clothed bodies match up well with the comic book sensibilities on display here, chief among them Gerard Butler, who is ideally cast as Leonidas. It's not a complex role, but even with his distinctively Scottish brogue, he has no problem showcasing the nobility, stubbornness and mocking cockiness necessary to be leading such an audaciously fatalistic military strategy. Made up like a bejeweled NY-glam boy, Rodrigo Santoro seems less than a match for the commanding Leonidas as the seemingly omnipotent, seven-foot Xerxes. Better is Lena Headey as the Spartan queen Gorgo, whose devotion to Leonidas goes unabated in home front scenes, where she has to fend off the advances of the dastardly Theron while begging the state council to send more troops. The rest of the cast really doesn't register much beyond the epic film stereotypes they are playing, including David Wenham's obligatory turn as the narrator Dilios. It takes a certain artistry to provide grace and power to a story mythologized from a real event, but it appears most of the filmmakers' efforts lie on the surface.The two-disc 2007 DVD package should make fans palpitate with glee. Disc One has the best extra - the constantly informative commentary track from Snyder with periodic contributions from Johnstad and director of photography Larry Fong. There is no doubt Snyder did a lot of research, and he is extremely forthcoming with the behind-the-scenes details, which in this case, is very helpful. Disc Two contains a lot of small extras, the most prominent being the mostly intriguing 24-minute '300 Spartans: Fact or Fiction?', in which Miller, Snyder and historians discuss the painstaking detail as well as the liberties taken with this interpretation of the actual battle. Another historically oriented short and a brief making-of featurette are also included, as well as a quick short on the translation of the blue-screen images. Miller is interviewed separately in one fifteen-minute piece, and there is a multi-chapter Web production diary, which seems to be a more common feature on DVD sets these days.",6,2,3,19 February 2008
Pineapple Express," Loopy Stoner Comedy Hijinks and Quentin Tarantino-Level Action Make for a Guy-Friendly Free-for-All
","Co-written by star Seth Rogen and his partner Evan Goldberg, the ramshackle dialogue is familiar from any of the comedies from the Judd Apatow factory. The funniest bits are the throwaway lines delivered by Rogen as Dale Denton, a carefree process server who smokes reefer all day, dreams of being a radio talk-show host, and has a relationship with a high school girl named Angie. The movie's title refers to the new and powerful weed strain that Dale buys from a sweet-natured, likeably loopy dealer named Saul Silver. Both are quickly on the lam after Dale witnesses a grisly murder at the hands of criminal drug lord Ted Jones and his corrupt cop lover Carol. They try to elicit help from Saul's shifty but hilariously obtuse friend Red, but he rats on them to a pair of hit-men who are in hot pursuit of the comic pair.I have to admit that the film starts rather unpromisingly as a stoner comedy with a somewhat unsavory element in the romance Dale has with his underaged girlfriend. However, it picks up considerable comedy steam when Dale and Saul become paranoid as much from their excessive smoking as their on-the-run situation. Director David Gordon Green, a filmmaker known more for his indie work like 'George Washington', also brings a refreshing human element to key moments within the escalating shenanigans, especially when the bond between Dale and Saul becomes hilariously intractable. It also becomes clear that Dale's relationship with Angie is based on his emotional immaturity versus a Lolita complex.As Dale, the schlubby Rogen is really doing nothing different here than he did in 'Knocked Up', though his baseline character's object of affection has shifted discernibly from a beautiful entertainment reporter to a dealer and his doobies. An actor etched in my memory for his startling turn as James Dean in the 2002 telepic, a stringy-haired James Franco manages to be funny and intriguingly poignant in an off-kilter way. The scene stealers, however, turn out to be Danny McBride (the suspicious brother in last year's 'The Heartbreak Kid'), who survives every action-thriller cliché imaginable, and Craig Robinson (the hilariously observant nightclub bouncer in 'Knocked Up') as the overly sensitive hit-man Matheson. Left far to the sidelines are Gary Cole not nearly interesting enough as Jones and a strangely cast Rosie Perez acting quite butch as Carol.Ed Begley, Jr., has a funny bit as Angie's beleaguered dad, and Ken Jeong (the obnoxious ob-gyn in 'Knocked Up') shows up as one of the ninjas from the Asian crime syndicate. Overlong at 110 minutes, the movie shifts gears into Quentin Tarantino territory during the last third - first with a predictably wild car chase scene and then the particularly over-the-top mayhem at the grow house where the Pineapple Express is harvested. As a silly overture, the opening black-and-white scene, set seventy years prior, has Bill Hader as a soldier smoking copious amounts of marijuana to test his mettle, but make no mistake that this is at heart a stoner buddy film, a point made clear by the film's hangover scene in the diner. There's a lot of funny stuff in this film, and much of it is well-played, but the audience is clearly pre-determined by the subject. If you are repelled by the thought of watching guys getting high for nearly two hours, then I say just skip it.",6,4,14,11 August 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Python Silliness Still Holds Up in Special Two-Disc Set
","With the opening of Mike Nichols' and Eric Idle's 'Spamalot' on Broadway last month, it's a good time to revisit the 1975 comedy classic that inspired the musical. Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly. If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say 'Ni!', a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.Well packaged, the two-disc set has several extras. The main menu on the first disc is funny in itself with an option for the hard of hearing. There are two alternative commentary tracks. The first is newer and features Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin; the second was recorded much earlier with Gilliam and Jones. Both are informative but only fitfully funny since they defer to the movie. The second disc has 'Mindless Sing-Alongs!', where three scenes are taken from the film and subtitled so that once can sing along to the amusing 'Knights of the Round Table' (which inspired the Broadway show title, 'We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spam a lot.'), 'Sir Robin' or chant along in 'Monk's Chant'. There is a hysterical little 'educational' short entitled 'How to Use Your Coconut' and two scenes dubbed in Japanese. But the highlight is a 45-minute documentary called 'The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations,' in which Jones and Palin explore the various film locations with humor and a sense of deserved nostalgia. Other features include a mock interview with the cast done during the filming, a Lego version of 'The 'Knights of the Round Table' song and various sundry features suitable primarily for a Pythonite. For non-Pythonites, the film is still worth a look at a comedy that only looks better with all the witless dreck produced now.",8,1,2,5 March 2006
Sin City," High POW Factor for Audacious Thrill Ride Into Sin City
","A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's 'Sin City' graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants. It takes a visual cue from last year's 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white 'Schindler's List'). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as 'Special Guest Director' though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' 'Death Becomes Her' (which coincidentally also starred Bruce Willis).The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esquire Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's '9 1/2 Weeks', Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall, a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona) and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character. The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before 'Traffic'. Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch.Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer. All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow. But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride.",8,2,4,14 December 2005
The Ugly Truth," Standard Rom-Com or Gross-Out Comedy? A Belabored Movie That Can't Make Up Its Mind
","This 2009 movie proves that women - in this case, screenwriters Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith - can write romantic comedies just as poorly as men can. As directed by Robert Luketic ('Legally Blonde'), the idea behind this misfire is to cross-pollinate the most tired conventions of the female-focused genre with the sensibilities of the recent spate of raunchy, man-boy comedies, this latter genre having found its unequivocal leader in Judd Apatow. However, unlike Apatow, who has figured out how to make films that are insightful as well as funny like 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up' (ironically featuring this film's star, Katherine Heigl), Luketic shows no such finesse as everything in this film feels labored with the principal actors Heigl and Gerard Butler overplaying their opposites-attracts roles to near-cartoon proportions. Moreover, there are so many absurd gross-out gags inserted in this film that it feels like the creators (including executive producer Heigl) completely miscalculates who its target audience appears to be.The strictly by-the-numbers plot centers on Abby Richter, an uptight, overachieving producer for a ratings-challenged morning talk show in, of all places, Sacramento. Her workplace is full of the stock characters you would expect in this type of formulaic movie - the demanding station manager, the show's vainglorious co-hosts with empty smiles and non-ironic deliveries, the inane segments that make up Abby's struggling show. Predictably, her personal life is burdened by an incessant, programmatic search for Mr. Right, and consequently, her one-time dates become a series of qualification interviews. Prospects don't look much better at work with her show's ratings, and so enters local cable-access celebrity, Mike Chadway, a chauvinist personality who regales in providing sexist advice on what men are really looking for in women. Naturally, it comes down to guys wanting nothing but sex and how women should do everything they can to encourage it.Ratings rise based on the prurient content and Mike's unapologetic behavior, and even Abby recognizes his prowess in tapping into the public's psyche, so much so that on a stay-or-get-fired wager, Mike convinces her that he can be her Cyrano to help her land her neighbor, a handsome doctor who meets all of Abby's superficial qualifications. As tired as the premise sounds (and it is), the movie's pain points are exacerbated by the constant need to humiliate Abby, mainly through simulations of sexual acts in public. Obviously a knock-off of Meg Ryan's fake orgasm scene in 'When Harry Meets Sally', the most notoriously contrived episode involves a pair of electronic panties that cause her to writhe uncontrollably in front of her corporate sponsors. Heigl seems to be playing the same model of efficiency in all her big-screen roles, and as Abby, she plays her stereotype on hyper-drive, for instance, hanging upside down from a tree in her underwear or doing her happy dance repeatedly.Burying his Scottish brogue under an accent that sounds suspiciously like Mel Gibson's, Butler should be careful about accepting roles like Mike because he could otherwise turn into a Matthew McConaughey-type of actor, a promising career start ('Dear Frankie') followed by bad commercially-driven choices. The other actors make little impression with even the comic talents of John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines wasted as the shallow talk show co-hosts. The ending is predictable and poorly matted on a hot-air balloon, and the denouement brings an unnecessarily cynical exclamation point to the whole venture. The 2009 DVD is unsurprisingly, mostly filler - a gag reel, a set of alternative endings, and a couple of featurettes – the first about the differences in the male and female points of view and the second about the apparent hilarity in making this film. I'm glad the cast and crew had a good time, me not so much.",3,12,22,15 November 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Emotional Connectivity Blends with Visual Panache in Boyle's Hindi Fanciful Tale of Destiny
","It's difficult to categorize a film that takes as many precariously driven dramatic turns as this 2008 picture directed by the versatile Danny Boyle. So why even bother since he manages to navigate fluidly between the feel-bad and feel-good extremes of Simon Beaufoy's ('Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day') emotionally dense script with aplomb? The apt title refers to someone who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, and in this case, is on the verge of becoming very wealthy due to a serendipitous situation that leads him to be a finalist on the Hindi version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' On the surface, the premise sounds rather silly, but the familiar game show, already a trivia footnote in this country, provides the catalyst for the vividly rendered events that unfold for one particular boy named Jamal Malik, a coffee carrier at a local telemarketing company. Contrivances aside, it is his life experiences that feed him the answers to the increasingly difficult questions, but the producers suspect a scam at work and have the police torture him in order to confess. What really emerges is Malik's undying devotion to his one true love, Latika, from whom he has long been estranged due to the desperate circumstances in her life.The movie's childhood flashbacks have a Dickensian quality set against a cultural tableau unfamiliar to most of us. They focus on young Jamal and his older brother Salim, who are soon orphaned after their mother is killed for being a Muslim. They are joined by another abandoned orphan Latika, and together they dub themselves the Three Musketeers. They eventually find themselves indentured under the servitude of the deceptively kind Maman, who goes to extremes in keeping the children as street beggars. The brothers escape and eventually figure out how to scam tourists at the Taj Mahal, while Latika suffers the consequences of being left with Maman. The rest of the plot shows how the brothers diverge in values and how Latika becomes an unwilling mistress for a rival gang leader. Amazingly, Beaufoy's screenplay juxtaposes these spiraling events with the multiple-choice questions posed by Prem, the jocular 'Millionaire' host, a popular figure who reveals his own sleazy underside in short order. There is such a swirl of activity with every episode in the film that there is little time to question the plausibility of the many plot turns because the resulting implausibility is what makes the movie so arresting.Boyle gives co-directing credit to Loveleen Tandan, previously a casting director specializing in India-themed films like Mira Nair's 'Monsoon Wedding' and 'Vanity Fair', and it's obvious that the combination of their talents gives us a greater intimacy into India than one would expect from Boyle by himself. Other than his charming fable, 'Millions', there is little indication in Boyle's resume (the sci-fi shocker 'Sunshine', the post-apocalyptic thriller '28 Days Later', the drug-infested 'Trainspotting') that he would have been capable of telling such a fanciful tale so convincingly. At the same time, the visual flourishes (thanks primarily to the stunning cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantel) and fast-cut editing reflect his familiar touches. The no-frills performances befit the story with Dev Patel bringing emotional focus to the grown Jamal and Frieda Pinto appropriately fetching as the grown Latika. Smaller roles are filled with a few more familiar faces with Indian movie icon Anil Koopar playing Prem and character actor Irrfan Khan (the father in 'The Namesake') as the determined police inspector. There are times when the film feels overly manipulative, but the buoyant spirit keeps thing afloat just when you feel you've been left on sensory overload.",9,2,5,4 January 2009
The Social Network," Ironic Biopic of a Social Outcast Capturing the Zeitgeist of Online Social Connection
","This propulsive 2010 film is probably the most conspicuous case of product placement in recent Hollywood memory. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin prove to be a particularly effective team in bringing to vivid life the somewhat trite story of the betrayal behind a Web site that reshaped the chore of networking into the zeitgeist of the online community reaching 500 million participants. The irony is that the movie is not really about the Facebook phenomenon itself but its opaque creator, nineteen-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, a socially impervious Harvard-based hacker extraordinaire whom the creators would have you believe developed Facebook as a way to get back at the girl who dumps him and the elitists who reject him. However, Sorkin is far too shrewd to turn this into a simple revenge story. Instead, he uses these factors as catalysts in his inspiration to ignite the basic need we have to judge other people in the safe haven of a site populated by people who are otherwise socially disconnected.The story's framing device centers around the detailed depositions given in two concurrent lawsuits against Zuckerberg - one filed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, identical twins and star members of Harvard's rowing team, along with their business partner Divya Narendra, and the other filed by Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's former best friend. The Winklevoss twins filed a suit claiming they originated the idea for Facebook when Zuckerberg agreed to help them build a Harvard-only community site. The second suit cuts deeper in that Saverin, a Facebook co-founder, finds his ownership in the company cut from a third to one-tenth of one percent. The decision is not without merit since Saverin's singular determination in eliciting advertisers to the site did nothing to help the site gain popularity. At the same time, it reflected Zuckerberg's socially inert nature – whether true or not - showing he is incapable of maintaining a deep friendship not out of malice or greed but because he has the unrelenting fortitude to recognize he has a better idea to code and implement despite the personal consequences. It's a fascinating conundrum that requires Fincher's emotionally precise direction to make it work effectively.In a tough role, Jesse Eisenberg ('Adventureland') plays Zuckerberg close to the vest by showing sparks of humanity with measured acuity. It's a well-observed performance that relies on keeping a clear distance from the viewer. Justin Timberlake does well in the showy supporting role of Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a savvy, paranoid poseur whose bona fide sleaziness provides the impetus Facebook needs to turn it into a global phenomenon. However, it's Andrew Garfield who gives the movie the little heart it has as Saverin simply because we feel his devastation in missing a once-in-anyone's-lifetime opportunity by trusting a friend whom he thought had his back. There are sharp, near-cameo turns by Douglas Urbanski ('Inside Job') as Harvard president Larry Summers, contemptuously arrogant in his dismissal of the Winklevoss' plea for support in their case against Zuckerberg; Rooney Mara who makes her character's numbing rejection of Zuckerberg palpable; and Rashida Jones ('I Love You Man') as a junior defense attorney who provides Zuckerberg the only honest summation of his legal chances to win. Fincher has made an intentionally cool, often detached film, compounded by a jarring Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score, but the hope of making a real, honest connection always seem to be within reach.",8,1,2,14 October 2010
The Proposal," Starts Off with Snap and Verve But Moves Soon Enough Into Predictable Rom-Com Territory
","Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's 'The Devil Wears Prada', I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's 'While You Were Sleeping', including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingénue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher ('27 Dresses') and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis' 'Crash' in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens ('The Mary Tyler Moore Show') and less like Rose Nylund ('The Golden Girls'). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman ('Watchmen') is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nuñez ('The Office') grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution.",6,31,48,19 October 2009
Hustle & Flow," Confounds Expectations With Powerful Ensemble Acting and Relatable Idealism
","Surprisingly powerful performances dominate what is essentially a familiar story of a man who dreams of having a better existence than the one he has. What's revelatory is the atmosphere that director-screenwriter Craig Brewer paints in this bitingly realistic film focused on DJay, a Memphis pimp desperate to change his marginalized life and become a rapper to get out of the ghetto. He's obviously bright and articulate but morally bankrupt, as he makes a living selling the services of two women, the young but world-weary Nola and the embittered stripper Lexus, with a third prostitute at home, the self-defeating Shug, pregnant with his child. In the midst of a mid-life crisis, DJay reconnects with an old schoolmate, Key, who is now a sound engineer for a local church, who in turn, introduces DJay to Shelby, a white musician with his own beat machine. Together they cut a demo tape that DJay plans to give a local celebrity, hip-hop rapper Skinny Black, at a 4th of July party thrown by a mutual friend Arnel.The film takes a while to gain its momentum, as Brewer establishes the gritty realism of his setting before moving the plot along. Credit Amy Vincent's verité-style cinematography, which makes us inhabit the ghetto setting without caution. Thanks mostly to Terrence Howard's searing portrayal of DJay, the story gains a palpable soul in his struggle to make it. Make no mistake in assuming the movie will be unrelentingly bleak and violent. It is, in certain ways, an idealistic film about finding one's destiny no matter how onerous the odds. Brewer is wise to keep his focus on the characters rather than the situation as the actors deliver the goods in unexpected ways. Comic actor Anthony Anderson is surprisingly subtle as Key, and along with Elise Neal's sharp turn as his high-strung, upwardly mobile wife Yevette, represents the middle-class black lifestyle with observational precision.The three women who play the prostitutes leave vivid impressions - Paula Jai Parker powerfully shows the angry desperation of the aging Lexus; Taryn Manning combines the hick and huckster of Nola, the only one making DJay money; and in the film's most poignant performance, Taraji P. Henson brings heart and painful melancholy to Shug. When she discovers her vocal chops during a recording session or innocently brings in a lava lamp, Henson is heartbreakingly impressive. Ludicrous makes his key moments count as the nihilistic Skinny Black. There are also some predictable plot turns that move the story toward cliché, including a conclusion that teeters on melodrama, but the Brewer's original execution compensates. Above all else, it's Howard who makes the film resonate with a rich, multi-dimensional characterization. As he moves fluently back and forth between scarifying and tender, Howard makes DJay not heroic but real and painfully wanting of a better lot in life.The DVD has several extras - Brewer's insightful commentary on an alternate audio track and three solid featurettes that lend insight to the production - 'Behind the Hustle', which includes the cast members talking about their roles and showing their various auditions; 'By Any Means Necessary', in which Brewer and producers John Singleton and Stephanie Allain talk about the struggles to get the film made; and 'Creatin' Crunk', which showcases the various funk and rap stars called upon to create the memorable songs DJay and the others perform throughout the film. There is also a disposable clip of the Memphis premiere.",8,0,0,17 January 2006
The Birds," Visceral Terror and Freudian Psychodrama Meld Seamlessly in Hitchcock Masterwork
","I remember as a child in the late 1960's watching this Alfred Hitchcock masterwork in the darkened family room and being terrified awaiting the next bird attack. It was great, and to my pleasure, it still is. Now that I am far more familiar with Hitchcock's filmography and realize the gamut of sophisticated drama and thrilling suspense he created in his long career, I think 1963's 'The Birds' is far and away the wonderfully visceral experience he produced on screen. The film is one part allegory on man's impudence over nature and one part family psychodrama full of unresolved feelings, and the two parts work seamlessly together thanks to Evan Hunter's shrewd screenplay. Hitchcock recognizes that more than the technical effects he amassed to simulate the surreal, bludgeoning bird attacks, the actual storytelling is what drives the plot.Although the birds provide an ominous presence from the outset, it starts with a flirtatious, love-hate romance between spoiled socialite Melanie Daniels and insolent attorney Mitch Brenner. Seeking but failing to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his little sister Cathy, Mitch travels to his family home in the friendly hamlet of Bodega Bay north of San Francisco. Motivated by her attraction to Mitch, Melanie goes up to leave the lovebirds secretly at his home, but oddly, a seagull attacks her as she pilots a boat on the bay. This is the start of what becomes a series of attacks that increase in scope and terror, and what I appreciate about Hitchcock's style is how he manages to build to them gradually, almost nonchalantly until the moment of strike when he lets the birds take over the screen. Equally intriguing is the way the characters are presented, especially Mitch's subtly dysfunctional family, and react to the attacks.In a surprising twist, Hitchcock eschews the glamorous stars he usually casts for the leads, though ironically the journeyman-level contributions of Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor seem to work in the film's favor as they don't distract from the allegorical storyline. Taking over for Grace Kelly, Hedren manages to exude the sophistication if not quite the complexity of Melanie. As Mitch, Taylor has always been a lunkish presence on screen and barely charismatic enough to elicit such fervent behavior from the women around him, but he manages the heroic sincerity necessary in the role. Far better are Jessica Tandy, who sublimates her natural likability to play Mitch's controlling, needy mother Lydia, and a sonorous Suzanne Pleshette as repressed schoolteacher Annie who still longs for Mitch despite Lydia's objections. I also love Ethel Griffies's bit as the elderly ornithologist who happens to be there to explain the genesis of the various bird species.Even though the matte shots look dated compared to today's seamless computer animation, the effects are still startling, and some scenes are developed brilliantly, in particular, the schoolyard accumulation leading to a direct attack on the running children. There are quirks that are a bit frustrating for their artificiality - heavy use of back-screen projection, the predictable behavior of stereotypical town folk - but none of this detracts from the superb craftsmanship and breathless pacing toward the apocalyptic ending. There are several extras included with the DVD, the best being the looking-back documentary, 'All About The Birds'. This represents grand execution by a true master.",9,2,5,4 March 2006
Cinderella Man," Old-Fashioned Story Strong on Historical Context and the One-Two Punch of Crowe and Giamatti
","As he proved with 1995's 'Apollo 13', director Ron Howard has an innate capacity of taking a well-known historical event and building suspense around an inevitable outcome. That's because he is adept at developing characters that reach deeper than the facts presented in standard docudramas. This time out, he takes a well-worn leitmotif in movies, the underdog overriding the odds to become a world champion, and puts a plush, sepia-toned design to this Depression-era story about light heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock. The movie is as old-fashioned as Hollywood movies come, but Howard also seems intent on presenting an interesting period of American history that has often been overlooked in recent films.Starting as a contender in late 1928, he deteriorates into fighting second-rate bouts five years later until he breaks his hand, at which point he is relegated to ad hoc longshoremen jobs on the New Jersey docks. Braddock gets a chance at redemption when his former manager, Joe Gould, offers him $250 to fight a heavyweight contender. He unexpectedly confounds the bookmakers and wins, which eventually leads him to a shot at the title against the heavily-favored opponent, Max Baer. Since the main story structure is rather predictable, Howard, driven by a period-authentic script by Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth, focuses on the atmosphere and the effect of the Depression on families struggling to survive. For example, the details around Madison Square Garden and the 'Hooverville' in Central Park feel genuine, and when Braddock hits rock bottom and begs for money from his backers, the scene has an unflinching honesty about how his humiliation has been superseded by his need to get his children back from relatives.It certainly helps to have Russell Crowe portray Braddock in a committed performance that would make Spencer Tracy proud. While it doesn't rank with his subtly complex work in 'The Insider' or 'A Beautiful Mind', his heroic performance is top-notch for this type of venture. The film's other sturdy performance comes from Paul Giamatti, who gives Joe a humanistic spirit that provides Braddock his path toward victory. I wish I could say the same for Renée Zellweger, who plays the June Allyson role of Braddock's wife Mae, with squinty-eyed worry and stiff upper-lip devotion, spouting the script's most sentimental lines ('You are the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!'). It just seems like a sophomoric role for such a proved actress. Smaller roles are filled out expertly, in particular, Paddy Considine as a Communist colleague who wants to force anarchy to make the government respond to the starving masses; Bruce McGill as the mercenary promoter; and Craig Bierko - who seems to be finally graduating from his golden-boy TV-movie roles - as the boastful, menacing Baer (probably an unfair portrait but one that works within this narrative).It's intriguing that for all the old-fashioned drama developed toward the final bout, that the more penetrating insight in the movie comes from how the period of FDR's New Deal really did not provide a timely response to the people who faced the degradation of poverty and starvation. Braddock is shown as a symbol for the downtrodden which the administration could not fathom in resuscitating hope for people. The DVD contains an insightful audio commentary track with Howard accompanied by screenwriters Goldman and Hollingsworth, as well as deleted scenes and several featurettes about the production. The most interesting addition though is about the subject himself, 'Jim Braddock: The Friends & Family Behind The Legend'.",8,0,1,12 December 2005
The Simpsons Movie," How to Extend, Expand and Humanize a Too-Familiar Cartoon for the Big Screen
","Credited to no less than fifteen writers, this 2007 big-screen version of the still-running animated series (unbelievably in its 19th season) is fast, frenzied and funny. I haven't watched an episode of 'The Simpsons' since the mid-1990's when I started to sense retread, but the movie directed by David Silverman reminds me how furiously clever the show can be with its unique mix of political incorrectness and pop-culture savvy. Moreover, at 87 minutes, or nearly four times the length of a regular episode, the plot never really flags, a startling accomplishment in itself. That's not to say the story doesn't sputter in spots from its own ambitious scope, especially in the last third, but the familiar characters seem revitalized by a plot that not only takes well-deserved potshots at organized religion and the EPA but reexamines the relationships within the nuclear family with surprising poignancy.An elaborate 'Itchy & Scratchy' space adventure starts the movie, and then the plot begins in earnest as Green Day performs on a barge disintegrating from all the toxic substances in Lake Springfield. Community apathy has turned the once-bucolic setting into a life-threatening cesspool, reason enough for Simpson daughter Lisa to reignite her social activism. At the same time, Homer continues to eschew fatherhood, this time in favor of a pig he has decided to adopt and serenade ('Spider-Pig' is an instant classic). He decides to accumulate the pig's waste in a gigantic silo, the aromatic ingredients of which he dumps into the lake. This sets off a natural disaster so monumental that EPA head Russ Cargill (a doppelganger for Michael Brown) quarantines the entire town under a giant dome. The townspeople of Springfield become an angry mob out to lynch Homer, and the rest of the movie follows his circuitous journey toward community responsibility and environmental awareness.Simpsons fans can rest assured that all five principal characters - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie - are intact, and the voice actors have completely defined their characters with special mention going to Julie Kavner's frog-voiced drawl as Marge and Dan Castellaneta's buffoonery personified as Homer. Except for Ned Flanders, who becomes Bart's unctuously sensitive replacement father, most of the familiar supporting characters are relegated to cameos. Albert Brooks provides the voice of the Machiavellian Cargill, and Tom Hanks has a funny bit as his avuncular self. Although there are several amusing sequences, my favorite has to be the Disney-inspired foreplay scene between Homer and Marge out in the Alaskan wilderness. Most importantly, the writers successfully magnify and even exaggerate the human dimensions of these all-too-familiar characters in a way that feels fresh and textured.The primary draw of the 2007 DVD are the two commentary tracks offered - the first with producer and series creator James L Brooks, Simpsons creator Matt Groening among others and the second a more technically oriented discussion with Silverman and several of the sequence directors. The first track is the one to experience since they stop the film for more specific discussion of key sequences, which extends the film's running time by fifteen minutes. Otherwise, there are less than ten minutes of deleted scenes and special features. Series fans won't be disappointed and the rest of us can enjoy the movie, too.",8,1,2,27 January 2008
All the President's Men," Proof Positive That Truth Is More Compelling Than Fiction
","It is amazing how compulsively watchable this 1976 non-fiction political thriller is given we already know the outcome and how the two Washington Post reporters spotlighted, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, thrived afterward. What is even more impressive now versus three decades ago is how dramatically resonant the labyrinth plot is relative to what is being reported on the current administration. Having just read Bruce Bartlett's 'Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy', the author draws strong, irrefutable analogies between Bush and Nixon. Now having watched this superbly rendered historic film, the parallels are almost eerie in how the plot developments foreshadow the clandestine activities highlighted in a bevy of contemporary political books including Bartlett's.Based on the 1974 book written by Woodward and Bernstein, the movie follows the two ambitious, unproven reporters from their breaking coverage of the Watergate break-in to the final headline on the AP wire of Nixon's resignation. Unsurprisingly, all this is done without the direct involvement of the incriminated officials, yet their off-screen presence casts a vast, impenetrable shadow on the investigation covered. The result is a suspenseful storyline that winds tighter and tighter as new evidence comes to light and the evasive participants come forward in the most elliptical manner. The cast is terrific but secondary to the intricacy of William Goldman's compelling screenplay and the documentary-style realism of the setting all masterfully directed by Alan J. Pakula. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman play 'Wood-stein' convincingly and for the most part unobtrusively, though Hoffman's naturally manic personality seeps out periodically and for good reason. Jason Robards plays Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee with his trademark authority as he begrudgingly moves forward in supporting the boys.Stalwart character actors Jack Warden and Martin Balsam play the other key figures in the press room giving the green light to the increasingly controversial news stories. In lesser roles and cameos, Pakula populates the film with a number of familiar faces from TV and movies - Ned Beatty, Hal Holbrook, Stephen Collins, John McMartin, Penny Fuller, Meredith Baxter, Neva Patterson, Polly Holliday - and they all register one way or the other. The standout is Jane Alexander as a fearful accountant working on the staff of the Nixon re-election committee - in just two brief scenes, she skillfully alternates between stonewalling, cowering and divulging in front of the intrepid reporters with ebbing fury. Through the course of the film, names from the past - Haldeman, Liddy, Hunt, Mitchell, Magruder, Segretti - come back with their infamy intact, as the covert CIA operations threaten to rock the Nixon administration beyond repair. Truth be told, unless you have a familiarity with the Watergate scandal, you will be swimming in the plethora of facts presented, but the propulsive pacing more than compensates for such presumptions.Now in a 30th anniversary two-disc set, the movie has been justifiably revitalized for a new generation with some wonderful extras. Redford's commentary is first-rate - illuminating from his perspective as both actor and producer. There is a Holbrook-narrated documentary, 'Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of All the President's Men', on the book-to-film transition, and another short about the impact of Woodward and Bernstein's legacy on present-day investigative reporting (though no mention of Woodward's current controversy in withholding information in the Plame scandal). There is an invaluable profile on W. Mark Felt, the FBI's then-second-in-command who has been disclosed as the real 'Deep Throat'. A 1976 making-of featurette has been included as well.",9,8,12,9 March 2006
The Fighter," Three Powerful Turns in a Biopic That Favors Family Dynamics Over Rounds in the Ring
","A trio of remarkable performances propels this frenetic, punch-drunk take on a dysfunctional family saga, and the compelling 2010 drama marks a return to form for iconoclastic director David O. Russell (his last film was the failed existential comedy, 2004's 'I Heart Huckabees'). Written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson, the film tells the fact-based story of boxing half-brothers 'Irish' Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund, eking out a blue-collar existence in Lowell, Massachusetts. Dicky once went the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard back in 1978, but it's the mid-1980's now, and he's vainly trying to recapture that moment of notoriety. Micky, on the other hand, remains firmly in Dicky's shadow, as he tries to follow in his footsteps and become a professional fighter. Most of the plot focuses on the demons that haunt and control them. Dicky's are internal as he has deteriorated into a scarifying crack addict and criminal, while Micky's struggles come from the stranglehold his family has on his life and career. Dicky is Micky's trainer, and their hell-bent, bottle-blonde mother Alice is his manager, neither of whom are willing to admit that they aren't savvy enough to get Micky a decent shot at the welterweight title.Micky's one personal salvation comes from his no-nonsense girlfriend Charlene, a tough-talking bartender who goes toe to toe with Alice and her seven grown, detestable daughters. Naturally, this sets the stage for a battle over Micky's soul. The irony of the film is that Micky has to be a dramatically inert figure since he is really a victim of his family's volatility. Consequently, Mark Wahlberg leverages his likable average-guy demeanor to play him in an economic manner that manages to evoke sympathy for his stoic, often passive character. This gives room for Christian Bale to steal his scenes handily with blazing intensity as Dicky. He dropped thirty pounds to shape his wiry, bug-eyed performance, and it sears in the memory. The gifted Melissa Leo ('Frozen River', 'Conviction') is equally fearless as the manipulative Alice, a vainglorious Lady Macbeth figure who is willing to steer her son toward failure if it means he won't abandon her. As Charlene, Amy Adams ('Enchanted') surprises the most with a flurry of F-bombs that serve to protect her clear-eyed commitment to Micky, even though her character has been developed mostly on one angry note. All three deserve recognition during the awards season.If the movie has one persistent flaw, it's that most of the rest of the characters are reduced to caricatures, especially Alice's big-haired daughters who act like a dispiriting Greek chorus to the proceedings (and strangely no bratty children surrounding them). The comic moments are welcome, but sometimes the approach feels like it cheapens the story. Russell's idiosyncratic filmmaking style is evident throughout with the camera constantly shifting to match the nervous energy of the narrative. In order to stick to the facts, he and the screenwriters shift the story in the home stretch to Micky's journey toward the title and more or less, abandon the head-butting family dynamics driving most of the story. Although the film ties up the fate of the characters neatly, it begins to feel more like 'Rocky' than 'Raging Bull' toward the end, and a certain hollowness permeates the film's resolution, even though cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema does an excellent job staging the fights leading to the inevitable ending. However, these are forgivable lapses in judgment given the stellar work of Leo, Adams and especially Bale.",8,3,5,19 January 2011
Up in the Air," Incisive Look at Life's Emotional Baggage Through the Journeys of a Corporate Hatchet Man
","As someone who has both laid off staff and a year later, became the victim of a layoff after twelve years with the same company, I had a personal interest in seeing how director/co-screenwriter Jason Reitman ('Thank You for Smoking', 'Juno') was going to adapt Walter Kirn's smart, unsettling 2001 novel. Even though eight years have elapsed since the book's publication, the filmmaker - along with co-writer Sheldon Turner - manages to deepen Kirn's themes in this wry, emotionally resonant 2009 dramedy and make them even more relevant with the pervasive downsizing of corporate America. The movie also manages to surprise even when certain plot turns seem evident before they occur. Initially, there is a veneer of cynicism that makes you think the story will be an abject lesson in the impermanence of life, but instead, it evolves into one man's journey into the heart of the emotional turbulence he had been careful to avoid. Toward that end, Reitman seems to be inspired by Alexander Payne's equally perceptive road movies, 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways', films that reflect a similar storytelling style.The plot focuses on laser-sharp corporate layoff consultant Ryan Bingham, a man who regales in the impermanence of life by traveling 322 days on the road, informing targeted employees that they are about to lose their jobs. There is a necessary callousness in his approach, but he knows it's necessary to be present and honest when it comes to conveying the unpleasant news. Bingham is also a motivational speaker who espouses unburdening one's life of possessions and fitting everything essential within the confines of a backpack. Proving his case, he lives in hotels, airplanes, and airport terminals with his one life goal being the seventh person to collect ten million frequent-flier miles. If you can get past the Spartan one-bedroom apartment he keeps in Omaha for the 43 days he is forced to be at home, the hatchet man appears to lead a charmed if rather solitary life. Complications, however, ensue on both personal and professional fronts.Bingham meets a fellow transient traveler named Alex Goran in an airport lounge and assesses that he may have found his soul-mate, so much so that he invites her to come to his estranged sister's wedding in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Bingham's boss wants to introduce a new strategy proposed by a fresh-faced, post-grad school upstart. New hire Natalie Keener suggests using remote teleconferencing to perform the layoff notifications. Since the new technology is the antithesis of Bingham's one-on-one method, he brings Natalie along on the road to show her how it can't possibly work. In a role that feels custom-tailored to all his strengths, George Clooney plays Bingham with an emotional precision that complements his charismatic persona which pivots between swaggering and self-effacing. On one hand, it's his most definitive movie-star role, and yet Clooney has never revealed as much about himself on screen.The always watchable Vera Farmiga ('The Departed', 'Down to the Bone') is sexy and confident as the woman who seems perfect for Bingham, even though their adroit compatibility could not possibly sustain an actual commitment. Their interplay is fun to watch because there is a Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell-level rapport that keeps both on their toes. Anna Kendrick ('Twilight') is winning as Natalie even if her character's naiveté feels a bit manufactured at times. Jason Bateman ('Juno') has a field day playing Bingham's smarmy boss, while Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey ('Heavenly Creatures'), and Danny McBride ('Pineapple Express') plays their accustomed types with aplomb as members of Bingham's immediate family. In cameos, J.K. Simmons ('Juno') and Zach Galifianakis ('The Hangover') sharply play two of the victimized employees, but for the rest, Reitman uses non-actors replaying their recent experiences of getting laid off. As usual with Reitman's films, it boasts an eclectic soundtrack that works really well with the storyline.",9,2,7,20 December 2009
From Here to Eternity," Involving Military Soap Opera Elevated by Sturdy Performances from an Offbeat Cast
","In hindsight, this 1953 classic doesn't seem as much a military drama as it does a highly charged soap opera, which shouldn't come as a surprise given that master filmmaker Fred Zinnemann ('the Nun's Story') was at the helm. The veteran director upended the western genre just a year earlier with the Gary Cooper classic 'High Noon', and he places the same incendiary focus of character over action here, that is, until the inevitable climax which uses the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as a catharsis for the characters' dilemmas now dwarfed by the coming world war.Based on James Jones' epic novel, screenwriter Daniel Taradash manages to reduce the complexity of the book's themes without trivializing them, and then-offbeat casting enhances the movie immeasurably. Set on a U.S. Army base in Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack, the focus is on two men, both dedicated to the military with no aspirations to become the officers they have grown to detest. One is Private Robert E. Prewitt, a talented boxer (and bugler) who refuses to fight on his regiment's team since blinding a sparring partner. The other is First Sergeant Milton Warden, a take-charge, professional soldier who earns the trust of his men even as he kowtows to his weak-willed commanding officer.Life in the barracks is fraught with adversarial personalities, chief among them Private Angelo Maggio, Prewitt's loudmouthed best friend, and Staff Sergeant 'Fatso' Judson, the sadistic stockade warden. Both Prewitt and Warden meet women who seek to change their lives. Prewitt finds cynical nightclub 'hostess' Lorene at a brothel masquerading as a social club, while Warden embarks on a passionate affair with his commanding officer's wayward wife Karen. Burt Lancaster is well cast as Warden, and he brings surprising nuance to his character's clandestine encounters with Karen. However, it's Montgomery Clift - despite looking too slight to be genuinely believable as a boxer - who transcends his loner role by playing off his innately sensitive nature to portray a man who will never sacrifice his honor despite how dire the consequences. Well within his comfort zone, Frank Sinatra's turn as Maggio is small but impactful.Still two years away from 'Marty', Ernest Borgnine makes Judson's malevolence palpable in just a few scenes. Deborah Kerr submerges her Scottish accent and previous lady-like demeanor to reveal the embittered, sexually assertive side of Karen without sacrificing any of the character's vulnerability. The legendary, much-parodied beach scene with Lancaster still sizzles after all these years. Similarly, Donna Reed foregoes her good-girl image (epitomized by her memorable turn as Mary Bailey in 'It's a Wonderful Life') to play the sultry, delusional Lorene. The 2003 DVD comes with a small set of extras - a three-minute making-of retrospective short, a nine-minute collection of on-set footage and interviews from a documentary entitled 'Fred Zinnemann: As I See It', and the original theatrical trailer. The best extra is the commentary track from Tim Zinnemann (the director's son) and screenwriter Alvin Sargent ('Spider-Man 2'), who had a small role in the movie.",9,13,14,17 August 2009
Atonement," Epic Sweep and Complex Character Arcs Bring Ian McEwan's Masterful Novel to Cinematic Life
","Cineastes will recognize the shadowy figure interviewing the elderly Briony at the end of this sumptuously produced 2007 film as director Anthony Minghella, who tragically passed away earlier this week. One can surmise that director Joe Wright's use of the estimable filmmaker for a well-placed cameo is something of a tribute to Minghella's work on similarly grandiose epics like 'The English Patient'. Minghella would have been an ideal director for Ian McEwan's emotionally complex 2002 novel, as would have been David Lean since the film concurrently evokes the sweep of 'Doctor Zhivago' and the intimacy of 'Brief Encounter' (especially in the wartime tearoom scene). Regardless, Wright does an admirable job in translating what is essentially an interior story into something quite cinematic. Much of the film's measured success has to do with his and screenwriter Christopher Hampton's abiding fidelity to McEwan's time-juggling story structure.The story is actually divided into two discrete parts. The first takes place on an inauspicious summer day at a rolling English estate in 1935 as precocious 13-year-old Briony Tallis writes a play for the children to perform at a dinner party that evening. She idolizes her beautiful older sister Cecilia and harbors a crush on the housekeeper's impassioned son Robbie Turner. When she sees the two together at the garden fountain, she presumes a situation more provocative than what really occurred. Later that evening, Briony makes a false accusation, and Robbie ends up wrongly accused of a crime and sent off to prison. The second part takes place five years later as Europe is engulfed in WWII. Robbie has moved from prisoner to foot soldier in France, aching over Cecilia while trying to get to Dunkirk in order to return to England. Cecilia has become a nurse, as has a now-grown Briony regretfully estranged from her sister. Where the story goes from there is startling and moving in ways that are quite unexpected.I'm rather divided on the performances. As the headstrong Cecilia, Keira Knightley evokes old-school glamour with her coltish beauty in an impactful manner reminiscent of a young Katharine Hepburn, but her character dissipates somewhat as the story progresses. James McAvoy captures the boyish magnetism of Robbie while gaining gravitas as his idealized character faces the fatalistic horror of war head on. Together though, Knightley and McAvoy somehow just miss creating the image of enduring passion necessary to carry the core story. On the other hand, Briony allows three superb actresses to seamlessly show the character's evolving fate. As the adolescent, Saoirse Ronan dominates the first third of the film with searing self-possession. She makes us care about Briony despite her repugnant act of self-interest. Romola Garai takes over as a young, uncertain nurse caring for badly maimed soldiers in a London hospital. Finally, Vanessa Redgrave carries the last scene by providing the denouement with her characteristic authority and giving the title its true meaning.All the production values are stunning  Sarah Greenwood's meticulous production design, especially in the Dunkirk scenes; Jacqueline Durran's simply designed period costumes; Dario Marianelli's stirring music score (with an effective if somewhat excessive use of typewriter keys to punctuate key scenes) and Seamus McGarvey's rich cinematography. Pay particular attention to the uninterrupted five-minute tracking shot at Dunkirk done with a Steadicam, a bravura set piece along the lines of the opening scene in Orson Welles' 'Touch of Evil'. The 2008 DVD has a fairly standard set of extras for such an elaborate production - an informative commentary track from Wright; a comprehensive, half-hour making-of documentary, 'Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of 'Atonement''; a five-minute short, 'From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic', in which Wright, Hampton and McEwan discuss the transition on a cursory level; and seven deleted scenes, about eight minutes in total with optional commentary from Wright.",8,4,6,21 March 2008
V for Vendetta," A for AudaciousB for Execution
","Cinematic translations of graphic novels and comic books seem to be gaining prominence these days with 'Sin City', 'A History of Violence' and 'Aeon Flux' as three examples of this growing genre. Here is another one adapted from a series of comic books written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd between 1982 and 1985. Produced and written by the Wachowski Brothers in their signature 'Matrix' style and directed by their protégé James McTeigue, the movie has a wildly inventive premise that despite its twenty-year old origins has a timely relevance in a post-9/11 world. It is indeed a comic book come to life, but it's also an often powerful political allegory that takes subtle jabs at the current administrations in both the UK and the US.It's all set in a dystopian London in the year 2020, a time when England has turned into a totalitarian regime under the thumb of fascist chancellor Adam Sutler. The story focuses on a young TV station assistant named Evey. On her way to meet her co-worker, TV personality Gordon Dietrich, she is caught after curfew by some thugs in a dark alley. A savior arrives in the form of a masked vigilante named V, and their ensuing relationship is what drives the labyrinth plot. Starting with the nighttime destruction of the Old Bailey, complete with fireworks and Tchaikovsky's '1812 Overture' blaring over loudspeakers, V orchestrates terrorist acts in a one-man attempt to usurp Sutler. Evey is frightened but ultimately intrigued by V, as her parents were taken away by Sutler's storm troopers as political agitators. She eventually seeks sanctuary with Dietrich but then gets caught in what appears to be her own purgatory. At the same time, the tenacious Inspector Finch attempts to find V before any further terrorist acts occur.This apocalyptic movie dares to ask the question of whether terrorism is ever justified, and the filmmakers go about making V a scarifying but ultimately sympathetic figure. Many of the visual elements are impressive here, but various plot points do not coalesce into a coherent narrative. The Wachowskis have constructed a complex, elliptical story with so many convolutions around the various targets  the government, the media, the terrorists  that it gets difficult to keep track. Part of the problem is simply scope because the movie's agenda feels so broad as to make some of the elements feel trivial, in particular, the 'Beauty and the Beast'-cum-'Phantom of the Opera' connection between V and Evey.On the other hand, certain passages work quite well, such as the brutalizing sequence when Evey is incarcerated and she starts to read a series of notes from a prisoner named Valerie, who has been executed for being a lesbian. There are also welcome bits of humor, for example, Evey dressed in one scene as a little girl to gain the trust of a bishop critical in allowing one of V's attacks to occur, and the Benny Hill antics on Dietrich's TV show meant to ridicule both V and Sutler. With a convincing British accent, Natalie Portman is solid as Evey as she shows both her adventurous and vulnerable sides with equal aplomb. As V, Hugo Weaving does what he can behind the confines of the Joker-style mask. In an ironic twist to his role as Winston in '1984', John Hurt chews quite a bit of scenery in the decidedly Big Brother role of Sutler. Stephen Rea makes a subtle Inspector Finch, while Stephen Fry uses his dry comic manner to good effect as Dietrich. The movie runs a bit long at 132 minutes, but it is relentlessly creative film-making.",8,3,6,27 March 2006
The Island," Bay's Visually Arresting and Mildly Diverting Smorgasbord of Futuristic Movie Clichés
","As the king of big-budget Hollywood bombast, director Michael Bay has a reputation so commercially oriented that it's hard to view his films without some amount of visceral disdain. His latest venture is not an artistic breakthrough for him, by any means, but it is a diverting though overlong entertainment that seems to be an amalgam of John Frankenheimer's 1966 sleeper 'Seconds', Ridley Scott's classically visionary 1982 'Blade Runner', Michael Anderson's comparatively cheesy 1976 'Logan's Run' and Philip Kaufman's 1979 savvy update of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' with plenty of references to Bay's previous blockbusters thrown in as well. Clocking in at 136 minutes, the result is a confusing shuffle, but he has certainly assembled a grade-A cast to inhabit the rather cartoonish roles headed up by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as two residents of a sterile, futuristic society. Their characters' names - Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta - should give you fair warning of the world in which they inhabit with trepidation, and the first hour seems like it could lead to a more thoughtful analysis of the transience of identity at a time when it is not valued.The cliché-ridden screenplay (co-written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Caspian Tredwell-Owen) provides the derivative concept of a brilliant but greedy scientist who has figured out how to clone the rich and famous in order to allow them to take organs or even entire bodies when age and disease set in. The clones - unable to mature beyond the age of fifteen (how convenient) - are programmed to think they are humans living underground to avoid contamination unbeknownst to their ultimate fate. Alas, once Lincoln and Delta figure out what's going on, we enter Los Angeles in the year 2019 as envisioned by Bay as a series of skyward collisions and exploding buildings. This is when the movie either escalates into high gear for Bay aficionados or disintegrates into a morass of action set pieces, though granted, Bay's use of giant metal spools as terrorizing traffic devices is genuine good fun. Unfortunately though, I am still of the latter camp, and shame on me for having any higher expectation for this sort of popcorn filler. The overstylized cinematography of Mauro Fiore, which smacks of new millennium commercials on upscale product placement, is another dead giveaway.Out of his Obi-Wan Kenobi guise, McGregor can get rather unctuous as a leading man, especially when the clone confronts his Scottish-accented antecedent, an obviously direct cousin to his smarmy Catcher Block in Peyton Reed's 'Down With Love'. Johansson is certainly luscious enough for her part, though she is not called upon to use her penetrating intelligence by any means. It's also disheartening to see a scene where she reacts emotionally to her duplicate within the actress's famous Calvin Klein ad. Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou play the parts of the scientist and his chief mercenary with predictable malice, though the latter has some unexplained epiphany toward the end. There is an extended cameo by Steve Buscemi, which is welcome at that point of the story though it's rather anachronistic and overly convenient. The ending is a bit of a bore given all that has come before, but it doesn't really matter, as Bay has concocted a movie that should please most of his fans and may even recruit a few new ones.",5,2,7,12 December 2005
