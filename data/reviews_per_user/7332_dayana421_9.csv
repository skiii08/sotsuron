First Man," Shame on them for not showing the American flag.
","This movie ia a total boredom, and shame on them for not wanting to show the planting of the American flag on the moon.American taxpayers paid for it, and American technology made it possible. But they refuse to show the flag being planted on the moon.",2,4,25,8 July 2019
Knives Out," Not good!!!!
","I love who done it movies, but this one bored me. Daniel Craig had no presence and his fake southern accent was insulting.Not worth bothering with. I wonder how many of the 10 star reviews are from the people that worked on the movie.",1,48,97,26 December 2019
The Irishman," Huge Disappointment
","I love Martin Scorsese movies but The Irishman is a super boring movie that never ended. Three and a half hours long and flat, just old man pretending to be young and aimlessly conversing. Robert De Niro's acting was awful the same face expression for 3.5 hours. I would have stopped watching this movie but because it was Scorsese movie wanted to finish it, we had to take 2 long breaks. I wonder who wrote those raving reviews, there were many people that worked on that movie.",2,30,60,1 December 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Huge Disappointment
","This movie was a big disappointment, predictable ,poorly made and acted.",3,1,8,19 May 2019
Legend," If only understood a word the main actors said.
",If you are an American get ready to strain yourself to understand a word the main actors are saying. I never understood why Brits hoping to make money in US use actors where 80% of their dialect will not be understood by Americans. Had to stop the movie after 10 minutes.,1,3,14,16 January 2020
Joker," Totally overhyped.
","Don't fall for it this movie is totally overhyped, borders between boring and irritating. Joaquin is good but the movie has no story and goes on aimlessly. Joaquin's behavior and crazy laughter is so repetitious. Who wrote those 10 star reviews?? Maybe family and friends of the people that worked on the movie??????",4,62,134,6 October 2019
Parasite," Really? Best movie? You wanted diversity?
","The reason this flat movie won imo because many people have a big thing about diversity. Many were complaining that this year Oscars are not diversified enough, so they decided to give the Oscar to this stupid movie to promote diversity, could have been best foreign movie. The awards should be based on the quality and the achievement of the artist not what race they are or what's between their legs. Liberals are all about diversity even at expense of short changing really good achievements .
Would like to know who wrote those 10 star reviews.",1,25,67,10 February 2020
Marriage Story," Who wrote this boring script?
","Good acting, poorly written, the script puts you to sleep. Another movie with good actors and terrible writers.",2,6,19,24 December 2019
Green Book," Excellent!!
","Don't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie this much!! Great acting, music and sensitive subjects. Viggo Mortensen is excellent in the movie. Definitely must see.",10,3,9,9 December 2018
