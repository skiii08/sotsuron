Black Swan," Utter drivel but Portman's acting did merit award
","This film is of the genre that keeps us wondering is it real? Is it a dream? Is it psychosis? SPOILER: that would alright except that we don't ever get an answer to that. The net result was that it was just plain irritating. I regretted the time invested in it other than to see what others were talking about. There were some good effects, such as SPOILER her morphing into the Black Swan Queen, and the moment when her childhood drawings started to move, but overall it was tedious, hard to believe, and hard to know whether it was all a fantasy or if we were supposed to learn something about the character's life and the world of competition among ballet dancers. Portman did acquit herself with admirable gravitas (and dance moves) given the overall ludicrousness of it all.",4,2,4,9 May 2011
Men in Black 3," The usual special effects extravaganza, plus strangely affecting
","Okay, it's not Shakespeare. But for its genre, it is outstanding. It delivers in terms of science fiction (the Michael Stuhlberg character's simultaneously inhabiting multiple time frames is inspired) and in terms of special effects. In addition, there is more attention to a coherent and interesting plot than in most films of its genre. On a related note, the word 'poignant,' which I would seldom use in connection with sci fi youth-oriented special effects extravaganzas, applies here. Everyone plays his or her part to perfection - SPOILER ALERT - the sorrow born in secrecy by Agent K, and later learned of by Agent J, relating to the fate of J's father, is not the usual 'cliche.' A tragedy at Cape Canaveral that changed Agent K was hinted at darkly throughout the film. I expected the 'Hollywoodish' approach, i.e. to learn that he'd had a wife and family who'd died there. But nooooo, it was a heart-breaking event that was not anticipated. Josh Brolin, too, deserves mention - he is so amazing as the young Agent K that I wondered if Tommy Lee Jones was dubbing his lines. If I don't give it a '10' it is only because it is ultimately silly and implausible. Yet it is excellent in terms of 'the usual' (effects, humor, comic-book characters) yet strangely affecting.",9,0,2,10 December 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Strange and unusual, very 'non-Hollywood'
","I approached this movie with some anxiety; I am not receptive to 'making light' of the Nazis and, being Jewish, was concerned about comments I'd heard that the 'revenge' angle is offensive to Jews. To make a very long story short, it is so beyond the realm of 'realism' that it is hard to take offense. Initially, when the Jewish brigade was carrying out acts of sadism, my thought wasn't so much 'Jews didn't do that' as 'Americans didn't do that' because the troop in question was ultimately representing America. But as time went on, I realized, the whole story is so outlandish that there is no point in picking out inconsistencies with reality. I admit that *****SPOILER HERE**********I started to wonder how it would have a major climax, as it seemed headed in that direction, that seemed to rest on major German leadership, including Hitler all being killed at the same time, as I figured it would not go against reality to that extreme. I made a mental comparison with HBO's Boardwalk Empire, where you know that the real life figures (Al Capone, Meyer Lansky, etc.) won't be killed along the way but the fictional ones are 'fair game.') But, noooooo ....(SPOILER) .... the theater fire did take place as planned and Nazi leadership, including Hitler, was immolated. Now, having said that the whole story is fabricated and clearly preposterous, I have to add that it was riveting, highly creative, had carefully written and performed dialogue, and was deadly serious where it needed to be (SPOILER: the French milkman's shedding a tear when he was forced to give up Jewish people hiding under his floor boards to save his own family brought in the right amount of poignancy) and Mel Brooks-like in other spots. Somehow or other, it all 'works' despite being bizarre and preposterous. I highly recommend it.",9,1,6,12 December 2010
The Hunger Games," Once you suspend disbelief the film is quite good
","I will preface by saying I am not a kid, and also, I am a science fiction fan. That means that on the one hand, I would not be entranced by the 'youth-oriented' aspects of the film but on the other hand, I am open to fantasy story lines. On that note, I would say that the whole setup is preposterous to the 'nth degree' and seems to be a pretext for mayhem. In that sense it is like all the post-apocalypse films which essentially use that as an excuse for all sorts of fantasy exploits. For example, in the first Mad Max it was never explained as to what the heck had happened to Australia to allow for the anarchic situation. Hunger Games, too, is unsatisfyingly sketchy and non-credible in attempting to explain its setup. Once we accept it, however, and can 'get on with it,' I felt the movie was extremely well-done. The casting of Katness was perfect, as she could carry the weight of the role, and since I figured that it would not be *******SPOILER***********possible for the sympathetic heroine to cold-bloodedly kill the other youngsters I kept trying to figure out how it would resolve given the directed for only one survivor. The futuristic sets, costumes, etc. were very well done, as was the whole 'steam punk' look to it. It does end ****spoiler***with a lot of unfinished business so I'm looking forward to the sequel.",8,2,8,19 December 2012
Pacific Rim," Utterly ridiculous and lots of fun
","There is a lot about this movie that is beyond ridiculous. As others have stated, you have to wonder, when fighting the monsters, why not use the ultra-weapons in the first place rather than duking it out 'mano a mano' and then finally pulling out the really powerful weapons, like cannons that blast them to smithereens? And the whole conceit of needing to build giant robots is also ridiculous - why not just go straight to the weapons and deliver them by, say, drone attacks? Let's just say it all starts with suspending disbelief bigtime. But that is not unique to this film, of course; it is a component of all fantasy/sci fi films, so having said that, I will move on to the good points.Strange to say, while it will not win literary prizes for character development, much less originality, they are strangely affecting and you care what happens to them - a statement I rarely make in connection with big special effects extravaganzas. Idris Elba's charisma and gravitas needs no further comment. And while other characters are 'stock' action figures, for some inexplicable reason they all 'work' too. When the heroine and the young pilot face off in a martial arts competition, the young woman's frail appearance makes it look like an unfair matchup yet it fits nicely within the Asian tradition of female martial arts stories like 'Crouching Tiger.' Furthermore as others have noted, there is real chemistry between the two actors. And while I don't want to go overboard on the issue of emotional resonance, the scene in which the heroine (as a child) shrieks and cries amidst devastation caused by the monsters is truly affecting.As far as science fiction, there are some good sci fi elements; the mind-melding needed to man (or woman) the robots makes for some interesting sci fi as does (SPOILER) the scientists' use of this in attempting to understand the alien attackers. Speaking of which, there is also humor, provided not only by the scientists (who are, however, gross caricatures) but by another caricature played by Ron Perlman of a wheeler-dealer who will sell you anything. Yet despite the humor it doesn't break the overall sense of 'serious threat.' Of course (SPOILER ALERT) the rules of Hollywood were so clearly in effect in this film that I did not bother to ask 'Will the hero survive? Will we (the human race) win against the aliens?' etc. I knew from the start that it would all end well. But I didn't mind. At times it was a bit too much crash/boom and I was distracted by wondering how many gazillions of dollars the incredible CGI effects must've cost. But overall it was a fun way to spend some time if you leave your critical thinking at the door.",8,3,5,9 December 2013
Ender's Game," Good but misses slightly
","First, a caveat - people who don't care for science fiction should not bother with this film. It does not have 'cross-genre' appeal.With that out of the way - I am a fan of the book, so it is difficult for me to assess how people who haven't read it will respond to it. I asked my husband, who'd not read the book, what he thought and generally he liked it but thought it was a bit draggy in spots relating to Ender's military training. He did add, however, that that was necessary to show how SPOILER Ender went from a disrespected 'wimpy kid' to a commanding presence. Apart from that he liked it a lot.As to my own assessment ... I did like it and am giving it a thumbs up; it was well cast, the special effects were terrific, and the SPOILER devastating point made at the end impacts as it should. But I do have a criticism relating to content that was omitted from the book. SPOILER Readers of the book will know that Ender kept seeing strange images in his video games (or whatever the electronic devices were called) and could not figure out what they really were - unsuccessful attempts by the aliens to communicate - until too late to SPOILER stop the unjustified annihilation of an entire species. This made it all the more tragic when he realized they were wiped out without justification.The movie includes a couple of instances of this attempt at communication but did not include it as a recurring theme. So at the end after the devastation and Ender realizes that that is what the strange video game events were really about, it seems a bit tacked on. My guess is the film makers figured more instances of physical fighting would appeal to audiences more than more instances of strange video-game encounters. This is counter to the book and is unnecessary since, after all, SPOILER, physical fighting was 'beside the point' in winning the war against the aliens; rather, computer-game skill was they key. This is the reason I am not giving it a higher score, but would nevertheless, recommend it.",7,0,1,23 February 2014
Bridesmaids," Serious drama and gross-out comedy - an uneasy mix but it worked
","This movie was all over the map. It was a serious drama about friendships, and about the sad plight of single women in contemporary society having to pretend to be okay with mistreatment by males as they attempt to show how 'liberated' they are. Kristen Wiig was excellent both as a dramatic actress with great depth of expression (when needed) and at the same time, capable of doing physical comedy of the sort displayed in her Saturday Night Live skits. The scene when she was first stopped by the policeman and tried to demonstrate (unnecessarily, as it turned out) that she was not drunk was one such example. Which leads to the SPOILER - the one area in which the story didn't ring true related to her rejection of the policeman after they had spent the night together and he openly expressed a wish to keep things going (instead of just sending her away like John Hamm's character). It seemed like a plot contrivance to inject more suspense into the story (i.e. 'Would they reconcile? Had she ruined her chance for happiness?') as there was no clear reason why she fled and then refused to return his calls etc. I see that as unrealistic behavior, a situation driven by plot and not character. Otherwise, while the movie didn't always seem clear as to what it intended to be (i.e. a gal pal comedy? a poignant drama about human relations?) nevertheless all the pieces added up into a moving film. PS, the trailer is entirely misleading and I can imagine many expecting a comedy romp were disappointed.",8,0,1,17 May 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Superb
","This movie is first-rate science fiction - the special effects are outstanding and the story is very touching in spots. Although the main character's father's Alzheimers is a plot device, Lithgow plays it with pathos, which should touch the hearts of anyone who has dealt with loved ones experiencing mental decline. As many have remarked, the 'motion capture' technique applied to the apes allows for full, nuanced expressiveness and 'Caesar,' too, becomes a moving character. Needless to say, if someone is looking for credibility he or she will not find it in this film, but my main criticism - SPOILER - would be that while it is ingenious for the decline of humans to be due to a virus they have created (rather than at the hands of a few rampaging super-apes), it raised a lot of questions like 'Why didn't Franco's infected lab assistant e-mail or call him instead of giving up when he couldn't find him at home?' Another weakness was the ho-hum attitude of the main protagonist and his wife toward the miraculous and potentially dangerous situation under their own roof in the form of the 'altered' chimpanzee. Sure, they took note of it but nobody seemed 'blown away' by it. However, the weaknesses in 'human' protagonists were more than offset by the mesmerizing performance by Andy Serkis (as Caeser) and the armies of motion-capture and/or computer graphics specialists.",9,1,2,29 January 2012
Gone Girl," Well done and all that but highly unsatisfying
","This movie was very well done in terms of acting by all parties concerned, and the story was very creative - it was a 'non-Hollywoodish' film in that the characters are not likable, and SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - it doesn't resolve in a way that you can say 'justice is served' so it is the antithesis of a Hollywood movie (or TV show). I kept making a mental comparison to Criminal Minds in which you can count on easy resolutions, a clear path from A to Z (or A to B more likely), and the bad guys getting caught. That type of crime story may be fun to fill 42 minutes with, but one can easily recognize how empty it is.But in Gone Girl, the opposite was true; it was complicated, it was hard to figure out what would happen next, it was full of surprises, the acting was not one-dimensional, and to many people's annoyance (including mine), justice was not only served; in fact, injustice was 'heartily rewarded.' My husband and I talked a lot about the movie afterward trying to pinpoint why we both disliked it. The main thing, I think, was that after investing 2 and a half hours we both went away with a 'sour taste.' That is largely because of the ending - SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - which not only didn't resolve, which I can appreciate, but which did not make sense in the larger context of the film. Long story short (SPOILER) when Affleck's character decided to live with his returned wife after she had shown herself to be a dangerous psychopath who had, earlier, specifically tried to destroy his life, I could not understand why he decided to make a go of it anyway. He hadn't shown himself to be madly in love with her, so that didn't seem to be a motive; and the threat she hurled (he'd be publicly reviled if he left her) was much lesser of a threat than being around a creator of diabolical plots who he knew had destroyed several others and tried to destroy him as well. Having that having over one's head would seem intolerable.So, I simply could not understand how that fit and it was a disappointment after enduring so much time spent wondering how things would go for these generally unlikable individuals caught up in an admittedly intriguing story.I give the film a lot of credit for the creativity of the writers and acting skill of the participants, but in the end had to admit it was a largely unenjoyable experience.",7,4,7,23 February 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Dreadful - I don't understand the acclaim
","The film displayed great technical wizardry and for those interested in special effects, this movie might hold some fascination. However, I found the story ridiculous and off-putting and the special effects didn't help because they came off as a distraction which underscored the whole gimmicky nature of the premise. The film tried to 'have it both ways,' to be based in a fantasy premise, while presumably providing insights into the 'human condition' and I don't think this worked because of a repeatedly jarring problem: nobody reacted in a realistic way to Benjamin Button's aging-backwards situation. There were other plot holes too, of the proverbial 'you could drive a truck through it' sort but I will confine my criticisms to that first 'sticking point,' i.e. people's bland reactions to an aging-backwards person in their midst, which in turn undermined any claim to pointing out truths about life, which the various life experiences of Button seemed intended to accomplish. And PS, what was up with that Katrina business?",5,5,9,15 June 2009
The Dark Knight," Has its unique aspects, but ultimately disappointing
","I am aware this is a highly-regarded film and that knowledge perhaps added to my disappointment by raising my expectations. I found it had unique elements (the energetically sadistic Joker instead of earlier 'kid stuff' incarnations) and - SPOILER - was surprised that two 'good guys,' Dent and the love interest, got killed off, a very un-Hollywood twist. The positive surprise was the unusual nature of the extreme crisis that needed averting - the 'game theory' played out on two cruise ships. I found this unique compared with the usual menaces posed by super-villains. But on the negative side, I found the film confusing, choppy, with discontinuities, full of pseudo-philosophical mumbo-jumbo, and with unexplained motivations - SPOILER - the thing with Dent at the end seemed contrived, merely an opportunity to display house-of-horror special effects - it did not convey what he was trying to accomplish and why. I see merit in the review by Stephanie Zacharek of Salon who was apparently not as taken with it as other reviewers.",7,2,6,21 December 2008
Thor," Nice job! It does exactly what it's supposed to do
","I will not attempt to defend this movie as an art film; it does not provide insightful reflection upon the human condition. And it is completely preposterous in every way. However, it is fun from start to finish, true 'escapism.' The characters are thin as some critics have charged, but they serve their archetypal purposes. Thor is a foolish, cocky kid who 'grows up' fast. Loki, like his namesake in Norse mythology, is evil and pitiful at the same time so in that sense not just 'evil incarnate' like your average superhero villain. The scientist-Valley Girl lacks credibility as a character, but Natalie Portman lends the role some sincerity and gravitas. Speaking of gravitas, the gate-keeper played by the always splendid Idris Elba worked quite well in that role. Some have complained about the phoniness of the sets in the small town, and I admit at times I kept thinking 'this is a set,' but it didn't get in the way - it came across more as an homage to cheesy 50s sci fi flicks in which the action always manages to take place in an obscure desert town. Some of the special effects were overdone and hard to follow (i..e who's pounding whom, and with what weapon?) and looked like CGI, but the whole fairy-tale aspect of it meant that if some of the landscapes looked more dream-like than real, that was okay too. The storyline is beside the point - Will Odin survive? will Thor prevail? Will Loki's lies be exposed? Do you even have to ask? You know from the beginning how it turns out but that does not spoil the fun along the way.",10,0,2,28 July 2012
Hancock," Surprisingly good (SPOILER ALERT)
","I have read a number of reviews which more or less say that it was a great idea but poorly executed. I don't entirely agree; while I would've liked more clarity at the end as to the origins of Theron's and Smith's characters, I think it was very touching and certainly carried more emotional heft and provoked more curiosity than the average 'superhero' movie. Critics have commented on the low-quality special effects and it didn't seem that way to me. I appreciated the novelty of a screwed up superhero and an uncynical PR man, and the 'knowing looks' of Theron's character lent intrigue to the story. The nature of their relationship, though, granted, not clearly explained, hinted at some mythological, tragic scale of brother-sister/twins/soul mates in a 'write your own explanation' sort of way. While the picture was not flawless (and the 'head up the a--' threat was carried out far too literally), it lingers on the mind far more than most action movies offered up for entertainment these days.",8,1,3,7 December 2008
Prometheus," Overworked sci fi clichés plus lots of gore
","I found this movie strongly distasteful. I was hoping for a great science fiction movie and instead found it to be a horror movie (i.e. gratuitous violence and gore) with a very clichéd approach to 'big themes' touted in the advertisements. **SPOILERS FROM HERE ON.** The science fiction part was something you've seen before a zillion times if you have ever watched Star Trek (i.e. aliens seeding planets with humanoids; a disembodied android head talking; dangerous parasites; etc.) People have praised the special effects, but prowling around in underground structures left by ancient peoples is nothing original, nor was the way it was depicted. The film did not deliver at all with regard to the big questions it raised (about the origins of human life, why those who created it tried to destroy it, etc.) so it was much ado about nothing. After watching it I turned to one of those cheapie made-for-sci-fi-channel-type movies about glaciers overtaking North America (or something) and got more enjoyment of that because I knew it would be dumb fun. But my high expectations for Prometheus made for disappointing viewing. I had had high hopes for it going in but it ended up being just another horror squirm-fest.",2,3,8,19 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Tedius but maybe appealing to Batman devotees
","Although I see that the prevailing trend is great acclaim for this movie, my thought is that there are those who have bought into the Batman mythos and those who have not, and for the former it is perhaps a very satisfying experience to not only see lots of Bat-gear and stupendous special effects but also to watch character after character reminisce and wax philosophical about how his/her childhood have led to their current state. For fans, perhaps, a 9 is warranted. For those who are not already 'fans' I would say that the movie's special effects are truly impressive, but the philosophizing will seem laughably superficial and the reminiscences very contrived. The effects will wear thin after a while, and as the movie approaches its finale, at slightly less than three hours, they are wearying. As to the philosophizing and reminiscing - it will become grating. SPOILER: when the snooty heiress recounts her sad childhood in a prison somewhere you want to say SHUT UP ALREADY and get on with it. For those not sold on the Batman mythos, I would say a 5 is more appropriate, hence the average score of 7. Another issue ... while I am reluctant to critique fantasy stories for logic and plausibility, there were issues all along that made it hard to suspend disbelief and just go with it. No, I'm not talking about the fact that Gotham was both Los Angeles (i.e. 'One Wilshire' was visible on a building) and New York:). SPOILER There seemed to be something contradictory imbedded in the storyline itself. For example, how was it that Bane was both turning the people loose, 'freeing' them to attack rich people (talk about paranoid visions of class warfare!) while also planning to kill them - didn't the people figure out that they were the targets, not the beneficiaries, of his plan as he publicly announced a nuclear bomb was due to detonate? On a related note, the actual peril was not stated until toward the end of this long movie, so it seemed to meander a lot. All in all, I found it dissatisfying and mind-numbing after a while but I realize I'm in the minority on this.",7,3,6,7 January 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Superman meets Star Trek
","My review is essentially the same as the one I posted for the first Thor movie. It is utterly preposterous; it is hard to follow and the 'otherworldly' places look phony. Why such a high rating, then? I would've actually have given it a 10 if not for two detracting things: one is that it is too long, with a few fight scenes too many. Yes, we get it; Thor is mighty; the CGI artists are mighty; but these points were made over and over since the opening scene so at the end it seemed to drag.The second detraction is for the asinine comical touches provided by Jane's sidekick Darcy, which are too disruptive to the point where they take you out of the film's universe and into the land of sitcom. These problems aside, all the rest plays beautifully. The blending of myth and science fiction worked very well - it was 'Superman meets Star Trek' because not only did Thor's might save the universe, so did scientists with their technobabble and gizmos. As to the characters - simplistic, yes, but they outdid themselves compared with the first film. Hemsworth did an excellent job not just providing muscle-bound good looks but was able to capture the angst of the 'Superman' character, torn between duty and his love for a mortal; and Loki's strange combination of despicable yet pitiful was 'off the charts.' (SPOILER - when Thor visits Loki in prison, Loki at first maintains the visual illusion that all is well with him. Then he drops the illusion, and the sight of what he has become is cringe-inducing). Portman, playing Jane, was at time dangerously verging on a 'sitcom' rendering of the love interest, yet could carry off the role of someone smart and brave in additional to being, of course, gorgeous.As to the story line - yes, absolute preposterous junk, but anyone watching a movie based on comic books knows that going into it; even with some plot twists and turns, it is never in doubt that 'good will triumph.' Still, I highly recommend this film - with its excellent portrayal of stock characters, the moodiness of the 'universe,' and the incredible special effects, this is 'dumb fun' with the highest possible production standards.",9,1,1,21 April 2014
Looper," Preposterous and off-putting yet strangely moving
","In reviewing this film I am trying to view it from two different angles; that of a 'mainstream' film goer and that of a sci fi fan. I fit the description of the latter. For mainstream viewers this movie will no doubt be an absolute dud. The characters are off-putting - the main protagonist (in his young and old incarnations) is a cold-blooded murderer, a point that is repeatedly demonstrated. The rationale for transporting people back in time to execute them is ridiculous - it is obviously just a plot contrivance to allow for the situations in which the 'old' and 'young' versions face each other. And of course, the time travel issues injects a further element of total absurdity. As a 'mainstream' movie, then, I'd give this a 5.However, as a science fiction movie I'd rate it somewhat more highly - maybe a 7. From the start, I had to suspend disbelief regarding the rationale behind the 'looper' methodology, but like others here I kept asking, 'If the crime syndicate can get away with that much illegal activity, why can't they just kill people in their own time period?' Accepting this plot point was hard work. I also had to put aside the repugnant nature of the main characters. Having consciously pushed these and other problems aside, I found the movie to be engaging and even affecting. Some reviewers have commented on the attempt to make Gordon-Levitt look like Willis, and I don't have a problem with that, other than that the novelty of it was a distraction to an extent (yet it 'worked.') The acting was perfect, the envisioning of the future was impressive in that the designers didn't work overtime to create an all-new look, which in a way made sense. (Like people today, those in the 2040s had a fad of wearing clothing from past decades). The 'future' also included some 'retro' touches - payment in silver bars - reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica in which there is space travel yet telephones have cords. The 'retro' touches were a distraction but still, added to appreciation of the film. A couple of other positives: SPOILER - the film turned into so much more than it appeared to be about. I wondered why the telekinesis issue was taken so casually but when it reappeared it did so with a vengeance (calling to mind Carrie, of course, as well as a character in the TV series 4400). Above all, like the 'unsung' Back to the Future Part II, with its ever-shifting realities, it was like a very bad dream. The nightmarish quality that permeated it was, I believe, one aspect that made it so effective.Speaking of other related movies or scenes, MAJOR SPOILER HERE: I was surprised by the ending, even though I instantly thought of 'The Butterfly Effect' in which the hero kills himself to stop a series of disastrous events from occurring. Which underscores the fact that this is a very un-Hollywoodish movie - the main protagonists die, and the choice Gordon-Levitt's character makes at the end SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER saves the mother and son but in so doing, imperils the rest of the world as the child is clearly a malevolent force - the future is in for big trouble. I would give the movie extra high marks for not wrapping everything up neatly, Hollywood style. All in all it is extremely flawed, yet I did find it strangely moving.",6,1,2,15 January 2013
The Fighter," Excellent film with occasional digression into SNL skit
","The film is excellent, overall, in creating interest in the lives of its main characters. Even though I am far from being a boxing fan, and the fight scenes were repugnant, I was interested in finding out how things would turn out, and I credit excellent story-writing and acting by the two main leads. Mark Wahlberg has, elsewhere, been criticized for being bland in the role but his restraint made me think of the saying 'less is more.' The only criticism, and this is frankly a significant one - which caused me to rate the film lower than I might have - is that it occasionally turned into an SNL skit, i.e. cartoonish caricatures were occasionally injected into an otherwise serious drama. When all the sisters and the mother were together, I kept thinking of the SNL skit 'Bronx Beat' in which Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph pretend to be extremely vulgar Bronx women - rather poorly, I might add (although that is another review.:)) The film's portrayal of these 'blue collar' Massachusetts women, as vulgar, ugly, and stupid, was a cheap caricature; it kept bringing it down to the level of an SNL skit and it was out of place in this serious drama. I would nevertheless recommend the film, but it loses points in my estimation due to these intrusions.",Null,0,1,30 July 2011
