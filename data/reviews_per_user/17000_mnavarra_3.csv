Hereditary," Not for everyone
","Solid movie, with a nice and unexpected ending. Not for everyone. Those who expect a horror movie with jumpscares will be disappointed. Those who want to experience a clever, deep, gut wrenching, scary, intense and innovative movie will be rewarded.",9,2,4,22 August 2018
The Hills Have Eyes," At last, a great horror movie!
","I've been a great horror fan since I was a little child, and am quite unable to miss a single horror flick even when I know it's bad, like the 99% of all horror movies we're all used to watch these days. And I'm always disappointed by all of them, they're all superficial, shallow, not scary at all, badly acted and horribly written. The result is that if I happen to come across two good horror movies per year (over about 40) I'm happy and satisfied. I've never liked American horror movies based on family slaughter and massacre, which normally take place in deserts or rotten villages lost in the middle of nowhere. Not because I don't like the landscape, but because they're normally just BAD. Well, I have to say that 'The Hills have Eyes' is the best horror movie I've seen this year (so far). The movie is well acted and directed, the soundtrack is great and the script is also fantastic. But what strikes me most is that I can't stop thinking about it, it leaves you with a disturbing feeling of fear and danger that is very unlikely to be found in any other horror flick nowadays. The level of brutality and violence is so strong... I really recommend the movie to all horror fans.",10,1,2,31 August 2006
The Descent," Ordinary horror movie with shallow ending
","I am really astonished by the positive comments this movie received. In fact, the Descent is not as bad as other horror flicks I've seen recently, but the plot is quite banal, the story - as well as the horror scenes - are definitely shallow and boring. One of the girls is painted as an adventurous bitch who lies about the site they are exploring, so as to discover unexplored caves lost in the middle of nowhere, putting all her friends' lives in danger. Eventually she is left behind by the only surviving girl; I think this could have been better explained and portrayed, since the 'social' dynamics in a suffocating and claustrophobic environment (as a cave actually is) would have provided the movie with a nice and fresh touch I have not seen in it. Not a horrible movie after all, but nothing special.",5,1,4,6 September 2006
