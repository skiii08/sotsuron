The Monuments Men," Historical movie quite different to what the previews suggest
","Based on the previews I expected The Monuments Men to be more comedic. It has an excellent cast whom are no strangers to comedy (John Goodman, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Matt Damon). Don't be under any illusions, though. This is a historic movie against the very real backdrop of World War 2.The movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be. It starts off with promise and reminds one a little of 'Ocean's Eleven' as the team of Monuments Men are assembled. There is some light banter that is entertaining. The movie quickly loses this comic momentum though as the serious business of saving art starts. It never evolves fully into a movie with a true 'war' feel as the comedic always threatens to come to the surface although it never really does. At some point you do start to wish that the movie will just finish and run to its conclusion.I suppose (upon re-reading my previous paragraph) that this 'don't know quite what to expect' feeling of the movie very closely resounds with the real historic events surrounding the Monuments Men (or anyone going to war, for that matter.) It starts off with unknown anticipation but as the personal costs escalate one does become more grave until you set about fighting for what you believe in in a 'business-as-usual' matter. For this reason I do believe it to be a quite good historic film.The film is not hugely entertaining, although the seasoned cast does bring enough to the table to keep the user engaged. I found the historical sites and the exploration of a part of history I was unaware of quite interesting and therefore enjoyed the film. I don't expect this film to have mass appeal though...",6,2,3,2 March 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," An excellent movie of Walt Disney magic and what stories are all about
","I visited America last year and among visiting several cities and historical sites I also managed to fit in a visit to Disneyworld (Florida) and Universal Studios. During my time there it struck me just how much stories played a role in the innovative and determined spirit of the American people and how much present day heroes took inspiration from the stories of heroes from the past. One such a hero is Walt Disney.This movie inspires one to keep dreaming, to keep innovating, never to accept no for an answer and to build a better future with your vision. It is the feeling that Disney establishes in its parks and it is the feeling that you experience after listening to the stories of great heroes.This movie is about the true power of stories: the love of stories and the ownership we feel about those stories, the good stories of our life and the bad stories of our life and which stories we choose to accept as the one defining ourselves.Emma Thompson is delightful as the uptight P.L. Travers. She manages to play the uncooperative and disagreeable role superbly without sacrificing any likability. Tom Hanks is an equal treat as the imaginative Walt Disney and really makes the giant come to life. Several songs from Mary Poppins brings back a touch of nostalgia and gets new meaning within the context of the story. A quirky script dispersed with several comedic gems ensure many laughs. We aren't dealing simply with a comedy here, however, and underneath P.L. Travers' tetchy behaviour lies a more complex story that is also beautifully explored. It successfully brings about laughs and tears.This movie is what movies are all about.As for me, the movie reminded me that no matter how much one might love stories, the purpose of a story is not just an object onto itself to be admired as a created piece of art. A story only truly finds meaning when it serves to augment, flavour and shape our own stories.",9,3,4,2 March 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Best book adaptation I've seen. Gripping, riveting stuff.
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is exquisite and is made so by a strong storyline, great pace, tension and great actors.What impressed me most in the books were the perfectly timed plot twists and how each turn of events consistently tops the previous ones. The book also manages to plant subtle suspicions, fears and ideas in the reader's mind that is just as often helped by what the characters DO NOT SAY than what they DO say. Combine that with the honesty and immediacy with which Katniss Everdeen narrates her own tale in the book and you have your job cut out if you want to bring her story to the big screen. But that is exactly what director Francis Lawrence has done with panache.The movie is superbly paced. Each plot twist and storyline is given enough focus to give the user time to process and appreciate. I dare say it evokes some of the same thrills and shocks as the chapter-endings had when reading the book.Jennifer Lawrence brings perfect life to Katniss as she struggles to adapt to her new status as a symbol of hope. This time around Peeta gets given much more opportunity to play his very central role and reveal his character. The complexity of the relationship between Katniss and Peeta is also explored in more depth and with more conviction than in the first film.Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. The introduction of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee as well as the introduction of some victors from previous Hunger Games adds a great deal of tension to the film.Visually the film is stunning. From the gray military-style districts through to the technicolor over-indulgence in the capital and through forests, each setting contributes strongly to the mood and enjoyment of the film.The film balances a dark mood and action with moments of light humor. It is not devoid of emotional moments that evoke great empathy but manages to do so without becoming sentimental.I give The Hunger Games: Catching Fire my highest rating - something I don't easily do. It is one of the few films where, at the end, I stayed behind through all the end credits - Elated, stunned, somehow tired but very very satisfied. I'd say that this is probably the best book-adaptation I have seen in a film.",10,1,22,27 November 2013
