Source Code," Well done, wonderful film
","A really well made film: 1. interesting concept, something you have not seen before; 2. a coherent plot that is well structured and well paced; 3. engaging characters and engaging story, it has a number of twists, plenty of heart and the action is both intrinsic to the story and believable; 4. well cast.... a really, really well made film.The 3 lead actors are all wonderful, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan work so well together, and Vera Formiga's performance is perfect. All three are really well cast for their roles and give such sincere acting performances. A wonderful film that I will watch again and again.",9,1,4,3 July 2014
The Prestige," Tremendous story telling. Wondrous film.
","I knew nothing of this before seeing it and it was such a surprise. I loved it. Not like a modern day film, just a wonderful story. Cast well, acted well. But it is the complex story, the wonder of the magic, and the wonderfully flawed and tragic characters that carries the film to such heights. The complexity of their mistake riddled and shared history defines their relationships and their lives and is so well imagined and so well told on screen. I love Michael Caine's role and his applied example of Ockham's Razor. I've since read criticisms that relate to the depiction of Tesla's or Nolan as a director. Such criticisms have nothing to do with the entertainment value of this film in its own right. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will watch it again. It is a new favourite. If you have not seen this, avoid reviews beforehand and enjoy the surprises throughout.",9,0,2,28 April 2015
Underworld Awakening," Elephant in the room
","The plot concept is excellent, casting of Rea and Dance is inspired. However the script seems to have evolved around Speedman's exclusion, and the workarounds to disguise his absence actually draw attention to it. Unfortunately, the CGI has become intrusive in this third installment. Having watched a 'making of' documentary for the second installment, in which the producers and film makers detailed the lengths they went to to minimise CGI and to maintain authenticity, the reliance on CGI is disappointing. However the CGI is poorly executed and intrusive on numerous occasions to the detriment of the story. I understand the compulsion for action sequences, but these should complement and advance the story. The character of Eve is underdeveloped and her fight scenes are absurd. The imbalance is laughable, as are the efforts to appeal to a younger audience. Theo, Theo, I guess it offered plenty of screen time... but your rebellious teen dialogue... at some point you need to move on from this clich√©. Having worked the story around Speedman's absence, somehow they have decided to keep him alive and the continuation of this saga now rests on his availability for the next installment. Fingers crossed.",6,0,1,26 March 2017
Oblivion," Excellent sci-fi movie
","This film is a ripper, it is visually spectacular and the plot has a host of classic sci-fi elements. It holds its own against sci-fi classics and I will happily watch it again.The plot holds together really well, it's a really good story with nice twists and is a well made film with believable characters and plenty of heart. I've seen some criticism of this film, but it seems this focuses on people wanting the movie to be something other than it has intended to be. If you want non-stop action and explosions this might not be your film. The main action sequence is necessary for advancing the plot but is the only aspect of the film I thought was overdone. This is the best sci-fi film I have seen in years and the DVD will happily live on my shelf next to Blade Runner, Gattaca and Alien.Casting is excellent. While I'm not particularly a fan of Tom Cruise, credit where it is due, he is really good in this role.Well done to all involved.",9,1,2,3 February 2014
Jack Reacher," Sigh. Poorly adapted for screen.
","I've read all the books and was disappointed with this adaptation for film. Not that this is a new experience. Why the bathroom fight scene? 20 odd books to work from and the film comes up with fight that sees Reacher prevail due to dumb luck? Completely out of character. Yes, Reacher is analytical, but he is not monotonous, not without character, not wooden and dispassionate, not humorless. There is nothing likable about this characterisation of Reacher, where is the live free/carefree aspect of his character? Disappointing. And the 'he doesn't care about the law...' monologue at the end, was that lifted straight from the Waterworld script? Was the entire film so poor in establishing the character that this was required, or did the director think the viewers so stupid that reinforcement was required by way of direct exposition. Sigh. I was really looking forward to this with fingers crossed. It is not terrible, but it should have been better given the wealth of material at their disposal. I hope it did well enough for them to have a second effort, to see if they can make it work. Cruise was OK, but I would rather have a Reacher film than an adaptation-to-make-it- work-for-Tom Cruise film. An opportunity missed. To my mind, Reacher was already such a strong character with a large and well established following that a 'star' was not required to carry the film franchise. If they wanted a 'star', I still can't go past Jackman.",4,0,2,29 April 2015
