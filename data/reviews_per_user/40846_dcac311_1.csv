The Ring," A great Halloween scare!
","Just in time for the scariest day of the year, this disturbing movie is sure to put film fans in the mood! Filled with haunting images and half explained legend, The Ring left this movie-goer wanting more. Dead horses, black holes, foggy islands....asylms, electro-shock, abandon nurseries. Every cliched horror image is assembled into one terrifying video...a video that kills the veiwer. Get extra butter on the popcorn, you only have 7 days left!",9,0,0,28 October 2002
