Casablanca," Best Romance ever
","Bogart and Bergman should be the standard by how all romances on film are judged.  Casablanca shows them at those heady early days of a romance, the tragic separation, the awkward second encounter, and the compelling story of how they resolve those feelings still inside.Henreid should not be forgotten.  His style sets up an interesting contrast to the more gruff Bogart.Rains gives a little comic relief to the film, and also contributes a great deal to the other side of this story: the onset of WWII.  His uncertainty of how much to follow Germany, and whether or not to go against the Nazis, was similar to how many Europeans at the time felt.  His ultimate decision at the end also makes this a great movie.The final ten minutes of this film is some of the best work ever done in any movie.  If you're a fan of movies, you have to see Casablanca.10/10",10,1,1,24 July 2002
Gettysburg," Compelling war movie
","It can be hard to show the perspective of both side in a war movie, but Gettysburg does it.  You can see the Northern soldiers in their dual cause: free the slave and preserve the union.  You can see the Southerners hoping for self-government.  I don't think this film excuses their practice of slavery, just shows what their view was.Daniels as Chamberlain was outstanding.  He showed the concern of a man who knew that the orders he was given or gave himself would end the lives of many.The epic scope of the battle scenes make you believe that you are actually seeing a real battle.  Men marching right into cannon fire (which actually happened) is put right before you.In terms of the bloodiness of war, Gettysburg is not as realistic as Glory, but I don't feel that's needed here.  You can still feel the tragic loss of life, and the relief of those who survive.10/10",10,1,1,24 July 2002
Gandhi," Kingsley's best work
","Ben Kingsley is an outstanding actor, and portraying Gandhi is his most outstanding work.  He shows the young man shocked to see what is happening to his fellow Indians who go to Africa, the idealist trying to form the Ashram in his home country, the leader standing up to the English, and the aging man distraught over the conflict between the religious groups in India.But this movie is worth seeing for other reasons as well.  The rest of the cast turn in A+ performances.  The film is extensive enough to show most of the key moments in Gandhi's life.  The epic scale of certain scenes are all the more impressive considering that today's modern computer technology was not used to depict the large crowds.The sequence leading up to and including the Great Salt March is one of the most moving scenes in film.10/10",10,11,15,24 July 2002
Ben-Hur," The best movie ever
","I've seen hundreds of movies, and Ben-Hur is the best of them all.Heston, who has several excellent roles to his credit, turns in his best here.  Boyd, as well, leaves a memorable impression on the screen.Of course, everyone talks about the chariot race, and they should.  But it's not just fast moving scenes like that which take this film to the top. There's the first greeting between Ben-Hur and Massala, the encounter between Ben-Hur, Balthasar and the sheik, and the emotional scenes where Ben-Hur finds his mother and sister.The best of all the scenes is when Ben-Hur is being led across the desert in need of water, but the Roman officer does not allow it.  A particular character - very important even though you never hear him talk - provides what Ben-Hur needs.Over 40 years later, we still have not seen a movie that touches Ben Hur.10/10",10,1,3,24 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Now this is what Star Wars is all about
","All the Star Wars films are very good, but Empire Strikes Back is the best of the series.  The story line is more convoluted than the rather straight froward A New Hope and Return Of The Jedi.  Though it lacks the special effects of the more recent trilogy, ESB has better interaction between the characters.The growing romance between Han and Leia is paced just right.  The rise of Luke to power under the guidance of Yoda shows the tension and respect that often exist between experts and trainees.  The comedy act of R2D2 and C3PO is classic.These actors, often criticized in the other films, do very well in ESB. Ford and Fisher give their best performances in the whole trilogy in this episode (Hamill was more consistent through the series).10/10",10,0,0,24 July 2002
