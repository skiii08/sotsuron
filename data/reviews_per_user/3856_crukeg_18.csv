Alien 3," Criminally neglected
","Alien 3 is a good film for many reasons. *It has a wonderful visual style thats helps build tension *It features weaver's best performance to date. *The plot is fantastic and is similar to the 1stPlot: Alien 3 shows Ripley as having been the only survivor from her ship that crash-landed on a prison planet. An alien was on the ship and she has brought one (Or more?) with her. The convicts grow to accept her presence and seek her help to destroy a monstrous alien. In the film she also discovers a dark secret inside herself that gives her a decision that will change her life.This film is interesting. The special edition is even better, though the TR is still good. give it a try.",8,1,7,20 July 2007
Alien: Resurrection," Pretty good for what it is: A kick ass sci-fi flick
","Alien resurrection is an incredibly interesting thriller. It is set 200 years after the events of the third movie.Scientists have finally cloned a successful Ripley after several failures. This Ripley is different. She has an attitude, and that is the story's best asset.Her blood has become a mixture of human and alien blood. The scientists have now retrieved the queen alien from Ripley. But as predicted it reproduces and the aliens kill everyone in sight.A cargo collecting ship brings a crew to the sight and they soon get caught up in the problem. Ripley joins them in their attempt to escape and a new creature is formed...This film has wonderful visual effects, nail-biting tension and great acting.I believe people have been far too negative.",7,2,4,31 July 2007
Rocky V," poor
","Rocky v has become somewhat of a curiosity to me. I read highly negative reviews for the film and expected a lame rehash of the first. I was very polarized by the moral messages it has. The film was far from perfect, and fell flat with the glum ending, so naturally, i was highly disappointed.Rocky loses his money and his boy begins to resent him. He moves back to the streets of Philly with Paulie and Adrian and begins to train a new fighter, Tommy Gunn. Tommy is bombarded by the press and agrees to fight professionally. He betrays Rocky and hurts Paulie. Thankfully Rocky kicks his ass.What i didn't like at all was the fact that rocky ended up where he started, with nothing to show for what he had achieved in the past. The film is astonishingly wrong headedThis movie is different to the others, it has a different message, but its still the worst of the series.",3,6,12,27 June 2007
Hot Fuzz," Not as good as it's supposed to be
","I had many problems with this picture. Being a brit myself i expected a funny, gory, bubbly romp like Shaun of the dead. Instead i got an overlong, half-baked, marginally funny movie that wasn't much fun. A boring spoof on the buddy cop genre.The film stars simon pegg as a cop who has been moved to sanford to work. He makes friends with a fellow cop, but is suspicious about the towns lack of crime and high levels of 'accidents'. He then finds out what the cause is.In the area of faint praise, Hot fuzz has a decent finale. The gun fight between the villagers and the cops is well staged and pretty funny. It's a shame we have to sit through a lot of sappy, wooden rubbish before we get to this point.Hot fuzz is no where near as good as the reviews suggest. But it's not awful either.",4,1,7,11 October 2007
Alien," In space, no one can hear you scream...............
","Alien is a Creepy claustrophobic thriller that has gone down as one of the best films in history. It focuses around a group of people who are told to investigate a mysterious planet. They are savaged by an alien they bring on board, and only one (and a cat) is left alive.This is a very effective film.It paralyses your sense of fear, and entertains you at the same time. With great acting and a very intimidating killer, Alien has gone down as a classic.Although it was surpassed by its first sequel aliens, it is still an incredibly effective thriller.A giant in cinema.",10,0,1,19 May 2007
Rocky II," I was surprised. I very much enjoyed it
","Rocky 2 continues the same type of storyline the original had. It has touching moments, exciting moments, thrilling moments and all of these are pretty good. Rocky is now spending money endlessly with his payment for the fight in the 1st movie. He starts to lose control and struggles to get a job. Eventually he accepts his true path and agrees to a rematch with (the now bitter) Apollo creed. Rocky wins again in what is the best fight of the series.I liked this movie a lot. It wasn't flawless like the 1st, but it had some excellent moments. great entertainment.Enjoy!",8,1,1,26 June 2007
Rocky IV," Rocky is fighting for his country. All together now 'ROCKY,ROCKY'
","I thought this was generally cool. Sly Stallone was great. This time he's fighting a Russian that killed his friend in the ring. This character is accompanied by a group of hilarious 1-dimensional characters that suggest he is stronger than the average American tank. It sounds silly, but Stallone gloraphies the international issues surounding the fighters, which gives the viewer a strange political message.The fight was deliciously ridiculous. Rocky is not fighting a man, but a machine. The punches are too loud, and the editing is sloppy, but hey it still gets the adreneline going.What bugged me was the music. what happened to the sincere score of the first? It was filled to the rim withexcruiciating songs that i'dexpect to hear in a bad episode of pokemon. Having said this, I enjoyed it for what it was, a fight movie, little intelligence, but glossy and nutty for a reason. Campy fun!",7,1,2,26 June 2007
Spider-Man," It's not great, but it's fun
","Spider-man is a good comic book movie. I have a few complaints though.It is about a science project that goes horribly wrong. Peter's best friend Harry's father has been affected, and is now the green goblin. Peter has been bitten by a spider, and his Dna has given him the characteristics of a spider. And of course, they battle.The girl he lusts after is MJ, the girl next door. This development of their friendship is interesting throughout and it gives the movie some focus.The bad: The green goblin is unconvincing. The Speed at which SM swings through the air is just ridiculous, and some of the FX are shoddy.That aside, I enjoyed the film thoroughly.",7,0,1,11 October 2007
Aliens," Definitive proof that sequels don't always suck
","In aliens, elen ripley is rescued by a military establishment that have sent colonies to lv246 (the planet on which the first alien came from). She joins them in their quest to reestablish contact after it is lost. However, the team are bombarded with monstrous aliens after finding a young girl called newt on board. Ellen makes a srtong bond with the youngster and vows to rescue her after she's kidnapped. And the ending is a complete rollecoaster of thrills and sheer horror.Sigourney weaver was fantastic in this (well deserved Oscar nod), and the action was non-stop. I prefer this to the first, which is a huge achievement in my mind.Watch aliens, you won't be disappointed.",10,7,13,17 February 2007
Rocky," Sublime
","Rocky is one of the best movies ever made. Not from a technical point of view, but from an emotional one. A movie so extraordinarily powerful that I'm almost lost for words. I wont go much into the plot. It's about a young fighter(who's fallen for Adrian,the girl in the pet shop) determined to get some self-worth. He gets his chance when hes offered a chance to fight for the world title, and of course he gets the girl. It's predictable, but thats kind of the point. It's so involving and touching to go through rocky's experience.The fight is the allegory, the deeper meaning, the showcase for rocky's determination. It takes all our energy away from us, and ends in the perfect way. It ends just when we've had enough. And that was good enough for me10/10",10,0,0,26 June 2007
Titanic," A masterpiece
","Titanic is one of the best films of all time for many reasons. There is not one single problem with the picture. Not one. The effects are extraordinary, it's well acted, well written, convincing and spellbinding.Two lovers from opposite worlds fall in love aboard the doomed ship titanic. And then the ship meets her doom. Their relationship is strengthened by their struggle to survive. This makes the film an experience instead of just entertainment.Titanic has been bashed by many people for years. All I can say is that i think it is the second best film ever (behind shawshank), and that i don't care what they think.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate winslet are stunning and they give the film a basic story structure. Now these people can act.James Cameron cleverly shows the peril that the passengers are in. We can relate to them, and we fear for them. It is horrifying to see them die. It is an intense and visceral experience.This is a beautiful masterpiece about the tragic sinking of a great ship. super.",10,6,12,17 October 2007
Rocky III," Great fun!
","It lacks emotional depth, but rocky 3 is good entertainment. It shows the period of Rocky's success and his successful title defences. Rocky takes on a new fighter, Cluber Lang. He knocks Rocky silly in the opening stages of the fight and Rocky gets depressed. After being trained by old nemesis Apollo Creed, Rocky beats Clubber silly in the first three rounds.It's not as emotional as the first two, but there is more action and of course the song. 'eye of the tiger'This film is just plain fun.I wouldn't advise you to use your brain watching it.",9,1,1,26 June 2007
Psycho," It's the best horror of all time
","Psycho is as about as thrilling as a film can be.We start off by seeing a normal woman, Marion crane, who decides to steal $40,000 dollars from her boss. She fleas from her normal lifestyle and stops in a quite and tranquill motel. The bates motel. She is murdered in the shower by a shadowy figure in a now famous scene.Her sister and boyfriend are troubled by her disappearance and question the Bates owner, Norman. He denies killing her and the mystery leads of into a startling climax.The acting is fantastic and the thrills are non-stop. The only other horror that has come close is Halloween(and maybe alien).Psycho is the best horror of all time. period.",10,1,1,27 December 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Stunning. The best movie i have ever seen
","The shawshank redemption is the greatest film of all time, in my opinion. Having read great reviews for the film, i was determined to watch it myself. And that was probably the greatest film decision ever made by me. I will never forget the engrossing intensity of this masterpiece, it will stay with me and many others for years to come.It centres around a wrongly convicted prisoner Andy Dufresne and another nicknamed Red by his friends. After Red sees the wrongful imprisonment he becomes Andy's best friend and they create an unbreakable bond that is the core of the film. Years go by in Shawshank prison and the pair live with the tortures of shawshank. The neglect, the murder and the horror.But Andy changes this. He does extraordinary things for the inmates. HE befriends the guards, builds a big library and helps people with their problems. He saves them from institutionalisation.In the end an incredible series of events allows Andy to turn these factors on the prison and to get the responsible people imprisoned themselves. Andy escapes and leaves for a new life abroad. Red is released soon after and follows him. The ending sees them reunited.This is a definitive tale of how the human spirit can be denied nothing.",10,1,2,24 July 2007
Scream," A Very Clever satire
","Wow this really is special. Scream surpasses the expectation for horror films nowadays and it also comes in as one of the best ever.the plot: A psychopath decides to murder some teenagers from a local school, and to taunt them before doing so with his love of scary movies. it is simple but still very entertaining.The acting is great, the setting is perfect and you care about the characters.Behind Halloween this is probably the best slasher film ever made. It's funny, Gory and sexy what more could you want?A must see for horror fans!!!",10,0,1,17 June 2006
Halloween," Absolutely superb in every single way
","In 1978 a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter's 'Halloween' got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated, and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history.plot: 15 years after a murder took place, four friends (all females) are babysitting(and having it on with their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael myers Returns to his home town to stalk these people. He murders 3 of them silently and subtlety. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He hides....Only one of the friends escapes, after being saved by Doctor Loomis (Michael's pursuer and doctor) There is one reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We don't know where Michael is, we don't know why he kills, and he frightens us. They're the only reasons why we are afraid.John carpenter wrote the movie, and directed. He builds unbearable tension throughout the story, and scares to such a degree, that sometimes we cannot watch. And the climax is truly startling.As horror, this is essential. It is terrifying and well acted. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. A force that cannot be denied.The sequels focused too much around Michael and his 'history'. This movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. Perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece.",10,1,2,9 December 2007
Speed," I loved this movie. loved every audience involving minute of it
","Speed is an excellent action movie, populated with sympathetic characters and stunning visuals. A movie so intense, yet fun at the same time, doesn't come around often.Plot: You already know but what the hey. After an unsuccessful attack on a building, a terrorist plants a bomb on a bus that will detonate if the bus drops below 50mph.It is simplistic but effective. The minor details of the movie are what make it succeed. stunt work on and off the bus is photographed with daring explicity. Jan De Bont is determined to show us everything. He doesn't cower.The movie is also acted well. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have instant chemistry which inspires sympathy from the audience, which in turn heightens suspense, thrills, etc.These details come together to make a terrific action adventure. It's a shame that De Bont went on to make commercialist bilge like tomb raider 2 and the haunting. I must admit that i am one of the few people who will defend speed 2 cruise control. I found it to be highly enjoyable. Just though I'd say that",10,2,4,27 June 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Its Great !!!
","The Simpson's movie does have one fatal flaw. Too many subplots. In the movie Homer gets a pig, Lisa falls in love, Bart finds a father figure in Ned Flanders, Homer spikes the water supply with pig crap and the US government put Springfield in a dome.I personally think that this is a bit much for young children, and for its relatively short running time.This aside, the movie is flawless. None of the jokes fail and they all managed to make me laugh. The voice acting was great, and the animation was spot-on. There were also many interesting aspects about Springfield that we were unaware of during all of those years on TV.This movie is well worth a watch. I advise fans to see it immediately and to ignore its minor faults.",8,3,9,25 July 2007
