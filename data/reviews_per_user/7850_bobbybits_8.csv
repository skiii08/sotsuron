Skyfall," The formula has changed
","No Bond girls per say excusing M, No real gadgets, Moneypenny is an Assassin, while Q is a teenager.This isn't the traditional James bond that we all love. It was something different the film certainly had its moments and if after following the opening it would have been an awesome James Bond film. Unfotunately as the film rolled on it transformed into something else.Even the opening song Skyfall while sung beautifully, was visual and seemed to be about a part of Bond but not the entire film. It was full of striking visuals but not James Bond or Bond Girls. Instead seeing Chinese dragons and other visual scenery.My biggest disappointment was seeing the Classic Bond car, the only Bond car get blown up.I'm sure if you look out for it a henchman who James Bond kills comes back in a later scene to be killed again 6 out of 10. Okay film but not James Bond",6,24,104,24 October 2012
Lone Survivor," Frogmen aren't superman but there can be only one
","Awful. However I enjoy war films that make an impact, showing war for what it is. This film was miles off that mark. Making comedy to please the arena. Rather then actually paying the proper tribute to the fallen with their acts of courage, bravery and valour. There were absolutely no combat tactic's of any real battle significance shown as established.This film was a machine-gun'slasher, in it Rambo meets Sparta. The frogmen aka sniper-ninja's. Try to fly off of mountainsides a few separate times. Headbutting granite, smacking their necks, backs, limbs into tree's and rocks. When being riddled with .45 calibre rounds from enemy Ak47's. The enemy who engage with superior numbers, die overwhelmingly to single shot kill guns. Even when having many RPG's but not grenades. After the insurgents claim the elevated positions, they can not really create any shrapnel explosions of any kind, even when the frogmen are but a few yards below. The Talibunnies die in numbers to the holy hand grenade, in this propagated comically attempt at heroism. The scenery shown was within a lush forest. I am wondering what part of Afghanistan that region is? Perhaps bordered with Pakistan wouldn't response EVAC been more timely, if being backed by air support or drones? Would the insurgents not have planted IED's and mines where the radius for optics on their stronghold was in location. Despite of arming their goats with cell phones? Alas the frogman's tale is spun on the title, once being peppered with so many bullet holes they eventually. Well....Action film's could be made with realism when showing specific war events in honour of those that have fallen. Or they are turned into fiction. This is Sparta, NO, not at all..",1,79,145,10 February 2014
The Hunger Games," What a cop out
","This film is no Battle Royale or Lord of the Flies.It is Hollywood who have really dumbed down the book taking away a lot of the critical elements in an attempt to sell it to to the masses. Effectively making a very mediocre 12A taking away from its cult status. This film lacks all the elements of horror and the fight for survival, also the struggles of the poor versus rich and the evil ruling elite from the book. Instead we see a lot of Hollywood stereotypes and tweenie wannabes. With their smiling faces and over dialogues and CGI special effects. Well I had real hope here because it had a great story, sadly it was a complete cop out and the on screen content was really lacking. Ultimately I am thankful though this film smashed the box office higher then Twilight, so at least this group of audience is starting to head on better themes. Although I am absolutely disappointed with this final product, it could have been a lot better instead of making it with such a puke factor. The smiling faces and massive dialogue and those oh wow special effects. In place of the horror and terror and gore, the evils of the ruling elite and the ultimate fight for survival. It should have been much better, staying in line with its cult status following alone the lines of Lord of the Flies or Battle Royale some of my all time favs.5 out 10 a waste of time unless you know the tweenie bop",5,34,64,26 March 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not a take to retake..... Boring and Bland
","The 2009 version had a much better story and was far more raw, rugged, and compelling. I was incredibly disappointed by this Hollywood retake. The acting in this version was solid which is to be expected from the 5 star cast on display here. However this story really lacked by comparison, it dragged on and on to the point of boredom. In this versions its characters didn't interact into this film story much during its course. They were given little time outside of its main two characters, Rooney and Craig who interacted with each other to much. Also a lot of the elements here seemed to be cut out and were made differently. This took away a lot of the edge and mystery of the original film.I am curious on how Fincher takes the next two books in the trilogy, although with this film the original 2009 version was better.6.5 out of 10",6,6,11,24 January 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Epic, Awesome
","What a stunning adaption. Peter Jackson has smashed it again bringing to life J.R.R Tolkien's children's novel into a cinema masterpiece an epic journey on screen.I felt while I was watching this film that I was in middle earth through the scenes, locations, and each of the characters. These had so much to offer and brought that novel alive by bring it on screen taking me into it's fantasy world.It was exciting seeing each of the dwarfs personalities through each of their different characters, while played so very well.My only complaint was I didn't watch the 3D it would have been better viewing giving more dimension to each scene and set.Favourite scene Bilbo Baggins, Smeagol being hilarious, witty and dynamic.The film had a great introduction and finished wonderfully giving much anticipation for its return. Never once did I lose interest on this remarkable journey the duration was a lengthy one but was filled with adventure. I don't understand how the most successful film almost on record was given so much bashing by the critics? They are obviously paid to promote utter crap.9 out of 10 absolutely wonderful film",9,5,14,17 December 2012
Django Unchained," Mediocre, Long and Repetitive
","If you are a fan of slapstick, pie in your face comedy in which any clown can have a laugh at. While also having a taste for splatter. Then it obvious that you will hail this film as one of Tarantino's all time greatest.However this by all standards fall short of that mark.The dialogue was a Gunniess World Record at saying the N word the most and was used more so then any other single word through this films course. It's rhetoric came from a German bounty hunter and provided mostly lessons in etiquette or rather a politer way in killing. A short story on Broomhilda the naked Visgoth queen. A lesson in submissive dimples if they existed found in mankind those who praise this film rather then question its creation.The story had holes throughout. The main was with a man who killed in front of son. This undermined the entire message of this film, freedom. Whatever his past was he should have been granted life as he moved away from that past and created a family. His past which was nothing more then a simple robbery. At night the rifle had no night vision. Why was he released after killing Candy, having you believe in stupidity. In the bible bashing south an eye is for an eye, this meant letting him live as what he already had been so he could escape and repeat it all again. Six shooter guns are standard issue in that time period yet more shots seemed to be fired with devastating spatter making a cannon redundant. Pointlessly serving no effect other to engage those who love that type paint splatter show, often found in cheesy horrors. There plenty more reasons why this 3 hour film was by no means anything but spectacular rather just a fuelling of tension of issues of a forgotten past in a pie in your face comic and spattered attempt.The acting was every actors attempt at hiding their smirking faces, as they struggled not to burst forth into laughter at the comedy in each line of their dialogue.As western go there was little in the way of natural beauty which comes from there locations of those rolling plains, forests, mountains, deserts and rivers.With other Trantino's their are plots within plots serving intricate story lines. Not in this film a mundane 3 hours repeating itself again and again the same plot. Gratuitous violence and a record how many times can the N word be said on screen.Granted this film while spawn a sequel. Already it has begun a generation of Django's. 5 out of 10",5,2,7,20 January 2013
Mama," Yet Another Ghost Story
","Not a bad horror containing plenty of jumps, probably laughter at what was just so damn ugly. Although this story line has been done so many times before the concept is nothing new. Although in this film, it had one of the best 'crackhead' (pun) monsters on film, visually nasty. Riminiscent of The Ring, The Grudge, The Excorist and a few others great horrors. Disappiontment into what was turned out to be such a lame ending, this equated to a bird in the hand is worth more then two on the branch. While playing that boohoo melody with its white lights and Moths/butterflies CGI. The biggest flaw I had with this film was the doctor doing his own investigation right after running away. Dumb slang title so not much expectation.Middle road, 5 out of 10 for a nasty Mama",5,4,6,25 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Could you spend over 3 hours in a cinema watching this?
","I finally watched this in the comfort of my home. I cannot sit for over 3 hours after adverts in a cinema. If I have to use a facility to get a beverage etc, I would miss some of the film. I was very disappointed with its result.My main angers are. Bane as villain had no venom, he was never in the league of shadows at all. Nor does he have an English accent coming from South America. Catwoman had no tail, or whip, or even any leathers. Selina Kyle respects Batman, but always works alone and while they occasionally share a kiss they never are an item. This defeating the entire point of being a cat. Batman while his home is constantly being invaded, never goes broke, or sells his mansion. His butler Alfred is always loyal, and doesn't outlive his master as to incur an inheritance. Hollywood is constantly rewriting the script and producing something else...The film itself was full of great dialogue and very good acting. Although sadly it wasn't entirely Batman. the film was however the jihad versus America with its terrorism in New York. With the films lengthy duration came a lot of dialogue, had it been shorter maybe better action.7 out of 10 great acting and not a bad film, though it really wasn't Batman",Null,2,5,16 November 2012
