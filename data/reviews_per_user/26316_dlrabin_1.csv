Skyfall," Awful
","Its just cheap movie and nowhere near a bond movie we expected. We want a professional bond as Brosnan who is serious and fun to see at the same time with better stories and wonderful gadgets. I feel Craig and Bardem are wonderful actors but the production house might be out of money and creativity.<ul><li>Bond is no more hero we wanted. - MI6 and Q doesn't invent gadgets any more like they used to do. - This is fight against an old 00's, no more a country or organization.</li></ul>However, i will still see next bond movie, with a hope that will be a better one. :)",1,23,51,4 November 2012
