Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," German's Wake Up
","For the past three years I have developed the habit of watching movies and by now I have watched over 1600 movies mainly of the year 2009-2012. After watching the Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), I was unable to stop myself to write a review at IMDb, the movie clearly depicts the German's Army consists of useless soldiers, the country which in reality has conquered almost all of Europe, in the early history of the 20th century was shown in the most degrading and humiliating manner. The entire squad at the bomb factory was so nincompoop that they were unable to stop a band of four guys and a woman. They used all possible means even the heavy artillery guns but failed miserably. It is requested that the movie maker may be suggested that please make things more realistic than fairy tales, thanks.",Null,0,3,27 April 2012
Underworld Awakening," What a movie
","Well after watching this movie, it can be easily judged that Ms. Selene; was the only one who would have killed every werewolf of the movie. The rest of the cast was there for nothing. More so, was Ms. Selene was made of plastic that she was thrown from here to there and she was not even hurt, quite a clumsy thought it was? It was a movie for a toddler or a teenager at max, not a movie worth watching for. Quite kiddish concept; Ms Selene pistol were never go empty after firing hundreds of bullets they were still firing, what is this man? Have some reality. I think this movie was there to increase the repute of Ms Kate, which I don't think is on the downward slope. One women killing the entire US police force what a shame for them, they should go home and hire two to three Ms Selene to do their job. Make a fiction but not that much that it looks like funny and you still think you have done a great job what a parameter you set to judge a movie. I gave it 2/10 and nothing more, totally a ridiculous movie!",Null,3,6,29 February 2012
Man of Steel," Man of Steel
","Yesterday! I saw the movie 'Man of Steel' my observations are as follows:- 1. The computer generated graphics were at its best, everything was running so smooth and without any glitches that it really gives a real look, which was much appreciated. 2. In the starting scene of the movie the process of child birth was shown which I think was a bit graphical and was not suitable for younger children to watch it with their parents that scene should have been avoided; if possible. 3. The acting part of either the man of steel or the reporter from 'Daily Planet' Ms. Louise Lane and much to mention about the excellent gesture in the eyes of the editor of the newspaper was really heart touching and it really moved me as I was deeply touched. 4. In the ending scenes of the movie the destruction shown in the city created by General Zod and the superman was a bit annoying as that scene was over exaggerated as it was for a longer duration it really lose its vitality. 5. In the culminating scene of the movie at one side the General Zod was shown so powerful that he was melting the steel pipes and steel structures and on the other side he was so weak that superman just twist his neck and he died which I think was out of proportion. 6. At the beginning of the movie I was not comfortable with the new superman but his acting and performance as a superman and as a human being was very outstanding and it really make me to like him by the time movie was ending which is quite good as the gentleman really make his mark. I will rate this movie by giving it 9 out of 10, as it really allowed me to watch it in one go and not even allowed me to go out for a smoke as it has really created an environment in which I was forced to watch it without any distraction. A good job by all the team members of the Legendry Pictures which really know how to make a movie!",9,2,6,25 October 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Excellent Movie
","Tonight I watched the movie 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug', along with my kids and it was fun and adventure. The movie started with the pretext in mind of the first sequel of the movie 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' and the story unfolds rather slowly. The action scenes were pretty long and undue details were added making the movie length to 161 minutes. Apart from all this the archery skills of Mr. Orlando Bloom was worth watch he was shown too good with the use of the bow as well as his counterpart Ms. Evangeline Lilly. The scene of the Smaug the Dragon was quite long and unnecessary details and talk was boring then adventurous. The mounds of gold shown was too mouth watering but it was good. The fighting with Orc's was good but again lengthy. The running around of dwarf's was enjoyed by the kids and it was funny and laughable. This was a good time pass and it consumed almost many hours of the weekend night. This kind of movies is worth watching for both adults and kids and this movie really played its part. All the cast played their part in the befitting manner and overall it was a fantastic effort. The back ground music and the scenery was stunning and as it was filmed in New Zealand; it means the country is worth watching due to its natural scenery. I gave this movie 9 out of 10 as it was an excellent effort by all.",9,1,3,30 May 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Fantastic Experience
","Today I watched 'The Bourne Legacy' the second time and went to IMDb to saw the reviews and was astonished that the reviewer who even don't like the actor Jeremy Renner was giving the reviews and reviewing this movie badly just on the pretext that it's hero was Jeremy Renner which I think I quite unjust. I have the experience of watching over 3000 movies in the past three years and found that movies in which main or the side cast performed by Mr. Jeremy Renner are all good and block buster movies. I specifically found this movie very appealing as Jeremy Renner possesses a unique personality; he is cute, polite, agile, tough, emotionally very stable, and confident and such a handsome guy that his personality appeals that he should be watched in close context as he is a perfect person. His action's along with acting of Ms. Rachel Weisz, was perfect and up to the mark. Both did their job well. Furthermore I think that Manila Police Department should pull up their socks and get some new recruits as their present staffs are not performing their tasks correctly. Overall it was a great movie and over hero was at his best. I will rate this movie 10 out of 10,",10,4,8,20 November 2013
Joker," A Big Laugh
",Last night I went to watch the movie 'Joker'. While ten minutes in the movie I started feeling bored by useless and continuous laugh of the main character without specific reason. That continuous hammering of a laughing sound made me started to think that I have wasted my money and time to get out of the house and get really I mean really bored. The lighting in the movie is dark as I was watching game of thrones season eight. The movie was below my expectations as the Joker character shown in the movie 'The Dark Knight 2008' was much better than this person was and it really ruined the movie. No action scene no fighting scene simply nothing worth watching in the movie. I am disappointed.,3,12,47,25 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Strange Movie
","It's quite funny to watch that a four star general is discussing the strategic plans with a major, as this never happens in real life. If a four star general talks to a three star that seems reasonable but to a major is quite lame and out of proportion. Moreover, a major cutting joke with a four star general is also clumsy and pure fiction, in military culture it doesn't happens like that, it shows how much you put in to make a movie. In military life a major thinks before talking to a lieutenant colonel who is just one step senior to him rather as shown in the movie the major is negating the four star general, very funny. A four star general do not speak to the CO of an officer he rather have to talk to the minimum the corps commander if he want to take under command an officer of the rank of major of some other army. Showing the same image again and again was quite confusing rather funny and good for younger children and was not expected from a Tom Cruise movie. I gave this movie 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,20 September 2014
Fast Five," Mexican's where are you living?
","I watched the movie today, apart for some childish action and destroying of entire Mexico's capital with just 2 cars and 9 guys it makes one think that is Mexico a pathetic country where entire police force is unable to stop a single money heist? Tugging of a container with two cars and rampage the entire city is too much fantasy that anyone can laugh about it and say Mexican's please wake up and do something about your country otherwise you will be perished in this world. Reviews should be logical and not that it s a good movie or a bad one. Mr Vin Diesel is just pulling up the legacy of first movie. For a teenager it might be a good movie but after watching thousands of movies this looks quite sub standard and useless activity to watch a movie and waste money and time, where there are good movies that can be viewed.",Null,1,2,6 October 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Real Deal
","Recently I watched the movie, 'Transformers, the dark of the moon', and I must say that this movie deserves to gain over a billion dollars in box office. The details are brilliant, the graphics are perfect, and action scenes are fast and natural. The cast did their role in the best possible manner. The story was good as it unfolds from start and reaches the climax in the end. One must really enjoy watching it in a cinema and it really gives the best for the money spent. I took it so willingly that I watched it many times and every time the interest and entertainment was different. I must suggest all of you out there to see all three movies in one go to get the right enjoyment. I must admit that a new movie of the same franchise should be there to assist the previous three versions. The voice of 'optimus prime' was so appealing and so invigorating that it really feels he is so concerned about the safety of the world and his fellow transformers and that he has full command on his voice. The movie is light comedy, full action; slight romantic and I must say all qualities in one feature film are quite appealing. I gave this movie 9 out of 10 score and hope you will like it too as I did?",10,1,3,10 September 2013
The Great Gatsby," A True Friend
","The movie started with a young boy who went to New York to pursue his carrier as a stock broker. His shack was built alongside a villa owned by Mr. Gatsby. During the initial part of the movie it was portrayed that no one has seen Mr. Gatsby as his reputation is preceded as he is a ghost or he is a murder or he is sort of some kind of a spy. Later part of the movie reveals that he is poor man who by using his mind and energy at the right time and right place made him a millionaire in a very short span of time.

The ending of the movie is quite dramatic and Mr. Gatsby was shot in the back by a person whose wife was killed by Ms. Daisy. In the end Mr. Nick Carraway tried his level best to make sure Ms. Daisy attends the funeral of Mr. Gatsby by failed miserably. Overall the movie was excellent and it really touches the heart. A good pastime for your money; the entire cast played their part pretty well.",9,1,2,30 May 2014
