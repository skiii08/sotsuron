The Avengers," meh...
","Watched it. Not all that good at all. For Example, why does Hawkeye have more than enough arrows while fighting against the Avengers, but as he joins 'em in their fight, runs out of arrows? Why does Hulk go berserk against everything on the shield flying boat thing, but fights with the avengers at the end, without a real reason given, even saving Iron Man? Hawkeye isn't even a real super-hero, but hits with every Arrow without even aiming ( At the end, there's a scene where he blindly shoots to his right, of course hitting the target) Sorry for the Random rant, liked that film either way, but could've been better >.> . And of course, SpiderMan was on a vacation while New York was invaded by 'Invincible' Aliens, DUH.",5,8,25,6 May 2012
