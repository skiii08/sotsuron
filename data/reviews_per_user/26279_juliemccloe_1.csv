United 93," Most Compelling Movie of 2006
","United 93 was one of the most compelling, heart wrenching movies of 2006. In knowing this, the characters give amazing performances, and show the brave love of human beings. When you watch this tale of tragedy, you wish and hope for a happier ending. But it doesn't happen. The tragic ending of these strangers and innocent people clenches your heart. At one point, the sadest point, one man clings to his fate as they crash to the ground. The strength and heart of these people really depresses me. They were amazing individuals.All Americans should see this movie. It shows the strength of strangers, who fought back and saved others.",10,1,3,24 June 2006
