It," 'It' is more than a horror movie - it's a great film
","Note to the film makers out there who consider themselves horror aficionados... When you create a horror movie, start with the intent to make a great film.'It' has a built-in cult following as many Stephen King adaptations do, but this film stands alone as the best Stephen King adaptation outside of 'Shawshank'. Why? The filmmakers do justice to several crucial elements to any good film: 1. They focused on a true-to-life script that felt real for both the setting, the characters, and the villain.2. The acting, especially by the child actors who are the lifeblood of the film, was phenomenal.2A. Let me single out Bill Skarsgard here, playing Pennywise is no small task, it takes a wide range of emotions that play out each time we encounter It - on several occasions we see Pennywise elicit several emotions in a matter of seconds - he brings an unpredictability and sporadic physicality to the role that works INCREDIBLY well and really keeps you on your toes. You're engaged whenever he's on screen. Kudos to his voice and terrific evil clown laugh, there's so much to love about his performance which I feel may be understated - the makeup is so scary that it may get lost just how much Skarsgard is bringing it in every scene. 3. The villain was the stylish, creepy, Pennywise - obviously the film needed this character to be near flawless to create a sense of impending doom at any moment... Success, Pennywise, even for those not afraid of clowns, puts most inter-dimensional pseudo-demonic villains to shame.The film works so well because character development was handled very carefully, we learn about each of our young protagonists along the way, and what we learn about them is continuously exposed by Pennywise in order to weaken their will. Without spoiling anything, this is a film about children being tormented by a demonic-clown, the very thought of children in danger can be unsettling, but 'It' takes it to the next level - within the first 10 minutes of the film you will understand what you're in for, and you'll know right away that NO ONE, regardless of age or how you might feel about violence toward children, is safe. The other great thing about this film was cinematography coupled with special effects... honestly, and I did not expect this going in - but 'It' is a visual spectacle - the set design, the scenery, the color-scheme, it's all beautifully (and sometimes terrifyingly) done.I could go on and on, this was a top notch horror film, plenty of jumps (if you're prone to that sort of thing), lots of spine tingling moments, and truly, nothing cheap - this film doesn't hold back. Beyond being a great horror film, it's a terrific coming of age tale, well written, well acted, well directed. I wouldn't be shocked if the film gets some surprise nods during awards season for cinematography, editing, sound, makeup and special effects, just my two cents.In summation: 'It' is a dazzlingly terrifying spectacle that will stun you with every punch it doesn't pull. It goes beyond being one of the best horror movies of the past few decades, 'It' is simply a tremendous film. Horror movies - take note, THIS is how it's done.",9,7,15,13 September 2017
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 is hilarious, brutal, and surprisingly heartfelt
","I won't say much, if you enjoyed 'Deadpool' then you will enjoy 'Deadpool 2' in terms of comedy. There's a lot of reviews here saying that it's just a rehashed version of the first film, I disagree. I think the comedy here was pretty fresh considering it's a sequel, which generally suffers from trying to replicate a formula that worked before.Yeah, there's fourth-wall breaking, Wade Wilson is still a sarcastic, over-the-top smart-mouth, and the film is full of gratuitous violence - but reapplying those themes that made the first film a success doesn't mean you've created a carbon copy (or even close).There was an actual maturation of Wade Wilson's character throughout the film, while there was very little development of other characters. For the most part, the supporting cast (new or returning characters) is under-developed, with the exception of Cable, who was a great addition to Deadpool's story. Cable has more depth to his character than expected here, and that helped the overall arc of the film feel more gratifying and less antiquated.The big surprise for me was that, in the end, the film was pretty heartfelt - which was a big step for me with the character. Deadpool is an antihero, he's a total a$$hat, but in the end, he's someone who kills bad guys, and it's tough to understand WHY if the character doesn't have SOME heart. That's what this film did well, they added depth to Wade Wilson, they added some heart overall - there was a moment or two that, dare I say, I felt these eyes begin to water, unexpectedly - which was a nice touch that was missing from the first film.If the first film wasn't for you, this one won't be either - the antics still exist, but the formula is different. Reynolds is still prefect for the role, and Josh Brolin is a great addition to a surprisingly complex character. It ain't the Shawshank Redemption here people, but it's a fun ride with a ton of laughs. Sit back, relax and enjoy.",8,1,2,17 October 2018
Toy Story 4," I'm glad I got to see you again
","I didn't know following Toy Story 3 if another chapter was necessary. I am happy to say after watching the fourth installment of the franchise that it was a story that needed to be told. The first film came out when I was 7 years old. Andy was around the same age. I grew up with these characters, but only after watching this fourth film did I realize the characters were growing up with me. After the third film you realize that Woody and Buzz being passed on to Bonnie was representative of these characters being passed on to a new generation of children. We had to pass them on to the next generation as much as we felt like they belonged to us, just as Andy did with Bonnie.Without spoiling the film, it does feel conclusive. Like we finally are saying goodbye. And just like the emotion of passing the characters on to the new generation through Bonnie, the feeling that we are saying goodbye translates to the characters in this film.Woody, Buzz, even though it feels like it's over, I'm glad I got to see you again.When you'll see the movie, you'll understand.",9,1,4,30 June 2019
