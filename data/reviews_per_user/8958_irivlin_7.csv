United 93," Good film but the Shake-Cam makes it unwatchable.
","I did like the film in some respects but I do not like to leave the cinema with motion sickness. Paul Greengrass (a fellow countryman of mine) either has a neurological disorder or he's obsessed with throwing the camera around to induce sickness in his audience. There was a time when steadicam was used - very frugally - to try and give a little immediacy to a movie. Mr. Greengrass should try and grasp the fact that steadicam is like garlic - use it a little and only on occaasion. To have the entire film with focus going in and out, and with juddering and shaking (which would make a 7 year old with a camcorder look professional by comparison) shows that he has 'Shake-Camitis', to the exclusion of all other cinematographic techniques. Anyone else on earth could have made a much better job of the photography. After I had to sit and suffer through The Bourne Supremacy (another of Mr. Greengrass's Shake Cam monstrosities, I've decided to leave Mr. Greengrass's films and his St. Vitus's dance to other unfortunate cinema attenders. UGH!",3,0,4,19 August 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," The emperor's new clothes.
","How sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be. As soon as a few critics say something new is good (ie - 'Shake-Cam'), everyone jumps on the bandwagon, as if they are devoid of independent thought. This was not a good movie, it was a dreadful movie. 1) Plot? - What plot? Bourne was chased from here to there, from beginning to end. That's the plot. Don't look for anything deeper than this. 2) Cinematography? - Do me a favor! Any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job (I am not exaggerating here). This film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work. The ridiculous shaking of EVERY (I really do mean every) scene will cause dizziness and nausea. 3) Believable? - Oh yes definitely. This is a masterpiece of credibility. I loved scenes about Bourne being chased by (local) police through the winding market streets of Tangier. - I've BEEN to Tangier. Even the guides can't navigate their way through those streets but Bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse. Greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples. 4) Editing? - I don't know what the editor was on when he did this film but I want some! - Every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds. I felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the 'scenes' flashing by. 5) Directing? - Hmmm. This is an interesting aspect. The film appears to have actually NOT had any directing. More a case of Greengrass throwing a copy of the script (all two pages) at the cameramen and told to 'shoot a few scenes whilst drunk'. - 'Don't worry boys, we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room'. The editor should be tarred, feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6) Not one but TWO senior CIA operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood Jason Bourne. - Putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't a traitor. Talk about stupid nincompoops. (Whilst the evil male CIA members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor). (well, all men are evil, aren't they? - Except for SNAGS of course). Yes, this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity. 7) When the you-know-what finally hits the fan, good triumphs over evil (just like it always does, eh?) and the would-be assassin gets the drop on Jason Bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger (Yeah - right...) - at that very moment, the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger. - How did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath? Wonders will never cease 8) Don't worry, there's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts. Well, we can't have nasty, politically incorrect, CIA operatives going round shooting people, can we? How lovely to see a true to life P.C. film of the Noughties. -------------The Bourne Ultimatum is utter rubbish.",1,175,314,11 August 2007
Wanted," Dreadful, dreary, hackneyed load of old rubbish.
","What a pity that actors as good as James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman can allow themselves to be degraded by such pathetic nonsense as 'Wanted'. I went with my sister, who I haven't seen for a couple of years. After this film, I felt embarrassed that after this long time apart, I ended up taking her to this turkey. I stayed to the end but was crawling in my chair from about 50% of the way through the film, wanting to get out of there. I didn't leave because I didn't want to spoil it for my sister. - Little did I know that she was desperate to get out of there too. I don't think I'll have the hide to ever suggest we see a film together.....This dog of a film trawls new depths. Whereas 'The Matrix' hit the mark (the first one, that is - the second and third ones were dreadful). To compare The Matrix with 'Wanted' is like comparing dog food with a top meal at Maxim's in Paris. The two films are about as far apart in terms of entertainment and excellence as it's possible to be. Save your money - don't see this film. It will leave a very bad taste in your mouth for a long time to come.",1,16,43,30 July 2008
Ratatouille," The best animated film I have ever seen
","I don't need to give a synopsis, since there have been so many from other reviewers. As you can see, all the feedback has been extremely positive. I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth to the reviews and agree with all the other people who feel that this animated film is the jewel in the crown of animated movies. Happy, sad, poignant, uplifting, nostalgic, BELIEVABLE (yes, really!) and ethereal. This is a must watch for all filmgoers. I can't wait to buy the DVD. I just hope there's a chance it'll be available in high definition, to do the experience justice. See this film, even if you have to crawl over broken glass and hot coals to get to it. It was a privilege to watch this superb piece of art.",10,1,2,14 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," Criticisms regarding plot holes.....
","1) The money had a 'transponder' in it. - Somehow it seems to have managed to put out a massive amount of radio frequency energy (without an aerial) - so much energy, in fact, that Chigurh is able to pick up the signal from many miles away. How did the battery last this long? - This might have been a GPS or cell-phone type of transmitter - thus explaining the wonderful distances it can operate at BUT is it likely that drug dealers would use a national system for tracking drug money? (ie a dead giveaway as far as they would have been concerned).2) Zero out of ten for the deputy placing an arrestee behind him, whilst he's on the phone. The fact that he got strangled was one of the good points of this film. - Such stupid deputies should not be allowed to achieve sexual maturity and (horror of horrors) possibly pass such stupid genes on to subsequent generations.3) People in this film seemed to end up horribly injured and bounce back in minutes or hours. Hardly manifesting any signs of pain or incapacity either at the time of the trauma or subsequently.4) Chiguhr seems to have a supernatural ability to track people down. The US military should offer him $5 million to find Bin Laden. - That way, we'll save billions in Iraq and Chigurh will murder all Bin Laden's lieutenants along the way. (Unless they win the occasional coin toss).Yes - it is honorable to make an ending that doesn't work out like the stupid duel in 'Heat' but the ending WAS badly constructed, unsatisfying and showed a lack of inventiveness or intelligence. If anyone ever saw the final episode of 'The Prisoner', the ending of No Country for Old Men was almost in the same category of no-talent stupidity. Moss - a man who'd been a soldier in 'Nam, had talents as a survivor somehow got located by the Mexicans in no time flat. A film has a duty to be entertaining - that is their raison d'etre. This film stopped entertaining in the final 15 minutes. The Coen brothers have demonstrated much greater skill in many other films. Having said all of this, the sound was superb and the photography pretty good. The characters were very wooden. Listening to Tommy Lee Jones drone on with his homespun, fake Texan drawl, philosophy bored the balls off me. They could have removed him from the film entirely and the result would have been a much more interesting film. Ugh! PS - message for the Federal Authorities, local police forces, DEA, ATF, etc etc etc - There are a load of dead bodies to be dealt with......",6,3,6,12 January 2008
Gangs of New York," This was a good film, rather than a great film
","I won't go over the story - It's been well described. 1) Direction - good but not up to Scorsese's best 2) Acting - Daniel Day-Lewis 10/10 (The film is worth seeing just for his performance. This will definitely earn him an Oscar). Jim Broadbent - 8/10 extremely creditable. Leonardo Di Caprio - 6/10. OK but somewhat disappointing. Cameron Diaz. 5/10. So-so and her role was not just superfluous but rather distracting in many respects. 3) Cinematography - 9/10. Stunning and any of the CGI effects were seamless. 4) Editing. Very poor. 2/10 It always amazes me how poor editing can make or break a movie and I regret that Scorsese took his eye off the ball, in this respect. (The bad editing disrupts the flow to the extent that things get disjointed and confusing at times). 5) Screenplay - 5/10. Could easily have been improved. I can't but hope that at some future date, they'll be a re-release of this film that has been re-edited. It would be a big improvement. All the above taken into account, it still was a good film. At 2hrs 45 minutes, it is too long. 2 hours would have been the perfect length.",Null,0,0,15 February 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," The shaky-cam made me nauseous. The plot was hopeless.
","What on earth are some modern photographers up to? - I was taking moving pictures better than this with my dad's Super 8 camera, when I was 6 years old. The 'scenes' last about 1/4 second and that wouldn't be so bad if the viewer had even a fighting chance of focusing on anything. This, unfortunately, is not possible as the photographer seems to suffer from Parkinson's disease, hemiballismus  and St. Vitus' Dance - all at the same time. The shots were badly exposed, out of focus, jerking this way and that way and nearly always had some head or other object obscuring most of the subject matter. In short - literally, truly and genuinely an unwatchable movie. About 10% of the people in the cinema walked out. I envy them. I'm greedy and wanted my $9 worth. Like an idiot, I stayed to the end and I still have the effects of motion sickness. Apart from this appalling and pathetic demonstration of avant-garde cinematography gone seriously wrong, the plot was convoluted, improbable and generally a yawn from beginning to end.  Compared to the original movie, which was excellent, the new film appears to have been made by an alien who's balance organs haven't quite adjusted to Earth's gravity.My score? - Easy - 0.001 out of a possible 1000. - Whatever disdainful superlatives I contemplate, they still don't adequately describe this dog of a movie. Ugh!",Null,0,1,26 August 2004
