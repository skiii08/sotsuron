Frost_Nixon," Excellent... was thinking about it the next day....
","Fantastic film. The acting of Nixon was the best acting I have ever seen in a film..... Not a dull moment.... I saw this in England with a British friend and we were both blown away by the acting and story of this movie. It brought back old memories of endless Watergate headlines and this film just tightened up all the memories/events. So well acted, it left you almost feeling sorry for Nixon but you would hear yourself argue about the severity of the crime and his position. This film was two hours long but it didn't feel like it. Top 10 films I've seen this year!",10,1,3,14 February 2009
Juno," Great film
","Great film, the dialogue was quick, witty and intelligent. I took my 12 year old and was worried about the content but it was handled very well. It's nice to see a bright, non-conformist American high school student featured so well in a major film (even though she does get pregnant). Well done, keep it up. Very touching and tastefully done. After seeing PS I Love you, I was disillusioned about what is coming out of Hollywood but was glad to see this. I might keep going to the major cinemas again! It seems many PATHE films are worth watching. The main actress and her parents were perfect for the part and their lines were entertaining and a compulsive view. Very good directing. Please keep coming out with quality films such as this. Watched in the UK, Epsom, Surrey.",10,4,9,9 February 2008
P.S. I Love You," Oh dear, How embarrassing
","As an American ex pat, living in the UK for 8 years, this movie was a total embarrassment. Who watches this stuff (in the USA?)? I only watched it because my 12 year old was having a cinema party and THEY wanted to watch it. The acting was atrocious, the story line was probably written by a cheerleader who likes Ireland or something. It was Hollywood at it's worst. Please, if you think you are going to do a film partly about a European country, have some Europeans on board who will advise you how schmaltzy a film can be for the rest of the world (and don't release it over here). The theatre was pretty empty and I can see why. Waste of 6 pounds for me. The main actress was so annoying to watch and look at, those teeth, my goodness.... Only redeeming qualities were the shots of NYC and Ireland and a rather good conversation between the mother and daughter towards the end. It wasn't worth watching for those reasons however.",1,31,54,27 January 2008
Music and Lyrics," Leave your kids at the theatre; don't stay with them to watch this!
","Geesh, Hugh Grant is hitting all time lows here. This is just boring Hollywood predictable script stuff. Pathetic. I just went because my 10 year old wanted to.Found the cheapening of Buddhism sad. As usual, everything is for sale in the USA.... Hugh just doesn't seem to get away from these rolls of a dithering something or the other. He's pretty one dimensional. This is just boring Hollywood, 3rd rate writers rehashing a bit of Love Actually and Notting Hill. There WERE some clever lines but not enough to waste 5 quid on. I don't know why Hugh Grant lets these roles go on. He was looking a bit worn in the film also (nice to know he hasn't gone the botox route!). Can a choreographer work with him please (he does have a nice bum)???? ;-0 :-)",2,2,8,24 February 2007
