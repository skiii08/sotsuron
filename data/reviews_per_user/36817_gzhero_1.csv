Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," play the role. whatever.
","the critics are kinda right in there perspective. although, they're always looking for the utopian/anti-utopian world of they're own self-absorbed dreams.and they're always trying to be the world's intellectual filmic frontmen and women....i don't blame them.episode one is indeed cold in the space of a deeper character development.  and it's got a lot of annoying creature camp.but the movie plays a role in a far bigger picture, than some pathetic film critic's wishes for deep thought.it's a definite must-see.  but then so are films like the italian recent 'life is beautiful'.  or i dunno.. 'shakespeare in love'.we are a playful species, however.  us americans. we are the world's most powerful warriors, collective. and we should like to believe we belong to some higher order or priority or cause for our actions.  we want to believe we are as powerful and benevolent as jedi.no?so whom shall the critics criticize? americans? critics themselves? hmm?watch the movie.  but know there's a lot more out there than what you think is worthwhile, people....",Null,0,1,19 May 1999
