Vertigo," For Me, VERTIGO Keeps Getting Better Over Time
","(No fooling -- SPOILERS galore here!) It's hard to believe now, but when I was younger, I used to have a love/hate relationship with Alfred Hitchcock's classic romantic psychological thriller VERTIGO. I loved its suspense, moving performances, haunting love story, dreamlike quality, and poignant yet powerful Bernard Herrmann score -- so why did it take me years to embrace VERTIGO as wholeheartedly as our beleaguered hero John 'Scottie' Ferguson embraces his beloved Madeleine Elster? James Stewart plays Scottie, a former police detective who finds out the hard way that he has acrophobia (fear of heights, to us laypeople) when he can't save a patrolman from falling to his death during a rooftop chase. Since VERTIGO is a Hitchcock movie, what better place for our hero to live and wrestle with his phobia than San Francisco? While working on a cantilever bra invented by an engineer (nice work if you can get it!), Scottie's gal pal, designer Midge Wood (wry scene-stealer Barbara Bel Geddes) tries to help him overcome his fear gradually with stepladders ('I look up, I look down...'). Too bad the ladders happen to be next to Midge's high-rise apartment's window. Poor guy, it's always something! Scottie's old college chum Gavin Elster (suave Tom Helmore) offers him a private investigator job tailing his lovely but troubled young wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak in her finest and most challenging performance). Seems that Madeleine -- one of the coolest and most elegant of the director's legendary 'Hitchcock blondes' -- thinks she's possessed by the spirit of her late great-grandmother Carlotta Valdes, and is behaving accordingly. Scottie tails Madeleine all over San Francisco to the places where the tragic Carlotta lived, loved, and went mad after her sugar daddy 'threw her away' and kept their love child. Our detective finally comes face to face with his quarry after saving her when she jumps into the bay in one of her fugue states.As the song says, the hunter is captured by the game. Soon Scottie and Madeleine are mad for each other -- but it seems poor troubled Madeleine is also mad in a less romantic way. When she confides in Scottie about her recurring morbid dreams about the Mission at San Juan Bautista, Scottie brings her there in hopes of curing her obsession. Bad move, Scottie -- Madeleine bolts to the bell tower. Scottie gives chase, but his vertigo paralyzes him halfway up the stairs (great spatial F/X here). He hears a woman screaming, sees a body fall past the window...and his beloved Madeleine is no more.Or is she? After he recovers from a grief-induced nervous breakdown, Scottie spies shopgirl Judy Barton (the versatile Novak again). Except for her red hair and somewhat tacky fashion sense, Judy's a dead ringer for Madeleine! As their relationship grows, so does audience apprehension as Scottie obsessively tries to give Judy the ultimate makeover, recreating his lost love. (Where's the WHAT NOT TO WEAR crew when you need them? :-)) Judy's a quick study -- because she's really Madeleine! See, Judy was Elster's mistress, and he coached her to look and act like the real Madeleine Elster as part of a murder plot. 'Twas the real Mrs. Elster who died at the mission that day, and Elster's real purpose for poor Scottie was to witness the 'suicide.' Since Judy truly loves Scottie, has all the self-esteem of a squashed grape, and doesn't want to spill the murder plot, she's willing to play Eliza Doolittle to Scottie's macabre Henry Higgins. But the jig is up when, post-makeover, Judy wears a necklace Scottie recognizes as part of Madeleine's Carlotta Valdes collection. Furious at being played for a sucker, he takes Judy to the mission tower and forces her to confess. A black shape looms. Guilt-ridden Judy is so spooked by what turns out to be a curious nun (Judy must've gone to one of those tough parochial schools) that she loses her balance and falls...and a shattered Scottie loses his Madeleine a second, final time, looking like he wants to join her.When I first saw VERTIGO in my college years during its 1980s re-release, I thought it was well worth seeing, but Scottie's necrophilic mania to recreate Judy as Madeleine really upset me. I found myself rooting for, angry at, and sorry for Scottie and Judy all at once. Stewart's portrayal of a man obsessed is tragic and unnerving; Hitchcock really knew how to tap into his leading man's dark side. As if the ghoulishness of Scottie's romantic obsession and the malleable Judy's heartbreaking lack of self-esteem weren't frustrating enough, even the department store salespeople and salon personnel in the film go along with Scottie's demands ('The gentleman certainly seems to know what he wants.') despite Judy's anguished protests. My husband Vinnie aptly noted that everyone on screen acted like Scottie was having a dog groomed.On my first time around, it seemed to me that Hitchcock gave away the mystery's solution too soon, making the rest of the film anticlimactic. But my appreciation for VERTIGO grew over the years as I matured and learned more about life, people, and emotions. By the time we saw the beautifully restored version of VERTIGO at NYC's Ziegfeld Theatre in 1996, Judy's revelatory letter touched my heart and added to the suspense of waiting for the other shoe to drop for Scottie. There's no question that VERTIGO has long since become one of my favorite Hitchcock films!",9,15,20,22 August 2010
In Bruges," Great Performances and Dialogue Make IN BRUGES a Modern Classic
","I first saw the dark comedy-thriller IN BRUGES (IB) in our local multiplex back in April 2008, and I loved it immediately. No wonder writer/director Martin McDonagh's screenplay went on to be nominated for an Oscar, and co-star Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical! When McDonagh's short film SIX SHOOTER, starring Brendan Gleeson, won the 2005 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, I was already familiar with his plays (including the 2005 Broadway hit THE PILLOWMAN with our family's household fave Jeff Goldblum), so I looked forward to seeing Gleeson work with McDonagh again in IB. I wasn't disappointed. McDonagh's quirky, funny, soul-searching dialogue is a joy to hear. It's chock full of profanity, but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive. The filmmakers even spoof the 'adult language' in one of the DVD's bonus features, a montage of every time the word 'F***' is used in IB.Gleeson and Farrell make a great seriocomic team as Ken and Ray, two Irish hit men who have suspenseful and surreal adventures hiding out in Belgium in the magnificent city of Bruges after their latest job goes horribly, heartbreakingly wrong. They're the ultimate odd-couple tourists as they await further instructions from their boss, with Ken enjoying the sightseeing and the swans as Ray spews forth befuddled, unfavorable, hilariously un-PC opinions of just about everything and everyone he encounters, except a pretty Flemish production assistant (Clemence Poesy of 127 HOURS), who's as full of surprises as our undercover assassins. Farrell gives one of his very best performances, blending laugh-out-loud comedy and guilt-ridden heartache beautifully. My favorite running gag was Ray's childlike fascination with dwarfs, and his oafish but well-meant concern for cokehead dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), who's in the fairytale-like city to appear in a dream sequence in a local indie art-house flick. As Harry, the boys' crime boss, Ralph Fiennes does a terrific job channeling Sir Ben Kingsley as the terrifying Don in SEXY BEAST (I assure you, that's a compliment!). IB mixes suspense, melancholia, and hilarity very well indeed. Along with THE BANK JOB, IB was my favorite crime film of 2008. The DVD's featurettes and deleted scenes are fun, too, including interviews, a captioned boat tour of Bruges, and a deleted scene involving Matt Smith in his pre-DOCTOR WHO days -- and a machete! The many deleted scenes are all quite entertaining; I'm sure they were only cut so IB wouldn't be a 3-hour epic! :-)",10,21,29,20 April 2011
12 Monkeys," Mind-Bending and Heart-Breaking
","Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast.  Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss!",9,141,168,31 March 2002
Cloverfield," Freshest, Scariest Horror Film in Years, Critics Be Damned!
","Oh. MY. GOD!!! CLOVERFIELD has everything: terror, laughs, pathos, sympathetic characters, a kick-ass Giger-like giant monster covered with what turns out to be even more destructive parasites, and location filming in NYC (and L.A., I'm told) with jaw-dropping F/X and one of the most chillingly apocalyptic endings since Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. What's not to love, at least for us creature feature fans? CLOVERFIELD plays like GODZILLA MEETS THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT sprinkled with a pinch of MIRACLE MILE, except that I found CLOVERFIELD's twentysomething protagonists far more sympathetic than THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's self-centered overgrown brats. (The whole cast is likable, but Lizzy Caplan stands out as Marlena, who had the bad luck to be at the wrong party at the wrong time, waiting for friends to meet up with her.) The film cleverly presents its harrowing story as found footage taken from a camcorder discovered by the military in 'the area formerly known as Central Park.' The camcorder in question is wielded mostly by affable dimbulb Hud (T.J. Miller) at a farewell party thrown for his pal Rob (Michael Stahl-David) before he leaves to take a job in Japan (oh, the irony! :-)). The first 20 minutes or so play like one of those indie comedies about young adults getting their bearings. It's all fun and games until the Statue of Liberty's head crashes into midtown Manhattan. :-) Soon, Hud finds himself documenting Manhattan's destruction ('People are gonna want to know how it went down!') as he, Rob and others make their way across what's left of the collapsing, chaotic city to try to rescue Beth (Odette Yustman), the girl Rob loves, after hearing her tearful cell phone message that she's trapped under debris in her family's posh Columbus Circle apartment building. I know, being trapped in a posh apartment doesn't sound so bad, but trust me, Beth's upscale address doesn't seem so inviting by the time our beleaguered heroes reach her.The found-footage gimmick is used especially well. Seeing the events through the eyes of Hud and his roving camcorder strips everything down to its barest, scariest essentials in the movie's fleet-footed 84-minute running time. No scientists step in to explain the origins of the vicious beasts; the closest we get to an explanation are a few terse words from military personnel and glimpses of TVs in stores (often while said stores are being looted) showing news updates, talking about tankers being capsized and such. Since Hud has accidentally been recording over a tape of Rob and Beth spending a day on Coney Island, the little bits we occasionally see of the couple in happier days sneak in some backstory, as well as providing CLOVERFIELD with one of the most ironic-in-context last lines since the late Ulrich Mühe's 'It's for me' at the end of THE LIVES OF OTHERS.I must say I don't understand all these movie critics who've blasted CLOVERFIELD for its film-making style (though Richard Roeper and the Chicago Tribune critic filling in for Roger Ebert loved it, and rightly so) and for its alleged insensitivity and exploitation due to the plot's parallels to the horrific events of September 11th, 2001. My family and I, born and raised in New York, still lived and worked in NYC on 9/11. While we were lucky enough not to have lost any friends or loved ones in the terrorist attacks, I can tell you the makers of CLOVERFIELD did a splendid job of capturing the feel of a disaster-stricken city and its terrified but determined citizens. People need to get a little perspective, if you ask me. For heaven's sake, Japanese filmmakers have spent decades responding to the destruction their country endured during World War II by making Godzilla movies and related creature features. With nearly 7 years having passed since 9/11, why shouldn't American filmmakers like CLOVERFIELD producer J.J. Abrams, writer Drew Goddard, and director Matt Reeves make a horror movie in which New York City is decimated by a giant monster who makes Godzilla look like a sweetheart, with nightmarish, surreal destruction and loss of life that outdoes even the horror of the World Trade Center attacks? I mean, at least in real life, the entire borough of Manhattan and its people weren't destroyed. In the meantime, those of you reading this who haven't seen CLOVERFIELD yet should drop everything and go see it now, now, NOW!!! ...Migraine and Motion-Sickness Sufferer Alert... It's been said that for some sensitive moviegoers, the deliberately shaky camera-work in certain scenes caused queasiness. To be fair, I can understand why. For me personally, the combination of the Shaky-Cam and the strobe-like effect of the malfunctioning lights in Beth's ruined hallway during the Columbus Circle rescue scene kept threatening to trigger my migraines. However, I don't consider that to be a flaw in the movie so much as a flaw in my brain. :-) Nevertheless, the Shaky-Cam cinematography is appropriate for the film's premise, so hey, caveat emptor! ...End Migraine and Motion-Sickness Sufferer Alert...",10,18,36,20 January 2008
Fargo," Frances & The Coens at Their Oscar-Winning Finest!
","Even people I know who can't stand the Coen Brothers' style *love* this slyly low-key comedy-thriller. Unlike so many 'offbeat' movies, the quirkiness of FARGO's Oscar-winning screenplay never cancels out its warmth or suspense as the Coens deftly balance clever plotting (*not* really based on a true story, as a poor disturbed Japanese woman found out when she came to the U.S. to dig up the hidden ransom money only to freeze to death trying), engaging characters, scares, poignancy, and the brothers' trademark loopy humor. Darkly hilarious as the kidnappers' bungling is, it renders the violence all the more chilling; one minute you're laughing, the next minute you're cringing over the shock of sympathetic characters meeting swift, bloody deaths. I found myself feeling terribly sorry for poor, sweet, unsuspecting Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud), her vulnerable adolescent son Scotty (Tony Denman), her wealthy father Wade (a delightfully bombastic Harve Presnell), and the other poor slobs unwittingly caught up in car salesman Jerry Lundegaard's plot to get money out of Wade by hiring two thugs to kidnap wife Jean and hold her for ransom, not factoring in the kidnappers' lack of both patience and anger management skills. Nobody plays losers like William H. Macy, and he sure deserved his Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Jerry, who ought to have his picture in the dictionary next to the word 'inept.' Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are letter-perfect as the loose-cannon wife-snatchers; if Buscemi isn't our generation's Peter Lorre, I don't know who is. But the heart and soul of FARGO is Frances McDormand, who truly earned her Best Actress Oscar here. Looking a bit like a young brunette Carol Burnett, McDormand is beyond superb as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant sheriff (my husband always liked the fact that FARGO doesn't include the nigh-obligatory scene of The Pregnant Heroine Suddenly Going Into Labor At The Worst Possible Time) who runs circles around the bad guys *and* her own well-meaning police force. Courteous and smart, down-to-earth yet slick, her luminous blue-green eyes never missing a thing, McDormand's Marge comes off as a warm Minnesota (is that an oxymoron? :-) female hybrid of Joe Friday and Lt. Columbo (I mean Columbo's stealth smarts, not his sloppiness :-). If you love FARGO, you owe it to yourself to own the deluxe DVD, chock full of way-cool extras too nifty and numerous to go into here -- oh, yah! :-)",10,17,23,11 July 2005
Burn After Reading," Kooky Coens At It Again with Dark Screwball Paranoia Comedy
","Winning Oscars hasn't kept Joel and Ethan Coen from their tradition of switching back and forth between comedies and dramas. The brothers have followed up the brilliant Western noir NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN with the funnier, less bloody but no less wickedly anarchic BURN AFTER READING (BAR), reuniting actors who've worked together in and out of previous Coen Brothers movies. Set in Washington, DC and environs (portrayed brilliantly by New York and New Jersey :-)), BAR is a screwball paranoia comedy about people who work in intelligence, pitted against people who lack intelligence. :-) When Osborne Cox (John Malkovich, proving he fits right in with the Coens' loopy repertory company) loses his CIA job, he decides to write his memoirs. A disk found at the Hardbodies Gym with what ditsy trainer Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) suspects is 'sensitive s**t' belonging to Cox builds a chain of nutzoid misunderstandings, violence, and other paranoia-fueled shenanigans. Those drawn into the insanity include Chad's co-worker Linda Litzke (the ever-wonderful Frances McDormand, her blue-green eyes communicating as much as her dithery yet determined voice. She's also wearing Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh hairdo, but it looks better on McDormand :-)), hoping to finance her extreme plastic surgery makeover by getting money from Cox; reward or blackmail, it's all the same to Linda and Chad. (Without giving away too much, love-starved Linda ends up an unwitting femme fatale, in every sense of the term.) Then there's womanizing Treasury agent Harry Pfarrar (George Clooney, doing a frantic comic version of his Oscar-winning SYRIANA role right down to the beard), a man who needs to run after sex (literally and figuratively) to stay in a good mood and is never without an oddball choice of words: 'I have lactose refluxDoes that contain shell food?'; Tilda Swinton as Katie, Cox's tightly-wound pediatrician wife; Richard Jenkins as Ted Treffon, Hardbodies' manager, who's secretly in love with the clueless, self-absorbed Linda; and J.K. Simmons and David Rasche as CIA men who have to sort out the increasingly crazy mess. The whole cast is terrific, but if anybody steals the show, it's Brad Pitt with his two-tone hair and smilingly bumbling attempts at extortion. Like our household faves Max von Sydow and Anjelica Huston, Pitt knows when to have fun with a role, and his delight in playing Chad is infectious. Even BAR's little details are a hoot, like Cox hiding out on his houseboat and keeping in shape by exercising to FitTV's GILAD'S BODIES IN MOTION (I've used the show to further my own fitness efforts :-)); Harry singing 'My Eyes Adored You' and 'Born Free' in the shower (alas, we only see this from the viewpoint of Chad, who's hiding in the closet :-)); and Linda using the (fictional) romantic comedy COMING UP DAISY, starring Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes, as a litmus test for the dates she meets online. (There's even footage of Mulroney urging the unseen Daisy to get down from a tree. Maybe Mulroney did it as a favor to his buddy Pitt.) Between his affairs and 5-mile runs, Harry finds time to be a hobbyist; without spoiling anything, I can only say the contraption he builds gets my vote for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object. I'll admit BAR may not be for all tastes, but to quote James Thurber, if you like this sort of thing (and obviously I do), it's the sort of thing you'll like!",9,9,20,25 September 2008
The Village," WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! Who Are THE VILLAGE's True Monsters?
","THE VILLAGE is flawed, but better than it gets credit for. People were probably disappointed because the film was sold as a thriller when it's a mood piece about how fear and paranoia impact a community, a timely theme in our post 9/11 world. Instead of misrepresenting THE VILLAGE as a twisty shocker a la THE SIXTH SENSE, the marketing department should've tried another approach: 'M. Night Shyamalan as you've never seen him before!' :-)Unlike MNS's previous films, it's easier to see through this story about the citizens of Covington Woods, an 1890s-style farm community, who won't venture beyond their village's borders because of their uneasy 'truce' with the 'creatures' outside, including jettisoning anything colored red, the 'bad color' that purportedly attracts these creatures. The narrative transparency causes the dreamlike effect of MNS's usual leisurely pace to peter out too soon. Fortunately, the stellar cast, beautiful Pennsylvania scenery, and eerie atmosphere held my attention. Former co-stars William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver reunite as village elders Edward Walker and Alice Hunt; for once Hurt's slightly dazed soft-spokenness suits his character! :-) Joaquin Phoenix, re-teaming with his SIGNS director, radiates quiet strength and intensity as Lucius Hunt, who tries to cross the village borders into 'the towns' for medicine to combat the community's recent rash of illnesses and deaths. Phoenix is well-matched by Bryce Dallas Howard, lovely and endearing in her film debut as Walker's blind daughter Ivy. I liked Ivy's subtle boldness as she saves the day after the guys who accompany her to the village borders chicken out. No surprise that Adrien Brody signed on for the role of mentally-challenged Noah Percy (or as his character has been dubbed by smart-alecks, 'the VILLAGE idiot') as his first post-Oscar role. It gave him an opportunity to work with a hot director (turning MNS down at this point in his career would've been like turning down Alfred Hitchcock in the 1940s and '50s), and most actors can't resist playing handicapped characters. Brody did a fine job with a role more complex than it first seems. In Brody's able hands, overgrown child Noah simultaneously breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and creeps you out. His behavior reminded me of autistic/ADHD children I've known, so I was particularly moved when Lucius wonders if 'the towns' might have medicines to help Noah 'sit still and learn.' (Seeing Brody in 1890s-style clothing got me thinking how great he'd be as Ichabod Crane if somebody films ...SLEEPY HOLLOW again!) The finest moment in Brody's performance comes after Lucius and Ivy's engagement is announced. Up until this point, Lucius, Ivy, and Noah have been a trio, with Noah responding affectionately to Ivy's kindness. That changes forever after the engagement, when Noah turns up on Lucius' doorstep with grief in his heart, tears in his eyes -- and a knife in his hand. After the attack, Noah's parents find him rocking agitatedly on the porch, frightened of 'the bad color' on his bloodstained hands. When Ivy finds out, she confronts Noah, who holds his arms out to her, clearly sorry and hoping for forgiveness, only to have Ivy start shrieking and hitting him until she's dragged off him. Although what Noah did was horribly, unforgivably wrong, his howls of anguish and wrenching sobs almost brought me to tears. (I'd love to see Brody's and Howard's performances get award nominations!) When Lucius' wounds become infected, Ivy must trek to 'the towns' to get medicine. Here's where the twist (and the *SPOILER*) comes in: Walker gives his daughter what turns out to be a prescription, and the foreshadowing (particularly various Villagers' revelations of losing loved ones violently in 'the towns' in their pre-Village lives) pays off. Our villagers *don't* live in the 1890s. The time is now...the village is a sanctuary from today's world, created by the town elders to raise their children away from the tragedy and heartbreak of their former modern city lives...the creatures were fabricated to keep the young people in line and in the dark, with various townspeople -- including Noah in mischievous-child mode -- donning creature costumes and skinning small animals periodically to scare everybody. And Walker masterminded it all! A history teacher from a powerful family, Walker used his inherited wealth to establish this quasi-Brigadoon in an isolated area of the Walker family's game preserve, with the adults conspiring to keep the village going with various deceptions. I liked the idea that Walker's rich enough to pull this off, with the preserve personnel on board with the ruse (when the young ranger Ivy meets outside the game preserve realizes she's a Walker, he quickly agrees to help her); I'm all for the idea of living in one's own little homemade world! :-) But why the hell would supposedly intelligent modern people like Walker & Company set their new community in an ersatz 1890s (even the gravestones list 1890s dates!), a time without *antibiotics?!* The film begins at the funeral of a little boy who, it's made clear, is one of several children who died of illnesses that could've been cured with the right medicine. I can't believe Walker and the town doctor didn't take precautions to have modern meds available just in case, to say nothing of medicine/treatments that might have helped poor mentally-stunted Noah and maybe even Ivy's blindness! It's unconscionable that, however well-meant Walker's power trip is, he and the others would let their children die or be damaged for life rather than go into 'the towns' for help, even if it means their elaborate ruse might collapse around them! (Amish people come to cities for supplies or trade in real life, so why couldn't Walker and the villagers do the same?) THE VILLAGE would've been more compelling had the script delved deeper into that aspect of it, with the secrets, lies, and power the elders have, but at such a terrible cost. Then MNS might have had a future classic on his hands, not just the cinematic equivalent of a nice try.",7,8,11,8 October 2004
North by Northwest," From The Master of Suspense Came the Daddy of the Modern Adventure Thrillers
","Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree! NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soignée Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy. Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :-), though the smoothly villainous James Mason nearly out-suaves him. My husband and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments. With all due respect to Grant, if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, 'Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?' they would immediately reply, 'No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you.' :-) Also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores. Anybody who wants to write or direct a chase thriller should watch NORTH BY NORTHWEST first to see how it's done!",10,50,73,7 February 2004
Quantum of Solace," Riveting Craig, Great Action Make Up for Uneven Plotting & Characterization
","In his second James Bond film, QUANTUM OF SOLACE (QoS), the riveting Daniel Craig again proves he's the most ruthless 007 since Sean Connery, blasting the Bond formula with a breath of fresh air -- that is, when he and the cast can catch their breath between great rock'em-sock'em action scenes that wouldn't be out of place in the BOURNE movies (no surprise, since some of the BOURNE personnel were on board)! Although director Marc Forster effectively films all of QoS's running, jumping, and doing, I would have liked the movie even more if the plotting and characterization had gotten as much screen time as the frenzied action sequences, like the excellent CASINO ROYALE. (I know I'm dating myself here, but it's still hard for me to invoke the title 'CASINO ROYALE' without thinking of the 1967 comedy version. :-) But I digress...) I do hope the next Bond film has a better balance of action, plot, characterization and emotion, otherwise we might as well be watching a video game. I liked the stern yet warm-beneath-the-surface, almost mother-son relationship that Craig's Bond and Dame Judi Dench's M are developing (Bond wryly acknowledges this in a throwaway line). I also liked Olga Kurylenko as Bond's revenge-minded main love interest, Camille; she's one of the few good-guy Bond girls who can take care of herself instead of 'Oh, James!'-ing all over the place. I wish they'd made better use of the winsome Gemma Arterton, though; she deserved to do more than just invoke GOLDFINGER. Heck, with all the running around the characters did on screen, I didn't even realize Ms. Fields' first name was Strawberry until I saw it in the closing credits! I wish they'd done more with Arterton's character, but at least she got endearingly naked with Bond. Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright return and are most welcome, although Wright still doesn't get as much to do in the role of Felix Leiter as he should. Ah, well, now that Bond has avenged his beloved Vesper's death and gotten the dying-of-thirst Dominic Greene (reminiscent of his MUNICH character) to drink oil, maybe the next Bond film can concentrate on new plots and scenarios with a better balance of all the elements that make 007 fun to watch, and they'll let Daniel Craig crack a smile -- or at least a cool, knowing smirk -- more often. :-)",7,11,19,27 January 2009
No Country for Old Men," A Career Best for the Coens, and the Scariest Oscar Nominee Since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
","The Coen Brothers turn back to crime in their stark, stunning, justifiably Oscar-nominated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (NCfOM). There's a Sam Peckinpah feel to this gripping 1980-set thriller. It's a morality play and a tense suspense story rolled into one  the leaner, meaner, more vicious brother of the Coens' previous great thrillers BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO.NCfOM's protagonist is Vietnam vet Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin in a brooding, laconic, star-making performance), who goes hunting near the Rio Grande and finds himself embroiled in nightmarish mayhem and violence, Texas prairie style. Instead of bagging wild game, Llewellyn bags $2 million in drug money after stumbling across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, complete with corpses, even a dead dog. (It's chilling to see the bodies in the process of decaying as others happen upon the scene over the course of the movie.) Llewellyn thinks he can just take off with the money, dodge whoever might come after it, and live happily ever after with his sweet wife Carla Jean (played with a letter-perfect Texas accent by winsome Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. Brolin and Macdonald make a wryly endearing couple. The rare times Llewellyn smiles, it's usually when he's talking with Carla Jean). To his peril, Llewellyn doesn't figure on being pursued by the likes of murderous bounty hunter Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a mysterious figure with a pneumatic cattle gun, a penchant for using a coin toss to decide whether someone should live or die, and a voice that sounds like it's coming not from a human being, but from the bowels of Hell itself. Chigurh relentlessly pursues the equally dogged Llewellyn through Texas as the compassionate, sad-eyed Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones as the film's voice of reason) tries to catch up, feeling overmatched by the sheer implacable evil of the 'ghost' that is Chigurh.The film's pacing is deliberate, but for me that simply increased the suspense as I wondered what Chigurh would do next and if Llewellyn had a chance in hell of eluding him for good, especially with his ever-increasing number of injuries. The suspense scenes are real nail-biters. There's a thrilling chase with Llewellyn pursued at night, first by a monster truck, then into the rapids by dogs. Pit bulls don't stand a chance against bullets! :-) One of my favorite scenes finds Llewellyn in his motel room in the dark. The only lights are the glowing tracking transmitter he finds in the drug money and the light under the door from the hall outside -- until a pair of feet appear on the hall side. All we hear is the transmitter...and the sound of a light bulb in the hall being unscrewed, resulting in more darkness...and I can say no more!It's a tribute to the power of Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh that his unflattering Beatles moptop-cum-Prince Valiant pageboy haircut doesn't stop him from being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. It got so that every time Chigurh showed up, I'd watch the rest of the scene between the fingers covering my face, because I knew Bad Things Were About To Happen. Bardem's Chigurh is all the scarier because he can seem utterly calm and casual even as he blows people's brains out with that pneumatic cattle gun of his. The thing can blow out locks as well as brains, so its versatility makes up for its cumbersomeness. :-) As good as all of this year's Best Supporting Actor nominees are, I'm rooting hardest for Bardem to win the Oscar.There's some humor in the dialogue (taken mostly from the novel), but it's of the low-key, matter-of-fact variety. My favorite is the exchange between the deputy and Sheriff Bell: 'It's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?' 'If it ain't, it'll do till the mess gets here.' My favorite black-humored sight gag: after Chigurh launches a protracted attack in which a cop is killed, the camera pulls back to show that the floor is completely covered with scuff marks from the dead man's shoes flailing and scraping against the floor during the struggle.Be warned, NCfOM is not for the squeamish or for those who like their endings neat and tidy, with everyone getting what they deserve. Nevertheless, it still haunts me, to the point where I happily paid to see it in a theater for a second time (with relatives who were as blown away by it as I was). Could NCfOM end up being the bloodiest, most suspenseful Best Picture Oscar winner since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? I feel that NCfOM is not only one of the best films of 2007, but one of the best films the Coens have ever made, richly deserving its 8 Oscar nominations. It's still playing in theaters as of this writing, so by all means, get out of the house and into a theater to see it for yourself!",10,6,12,26 January 2008
The Pianist," Adrien Brody's Minimalist Acting Packs Maximum Emotional Punch
","This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)",10,139,176,9 January 2004
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Big Food and Big Fun in Animated Adaptation of Beloved Book
","CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS (CWACOM), based on the beloved 1978 children's book by Judi and Ron Barrett, is almost Pixar-level good! My family and I saw this animated treat in 2D rather than 3D because we wanted to take advantage of a local theater's morning matinée. However, we didn't miss the 3D effects in this vivid, playful, rollicking adaptation; we were having too much fun! Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, CWACOM deftly combines the warmth of a Pixar film with the zany sight gags of a Looney Tunes cartoon. The movie also expands entertainingly on the book's premise about the little town of Chewandswallow (in the film, the town is part of an economically-depressed island, Swallow Falls), where food drops from the sky like rain, with surreally madcap results. The film gives the townspeople more personality, including an endearingly awkward protagonist, young scientist wannabe Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader). When Flint hits on a way to convert water into all manner of foodstuffs, saving his town from poverty and an all-sardine diet, he finally becomes a town hero after years of having his inventions laughed at. To our hero's frustration, his laconic but well-meaning dad isn't quite on board with his son's success yet, fearing he hasn't thought through the possible consequences. (This being an animated film, of course Flint's mom is the only person who believes in him, and of course she dies young.) Flint teams up with aspiring weather-gal Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), who's as ambitious and eager for acceptance as Flint is; merciless childhood teasing led Sam to hide her smarts behind her pretty face and perky personality. The film makes some good points about the pros and cons of craving other people's approval and over-sized food portions. Happily, Lord and Miller put all of this across with a light touch, a refreshing lack of sap and snark, and a super-size helping of hilarity and wit. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the majority of the laugh-out-loud funny gags aren't so ridiculously topical that they'll feel dated by the time the DVD comes out. :-) There are tips of the hat to classic science fiction movies, but those scenes will still be fun even if you've never seen the films in question. The gags aren't just funny, they're plentiful. In fact, our family would love to see CWACOM again to look for all the uproarious background sight gags we missed the first time around! Even Flint's posters of his scientist heroes are funny and clever, drawn to look like rock star pin-ups. There's a side-splitting payoff to every little running gag -- sometimes literally, like with the walking TV Flint invented. As chaos reigns late in the film, a looter carries off a TV -- and Flint's walking TV carries off the guy! (THE TWONKY, anyone? :-)) Spaghetti tornadoes with meatball meteors, feral Gummi bears on the attack, schools closed on account of falling giant pancakes -- what's not to like? The voice cast is terrific, too; in addition to Hader and Faris, we loved James Caan's imitation of James Gandolfini as Flint's dad; Bruce Campbell as the self-serving mayor; Andy Samberg as former sardine factory icon Baby Brent; Mr. T. as gung-ho cop and loving dad Earl; and my favorite, Benjamin Bratt, who's deadpan funny (yes, both Bratt's voice and his animated character's face are deadpan, smarty :-)) as an unassuming bystander who turns out to be a doctor, saving Earl's young son from his food coma: 'I came from Guatemala for a better life. Good thing, huh?' As a side note, one plot element that particularly hit home for our family was Sam's peanut allergy; during a climactic action scene, she's scratched by knife-like shards of peanut brittle, resulting in a race against time to get her back to their ride so she can use her Epi-Pen before anaphylactic shock sets in. Our daughter could relate because of her own peanut/tree nut/sesame allergies. Of course, she carries her Epi-Pen everywhere (good girl)!",10,5,10,19 September 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Tim Burton and Roald Dahl: A Movie Marriage Made in Candyland
","When my husband and I heard that Tim Burton was making a new film version of Roald Dahl's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY starring his favorite leading man Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the world's quirkiest candy maker, we knew it would be a perfect match of filmmaker and source material, and indeed it is! Burton's inventive imagination and dark, twisted sense of humor suits Dahl's gleeful misogyny perfectly, yet still results in a family-friendly film simply because, like Depp's Willy Wonka, it doesn't pander to the young'uns. Indeed, Wonka doesn't even seem to like the golden-ticket-winning kids he invites to his weird and wonderful confection factory, though in his own oddball way Wonka eventually warms up to our hero Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). Who wouldn't like the selfless, poor-but-thankful-for-his-blessings Charlie, especially compared to the four spoiled brats competing against him for the 'special prize' Wonka dangles before them? The kids' acting styles work well, with young Highmore's un-actorish down-to-earth quality playing off well against the appropriately flamboyant brattiness of AnnaSophia Robb (as super-competitive Violet Beauregarde), Julia Winter (Veruca Salt, the overindulged rich kid), Jordan Fry (Mike Teevee, now an aggressive video game freak as well as a television addict) and Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop, a sweet-faced but selfish glutton). Wonka is also given a back story of funny yet poignant strife with dad Christopher Lee, a dentist (!) who takes his work just a little too seriously. This angle could have been as overly sweet as a bad piece of candy, but the cast, Burton, and screenwriter John August work it gracefully into the family theme. Unlike Wonka, Charlie has a loving relationship with his eccentric family (all played with warmth and wit by a cast of fascinating faces, especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor as Charlie's dad, and Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's cabbage-soup-making mom). It helps that Depp and Highmore have good chemistry. (Fun Fact: Depp recommended Highmore to Burton after working with the lad in FINDING NEVERLAND. Another FN veteran in the cast: Eileen Essell of DUPLEX fame, playing Charlie's Grandma Josephine.) With Alex McDowell's production design, Philippe Rousselot's lush photography, and Gabriella Pescucci's costume design, the movie is deliriously gorgeous to look at, like a collaboration between Edward Gory and Peter Max. Thanks to the deadpan performance (or should I say performances? :-) of a CGI-multiplied Deep Roy, along with Danny Elfman's fabulously fun score -- with songs based on lyrics from Roald Dahl himself, yet reminiscent of Elfman's work with Oingo Boingo -- the Oompa-Loompas' production numbers are a delight to watch and listen to (no cover version of 'The Candy Man,' sorry! :-). Our whole family had a blast -- CHARLIE... is the tastiest sweet-and-sour sugar rush of the summer!",9,5,8,18 July 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Love Story As Only Charlie Kaufman in a Phildickian Mood Could Tell It
","Yes, I realize that any review that isn't an unabashed love letter to this film is likely to get a 'No' vote! :-) I hope you'll note that although I didn't love this film, I didn't hate it, either. Charlie Kaufman's script deserved its Oscar, the acting is top-notch, the emotions rang true, and the DVD's got loads of goodies -- it was the direction that I felt dragged the film down.If Philip K. Dick had written a romantic comedy, the result might have turned out like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. In this seriocomic SF love story, Jim Carrey proves again that he's not just another mugging face, and Charlie Kaufman proves that he's the master of surreal dramedy. Director Michel Gondry, however, proves that Spike Jonze is really the most suitable director for Kaufman's particular brand of daffiness.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are stunningly believable as dysfunctional couple Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Clem initially seems like a sexy free spirit with a roguish streak, but as their romance continues, Joel sees the dark side of Clem's impulsive nature: on her bad days, hard-drinking Clem is needy and temperamental. What's worse, she sees Joel's relentlessly low-key, emotionally walled-off nature as a rebuke to her recklessness. Mutual misery ensues.No wonder Clem finally consults Lacuna, a Manhattan company run by avuncular Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) that erases your memories of a bad relationship. Lacuna even sends postcards to clients' intimates telling them not to mention the erased ex again, as Joel discovers when he sees one in their mutual friend's mail. Heartbroken, he also opts for the Lacuna treatment. While the erasing process takes him through memories of life with Clem, we discover that, when Joel wasn't being passive and Clem wasn't drunkenly cracking up Joel's car at 3 AM, the couple also enjoyed many good times together. Joel's reluctant to forget these happy moments, and that's where the film gets phantasmagorical as reality, fantasy, and memory collide. Within the maze of Joel's mind, he and Clem (who's been panicking and feeling like she's 'disappearing' as she's slowly wiped from Joel's brain, despite having already forgotten him) team up and try to hide in all kinds of memories she has no part of. The funniest of these is the scene in Joel's childhood home, as a shrunken-to-child-size Joel faces Clem as his mom's miniskirt-clad, go-go-booted neighbor.The details of Lacuna's workings are ...SUNSHINE's most consistently witty, entertaining bits. Lacuna looks like a typical busy doctor's office, with receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst at her most winsome and dimply) constantly scheduling appointments: 'Valentine's Day is our busiest time.' Funny yet poignant details abound, such as the teary-eyed client loaded down with her dog's belongings, a crucial part of wiping away memories of a loved one. The actual procedure is performed by young computer techies Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood, leaving Frodo Baggins far behind) who erase the subjects' memories in their homes while they sleep. The techs act like a bunch of fun-loving but irresponsible babysitters, swilling the unsuspecting Joel's whiskey, smoking pot and having sex (with Mary, not each other :-) as he sleeps. But Patrick goes beyond mischievousness into unethicality: usually a strikeout with women, he's begun dating Clementine, having fallen in love with her while erasing her Joel memories. Patrick tries to take the expressway to her heart by wooing her with her discarded Joel mementos. Of course, he doesn't consider that since Joel's relationship with Clem went sour despite all those nice gifties, history just might repeat itself. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bigger payoff to the Patrick subplot; he just kind of disappears from the film as if *he* were erased. Of course, that may well be the point! :-) Director Gondry, who also directed Kaufman's HUMAN NATURE (2001), spends so much time cross-cutting, juggling the movie's timeline, and inexplicably staging certain scenes in darkness with only a flashlight rendering the characters' faces visible that instead of enhancing the storytelling, it's merely distracting. I kept getting the feeling Gondry didn't trust the story itself to keep moviegoers' attention -- ironic, since he shares story credit with Kaufman and artist Pierre Bismuth. Having said that, when the visuals work, they work wonderfully, like when our hero and heroine dash through Grand Central Station while commuters wink out of existence left and right.Refreshingly, the New York locations aren't the usual hip or glamorous places. Joel and Clementine live in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and their apartments look just like homes of college students or artistic types trying to inject Soho style into suburbia. The filmmakers also make splendid use of the stark beauty of Montauk beaches in winter.For Carrey fans seeking slapstick and belly laughs, ...SUNSHINE... may seem to drag on eternally; its humor is more in the rueful TRUMAN SHOW vein, shot through with Kaufman's trademark surrealism. If you want a love story that will make you laugh knowingly and think about the way people approach relationships, ...SUNSHINE... is worth seeing. Hopefully it will convince you that counseling is a better approach to your relationship problems than science-fiction gadgetry!",7,8,15,19 March 2004
Stranger Than Fiction," Helm and Forster: The New Kaufman and Jonze?
","I saw STRANGER THAN FICTION (STF) on its opening weekend, and I think it's one of the most engaging, funny, poignant movies about writing, the creative process, and human nature I've seen since ADAPTATION. While Will Ferrell is a fave in our household, I must admit this is the first time I've seen him in a movie and thought of him as the character he's playing, not as Will Ferrell. Toning down his screechy/crazy qualities without losing his ability to make audiences laugh, Ferrell stars as unassuming IRS agent Harold Crick, who loves his job, so you know his life needs an overhaul! :-) Even Harold's curly-topped sidewall haircut seems to hint that his well-ordered life is about to dissolve into craziness. One morning, it does, amid FIGHT CLUB-style captions and the plummy, ironic tones of a British female narrator accompanying Harold's thoughts and actions in the opening scene -- narration that Harold can hear along with those of us in the audience. Our increasingly puzzled, alarmed hero soon realizes he's the protagonist in a novelist's new book-in-progress -- not just any novelist, but the reclusive Karen 'Kay' Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who's been suffering from writer's block for 10 years and whose novels always end with her protagonists dying! As Kay's publisher sends compassionate but no-nonsense troubleshooter Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to help unblock her, Harold seeks help from literary professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), an expert on the problematic author's favorite phrase 'Little did he know...' It might be a subject especially dear to a writer's heart (especially in gags like Hilbert questioning Harold on standard literary devices to see if he's the hero of a comedy or a tragedy: 'Have you been invited to a country house and had to solve a murder?...To find out what story you're in, I have to find out what stories you're *not* in...'), but I found STF funny, touching, and playfully surreal as director Marc Forster and screenwriter Zach Helm prove to be the new Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, only with a touch of sweetness. In addition to the excellent Ferrell, Hoffman, Thompson, and Queen Latifah, the great cast includes Linda Hunt and an all-but-unrecognizable Tom Hulce as well-meaning but unhelpful psychiatrists, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana, an anti-establishment baker who refuses to pay taxes on munitions (The Clash's 'Death or Glory' plays in the background when Harold visits her bakery to audit her, only to be booed and heckled by Ana and her customers. Later, Harold wins Ana over by bringing her flours -- that's right, flours, not flowers! :-). There's nice location shooting in Chicago, too. STF is well worth heading out to a theater to see, and when it inevitably comes out on home video, it'll definitely be in the Writers' Movies section of my DVD collection alongside ADAPTATION, THE SINGING DETECTIVE, and the underrated ALEX AND EMMA!",9,80,113,25 November 2006
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig: Blond, Brutish, Short, and the Best Bond in Years!
","I saw the new, gritty, pulse-pounding CASINO ROYALE (CR) on opening weekend, and *IT ROCKS!!!* I sat grinning smugly from ear to ear, my faith in Daniel Craig as the new James Bond proving well-founded as the pumped audience cheered and carried on! After seeing him in LAYER CAKE and MUNICH, I knew Craig would make an awesome 007, despite all those tiny minds out there ready to reject him as being too blond, brutish, and short. :-) CR totally reboots the Bond series. Right from its spectacular, stylish black-and-white opening sequence in which Bond earns his 'license to kill' status and then some, this movie kick-starts James Bond as an ass-kicker with shades of vulnerability and reserves of ruthlessness that do both Ian Fleming and Sean Connery proud! Even my mom, who swore she'd never love another Bond after her fave Pierce Brosnan, gushed about Craig after seeing CR, and there's much to gush about. For one thing, Craig's got the rugged good looks of a Cro-Magnon Steve McQueen, with bristly blond hair and laser-sharp blue eyes that could drill right through you, plus a buff physique that's shown off delightfully when he emerges from the surf in the Bahamas. It's the male version of Ursula Andress' introductory scene in DR. NO -- yes-s-s! :-) Heck, Craig's naked body is so amazing to behold, even villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen, who'd be an intimidating presence even without Le Chiffre's unnerving tears of blood, the result of an old eye injury) makes approving remarks about Bond's build as he tortures him in a scene that's faithful to Fleming's original novel while improving on it at the same time. However, I didn't appreciate the decision to change the film's high-stakes baccarat game to Texas Hold 'Em poker. Maybe they thought more moviegoers would identify with a poker game, but it seems to me that the sophistication of baccarat is more appropriate for a Bond movie. Despite that quibble, in addition to balancing intensity and dry wit that deftly kids the time-honored Bond movie traditions/clichés (as opposed to the overdone, forced jokiness that's plagued the series off and on since the Roger Moore years), Craig has a humanity that I feared had been formula'd out of 007. Take Bond's ever-evolving relationship with British Treasury Agent Vesper Lynd, as played by THE DREAMERS' Eva Green. While Green doesn't quite possess the screen presence or charisma of such classic Bond leading ladies as Andress, Honor Blackman, or Jane Seymour, she and Craig still strike enough sparks to be a good match physically and emotionally, each of them hardened loners who slowly grow to love each other (the result of Oscar-winner Paul Haggis contributing to the script, perhaps?), plus I like the wry twinkle in Green's aquamarine eyes. Most of the cast is terrific, including Dame Judi Dench returning as no-nonsense spymaster M (the flinty relationship between Dench's M and Craig's Bond feels more like a battle of wills here -- wholly appropriate, since this is essentially Bond's first case as a Double-0 agent), and Giancarlo Giannini as the shifty Mathis. Jeffrey Wright, another fave in our household, has a nice moment or two as Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA contact, but overall he gets surprisingly little to do. Oh, well, maybe Wright had scenes left on the cutting room floor, or maybe he'll have more to do in subsequent Bond films. The action scenes owe more to films like RESERVOIR DOGS than previous Bond films (which should make original CASINO ROYALE fan Quentin Tarantino happy :-), and I'm not just saying that because two of these scenes take place in bathrooms! :-) There's a down-and-dirty, kinetic fleetness to CR's action scenes (with some cool and unexpected locations, including the macabre Body Worlds exhibit and the Miami Airport. Between CR and the 2002 comedy BIG TROUBLE, the Miami Airport is certainly an embattled place, at least on film! :-), especially a wild foot chase between Craig and Sebastien Foucan that takes them through a construction site and into Foucan's embassy -- and with this new, no-holds-barred Bond, if this creep thought he'd be safe in his embassy, he was kidding himself! Forget Shaft -- the new Daniel Craig version of James Bond is a bad mutherf***er! :-) Long may he reign!",9,4,7,25 November 2006
The Producers," This Quotable Classic is Still One of Mel Brooks' Very Best
","I know more people who quote lines from THE PRODUCERS than from Shakespeare; make of that what you will! :-) That said, people seem to either love it or hate it, but most folks I know agree this nutzoid farce has, to quote groovy LSD (delightful Dick Shawn), 'Love Power!' Writer/director Mel Brooks' insanely zany yet strangely sweet tale of down-on-his-luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock (the great Zero Mostel, who should have been nominated for an Oscar himself) who uses his powers of persuasion (and wheedling, and bellowing, and conning :-) to convince meek accountant Leo Bloom (justifiably Oscar-nominated Gene Wilder) to help him make a surefire Broadway flop that, if their nutty book-cooking scheme works, will land them in Rio -- or, if it doesn't work, Sing Sing. This screamingly funny, no-holds-barred comedy won Mel Brooks an Oscar for Best Screenplay and put the former YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS writer on the map as a filmmaker. Anyone trying to make a comedy depending on controversy and questionable taste for its laughs should watch THE PRODUCERS first and see how a master does it! For that matter, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder ought to watch it again themselves; after the duds they were churning out for a while there, maybe they need a refresher course in how to be funny. (Hell, it might be as simple as them teaming up again; Wilder seemed able to temper Brooks's mania for poo-poo humor and Brooks seemed able to help Wilder to better balance out his trademark blend of shrill hysteria and sweetness.) Much as my family and I also loved the Broadway and film editions of the musical version co-written by Brooks and Thomas Meehan and starring the incomparable Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick (even though I felt that Broderick wasn't quite as good as Leo Bloom as Lane was as Max Bialystock. That said, together they have great buddy chemistry), the original is still the champ.",10,21,27,18 April 2007
Rear Window," Reading from Top to Bottom...Hitchcock's Sophisticated Masterpiece
","Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy ('Miss Torso'), then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed.",10,141,203,24 November 2004
The Thin Red Line," World War II Soldiers as Walk-Ons in the Theater of War
","THE THIN RED LINE (TTRL), writer/director Terrence Malick's Oscar-nominated World War II drama based on James Jones' book, is notable not only for its introspective approach to its subject, but also as the film that was initially supposed to make Adrien Brody a star in his pre-PIANIST days. Brody trained at boot camp for his portrayal of Cpl. Fife (the character based on James Jones himself) and was hyped to the skies as Hollywood's Next Big Thing. No sooner was Brody included on the cover of VANITY FAIR Magazine's 1998 Hollywood issue than he discovered that many of his scenes, chiefly those involving dialogue, wound up on the cutting room floor. I got the feeling that Brody wasn't the only TTRL cast member victimized by the editing process, though. While Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin, and Jim Caviezel have substantial screen time as the audience gets to see and hear their thoughts, the rest of the all-star/star-to-be cast come across as extras in their own movie, with everybody from John Cusack to John Travolta to Nick Nolte to George Clooney (among many others) getting one or two memorable scenes at most and then moving right along. Perhaps that's Malick's point; maybe he's saying that combat dehumanizes men until they're just walk-ons and bit players in the theater of war. This might also explain why most of TTRL's characters have one-syllable names that soon start to sound alike: Welsh, Whyte, Witt, Fife, Gaff, Tall, Tills, Bell, Doll... Indeed, as the soldiers of Charlie Company become increasingly filthy and exhausted during their traumatic tour of duty in Guadalcanal (some of it filmed on location), it gets increasingly difficult to tell one from the other. As my husband Vin and I played 'Spot the Adrien,' Vin kept thinking he saw him because, as he said, 'It's like everyone in this movie has thick eyebrows and big noses!' Once you actually spot Brody in TTRL, however, it's hard to forget him, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of the man. While Brody doesn't say a word until the final reel (Vin and I were amazed: 'Finally! Brody speaks!' :-), his expressive face and eyes and his considerable screen presence make up for his lost dialogue as he hovers anxiously in the background; Brody haunts the film like The Ghost of War Past, Present, & Future. You'd think they'd release a special-edition DVD with Brody's cut scenes, now that he's an Oscar-winning star! :-) Even if you're not on the lookout for your favorite actors, TTRL dazzles the eye and touches the soul with imagery that is at once grim and poetically beautiful, as well as poignant Melanesian native music that acts as a moving counterpoint to the soldiers' ordeals. If you're looking for rock-'em-sock-'em action and people getting blown up real good, you may find yourself getting impatient at TTRL's leisurely pace and 170-minute running time, but if you like your war movies intelligent and thought-provoking, TTRL is worth renting.",8,4,9,9 October 2004
