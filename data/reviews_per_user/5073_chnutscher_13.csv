First Man," Mediocre. Even space adepts will be disappointed.
","Mediocre. Even space adepts will be disappointed.My guess is, this movie fails from minute 1 due to the premise of this movie. In fact, it was primarily the NASA that landed on the moon finally, and Armstrong was 'just' one of its employees. No doubt an able, self-controlled man best suiting for the 'job', who took many risks in his NASA career, but there were several others who did succeed, as all NASA missions and the following Apollo missions proved.So the attempt of the movie to make out an extraordinary 'first man' of Armstrong in the positive as well the negative way somehow goes to fiction. I found the movie over-pathetic in long parts, overdramatizing (and over-audioedited) the dangerous experiences of Armstrong. Seeing the movie, you easily can mistake Armstrongs life as one unique depression. Foy as his wife completes this, as she apparently took her worst 'annus horribilis' as queen over to this movie as solemn, undercooled wife. As far we know of Armstrong, as restraint he was, he DID smile occasionally in interviews etc., something you will not find in the movie. I think also the side story of his child that died is overly emphasized in the movie. Hard to understand how the successful career of Armstrong leaves you so depressed in this movie, as would he literally have 'sacrificed' himself with his hole life alone for this 'holy' mission, pathetic! This hole movie looks like a gross misreprentation, I doubt Armstrong would have signed for the script.As for the CGI of the space flights, they are OK but not that brilliant. Space adepts will easily overlook weaknesses of the script, if the technical portrayal excels, but also this is not very convincig here IMO. Not to speak from the sound editing which I found awful with the exaggerated background sounds.My guess is, the overly high rating here in fact honors 'the important mission', but not the movie itself, and the filmmmakers maybe counted on that.",5,0,2,17 January 2019
The Death of Stalin," Satire about ruthless dictator milieu doesn't really work
","Satire about ruthless dictator milieu doesn't really work I enjoyed the movie in technical terms, well shot, adequate costumes and settings, also the actors an their performances. But as satire it somehow didn't work. I appreciate that the director and scripting did pay indeed credit to the real, gruesome details of Stalin's dictatorship, naming and representing them in the movie without any filter. But it's exactly this what collides with the satirical, tragic mood of the movie. I think it's not really possible to make a synthesis of a reign of terror and a funny look at it, since the realities behind are just to terrible. Specially it you have a historic awarness of the facts. For someone without that background knowledge it may work better.As of german tongue I can say that the many analog attempts of satire over Hitler (in movies), nazi Germany being a topic of german obession up to this day, also none of them really worked, the facts behind are just to dreadful. As a successful exception the movie Schtonk (1992) may be named, which however focused on a sideline of the history, the fake diaries of Hitler.",6,0,3,11 March 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Convincing nostalgia shipment
","Convincing nostalgia shipment.Congratulation to the producers and directors. A classic fantasy action flick, well entertaining. A worthy sequel of the Star Wars saga. Although you'll see a lot of its known gear movie-recycled again, robots, space ships etc., don't worry, it just adds to the fun. Way better IMO than the new sequels of the Star Trek saga. Graphics, CGI are remarkably excellent, and yet without excessive overuse. The story is surely simple, but solid, good enough. For the sake of the fun, a new robot is introduced, with better entertaining qualities than the previous R2-D2 IMO. Also in general the humor is appropriate and adds to the fun. A great Forest Withaker in a minor role.The movie rides on nostalgia wave, intentionally maybe, but never mind, it pays off.",7,1,4,14 April 2017
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Truly a (underrated) masterpiece.
","Truly a (underrated) masterpiece.By far the best movie adaptation of a Le Carre subject IMO. Dialogs, cinematography, acting, settings, storytelling, editing and music are at highest, almost perfect levels, in a harmony seldomly seen.
The slow development of the story with its limited dialogs is the one, most winning point of this production, leaving open the unpredictable resolution up to the last moment. Although the real appreciation of the development of the story probably grows only after a second view, once you are aware of the content. The serie of 1977 with Guinness already was a very valuable production, but here this movie even tops that IMO, although some interesting details in the story are lost in its brevity.The play of Oldman is stellar, as is the one of Colin Firth, giving the winning, sinister-sympathetically manipulating villain here. Don't miss the scene with the bee!It's one of those rare movies you can watch 10 or 20 times and you'll like it again without being bored. My congratulations.",8,1,1,18 April 2020
Moana," Quite weak despite an excellent animation
","Quite weak despite an excellent animation.This movie would have been an opportunity to set a monument for the remarkable polynesian expansion over vast areas of the Pacific. Pre-columbian and pre-Portuguese, no sextants etc. and indeed a stellar achievement of sailing and navigation. This context somehow is almost completely lost in this lame story, reduced to a fairy tale set in the South Seas without much local atmosphere in terms of narration. Just using an outrigger canoe as major focus in this animation is not enough. Also the soliciting topic of the search of the unknown remains mostly unused in this movie in fact. A wasted opportunity.",5,1,2,8 November 2017
Oblivion," What a messy script, a sarcastic review.
","What a messy script, a sarcastic review.In an unclear, but near future, earth 'was attacked', due to a 'put out of the moon function'. Spare me the scientific questionability ... By some evil darth-vada-alike 'aliens', known as 'da lootha gang', however with an also unclear loot focus. Stones? Water? The last human front on earth, a 2-man, pardonnez moi, 1man+1woman command obviously, in cleanest tidiness out of the lab, is here to conclude some earthy business before the big departure to Saturn's Titan. Isn't that an original plot premise? Oh, and that dream team underwent a memory clean '5 years ago', to honor that I guess also the script writers had the same procedure, judging the vast unexplained field of this movie.But suddenly, another mysterious ship falls out of the sky, no further detail beside 'NASA' mentioned, so at least we have 3 protagonists on the screen now. At 46mins of 124. Now we have the pleasant turn, that the aliens turn out to be humans, and out of the nothing, ups, out of the amnesia, a true love story is also established at once. But this brings no comfort, we just find out that our hero of the story is the victim of a giant -still obscure- set up in a kind of world with countless of his own clones, but having the immense consolation he being the original among the clones. But I'm not sure if I got that one right. In the final climax, we can even witness a resurrection.Visuals are quite good, but the story is somehow obscure, or shall I say, inconclusive? To remain unconvinced by this movie, you even don't have to dislike T. Cruise. Pathetically put into scene, the movie IMO is not able to create any mystic sci-fi poesy.",5,0,5,10 May 2017
Burn After Reading," Solid, big fun with the Coen Brothers. Best watched in English.
","Solid, big fun with the Coen Brothers. Best watched in English.The movie of course can not keep up entirely with other 'serious' Coen movies, but is a solid, entertaining comedy, IMO way better than the other Coen comedy 'Intolerable Cruelty'.The fun and the interesting part of the movie IMO is the presence of at least 3 big shots of Hollywood, Clooney, Pitt and Malkovich. All of them playing the roles of naives, fools, and lightly retarded guys. While we already know this role of McDormand in other Coen movies, there are not many comparable roles of these 3. In this regard, Brad Pitt does the best (or most convincing) acting job here IMO, Malkovich is also great, while Clooney tends to overact the role of the simpleton a bit, I think. Still, very enjoyable to see big names acting as fools, it's one of the inherent qualities of the movie.You'll never see Pitt dying in a funnier way, and you'll learn something about Schwinn bikes.Hint for 'foreigners': watch it in English if possible, for example in German the movie loses much due to the inappropriate ('political correct') translation.",7,1,2,29 November 2015
Hidden Figures," Enjoyable and still overrated
","Enjoyable and still overrated Having seen is now, by far the best part of it IMO is the fact of being a movie based on true events. The positive message that talented black people made it through the barriers of then-segregation with persistence is indeed nice. But it is put into scene with a too much schmaltz. The sets reproduce the 50&60ies quite well, as space adept you might also love the technical scenes of the rocket gear in action, but it somehow ends there. A bit curious it made it to the Oscar nominations IMO, at least it didn't win any rightly. This would have been indeed to much concession to the pioneer character of true events behind.What I liked most or was portrayed best, I think, was how the feeling of the then-imposed rule for blacks of standing back 'humbly' was put into scene.",6,3,8,29 March 2017
Elysium," Somewhat uninspired, with Sci-Fi as background scenery.
","Somewhat uninspired, with Sci-Fi as background scenery.Uh, well ... Set in the future, where the fiction does not make too much sense (the rich part of humanity migrated into earth orbit into a kind of pepped up ISS) our hero, again Matt Damon, fights his way through the obstacles. For a just and moral cause, of course. And with some upgrades, compared to the Bourne Saga, a skilled, athletic fighter in now semi-mechanized improvements. In essence a classical action flick, even the fighting slow-motions are present. The thin story line lacks of inspiration, the tale is quite limited. Sci-Fi IMO is just a background setting without one original idea added that would justify the label Sci-Fi. But in that regard, CGI and settings are well done. Not really bad, but I doubt i will watch it again.",6,0,4,10 April 2017
Arrival," Great movie, spoilers are helpful before the first view
","Great movie, spoilers are helpful before the first view.Sci-Fi aficionados probably can't withstand to like it. So did I. The narrative line is cleverly constructed, however, if you watch it the first time probably you just don't get the point if you don't know that the flashbacks in 'reality' are glimpses of the future. Like another reviewer wrote, you probably will appreciate it more on a second view, once you've understood the setup.Very poetic for everyone who is receptive for the Sci-Fi mystery, able to induce imaginative thoughts. Settings, CGI and sound were very good. The point maybe one does consider after the first enthusiasm is that some parts in fact do not make too much sense, seen objectively (in fiction terms). For example, the stretch until it is understood that a communication works with writing and not with speech, logic would tell viceversa is the best attempt. Also the storyline that humans try hard to be able to communicate in the alien script, meh, given the supposed superiority of that alien race you would expect it's them who should not have too much problems to communicate in an earth writing. But never mind, Sci-Fi remains Sci-Fi, it doesn't take you much to concede these script liberties, when the production as whole is that appealing.I'm prejudiced with Amy Adams, as I find her a very likable presence anyway, but I think she did a good acting job here, the delivery of the doctor/professor was quite convincing.",8,0,3,18 May 2017
Life," There as never been so much drama and action in space.
","There as never been so much drama and action in space.In the start, the movie reminds you heavily of some Star Trek episodes. But here, they seemingly were determined to leave out the meditative, thoughtful climate and ignite the full action instead. And there is a lot of it, from start to end. For the sake of it, any reflective behaviour as expected by astronauts is left out. In fact, towards the end you wished that 'firewall stage 3', to blow up the space station, would been have put into action in first place.I guess it could be amusing entertainment stuff in the real ISS station, where I imagine the fun is given in spartanic doses and the life might be pretty boring.CGI and settings are very nice, 4 stars for them. Acting also satisfying within the given unsatisfying plot and dialogs.",4,0,2,30 September 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Hugo Weaving delivered by far the best acting performance
","Hugo Weaving delivered by far the best acting performance.Well. Again there is quite a difference between the true bravery of a Desmond Doss and how it is put in scene without much realism in another heroizing movie. A pity. A bit schmalzy in the start maybe but decent overall, the movie loses much in the portrayal of the battle scenes on Okinawa. Many of them are almost ridiculous, even being no expert in the matter I'm pretty sure every military practitioner will confirm this has not much in common with real military attack practices, behaviour etc.. Soldiers running around suicidal upright in barrage gunfire etc., common ...A somewhat poor tribute to the true facts behind, how this movie is set up in a less than credible, overheroized action-like manner. I bet Doss wouldn't have signed for the script with all these woven in adventurous tales. I found the best portrayal and acting performance was delivered by Hugo Weaving as Desmonds tormented father in that minor role. A good portion of the real story was wasted in the other parts of the movie.",5,1,6,27 May 2017
The Martian," Title should be: 'Another triumphal success of the NASA'.
","Title should be: 'Another triumphal success of the NASA'.Big names like Ridley Scott doesn't automatically mean great movies. Once proved again.The movie with the premise of the successful rescue of a stranded man on the mars in fact does not give much space for an elaborate story. But in the movie even that limitation seems to be undercut. Soft-footed straight forward to the rescue, which is never in doubt, on the waves of the 70's disco sound. Does not really make the big thrill. As criticized in other reviews, no slightest signs of loneliness, despair etc., the movie goes on in a completely positive attitude. Le cliché US par excellence.CGI and settings are nicely done, Damon's acting job is OK. Surely watchable, but nothing to be remembered. 8.2 rating ATM seems still quite overrated for me. However, better than 'Gravity', I still have not recovered from the fact how may Oscars that dull movie has won.",6,4,10,27 December 2015
