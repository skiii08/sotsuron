Lucky Number Slevin," Pretty Good Setup/Shoot'em up Movie
","This was an excellent respectable movie, that kept you guessing for most of the movie. In terms of box office, I think the biggest problem to seeing this is the name. While kind of clever, it tries too hard and is annoying, while some think that also describes the movie, I don't. The story, plot, and acting are all excellent, except that the ending is a bit too happy. To make it a truly great movie, there needs to be less rose and more thorns. The cast is phenomenal and more could have been made of character development. It did feel somewhat manipulative in the time line jumping, which always makes me feel like the maker's do not feel like they have a good story to tell. On this note, all perspective film makers, please see Italian Job. Overall an excellent movie and I would suggest it to just about everyone.",8,0,1,15 August 2007
The Princess Bride," A Fairytale of Awesomely Comedic and Charming Proportions!
","This movie is legendary. Can't Be Beaten in it's Genre. It is its own genre. Like so many great, great movies, it is difficult to classify, because it is flying on all aspects. It is a wonderful movie overall. Anyone with a heart to enjoy a Fairy Tale, will certainly make this movie one of their top ten favorites. It is in my top 3, which are always rotating. There is not one thing that isn't great about this movie. Once again it is not then main character that make a great movie greater, it is the assembling of great secondary actors and developing their characters and making them interesting. The choices of Shawn Wallace, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant and the impressive Clergy man (Peter Cook) could not have been better. The energy thrown in by Carol Kane and Billy Crystal was phenomenal.",10,0,1,4 July 2004
Ghost Rider," Great Ideas that just didn't connect
","Overall, I like the movie. It appears very tough to make a great comic book superhero action movie. It was 22 plus years between Superman 2 and Spiderman, so you know it isn't easy. Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were really, really close to being great. X-Men was just below those. I would ranked this one just above Daredevil and Elektra, although it is hard to resist Jennifer Garner in red.It was OK. Not the best, but I like Nick Cage and Eva Mendes, although maybe not together. Their chemistry lacked. I blame writers, directors, Cage or story lines, because Eva has a smile that melts steel. The other actors were very good. Peter Fonda as the Devil and Brett Cullen as Johnny Blaze's father were excellent. The other bads were effectively bad and creepy. Sam Elliot was excellent as always, but the part they wrote for him could have been better. Donal Logue and the crew should have been used to help us care a little more for Cage's character.My kids got me the extended video. It was much creepier than I thought it would be, which is good, unless young kids are watching. I think they did the whole skull on fire thing as best as they could. You can't give a straight skull much expression without animating the eyes, brows and cheeks. And because of that, the body with the skull attached to it seemed a lot like a Scooby Doo villain, which became more acceptable as time went one or I imagine you hated the movie.Overall, I liked it. The action was cheesy fun, acting was fine, the bad guys sufficiently creepy and it appeared to follow the Ghost Rider legend.",7,1,3,20 June 2007
