The Blair Witch Project," You decide how scared you want to be.
","I rented BW here last night and since I live in Norway I'm quite used to being out in woods at night. City dwellers and computer-geeks that have never spent a night camping in the forest really can't tell how 'spooky' things sometimes can get. I like BW because it had no gore, and the my kick came from thinking back to when I'm hiking myself! I to have heard strange noises outside my tent, I have personally experienced people being scared and seeing things in the woods at night. The beauty of BW is that your own personal experience can scare you more than any blood/gore/guy with hockeymask. I loved it!",Null,0,1,2 May 2001
