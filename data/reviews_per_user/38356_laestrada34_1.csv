Sucker Punch," What a pile of dog crap
","OK so maybe the visual effects were OK but even with that the story was so lame and the acting was so amateur that it made me wish I was watching a syfy movie instead. Kepp your money, it's not even worth renting wait for it on cable and them maybe it may be worth it. I could not keep track of what imaginary world the character was in, the more it went on the more confused I was. The actors over dramatized everything and that dumb accent that Carla Gugino had as a Russian or whatever doctor was like watching a Mad TV skit. The costumes were obviously put together to get 13 year old boys hot and bothered and the for that matter so were the Zombies, Robots and dragons they concocted.",1,12,27,28 March 2011
