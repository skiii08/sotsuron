Frost_Nixon," Nixon not Nixon
","My challenge to watch this film is that Frank Langella just isn't Nixon. He is an incredible actor and does an excellent job in this film. It's just that I never buy him as Nixon. For those who can remember in real time, Nixon the person was like nobody else ever. His looks, posture, style of speech and mannerisms are as bizarre, unique and funny as has ever been seen in American political culture. A figure of true comedy. Dan Ackroyd in SNL'S early days was closer to a real personification of Nixon the image, though obviously taken too far to be real. But to get it right you need to go over the top like that (at least a little bit anyway) and Langella isn't that character in this film. He's too reserved. Measured. So I felt like I was watching a drama about someone else. And I found the movie itself a little flat at times. The pace starts slowly and ends the same. But done well in terms of a craft, and I followed it through to the end okay. It's just not an image of Nixon the character that resonates with me.",7,1,5,14 December 2008
