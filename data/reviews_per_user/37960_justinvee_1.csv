The Longest Yard," Very funny movie!
","I have seen this movie more than 5 times and i enjoyed it every time. The start of the movie is fantastic as well as the ending. This movie was very good and i recommend it for people above 12, as some of the jokes are quite racist. This movie starts out with Adam Sandler being with his girlfriend at a party, and then stealing her car and crashing it into police cars. He gets charged for driving while under the influence and is sent to a prison because the warden wants him to teach Football skills. Then he starts to get a prison team to play against the guards, in the process Adam Sandler's best friend gets killed by a bomb. In the end the inmates win against the guards even though the guard threatened Adam Sandler.",10,0,2,28 January 2007
