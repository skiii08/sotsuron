Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't believe the critics or me -- SEE IT!!
","When I learned that George Lucas was going to make Episode I in 1997, I was ecstatic.  I knew that 1999 was going to be a long wait, but a worth-while one.  In January, I kept a running tally of how many days till the movie opened (starting at 125) and slowly watched as the number got smaller and smaller.  Well, last night I went to the movie after watching the original trilogy and spending the whole day (besides taking a final -- I'm in college) preparing for the movie.  I thought it was fantastic!  Wait - it was awesome.  When the movie was over I was almost in tears because I realized that I was going to have to wait another 3 years to see the next chapter.  There was no 'bad' aspect about the movie.  The story, acting, pace, visual effects, dialogue -- they were all 'Star Wars' caliber. After seeing it, I have no problem raking the movie as 'Star Wars.'",10,0,0,20 May 1999
