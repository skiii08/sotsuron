Skyfall," Most disappointing
","I have to say I went in with very high hopes but came out utterly disappointed. When I hear James Bond, I think of action, fancy gadgets, exotic locations, hot ladies and some serious bad ass villain. This movie had nothing. Action? First 3 minutes or so. Fancy gadgets? A radio. A frigging radio! Hot ladies? I guess the black girl was cute but in the wrong role! Bad ass villain? Not impressed at all, give me Jaws or, gold fingers bodyguard anytime.Granted the musical score at the beginning was nice, as well as the unveiling of the car used in gold finger but the rest was quite boring. James Bonds childhood? So what? I don't care about his ancestors, he is a British spy agent, doesn't matter if he is Scottish! English, welsh or whatever. Hell he could have been Ghanaian for all I care ( I am Ghanaian btw).This is a huge letdown I actually had to keep myself from falling asleep, twice. Despite all its flaws I gave it a 6. The director tried but it simply didn't come off, the prior movies of Craig and the ones before we're all better.Simply put, the worst Bond I have seen.",6,7,16,18 December 2012
Straight Outta Compton," Emotional, entertaining, riveting.
","Wow, what a movie. Where to begin? So I saw highlights of this movie on HBO and what drew me in wasn't the actual backstory of N.W.A. but the soundtrack. I love music so that drew me in immediately, considering that I knew most of the songs. I don't know how true to life this movie is, but I was impressed with both Ice Cube's and Easy-E's character. This movie explains (to me anyway) why Ice Cube hardly ever smiles, and I had no idea he was a key contributor to N.W.A. Ice Cube was and still is a really talented dude. Same with Dre - his scratching - was amazing to watch. To be honest, this movie has some emotional elements to it, despite the Compton feel and hardcore background. I cried when Dre got the bad news and when Easy-E found out he had AIDS.It was a completely riveting movie and all the actors did a phenomenal job, especially Ice Cube's son. He pulled off his Dad perfectly!Great movie 10/10.",10,5,22,30 April 2017
