The Blair witch project is a classic horror film with..h..ya no recognizable actors.",10,1,3,18 October 2016
Insidious: Chapter 2," What a awesome horror sequel to a great film!!
","Insidious:Chapter 2 is the horror sequel to the almighty horror Insidious. The film picks up after Insidious and The Lamberts are still being haunted by evil spirits from The Further and with Elise gone,they must like defend for themselves. This film,I used to think was a boring,crappy sequel but after watching it again,I've realised that its so good and so cool! James Wan was amazing directing this,it obviously was not as good as Insidious but only by like,a wincy,tincy,shincey bit. The film has a great script and delivers like A LOT of scares. Danielle Bisutti was amazing as Michelle Crane,very scary and intense. Insidious:Chapter 2 is an awesome horror sequel that is also one of my fav horrors!!!",7,0,1,4 October 2016
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Words literally cant explain how this is in my top five best films in the world!!
","OK..ya,hi! There are five films right,that I love and the first four are Lost In Translation,The Exorcist,6 Years and now..the fifth had been decided..Charlie is a anxious freshman traumatized by the experience's of being molested by his demented aunt and now starts high school on,y to discover,he's been let in by two wild seniors who treat him on a tour of the real world and discovers who his true friends are! The Perks Of Being A Walflower..I can't explain,it's one of the most beautiful movies of all time! Emma Watson does a brilliantly job as majestic Sam and Logan Lerman who's actually a lot older then he looks does a brilliant job as Charlie as well as Ezra Miller playing Patrick. The film,out of many which don't make me,kind of made me tear up but not cry. The films best scene was definitely The Tunnel Scene at the very end which I thought was TOP. 1! At best scenes in movies! The film also features Julia Warner from Grandma even though she had no lines through out the film although's personality is revealed through Charlie narrating. The film had a disturbing ending where Sam and Patrick left Charlie after he kissed Sam then his girlfriend and was left by Patrick after being told to wait a while and everything while be back but when it doesn't,he thinks that his crazy aunt's death was his fault when she rammed in to the back of a truck after thinking about what she's doing and he threatens to kill himself but is put in a home after fainting before he can and gets better and goes home to where Sam and Patrick visit once every month and then Sam and Charlie then spawn a relationship as they ride off through the tunnel. Everything about this film,was amazing,I have absolutely no reasons why this film is a utter piece of crap! It's beautiful!",10,1,2,8 September 2017
The Ring," Halloween Review #7: Psychological thrillers don't get as scary as this!!
","So,in 1998,One of the most creepiest horror films alive was made called Ring,the film spawned three sequels and one crossover against another highly famous J horror franchise Ju On. Then of course,a American remake was made starring Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson..and the casting couldn't of been more brilliant. I can't tell you which one is scarier,Ring or The Ring,you tell me. So,we all know what it's about the cursed videotape that kills you in seven days. The Ring has absolutely no flaws,what so ever,the story is exactly the same basically except for the names,the acting choices were brilliant and gave more time for the kid and his personality and how the tape effects him due to in the Japanese film,the boy had barely any lines. Two sequels were spawned of course after The Ring,The Ring Two was probably the worst sequel ever,probably worse than like Poltergeist 3 or Omen IV and then Rings came out the third reboot,that basically didn't really have any point to be made,but was OK,nothing special,OK. The Ring is probably one of my favourite horror films ever.",10,1,1,15 October 2017
It," Andy Muschetti delivers one of the best King adaptions in years!!
","In 2013,Andy Muschetti,a Spanish director made his film debut on Mama,a Gothic rare idea for a horror film that to this day,remains one of my favorite horror films of all time. Now,hes made the next Stephen King adaption,It. It follows seven bullied kids who find out all of the children going missing are responsible for a ancient shape shifting evil that takes the form of a clown who eats children. It is one of my favorite movies,Tommy Lee Wallace's,but,I saw it once,I saw it twice,now I'm sick of it,completely. But,this film I could watch over and over again. It is a rare remake that is a film,trust me,you don't haft to worry about with the whole paranormal and jump scare thing,this film is scary anyway because you know something is watching them all and at one point,something absolutely terrifying unexpected happens and your like,wow! This film also has great acting from the kids who some have literally only started acting and Bill! OH MY GOD! Bill Skarsgards performance..HE WAS F*CKING BRILLIANT! He was so much scary then Tim Curry anyway. I'm definitely going to see this again,no doubt! Next Friday! It is an amazing horror film that you probably already saw in theaters! Oh,just one little problem with the movie,if you want to hear,the picture Stan's afraid of,that picture was completely terrifying and everything,but it was the exact same as MAMA!..but still it was scary!!",9,9,18,11 September 2017
Hereditary," Hell yeah!!
","Hereditary came out a few months back and follows a family of four who since the death of the family matriarch has gone down hill -- that being due to the demonic curse put on the family. The film stars Toni Colette who is absolutely astonishing in her role and possibly her best. The film is highly creepy and at times uses creepy imagery which always works especially in films like Black Swan and The Shining. In a quick review, go see Hereditary because its one of the best horrors out there and possibly the best of the year!",9,14,25,4 September 2018
Ted," High-larious!!
","Seth MacFarlane became very famous after his success on the animated show Family Guy and to keep fans occupied, decided to make his own comedy and eventually it was put into production and then we got ' Ted '. Ted follows the story of John Bennett who grew up as a child with his one and only friend; a talking teddy bear by the name of Ted, eventually, when John begins to grow up, their friendship then begins to grow more and more distant by making adult choices. Ted is a film I think is brilliant, the film is literally an brilliant comedy for millions of reasons, the film is not just a crouched up comedy, it has loads of heartbreaking drama to it aswell which also makes you feel your watching a drama aswell and laughs, oh, Jesus! The laughs! Ted is hilarious, no other words, the film supplies you with so many jokes that work on so many levels, there is literally not a joke in this film that did not work, it was all so funny, the acting in the film was also something to praise, the acting from Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis is brilliant and Seth MacFarline is also brilliant as the talking Ted. Ted is honestly just a brilliant comedy you should really see if you love Family Guy!",9,1,1,9 February 2018
Home Alone," The best Christmas movie I've ever seen
","Home alone is my favorite Christmas movie I've ever seen,I have loved it since I was young. It tells the story of Kevin,a young boy who is often bullied by his siblings but probably most by his brother Buzz. One night,Kevin wishes his family would disappear and when they leave to go on holiday to Paris and they forget Kevin,Kevin has the time of his life until two burglars try to break in looking for rich things and Kevin is forced to protect himself so he sets up a set of violent booby traps showing the robbers. The movie stars our favorite child star Macaulay Culkin who starred in My Girl,The Good Son and many other classic films and he's still out there doing eh...ya know..stuff.. The movie is directed by Chris Columbus who directed the first two Harry Potter films which I love so so so much obviously. The movie I think is written by comedy legend John Huges who is most recognizable for his work on the breakfast club and sixteen candles. Home alone is one of the best Christmas movies but I wouldn't recommend it to small children aged 4 or 5 due to some bad language and violence.",10,0,1,10 November 2016
Scary Movie 2," Another laugh riot!!!
","Scary Movie 2 is the 2001 sequel to the hilarious fun fest Scary Movie. The film parody's Titanic,The Exorcist and Poltergiest. It's about Cindy who now in college goes to a haunted house as a project for college only til not so scary entity's come out to kill one by one. Like the first film,an amazing hilarious laugh riot. Anna Faris was perfect as the idiot Cindy. The film spoofs a lot of good films that I really liked. Natasha Lyon made a guest appearance as Regan from the exorcist who I thought was really funny. The movie once again was directed by one of the Wayane brothers who I love as a director. Scary Movie 2 is a awesome hilarious astounding comedy spoof that you need to see if you love spoof films!!",10,0,1,13 January 2017
Lost in Translation," One of the best films ever!!
","Lost In Translation is a 2003 comedy drama film starring Bill Murray,Scarlett Johansson,Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris. Taking place in Tokyo,two people;an actor and a conflicted newlywed meet each other while staying in the same hotel and soon create a very special friendship. From Sofia Coppola who created two of the best films in the world,this film becomes one of my favourite films ever because of its funniness,happiness and lightness. Bill Murray felt like he shouldn't of been in this..but he should have been at the same time. Scarlett Johansson was brilliant as the wife of a photographer who is also a workaholic. Giovanni Ribisi plays good as Charolettes husband who is an workaholic. Anna Faris plays Kelly,an annoying girl who is starring in a film there who never stops talking. Lost In Translation is a brilliant movie that I loved,you probably loved and if you have not seen it..please do!!",10,1,4,22 December 2016
Bird Box," Great horror film to end 2018
","Just before Christmas the pass of 2018, Bird Box, a survival horror film was released on Netflix with astonishing reviews from critics and audiences, and as a horror fan, it was a great horror film to be the last of 2018. The plot has been polarized everywhere so I won't explain it, also because its a bit of a spoiler. But the cast including Sandra Bullock and Sarah Paulson were all amazing in their roles. The ending was also a nice and light ending for the film. Bird Box was definitely one of the best horror films of 2018, and definitely in the top three with Bird Box, The Strangers: Prey At Night and Unsane (or Hereditary)!",10,0,6,26 January 2019
Split," M. Night Shyamalan returns to writing with this deliciously intense thriller
","Split tells the story of three girls who are abducted by a man with 23 completely different identity's and they must find the personalities that will help them get out of the basement there trapped in before the 24th deadly personalities is released..The Beast. Going into this film I was so scared it was going to be bad but I think already that this horror film will be one of the best horror films of 2017. James McAvoy plays 24 different characters which must of been hard changing from a neat man to a small child to a relaxed sort of mother type. That girl from The Witch was also in this that was very very good. The other two girls were no where from good,there acting was atrocious and if you two girls see this post IM SORRY BUT YOU WERE VERY VERY BAD IN THIS FILM THAT I WAS HAPPY YOU TWO DIED. Sorry just needed to say that if them two saw this but em..yeah.Split is a awesome thriller horror that you haft to see if your a fan of mysterious thrillers that just make you want to know all the twists that are in the..film and..stuff.",10,1,9,21 January 2017
The Exorcist," I just found out William Blatty,author of Exorcist died,R.I.P,so here's The Exorcist..
","The Exorcist is a horror film released back in the seventies by William Fredkin,who directed some of the best films ever including Killer Joe(2012). The film follows a actress who's daughter becomes possessed by a demon by the name of Pazzuza and calls in two priests to drive it out back to Hell. The Exorcist as we all know,literally,everyone,is considered one of the best films ever and I'm here to talk why. The Exorcist is not just about horror,but also about faith and how far you'd go to save a loved one. Linda Blair as the twelve year old Regan is also brilliant and considering this is her first role in a big motion picture after only having minor roles in two TV movies before this. Ellen Burstyn was also very good who actually made it as if it was actually real with her speechless scenes and her crying and her expression knowing something is horribly wrong,Max Von Sydow was also brilliant in this even though he only really appeared in the beginning and at the very end as well as Jason Miller who also made his role very real. The scenes in the film were very intense especially the last scene. The Exorcist is a brilliant masterpiece with brilliant acting,brilliant horror and a brilliant storyline that even started its own line of films and a bunch of s*itty low budget horror films such as Annelise:Exorcist Tapes,Shark Exorcist and The Disco Exorcist!!",10,1,1,2 September 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them:What was it?
","Telling a story seventy years before Harry Potter read his book. Newt Scamander is a young man going around New York where No Maj people live AKA muggles but he has a huge secret all in his suitcase;a bunch of magical little creatures living inside a house and chaos strikes when each one of them get out and start wrecking havoc in New York. Newt must find the creatures before it's too late with the help of a young woman and a man. I am a pretty big Harry Potter fan,I really like the films and I shall do a list with best to worst. This film though..ya. Going into the cinema,I knew that the film wouldn't be perfect. I actually did like it and it was very very entertaining until..Newt and Jacob went into the suitcase. After that one incident David Yates,you turned this film into a Sharknado 5..a crap film. It was very boring and just so pointless I mean it was just like Igh......it had like 9 endings,they were all like ohh it's over now and then Credence turns into a..ehh..a sort of black entity..like that weird ghost from Paranromal Activity 6. Fantastic beasts and where to find them was a OK film but it wasn't to good,it would've been awesome but it just didn't work that well as a Harry Potter film.",7,0,3,26 November 2016
Saw III," Halloween Review #27: Best in the franchise?!
","So,Saw obviously was not over when Darren decided to create Saw 3:The Final Chapter..I wish I could say that now. Saw III follows a new group of guilty people who've done guilty things and now,Jigsaw has captured them and is now,giving them a chance to learn from their mistakes. Saw III,when I heard,obviously,I was not excited really,its just another dumb sequel I told my friends but oh no,people like them just had to see it because they wanted to see it,when I was watching Saw III,I was really bored..I was,that's before when Saw III became the most coolest,amazingest horror film ever,well..not ever. Saw III had brilliant writing and for some reason,that's actually something really good about the Saw films,there really is not one that has weak writing(well,except for Saw VII,or course). The acting in the film is probably why I'm giving this a nine,look,I'm not going to say that it was awful but the acting could have been better but I guess that's Saw,not really any of the films,except for one and two,have great acting but,Saw III is a very good well crafted horror film",9,0,2,26 October 2017
The Conjuring 2," As scary,brilliant and original as the first film!
","When I heard about the conjuring 2 I didn't know what to think,I thought it would be good and I thought it wouldn't but when I went to see it with my father as a sort of present as he left to go to England for work,the first 30 minutes was so creepy,I knew I'd like it and after about 150 minites..I loved it. This film was a lot scarier than the first movie,the jump scares were more scarier although some were a bit predictable. I loved the acting like the first film and I just have one thing to get out of the way that I didn't like about it...CGI. This film had really bad effects but that doesn't mean it was terrible and I didn't think about it till my dad said it had a lot of bad effects and I thought that was what was annoying about the film but I still loved it like the first film. The conjuring 2:the Enfield poltergeist is a really brilliant horror film starring Patrick Wilson,Vera Farmigia and Bonnie Aaron's and Frances O'Conor. 7/10",8,0,0,4 October 2016
It Follows," One of the most creepiest and unsettling film ever since The Pact and Under The Skin.
","It Follows tells a story rather familiar to The Entity but kind off different,its about a young college girl who was a rather happy life and when she meets a boy who feels like her soulmate,the two have sex and soon after she is on the middle of the road left. Over the next few days,she starts seeing abnormal creatures and humans when she finds out she is cursed after having sex and must pass it on before it kills her and goes back down the line. It follows is a very silent film with real creepy noises like under the skin. The films ghost which's real identity is never seen's humans that haunt Jay,the girl are absolutely horrifying. The scene where jay is in the house and she opens the door to her friend and the real,real tall guy comes behind her was absolutely awful scary and when they hid in the shed and that guy burst in the door. It follows is a absolutely terrifying horror film with good effects,good scares and a good story.",10,1,3,3 June 2017
Insidious," Brilliant horror classic from James Wan!!
","Insidious is one of James Wan's first horror films since 2004's Saw,I would say that after this film,Wan got the confidence to go ahead with The Conjuring,Furious 7 and the upcoming live action,Aquaman. Insidious is your typical story;a family move in to a house and are haunted by evil demons,BUT,this has a very interesting story and its,not gonna spoil,but turns out to be a kind of bloodline thing with the demons. Lin Shaye stars in this and does a brilliant role but sadly as we all know,dies in the ending. Insidious has a very good story but by now,that story is just worn out cause lots of people have used it now;family haunted and it turns out to be a bloodline thing between father and son'. Insidious is a awesome horror film,good story,good acting from Patrick Wilson(Conjuring) and Lin Shaye(There's Something About Mary)",10,0,0,4 October 2016
A Quiet Place," A very good horror and sci-fi film!
","A Quiet Place is the newest and probably most popular horror film yet for the year 2018 after receiving multiple praise from critics. The film follows a family of four who are all pretty dulled up after the death of their son and the death of humanity after a society of monsterous creatures came down to kill people who make too much noise and when the family cause a bit of destruction, they then realize they're really up crap creek. This film, I was really excited for, mostly because of how unique and original it sounded and how it was nearly like a mash-up of Alien and 10 Cloverfield Lane, two amazing films..and I loved it. I'm doing thia review on my phone so I haft to make it quick but I loved how intense the film was and the amazing performances from Emily Blunt and John Krainski, it's truly a very good film that has no parts I haft to point out, 10/10!! Stay tuned for my reviews on Truth Or Dare, The Babadook and Bridesmaids!!",10,2,4,20 April 2018
Garden State," Time to review one of the best films ever!!
","In Summer 2017,unexpectedly,I watched one of the best films ever,Garden State,I also discovered that The Perks Of Being A Walflower was one too! The film follows a failed small TV actor,who usually bottles up his feelings,for instance,never having cried for years,goes back to his hometown for his mother's funeral to discover a bunch of great people who never even knew existed. The film is directed by Zach Braff who also stars as the main role. Garden State is a brilliant film,I've loved it since the day I watched it and I try to watch it,once every year,so,next year,possibly in Summer,I'll watch it. The film had absolutely no flaws and I loved the guest performances by Peter Sarsgard and Natalie Porter,I thought they were brilliant as well as Ian Holm and the small appearance by Jim Parsons. The film had brilliant acting,as just said,and a great story that was brilliantly put into a movie,I heard it was based on Braff's true life experiences. The film has a excellent soundtrack featuring a song that would end up being in my best songs ever list which was Let Go - Frou,Frou. Garden State is a brilliant movie,I really advise you to see",10,0,0,6 November 2017
Saw II," Halloween Review #26: Ah,nothing awful
","Saw was a big hit back in the year of 2004,so big,that even before the film was released some dude Darren something something was making Saw II,which is about another group of guilty people who've done guilty things as they desperately try to get out of Jigsaw's twisted games. So,when I saw Saw II,which was'int too long really ago,even though I saw all the others,I did'int think too much of it and I still don't. Saw II is nothing really great,in fact,I don't really see why people are saying its the best in the franchise,like sure,its got some really fun traps and some really cool characters,but I personally felt it was just another excuse to make another money making sequel,BUT,I don't actually think Darren wanted to make this actually crap,I could see some cool things in Saw II that like the first film were really cool,as,like I said,the traps..but,this film is OK. Saw II's OK everybody!",6,0,1,25 October 2017
Paranormal Activity," One of the most unsettling horror films ever!
","Paranormal Activity,today,is something probably everyone knows about. Oh no! Not because of the awesome first film! Because of the millions of crappy sequels they made to this! Paranormal Activity's about a couple who are haunted by a demon but does it have a reason? PA is one of the best horror films ever made,when I first watched this film after loads of people saying 'its one of the best horror films ever!',I was like 'Ehhh? How the hell is this scary?!' cause lets face it,its not scary but then at night,getting in to bed,I thought 'WOW!..There's a demon sleeping right beside me,ain't there?',the film has a very real vibe to it because it felt like it was actually found footage,now,the sequels don't feel real because they were actually used with a real camera which made you like 'uh..good film though!'. When Unfriended came out,I was like OMG! a film that might actually feel real again(well,that's what I heard anyway)but really it was all on webcam and IT WAS SO SO SO BORING!!! PA is a brilliant horror film!!",10,0,0,4 October 2016
Friends with Benefits," One of my favorite comedy's EVER!!
","Friends with benefits is a 2011 comedy starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis as two friends who decide to have sexual intercourse one night and never speak about it eve again and remain friends. The film stands out as a bit of a remake of No Strings Attached(2010). I loved this movie so darn much,it was absolutely hilarious probably from that guy who the hard guy in Zombieland(2009)and also Justin Timberlake who I hate as a singer and actor,Mila Kunis was OK in this film nothing great,I think there was somebody else who should have played her but apart from that everything was great. Also,really liked Patrica Clarkson from the TV remake of Carrie in this as the mom.Friends with Benefits is a awesome comedy.",10,0,2,9 January 2017
Saw," Halloween Review #25: Brilliant horror film that continued a horror series til now
","When Saw came out,I remember everybody was talking about it,from school friends to even adults on the street and when I went to see it,literally the god damn cinema workers were just there,not talking about bills or events,they were talking about the god damn Saw movie and saying it was so creepy and gory,now..that dose'int happen too much. Saw follows the story of two strangers(or are they?)who wake up in a abandoned bathroom with no explanation of where they are,but when they begin to find clues to getting out,they realize that everything is linked to a sadistic serial killer who sets traps for his victims who have done wrong. Saw is a brilliant film,James Wan knows how to create horror,hes brilliant at it,its not zombies or witches or little Asian ghost girls,he can make a awfully low budget horror film and it will be the most scariest horror film ever(Insidious,The Conjuring as well as the sequels,ehhh,heloooooooo?). There are scenes in this film are stupidly so good because I love how smart Wan is,he can just make a brilliant horror film that will have people talking for years with literally just a click,every other horror director puts so much effort in to horror films and it just ends up being so awful and cheesy,even if Wan dose not create a awesome horror film(which,i hope not,is yet to come),he dose'int give two sh*ts,hes just like 'all right,lets move on'. Saw is an amazing horror film I advice you to see. I will be reviewing the next 6 Saw's,hopefully before Sunday after I see JIgsaw,the new film and yes,these are parts of my Halloween reviews!!",8,0,2,25 October 2017
Mama," I thought this was crap?! This Is Awesome
","Mama is a 2013 horror film from some dude who's name i dunno but i know he's directing the (cant wait to see!) It remake and hes Spanish so..lets get to it. Mama is about two girls who are found in the forest and are adopted by there uncle and his hipster(MOST CERTAINLY not mom material)aunt. Over the next few days,hipster mom over here starts hearing weird noises and starts seeing weird creatures when she notices that the girls while out in the wild met a ghost of a woman who they call Mama. Mama is one of the best modern horror films ever,its so beautiful and its not like most horror films just gore,ah,die,help,it has a very beautiful story about a dead woman who comes back to care for a child after hers died. Mama is a brilliant horror film from the great mind of Mr ?? ??? and I'm really looking forward to Mama II,next year from the directors of starry eyes,Yes! More Mama!",9,0,1,8 July 2017
Sinister," One of the scariest horror films in years.
","Sinister stars Ethan Hawke,Juliet Rylance and Fred Thompson. It tells the story about a crime writer who moves into a house with his wife and two children and one day when he goes up to attic he finds a box full of videos when he watches them,the movies are of family's dying. Soon then,strange things start to happen around his house and with his family when soon it's all leading up to one thing..a man from the snuff videos called the Boogeyman. Sinister honestly so god damn scary,I was terrified going to sleep when I saw this I just couldn't get it out of my head then it passed but I was still scared and I made a pact never to watch it again. The acting was good but the jump scares was terrifying as hell. I actually screamed when the boogeyman jumped out when Ethan Hawke walked up the attic and saw all the children watching the tapes. Sinister is a very very very scary horror mystery movie than definitely horror fans will like.",10,6,7,5 October 2016
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Classic sequel to my favorite Christmas movie!!
","Home Alone 2 is a classic sequel that tells the story of a year after Home Alone,10 year old Kevin gets humiliated by his brother at a play causing him to get a bit angry and he wishes that they would disappear once again and when they leave for Florida,Kevin gets lost in the airport and boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York but little does he know New York isn't Kevin's dream place for having a vacation when he is chased by a bunch of hotel workers but worst,the sticky bandits escape from prison and are now walking the streets of New York and when they bump into Kevin,Kevin sets up a bunch of booby traps in a old abandoned house and once again..madness returns. This movie was so good,it was just as good as the first film. Macaulay Culkin returns as lovable Kevin,the idea was so good and original it that was some other director it would just be the exact same thing as the first film but probably 'Different Robbers' which would turn out horribly with a different kid(don't worry that happens in Home Alone 4 and I won't be happy doing that review). Home alone 2 is a classic sequel,if you loved the first film..you will absolutely love this more!!",9,0,0,10 November 2016
Don't Breathe," one of my favourite horror films and one of 2016's best!!
","A teenage girl Rocky decides to rob a blind man's house to live with her little sister somewhere safe from her abusive,alcoholic parents. She goes with her two friends to rob a blind mans house but do they know who he really is and what he's hiding. I only finished watching Don't Breathe right now on TV as I bought it on Sky Store. The film was absolutely amazingly mind blowingly fantastic. From actors with only a bit of experience,this film is now one of my favourite 2016 films and favourite horror films. The film was so creepy and deranged especially what the blind man was going to do to the teenage girl,it was very messed up. A sequel has been announced so I'm really excited to see that. But,Don't breathe is a film your not going to want to miss. If you love horror films like I do,you will love this guaranteed!!!!",8,0,3,2 January 2017
Eyes Wide Shut," A masterpiece of cinematic history!
","Eyes Wide Shut came out in the Summer of 1999 and was directed by my favourite director of all time, Stanley Kubrick, who sadly died a week after the film's final cut was shown. The film follows Bill and Alice Harford who seem like a typical New York wealthy and happy family with their 7 year old daughter but when Alice reveals a secret about a sexual encounter with a man from last summer, Bill then goes to get fair on his wife by also sleeping with someone and after everything fails, Bill then is recommended by his friend to go to a building outside NYC only to discover the great danger he's in and how it can affect his family and friends. Eyes Wide Shut deserves more attention because it truly is a masterpiece in cinematic history, why? The film is art, it's so beautiful, can we all just look at that amazing ritual scene in the film, that scene was basically a painting, literally, A PAINTING!! The performances are so loveable but I haft to say, Kidman goes way over Cruise, I really wished she was in the film more which was probably just my little glitch with it but I truly did not mind that, she was just better than Tom Cruise, no affence! There arent really any other characters except for a few who pop in and out like the costume shop man and his daughter and people like that. My favourite part of the film, like many's obviously was the mansion scene, it was just because it was so beautiful and mysterious and so well acted by Cruise. Eyes Wide Shut deserves more praise then 74% on Rotten Tomatoes!",10,0,0,18 March 2018
Titanic," The definition of 'a movie'
","If you have not seen Titanic, I'm sure you've heard of it, and of so, please do watch it because not only is the film a 'great watch' or a great 'thrill ride of suspense and emotional scenes', but Titanic is one of the greatest films of all time. The film has some of the best acting from Winslet and DiCaprio and some of the best character chemistry between them. The direction lead by James Cameron is phenomenal. The ending to the film is one of the most intense, beautiful and sad endings I've ever seen, i can not remark one flaw about it. The cinematography is great and the film has some of the best and most memorable shots in cinema history (yes, that including the scene where Jack holds Rose up at the ship deck). The soundtrack is amazing, including Celine Dion's fantastic song that totally fits the feel of the film. Titanic is a must watch, one i would have killed for to see on the big screen! I will be posting a review of AHS Apocalypse Episode 3 this evening after the confirmed return of Cordelia, Madison and Myrtle, so exciting!! Stay tuned",10,3,5,27 September 2018
The Witch," The village meets old witches..
","The Witch also known as the vvitch is a horror film taking place in the 16th century about a family who move to a house outside a family and when there young baby vanishes without a trace,they find out the evil leaving in the woods that may lead to witchcraft. The film has a very very good storyline and it pretty much had no plot holes to me,there were not actually that many scary scenes which made you appreciate the plot and when there were scary scenes,they were utterly terrifying when the kids were locked in the shed and they saw the witch at the end of the room that was very scary and pretty disgusting. The ending is why I did not give the film a ten it was really weird and then after I had to find out what it was about on Wikipedia and I'm guessing that she became a witch in the woods because she signed some contract with the devil disguised a goat?? Well anyway,the witch was a very good horror film with very scary and disturbing scenes that should honestly be for 18+",9,5,8,9 January 2017
Scream 2," Just as good as Scream,the same thrills and everything!!
","Scream 2 is the awesome horror sequel sequel to Scream. The film yet again follows Sidney being stalked by the new Ghostface. Scream 2 has the same feel to Scream,the film has a great amount of deaths and intense scares,Neve Campbell,David Arquette and Courtney Cox all do awesome jobs as there usual roles Jerry O'Connell also appears in this and does an awesome job as Derek,Sidney's new boyfriend,the film has a few flaws though,some of the actors are quite boring like Elise Neal and Jada Pinkett Smith,but,Scream 2 manages to escape your usual bad sequel",10,0,1,11 August 2017
Jaws," One of my favourite horror films of all time!!
","Steven Spielberg is a brilliant director; he is literally what maked half of the 80's great with all of his amazing nostalgia filled movies including Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, Jurassic Park, E.T, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and of course..Jaws. Jaws came out in 1975 and is now considered one of the greatest films of all time with it being the ninth highest grossing film of all time and there is a few reasons why it's a amazing film. I won't rehash the plot because you already know what it's about for God's sake; a man eating shark attacking Martha's Vineyard but the film is so good for many things. 1. The direction, the direction in this film is brillaintly done and probably some of the best ever in cinema to me, 2. It's too creepy too watch, for me, Jaws is too creepy to watch, it always has me turning away at the underwater scenes and 3. It has the scariest and most creepiest score ever, that shark theme will always stay with me like, forever. Jaws is a classic and one of my favourite horror films that if you have not, obviously, please watch it!",10,1,2,29 March 2018
The Conjuring," One of my favourite modern horror films of all time!
","The conjuring is based on a true story from the cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren which in my opinion all of there story's are true. The movie tells the story of a family with about 5 daughters who move into a new house when soon strange things start happening when they find out the last few owners had the same thing happening to them and it's all because of this witch that built the house and killed herself and cursed all the owners that would move into the house and they call Ed and Lorraine Warren played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmigia to stop and get rid of the evil spirits haunting the house. I watched this film and thought it was crap but then I decided to watch to watch it again and honestly I really liked it,the movie had really good actors like Vera Farmigia who starred in Orphan,up in the air and higher ground and I really liked Joey King who played one of the daughters who's from Oz,White House down and this movie. The conjuring is a brilliant horror film and one of my bests. 10/10",10,0,0,4 October 2016
Halloween," Halloween Review #9: Had to!!
","There was basically no denying that I had to review Halloween this Halloweeen,I mean it's Halloween so,here it is. Halloween came out in the fall(I'm guessing)of 1978 and stars Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis and follows a man who's recently just escaped from a mental home and now,he's after his young stepsister after killing his family back in the 60's as a child. Halloween is a classic! You won't believe this,but I am actually reviewing my favourite horror film ever,ya,I know,out of every one in the entire earth I've sat threw in watched,this is the best ever. Halloween has absolutely no flaws what so ever,there was nothing that badly bothered me,this movie was perfect! The acting was perfect,Donald Pleasance was brilliant in this film,possibly one of the best performances ever,the score was also amazing,when I first watched it,I was very scared!! Halloween is a perfect horror film,obviously great for Halloween. Get ready guys because I've just made a list there so I'm going to be doing a lot(possibly even today),I have Friday The 13th,Nightmare On Elm Street,The Omen,The Ritual,The Omen and Rosemary's Baby,because for some reason,that film I've never seen. Halloween,though..10/10!!!!!",10,0,1,16 October 2017
Carrie," Brilliant teen horror film!
","Carrie is one of the best horror films ever no question about it. I love the acting,the drama,the horrific prom scene and now I...come...to..talk...about...it. Carrie tells the story of a young 17 year old outcast who is bullied every day by Chris,a horrible classmate. Each day,Carrie goes home having to face with her maniac religious mother who thinks of everything as a sin. One day,Carrie is asked to prom by a popular classmate,she thinks it's a joke but it's really one of the bullies who feels ashamed of what she did to poor Carrie. Carries mother grows angry about this as Carrie demands she attends. Carrie attends the prom but Chris has been expelled by a gym teacher who feels so sorry for Carrie so that means no prom for Chris so she decides to humiliate Carrie by pouring a bucket full of pigs blood on her. When this event happens,all of her classmates start laughing even her gym teacher then Carrie gets angry and uses OH YES I FORGOT she has telekinetic powers to kill them all,Carrie sets the school on fire and walks out,Carrie goes home and her house is covered in candles,Carries mother cuddles her and tells her her first time with her father. Carries mother stabs her and Carrie falls down the stairs and uses her powers to stab her mothers with loads of sharp items. Carrie kills her and starts to scream crying as the house breaks down and it sets on fire. Carrie and her mother lie in a cupboard dead as the house crushes to pieces. The next day,Sue is in bed asleep as she has a dream of her putting flowers on her grave when suddenly DUN DUN DUN Carries hand pops up and grabs her and the movie ends. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!",10,0,1,1 October 2016
Mother!," Halloween Review #3:Unusually Brilliant!!
","When I heard the plot of the movie Mother! I was very excited and trust me,I knew I told would bow good,then I began to hear things and I was like,oh..yeah,that's not the movie I asked for,but I was still very excited to see it,considering,for some weird reason,it didn't premiere in my cinema,so I have just finished it online. Mother!..it's..well..OK,lets do this in pairs. The acting:Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant along with Javier Bardem,Ed Helms and Michelle Pfeifer. The movie's plot was obviously something,that if Afronsky didn't come up with,would never be made,Mother! You may of thought,when it was announced was not original,but trust me,that's just the shield,ya,this film is f*cked up,but I liked that,it was original,although,just a fact here,if a group of teens are going to reunite by seeing a jump scare fest horror film,Mother! Is not the film,it's not really a horror film at all,it's more of a drama/bit of thriller and like,tiny bit of horror. This is the kinda movie a posh couple would see or a group middle aged women. Mother!..yeah,it's good. Sorry guys,but I probably won't be reviewing anything tomorrow or the next day,due to being away,but on Sundaoy,I will have a new horror review up,possibly the new British horror film,The Ritual!!",9,1,4,12 October 2017
Final Destination," Pretty entertaining!
","Final destination came out in 2000,the plot was pretty original but it didn't seem it like OK good to Wong for making a original horror movie but it feels like it was done once or twice I don't know it just sounds familiar. I liked the film though,it wasn't great though,I want a big fan but I'd you are a horror fan you would probably like it and the rest of the crappy series which didn't live up at all..well except for final destination 3&5. But apart from that,final destination is a original OK horror film starring Ali Larter(resident evil,house on a haunted hill)Devon Sawa I think(Casper,now and then,the exorcism of Molly Hartley)and Sean William Scott(American pie,goon).",6,0,0,30 September 2016
The Purge," I don't know about this...
","The purge tells the story of a future where crime is legal for one night and a rich family board up for the night ahead of them. As the night goes on,There youngest son Charlie hears a man screaming,he sees a man beginning for help on the deserted streets saying someone's after him,Charlie lets him in as he disappears into the house. Then,a group of masked people ask them kindly to let him out within 30 minutes or the family will die and what happens..they can't find him and the group break in. This movie was pretty dumb but the director did put a bit of effort in to it its just a bit..dumb. In this movie,crime is legal so why are they all dressing up as weirdo people from the strangers I mean..come on! The movie stars Ethan Hawke,your typical serious modern horror movie actor and Lena Headey. The purge is a crap unrealistic movie that makes no sense...no sense. Although,the second film was a really good film that should have been made on its own and I never saw the third film.",4,2,3,6 October 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Halloween Review #11: No horror film could beat this at the time
","So after Halloween and Friday The 13th,a new horror film was coming that was unexpectedly become a new horror film that would be going on for years to come,A Nightmare On Elm Street which focuses on the humorous killer Freddy Kruger who begins to haunt young Nancy's dreams unaware,she's get a police officer daddy and also,she's a pretty strong lady and won't take no sh*t from any one. When A Nightamre On Elm Street came out,it was booming,it was the new Halloween/Friday The 13th and as I said,it got another bunch of films and spin offs and a remake. The film is a brilliant classic,the acting was also brilliant especially from Heather Langenkamp who to this day,remains one of my favourite final girls along with Laurie from Halloween and Alice and Ginny from Friday The 13th:Part 1&2. Robert England was the only one in the three big horror franchises that actually appeared on screen and had actual lines,Michael and Jason just killed people and stared at people angrily. Johnny Depp also did a fantastic job in this doing an amazing performance as Nancys brother who was weird to see in this and even reappeared in the sixth Nightmare On Elm which was most likely the worst. A Nightmare On Elm Street is definitely a A+!!",10,1,2,16 October 2017
Cube," Halloween Review #21: Very good horror film
","Cube is a horror film that not really,if i can remember,got talking about back when it was released,but now,its weirdly a big hit,well..big enough. Cube follows several strangers wake up in a cube sized room when they discover that there whole life literally depends on it when they discover there is a way out but its highly complicated. Now,I love like trap horror films and when I mean trap,I mean like movies where there is possibly no destination and this film did it quite good. Cube is very psychological and very creepy,the films very unpredictable and when you find out your like..what. The film also has a very good cast and leaves the whole gore situation very limited,in fact,there is very little until the end. Cube is a very good horror film and also,very original",8,0,1,24 October 2017
