The Blair Witch Project," Utter Trash
","I simply do not see the attraction to this movie.  It's boring, predictable, and about as scary as a coffee mug.Why?  You know exactly what is going to happen.  They start hiking, they camp, they hike, they hear weird noises, they scream, they hike, they camp, they hear weird noises, scream some more, hike, scream, scream, hike, scream, camp, noises, scream, blah blah blah.The only thing that is truly amazing about the picture is that Artisan has managed to dupe millions of people into believing this film is original and worth the hour and 20 minutes it takes to watch.",1,1,3,20 August 1999
8 Mile," Should have been titled 'Hip Hop Karate Kid'
","This movie is basically a rehashing of every down and out tough luck kid who has a dream and then achieves his goals.  This includes 'classics' like The Karate Kid, Rad (yeah, you remember that BMX movie, don't you?), even some more violent stuff like Bloodsport.  There simply isn't much here... There are a lot of little plot points that don't have anything to do with the story: the conflict with his ex-girlfriend, conflicts with his new girlfriend, conflicts between his mother and her boyfriend, conflicts between him and a guy from his neighborhood, conflicts between him and a rival rap crew, conflicts between him and his own rap crew, and finally... conflicts between him and himself.  The movie runs the gamut of dysfunctional relationships, trying to find at least one that you'll buy into, but none of them are developed, and none of them are at all suspenseful because you know that it'll all work out in the end (or you don't care enough to notice that the conflicts weren't developed and were simply forgot about).  The few 'freestyle MC battle' scenes were decent... but they were scripted, not freestyled, so they lose their impact.  The colors were nice and the cinematography during the MC battles was pretty good, but that's all the positive I can say.  Anyone under 14 who doesn't really think about the quality of the story will most likely blindly enjoy this.",Null,0,0,9 November 2002
Vanilla Sky," Cameron Crowe Stole this movie scene for scene, line for line
","When I first saw this film in theatre's I was fairly underwhelmed by it.  I thought it dragged on and the ending was a total copout, and I was immediately interested in seeing what the original version (made only four years earlier) was like, as I had heard it didn't have the terrible ending. I recently found a copy for a very reasonable price and was absolutely astonished at what I saw.  Cameron Crowe copied the film scene for scene, line for line... and the things he changed he made worse.  He should be ashamed of himself!  I have lost all respect I had for Crowe as a film maker, putting a different spin on a story is a nice thing, but blatantly copying is just pathetic.",Null,0,0,24 May 2002
