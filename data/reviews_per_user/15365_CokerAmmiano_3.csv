The Blair Witch Project," I've seen scarier cartoons than this movie.
","I don't know how anyone could find this movie scary, or even remotely creepy. I was bored the entire way through. The only endearing quality was the realistic look and feel of the actors and the camera, which I must add made me especially queasy with all the jerky movement. I suppose I may have been able to get into the plot if I weren't too busy looking at the jump shots in the movie. Intentional of course, but disorienting none-the-less. At least for someone who spent their college years studying film making.The 'chilling' final shot of the movie was wholly unoriginal; the story of urban legend come true has been told countless times over.I applaud the two film makers for a wonderful attempt. I can see how the movie might appeal to people whose idea of great television is the Jerry Springer show, or perhaps people who have a pile of cat bones in a bag and pentagrams all over their floor. But I have seen movies infinitely more chilling and well done. If you want a truly chilling movie rent Silence of the Lambs. If you want motion sickness go see The Blair Witch Project.",1,1,2,10 August 1999
Insidious," If I could rate less than a 1, I would.
","Initially, I set out to watch this movie because I'd heard from many, many people how scary it was, and frankly, my goal was to justify my position that they were all wussies.Well, the joke was on me.I was right, everyone I know is a chicken, this movie is not scary. But, it's also not even remotely entertaining.I had hopes I'd at least enjoy it, as I've quite enjoyed some of the previous offerings by Wan and Whannell. Now, I'm just angry at Wan and Whannell for dropping the ball so very, very badly. I suspect they owe someone money, and this is what they did to get it.Find below an enumerated list of my major complaints: 1) I know nothing is really 'new' anymore, but this is basically nothing but Poltergeist with Astral projection. Boring.2) Astral projection? Seriously? Come on. And the Dad being able to do it too? How convenient. Not quite a Deux ex Machina, but close enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth.3) While I'm on astral projection... I realize that it's difficult to 'film' that concept, but seriously, walking around in a house? That's the least convincing depiction of astral projection anyone has ever come up with. Seriously. Horrible. Did anyone think that was GOOD? 4) Fist fighting while astrally projecting? Come on.5) Contrary to popular belief, not all North American audiences are drooling morons, and we don't need to see things like the red door, and then him flashing back to the drawing of the red door. We didn't forget seeing the drawings guys... we made the connection. Also, again with the horse. I don't like my movies spoon fed to me, thanks.6) The demon looks like Darth Maul. The only thing scary about Darth Maul is how many people went to see that other snooze fest of a movie on the big screen, including me twice. If they'd been able to reanimate Tiny Tim as the demon to go along with his music, it would have been a lot more frightening than the demon they had.So, there were only two things I enjoyed in the entirety of the movie. Two. That's it.1) The creepy smiling people in the house. They look fun, and I'd invite them to dinner.2) I'm glad the father came back possessed. Though I was hoping it'd happen to the kid too. But hey, gotta punk out for the North American audiences, right? Can't do that to a kid. Blah.The end is the only thing that saves this from a total zero..5",1,2,8,18 July 2011
Saw," Outstanding.
","Just finished watching it, and I think it's one of the better movies that I've seen in quite a while. Perhaps one of the best. I've read quite a few reviews in various places where people complained about the pacing of the movie, personally there weren't any points where the movie dragged for me. As for the acting, well... I've seen much worse. Yes, Cary Elwes has a tendency to go over the top at times, but that's pretty much his acting style. Not that he's a bad actor, he's just much better suited to comedy than drama. For my money, he's a terrific comedic actor. Was he miscast? I don't know. Maybe I'm biased in that I just love looking at the guy, heh, so I can forgive mistakes more easily than some. The ending... ah what can I say about the ending? I'll say this. I LOVED it. LOVED it. Whether or not you 'saw' it coming (ah, forgive the pun, I had to), I think it fit the movie perfectly. The movie is made all the better given the low budget and relative inexperience of the writers/director. For a first effort, I think it's absolutely outstanding. I think part of the problem people have with this movie is that they were expecting a gruesome horror, when I'd classify it more as a psychological thriller. For me, those are the best kind.Regarding comparisons of this movie to Se7en, I don't think it's an apt comparison. Do they have a common meeting ground? Yes. So do a lot of movies that are vastly different from each other in execution and style.One last comment, on the subject of plot holes. I've got three words - suspension of disbelief. Learn it, live it, love it. C.",10,0,0,23 October 2004
