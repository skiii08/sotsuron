Black Swan," A Horror Movie Marketed As An Art Film
","I wrestled with whether to submit a review for this reason: everybody is entitled to their own taste in movies, and the mere fact that this movie is not to my taste doesn't make it 'bad.' On the other hand, I note that people who obviously like horror movies have given this movie an enthusiastic rating so that, on balance, I see no reason why I shouldn't rate it 'awful' based upon my dislike of this genre.The next question I asked myself was whether there was any point in submitting a review -- what could I add beyond simply dissing horror movies. I answer that question this way: I saw this movie because it was released at year's end with an 'Oscar buzz' and it turns out to be simply a horror movie. It has all the gory scenes and demon-like characters popping up suddenly when a door is opened that is de rigueur in such a flick.The story that underlies this tale profiles the psychiatric torments of a profoundly disturbed individual. As such, this tale could have been told without the gratuitous 'sex' and without the special effects. It is sad that the movie industry has come to the point where the fare of mindless summer blockbusters is now being served up as serious drama.If horror movies are your thing, go for it. Otherwise, I'd take a pass.",1,147,280,8 January 2011
Gravity," Lost in Space
","The big 'spoiler' is that this is a big budget Hollywood move with a preposterous plot and lots of special effects. The problem here is that nobody could possible survive through any of this, and the special effects become a substitute for any meaningful plot. Even taken on its own terms, the movie makes no sense. Sandra Bullock has become an astronaut but lacks even the basic skills for that occupation. She tells us she always crash landed the flight simulator, and we find her thumbing through an instruction manual about the size of the instructions for a DVD player to figure out how to safely pilot a space craft back to earth. She even picks the buttons eeny, meany, miney, mo style. Add to this the contrived scenario that she has not only lost a child but also is 'revived' and given a reason to live by the now dead George Clooney appearing in a dream sequence. And how great a movie can it really be where there is only one character (and almost no dialog) on camera for most of the film. The special effects are impressive, but what they've obviously done is use computer graphics to create all the weightless effects. As such, things remain weightless even when they shouldn't be, and you eventually become more interested in looking for the screw-ups than watching the movie. Please, please, please. Will someone make a movie with a clever plot that keeps you guessing to the end and with interesting and passably believable characters.",1,978,1496,8 October 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," At Last, A Movie For People With ADD!
","There are many movies with impossible plots that are entertaining because you are carried along by the story. You don't notice the holes in the plot until the next day. In this case, the plot is not merely preposterous, it is transparent. As such, it is impossible to enjoy the movie because you are sitting in the theatre analyzing its faults. Let's begin with the idea that Matt Damon looks for his true love for 3 years after their chance meeting. O.K., so I didn't realize until the next day that his true love had crashed a wedding and that she was last seen being chased by security people much faster than she was. Matt could simply have checked back at the hotel to learn her identity. But even while I was watching the movie it was obvious that he plays a well-known public figure. So why didn't she just call him up? Once you realize this is all she would have to do, the premise of the movie collapses. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, the human hero is outwitting God. How believable is that? The angels suggest that God just doesn't have the resources to monitor everybody, so He focuses on 'important' people. That's simply annoying. This is a God who (rather than knowing when any sparrow falls) apparently only knows when a condor falls. And then you have the angel who violates God's orders to help our hero find his true love by loaning him his cheesy hat. I could only think of the Red Hat Ladies. Where do they end up when they go though a door? I've never read (or heard of) the scifi novel from the 50's that this is based on, but I recognized the genre when it was postulated that all the large events of Western Civilization could be explained by times that God intervened and times when God took a hands-off approach: God was on-duty up to the Fall of Rome, but took the day off during the Dark Ages, etc. Other reviewers quibble that this ignores other cultures, but 1950's scifi was into sweeping concepts like this. Frankly, it is kinda neat, and as a teenager I would have been intrigued. But the problem here is that Hollywood has taken what was probably a pretty good idea from the 50's and trashed it. I'd bet that the author made a much more credible case for his premise and tied up the loose ends in a way that was internally consistent. Not so here. I give three stars because of the scenes of New York and because smoking was not prominently featured. Even Big Tobacco passed on this turkey.",3,39,72,6 March 2011
