The Ring," Not the creepiest, but close
","Just saw it tonight. Wasn't as creepy as The Sixth Sense, but of its genre, excellent point-of-view camera work and story-telling puts it in the same league. It has a lot going for it. An inventive 'urban legend' kind of tale, a creepy little kid (stolen, I'd say from the aforementioned picture), a well-written mystery/detective story and a frightening denouement. The methodical unraveling of the tape's meaning makes you forget there is a time element in this movie until the end. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year.",10,0,0,21 October 2002
