50 First Dates," Sweet and Funny
","The chemistry that Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler showed us in 'The Wedding Singer' carries over into this sweet and funny romantic comedy. Peter Lucas gives us an abundance of wacky moments, over-the-top characters, and quasi-adolescent sexual humor, but considering the cast, we'd be disappointed if it didn't have all that and more. However, it's the 'and more' that makes this movie special. Sandwiched between the zany moments are bittersweet romance, the powerful ties of family and friendship, and, finally, a surprisingly insightful picture of the true meaning of love. Cudos to Sean Astin, who shows us he's not afraid to take a risk!",Null,0,0,23 June 2004
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," What a wonderful surprise!
","I finally watched this movie because I thought I ought to, but I wasn't expecting a lot. Boy, was I in for a surprise! Like the book (which I started but didn't finish), the movie begins slowly, but once it gets going it draws you in and won't let you go. This is a different sort of love story. Cage & Cruz give wonderfully understated performances that manage to communicate both the palpable longing that draws Corelli and Pelagia together and the internal conflicts & social pressures that pull them apart.John Hurt's performance as Pelagia's father is fabulous. In fact, this film is just full of 'smaller' stories you wish they'd had time to tell you.It's a masterpiece of subtlety and nuance. You'll want to watch this one again and again!",Null,1,3,28 July 2004
