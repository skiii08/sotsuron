The Blair Witch Project," Simply Stunning
","This movie might just do for the woods what Psycho did for the shower.  The most horrifying thing is just how realistic this movie is.  This may not be a perfect motion picture, but it is a perfect movie.  What it sets out to do it does perfectly.  It will scare the absolute crap out of you.  I saw it in a full theater with probably 200 people total.  Afterwards, no one was talking about where they were going to eat or what they were doing next. Everyone was talking about this movie, and I assume that like me, they kept talking about it all night long.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
