Your Name.," Not impressed
","Had high expectations due to the hype and I liked Shinkai's previous works, but was disappointed that it really wasn't special. The plot is bland and predictable, the mystery not quite so mysterious, and you're expected to suspend disbelief but then one would expect an incredible journey that makes it all worthwhile when in reality it's all rather pedestrian of the usual teenage pulp romance genre. The implausible we are asked to believe thus becomes rather irritating - when the great unraveling of the 'mystery' is anything but.I far prefer Studio Ghibli's wistfulness and sensitivity in their approach - there's something magical and enthralling in their hinting at young romance. Even in the realm of the impossible, eg Arietty, the story-telling is compelling enough to make the deeper currents palpable.Oh well, different strokes and all that...",1,21,83,2 January 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Grand Waste of a Stellar Cast
","Having been to a few of Wes Anderson's films, the twee, absurd caricature, dead-pan precious, lush, scenic, cardboard Tim Burton-esque cinematography that many insisted is synonymous with 'intelligent humour' were all expected. What wasn't is the insufferable, sophomoric idiocy of the story, gratuitous characters and shallowness of the plot, the script, the character development, the entire purpose of the making of this film. What on earth is it suppose to say?! What deeper layers are there to uncover other than it being a madcap caper about promiscuous hotel staff carrying on with obscenely rich geriatrics, murderous villains and relatives, an outrageous and unbelievable jailbreak adventure? What is the point to this wedding cake indulgence of a film, exactly? And please don't sniff haughtily with a 'You just don't get its brilliance/genius/subversion/provocation, blah..blah...blah...go watch a Tom Cruise flick!' retort. I honestly don't get much more from this film than its gruel thin plot.",1,154,325,25 August 2014
V for Vendetta," Film rendered brilliant by our times
","I put off watching this because I was tired of the masked hero comic genre and wasn't sure if this was another action flick with lots of CGI and a thin plot. But do I regret it! Sure, the weaknesses I feared were there - too much of The Phantom of the Opera, a number of Big Brother clich√©s and Natalie Portman was so kosher it hurts - but this film is saved by virtue of its timing. The film also considerably at some junctures even though the action was well- choreographed and worthy of the makers of The Matrix. It is long, the narrative familiar but engrossing enough. Before 2000, I would have scoffed at the probability of such a plot premise which would have seemed far-fetched and over the top. Watching it in this day and age, I get chills and goosebumps not because the film was that good but because the times we're in are that bad. Before 2000, the self-evident truths in the film would have made it trite, today, they are strangely poignant. All the references to atrocities tolerated are so ordinary to us at this moment in time, it is almost psychotically hilarious. It is so unsettling to sit through this that towards the end, one actually finds great relief that the directors did not deny us a hopeful trajectory and one is happy to embrace the 'Hollywood' ending because the possibility of us fighting back instead of sinking into greater paranoia and apathy against neo-fascism in our lifetime is to put it optimistically, bleak. How many truly care about the erosion of civil liberties, detention without trial or torture camps? Well, if you've got nothing to hide, what are you afraid of? Nuke Iran and potentially killing millions? Shrug. In that, this is highly recommended as a great escapist film.",Null,0,1,9 January 2007
