Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I have never cringed more during a film...
","I get the impression that Lucas did not even go back and /watch/ the first three moves before making this one. My list of complaints is great, but I will try to keep it down to my major criticisms.1)Not only did I find Jar Jar annoying, but his accent and attitude struck me as some how racist.2)Why is the technology of the past so vastly different (and seemingly superior) to the technology of later years? This made absolutely no sense to me.3)It seems as though everything interesting and mystical about the force was taken away in favor of more 'technology' that does not show up in other films.4)The acting was miserable, even by the good actors. They were not given good enough dialogue to work with. Anakin was hopelessly wooden and uninteresting. There was not a single character that I cold feel any empathy towards.5)Why do we care about the past anyway? We already know what happens, ultimately. Lucas should have focused on telling us about the future.6)While ultimately, all the Star Wars movies are meant more for children, Lucas catered this movie far too much towards them while ignoring those who made his movies popular in the first place.",3,1,2,29 April 2000
