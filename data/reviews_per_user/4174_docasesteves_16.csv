","This movie keeps improving every time you watch it! First i watch it i dont like it very much (7), second time i love it (9), now, in this third time, omfg, this movie rises to one of the best movies i have ever seen (a glorious10). Christopher Nolan trully is the best filmmaker alive. I LOVE THIS MOVIE, it is very emotional, the story keeps revealing kee points every time you watch it, Hans Zimmer best score work since The Lion King, with this incredible soundtrack that you will want to hear again and again. WOW. A trully masterpiece that already is a classic of the cinema!

Inside Out," Best animated picture ever
","In my opinion, THE BEST ANIMATED MOVIE EVER MADE, and one of the bests ever. So deep, involving, OMG",10,3,7,6 October 2018
Avengers: Endgame," The last hour
","Im not a huge Marvel fan, but i like to watch their movies, and after seen Infinity War, i can say, this was worst. The first couple of hours was just fill time and i wasnt enjoying that much. The last hour, with the battle and all the events, it trully become really good. So, a 7 for hour 1 and 2, and a strong 9 for the last.",8,1,2,30 July 2019
Toy Story 4," Surpassed my expectations
","I had a low expectation for this movie, after the disapointment i have after watching Incredibles2, and this was actualy a really good surprise! The ending make the movie completely, with out it i would give this an 8. The movie as good, but it lack some character development, they introduce a bunch of new characters when they could use it the old ones, they just hang around in the movie. In the midle of the picture i thought 'hm this could be the begin of another great trilogy' but in the end, i mean, i dont see how they could do it. This movie was necessary? Absolutely not. I would prefer if they have just end it with the ToyStory3 MASTERPIECE,, but i mean, they 'need' money so. I recommend it yes. See this like Annabelle 3, it was just a story that happened in one afternoon, nothing more, nothing less, doesnt have that thrill of many many days in developing ideas, situations and characters,, this could just be like when after Cars2 they create MattTons or something like that, just things that happen to our beloved characters. After this, IT IS A GOOD MOVIE!",9,1,6,8 August 2019
The Favourite," Exquisite
","What can i say about this movie, well it is unsettling. This is a ride of marvelous performances, screenplay and a masterclass in directing. This movie is trully a masterpiece beautifully crafted by Yorgos Lanthimos and the astonishing good actresses Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. They got it right in so many aspects, flawless and stunning cinematography, stunning costumes, stunning sets (way better than Black Panther wich took the oscars in those categories..)
I cant point flaws in this picture, the story was envolving, funny, caring, heart melting, dramatic, you care and you believe in the dispute that the characters of Stone and Weisz are having to earn the love of Colman's character, queen Anne oscar winning performance.
Just watch the movie, i really recomend it!",10,1,3,28 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Quentin did it again
","I was blowned away when first watched in Cannes Festival, its a trully masterpiece.
Very well done Tarantino, just loved it.
You must watch it in theaters when released, you wont regret it",8,43,107,13 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Final
","I had HUGE expectations for these movie, and it let me down a bit. I love the begining when DiCaprio is speacking with AlPacino (if he had a bit more screen time, i believe he could be nominated for an oscar) but after that the movie kinda drags. I LOVE Margot Robie but if you cut all her performance you wouldnt notice, because she isnt important for the plot, she just dances and watch her own movie basicaly... Leonardo DiCaprio performance was incredibleeee but after what he did on the Revenant i dont see the academy give him another oscar, but for sure he will be nominated. Brad Pitt character was good, and also his performance, but, i dont know.. it lack something. The CLIMAX OMG AHAHAHAHHA I N C R E D I B L E !!!!!!! I will not reveal any detail ahahha just watch the movie.
So i like this movie, but it lack a more straight to the point screenplay, many many characters that really dont add anything, but the movie worth the watch because it a DiCaprio Pitt Robbie and Tarantino (and many others) movie. I dont see tarantino get a nom for director, but yes for screenplay, but i dont think he will win any of it. At the oscars this movie only have a chance on costumes and production design and maybe something for the sound (until it come a time picture and a space one).

Children of Men," Caotic !
","This movie is a marvel. It is so overwelming, so striking. I mean, what i have just seen. Alfonso Cuaron proves himself again and again as one of the best directors alive. Chivo Incredible cinematography along excellent directing by Alfonso creates another masterpiece. Wow",9,0,0,6 August 2019
"Girl, Interrupted"," Angelina stole it
","Pratically Angelina Jolie is the only good thing in the movie.

Titanic," OMFG
","This is not a film, this is a life experience. Simply THE BEST PICTURE EVER MADE,, NOTHING CAN TOP IT, MY ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE MOVIE BY FAR!!!!!",10,5,12,10 April 2019
Joker," IT MATCHES HEATH LEDGER JOKER!
","Joaquin Phoenix did the impossible in this movie! A M A Z I N G,, WOW, just love this movie!",10,12,45,5 September 2019
Joker," Joaquin Phoenix Oscar worthy performance
","Wow. This movie astonished me! Mind boggling performance, Joaquin Phoenix delievers a completely original, unsetling, crazy Joker, brilliant direction, narrative, cinematography, SCORE, sound, and also Robert DeNiro whit a smaller part, but a nailed it one (waiting to see him in the IrishMan!!)
This movie trully is about the Joker origin, so dont expect to see him as a trully Joker in the first 10minutes. The movie slowly builds itself to the masterpiece you will see and rewatch again and again in the future. I think no one could have done a better Joker movie. I just love it! Thanks",10,1,2,3 October 2019
