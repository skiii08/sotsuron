The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Had the potential to please all twilight lovers however this falls short of any real entertainment.
","So I have found myself thoroughly disappointed by the latest twilight film, I am a huge fan of the entire saga and loved the books. The other 3 films have left me satisfied, they were humorous and generally followed the plot however the latest film is sadly disappointing. The start is slow however this is forgivable as so is the book. But you expect the film to improve have a little more debt, but this doesn't come. Instead you find yourself bewildered by some really bad directing. At one of the key moments when Jacob (Taylor Lautner) leaves the pack we hear some very cheesy manly voices (aiming to be the conversation between Sam and Jacob). Probably one of the cheesiest moments in film history, this is followed by some clich√© lines and poor scenes. Bellas (kristen Stewart) pregnancy feels rushed there's no real build up to the birth of the child. Or any emotion, everything is predictable and slow. The final straw was when Jacob imprint's on Renesmee, the cheesy eye contact and then Jacobs voice over while there's white lights almost symbolising a heaven-I almost cried with disappointment. I was expecting another brilliant film with a deep story line wanting you to watch more. However I was left wondering what more could happen 3/4 of the book had already been shown the only thing that makes me curious about the next film is what is there left to show apart from one 'fight' scene??",3,12,24,18 November 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," sadly disappointing
","I have now been to see the second part of harry potter twice and both times have been impressed with how good the graphics and acting of the three main characters are, however i was disappointed that it did not stick to the book as much as part 1. My main problems were:teddy lupin is barely mentioned Freddie's death is barely seen snapes memories are rushednot enough screen time on professor mcgonagall or snapemy least favourite part is the ending where harry defeats voldemort and afterward he goes back into the great hall but nobody says to him well done or finally voldemorts dead which is a little bit weird.However it has some great music and brilliant acting especially by Alan rickman who is portrays snapes emotions brilliantly and shows a more vulnerable side another great performance was by Mathew lewis who plays Neville, Neville steals the show for me being the surprising hero.overall this is a must see film but if you are a big fan of the books you may find the film slightly disappointing",9,2,4,16 July 2011
