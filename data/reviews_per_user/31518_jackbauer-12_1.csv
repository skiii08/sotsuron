Angels & Demons," 'Very entertaining blockbuster'
","Before, i began i must say, that English is not my mayor language. I've read all Dan Brown novels. My opinion,he's a very talented writer. I'm also a big fan of Tom Hanks works. I saw the movie yesterday in a Szombathely movie theater. The acting was quite good, the cinematography, and the score to(credit to Hans Zimmer), the screenwriters(David Koepp,and Akiva Goldsman) did a few changes in the plot, but nothing that big.<ul><li>Spoiler - The twist at the end of the movie stayed the same, as the novel.Yeah Ewan McGregor killed the Pope. The explosion of the bomb, at the end was well made, it was just how i've imagined while reading the book. - End of Spoiler - Overall, it's a great entertaining blockbuster movie, with stunningly good sets(the Vatikan inside was fully made by the filmmakers, because they don't become a permit) and great special effects. It pleases Dan Brown-Ron Howard-and Tom Hanks fans to.</li></ul>P.S.: The movie is a bit better, than the Da-Vinci code.",8,4,17,14 May 2009
