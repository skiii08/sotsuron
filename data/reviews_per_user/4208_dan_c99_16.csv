The Hangover," Not that good, really...
","Went to see it with my wife last week. We laughed a little, but there is NOTHING memorable in this film. They seem like nice boys, and the stuff wasn't too raunchy, but nothing timeless or classic. At All.Weekend at Bernie's? Better.City Slickers? Better.I could go on, but why bother?None of the movies these days are very good. The industry is collapsing. There is a lack of good writing. The actors are all boring. The girls are pretty, but that's not enough. Nothing is interesting in these movies any more.",1,12,25,28 September 2009
Deja Vu," A terrible movie, just awful...
","This movie is not even a science fiction movie. Its ridiculous. Excuse me Denzel, but how could you get involved in this? Oh, for the money! Nothing is explained well. this movie wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but it is. But as soon they started to 'talk' about wormholes etc this movie was over. Denzel Washington is usually worth watching, but not here - the movie is just too awful.It's a really sorry piece of work, anybody with the least knowledge of Sci Fi will Agree that this movie is just ridiculous.Tony Scott jumped off a bridge in L.A. not too long ago, probably dismayed over the portfolio of junk movies he'd made during his career. While that is indeed a shame, at least we won't have to worry about more movies like this from him.",1,4,11,11 November 2014
L.A. Confidential," An absolute ripoff of Chinatown
","Better to watch Chinatown again than this overrated junk. The story was too contrived and needlessly complicated. Kim Basinger is no Faye Dunaway. The period music was applied with a trowel, and I never believed any of the characters was a real 'tough guy'. A bunch of Hollywood types pretending to be rough characters. And it never established a real period feel. By the way, having Danny Devito in this movie made it a total joke. We're supposed to take The Penguin seriously as a character in a major film? And his voice-over was a cliché, something I would expect in a satirical film.I'm mystified that so many people think this movie is great.",1,4,19,29 August 2014
North by Northwest," Undeniably a classic!
","This is Hitchcock's best film – quite an accomplishment, considering how many great films he created. And after half a century, 'North By Northwest' holds up beautifully. This film has it all: suspense, glamour, humor, and images that capture the imagination and remain etched in memory. The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action. Ernest Lehman's script is full of sophisticated dialogue. Performances are spot on. Has Cary Grant ever been more engaging? Is James Mason the ultimate in charming villains? And Eva Marie Saint's allure is multi-faceted. Movies just don't get better than this.",10,1,3,18 November 2014
No Country for Old Men," A disgusting piece of work
","Self indulgent, stupid, illogical, incomplete, needlessly violent, immoral, etc, etc, need I go on? The Coen brothers should have all of their money and trophies taken away and then they should be put in jail for around 25 years.A beautifully photographed but ultimately empty homage to the brooding maniacs in our society. And not a very well done homage at that.I've enjoyed other of their movies, but I've seen a pattern emerge over the last few films: they love pools of dripping blood in their work. The puddles of fake blood are like a recurring character that appears over and over in every one of their films. To what end? Why are they so fascinated with blood? The very stuff of life and they display no respect for it or for life itself, for that matter.Do yourself a favor, stay away from this movie. It's just stupid and disgusting. Only a pretentious bore so impressed with their pseudo-intelligence would appreciate this mess: 'Ohh, how clever, I'm sooo glad that I understand it. Too bad nobody else will because they're not as sophisticated as I am.'",1,3,7,6 August 2009
Drive," You're kidding, right?
","I can't believe the critics raved about this movie.Awful, just awful.A little bit of Vanishing Point, a little bit of Bullitt, a little bit of The Professional, a little bit of The Transporter, a little bit of Heat.All of it bad.Scenes that were totally silent for minutes at a time. The sum total of the dialog could fit on 2 pages. Half of this movie was silent, I'm not kidding. Note to the producers: making a movie that is crammed full of enigmatic gazing into someone's eyes does not make it an 'art film'. It just makes it BORING.Excruciatingly gory violence, totally unneeded in a film like this. The lead guy is a skinny little nothing with no discernible muscle mass, and yet he dispatches the bad guys as though he were The Terminator.Yeah, sure.Zero character development. The lead character is a cipher: who is he, where did he come from, where did he learn all that stuff, was he hatched or born? Who cares?Oh wait, the hero must be a genius! Not only can he drive fast and kill people twice his size with one hand, he can rebuild a Holly 850 carburetor on his kitchen table using just a screwdriver.And Albert Brooks playing the Chief Bad Guy? Albert Brooks? Are you serious? In his old age, Albert Brooks looks like a retired accountant, not a tough guy. Albert Brooks? Really?A film like this makes Stallone's The Expendables look like a Shakespearean tragedy.Come to think of it, I know what this film is. It's a chick flick. Just like the ones seen on Lifetime. Sure, it has cars, guns and violence. But they're just there to sucker the guys into going along with the ladies to see it.Quite a nice bit of bait-and-switch.I want my money back.",Null,2,5,22 October 2011
Patton," A great performance, a great movie...
","And the best performance from an Actor in history. George C. Scott is General Patton, the greatest General of World War II and the most controversial. Scott gives the performance of a lifetime if Patton watched this film he couldn't tell the difference himself. Scott portrays him the way he was, not the way he should be or the way we would like him to be. Patton is Patton, tough, resilient, fearless, sarcastic, angry, witty, cultured, charming, bull-headed, uncompromising, temperamental, and more patriotic than Uncle Sam on the 4th of July. The speech at the beginning with him in front of the American flag sets the tone. It's his way or the highway. And Patton is driving. His antics tick off the high command and rankle his subordinates but they all can't argue with his success. Karl Malden is his good friend and at times adversary General Bradley who is as resourceful as Patton is eccentric and they make a great pair. Every time Patton has a victory he screws it up by way of his gargantuan mouth. But he keeps going. When disaster strikes he always manages to pull defeat out of his rear and strike a blow for the 2nd Corps or the 3rd Army or whatever army he's commanding. His soldiers love him, his soldiers hate him, but his soldiers fight for him regardless because they know he's the best. Patton's rise is like Patton's fall, momentous. His last line is the most telling of all. 'They remind us that glory, like everything else, is fleeting.' Glory may be fleeting but this movie won't be. Perhaps the best war movie in history. --------- ------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ---------- ----------------- ------------------- --------- ----------- ---------- ------ ----------- - - By the way, Mr. 'Tetdog', regarding your ignorant 'review' from Sep of 2009: you are an idiot.That was not a review, it was a political rant. What are you, 15 years old? That is the most vitriolic, ignorant, disrespectful piece of tripe on the whole IMDb website. It's obvious that your grasp of history is woefully inadequate, and your hatred of anyone who doesn't agree with you is disgusting. Even your father is subject to your insults.What a waste of air you are.",10,1,3,5 January 2010
Guardians of the Galaxy," Don't waste your time
","The Marvel team has once again given us another bunch of junk. The ever growing 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' deserves to be destroyed, and I found myself rooting for the bad guys to put the rest of the sappy characters out of their misery. James Gunn takes the helm of the fairly unknown 'Guardians of the Galaxy', much to his detriment. Unlike Iron Man, Captain America and Thor join this film as partners in grime. An unmitigated disaster, total junk, a complete waste of time and utterly forgettable. Stay home and watch Friends reruns, they are more creative and still more relevant than this unimaginative, unoriginal mishmash of plagiarized elements from other films.Ugghhhh...",1,29,78,1 August 2014
Caddyshack," A great film that still makes me laugh
","I don't know where to start with this film. To the people that didn't find this movie funny, you obviously have no sense of humor at all. Everyone who likes this movie, you know what I am talking about. This is a classic and one of the best line-ups of all time. Dangerfield and Murray Stole the whole show.Chase, best line: 'My father never liked you.'Dangerfield comes out with the funniest jokes you ever heard: 'The last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it' and so many other lines that had tears in my eyes.To the folks on here who criticize the movie as being low-brow and not as sophisticated as other movies: please, spare me your high-brow condescension. I enjoy those films as much as the next guy, same with the Mel Brooks films, which are also brilliant. There are all different types of humor, different types of funny characters. 'Seinfeld' is very different from '2 1/2 men', but they are both well crafted and funny.",10,2,4,12 January 2010
Everest," I actually fell asleep during this movie
","I kept waiting for something to happen. It never did.The buildup surrounding this movie had me expecting to see a thrilling action drama with uncanny effects, and I was badly let down.The film badly failed to deliver.The characters were given no backstory and we couldn't care less about any of them.The effects were OK, but did not provide any real excitement.It's a story about a group of wealthy narcissists who put their own thrill-seeking above the needs of their families.Do yourself a favor and see The Martian instead.",1,52,101,4 October 2015
Avatar," A total disaster
","Straight to the point: The movie pretends to have a story. I don't know what Cameron has been smoking while writing this screenplay, but it's easily his worst-written movie yet.There's not one inch of character development. All characters are as clichéd as they get. Look no further than to Michelle Rodriguez, whose character is as blank as a piece of paper for the duration of the movie, before she suddenly declares right before the big battle: 'I didn't sign up for this s**t.' Now, that's good writing.Why did Cameron feel the need to rip off Aliens over and over? The design of the ships reeks of Aliens. The movements of the Navi somehow look like the movements of the titular Aliens. Rodriguez plays a B-movie version of the tough pilot from Aliens. The bad guy Paul Reiser played in Aliens was split up between Ribisi and Lang. The end fight between Lang and Saldana/Worthington/CGI creature is a reversal of the Aliens end fight between Weaver and the Alien queen.Why was it necessary to create a Navi language? The most important Navi speak English really well. At one point Tsutey has suddenly become so advanced in the English language that he is able to give a simultaneous interpretation of Sully's big speech without any effort.Why is Avatar a blatant copy of 'Dances with Wolves'? Why is Avatar's mysticism even more embarrassing than the mysticism in the Matrix sequels? Why does Cameron use the big, old sledgehammer for his embarrassingly naive sociological-political-ecological message? This movie has too much fat that a more capable writer would've cut out radically. Cameron isn't a capable writer.Forget about this piece of junk.",1,11,31,5 January 2010
Pretty Woman," Ridiculous
","Anyone who has ever seen women working the streets in person, or even in a documentary on TV, should find this film to be ridiculous. They are living a wretched existence, usually to support a drug habit or an abusive pimp or both. Nothing glamorous about it.Yet this film presents Julia Roberts as some sort of naive Girl-Scout-turned-hooker, all shiny and clean and cute and perky. Are they serious? And, yeah, right, a multi-millionaire venture capitalist is going to bed down with a street walker. Not in a million years.Just stupid, unbelievable and ridiculous. Gary Marshall, director of Lavernce and Shirley, directed this farce. It displays the same stupid unrealistic view of life.",1,13,26,29 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," A vile piece of junk
","I wish I could say anything positive about it, but I feel the responsibility to keep people, especially young folks, away from this movie. This is literally the worst movie ever. I do not understand how this movie can be entertaining in any way. The scenes are mostly disgusting and it's length could be reduced to an hour at most. The plot is a rehash.This is basically 'Good Fellas', but with Wasps instead of Mafiosi. Do whatever criminal behavior you want, steal anything you want, use as much drugs as you want, abuse as many women as you can. But, at the same time, 'Don't you think I'm cute?' 'Don't you wish you could be my friend?' Success has allowed Scorcese to amp up the debauchery to a ridiculous level. What's next for him, actual film of disembowelment? The main difference is that Goodfellas had a somewhat satisfying ending: they mostly got what they deserved, especially the guy who got shot in the head.Scorcese now appears to be repeating himself (come to think of it, the plot isn't much different than 'Gangs Of New York' either).It happens to most of the great directors: their originality runs out, the studio bosses don't rein them in because of their prior success, audiences continue to buy tickets for a while. So long, Marty, it was good while it lasted.",1,3,5,8 August 2014
The Wrestler," One of the best films ever
","This was not just one of the best films of 2008. It is one of the best films EVER.Mickey Rourke is magnificent in this film, I don't know how he could ever do better, but I am hoping he can at least equal this achievement.The parallel between the actor's life and the character's life is obvious. It just makes the film that much more striking because you believe that Mickey really feels that way about what happened in his life.The direction and camera-work is good, and the location choices are good as well. There is not a false note in this film, it is painfully honest and realistic.It's OK Mick, we forgive you and we still love you...",10,2,3,7 September 2009
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Best part about it was leaving the theatre and having dinner with my wife
","For me, a complete and total waste of money and time. We almost left about 20 minutes into this self-indulgent piece of tripe.This movie strains so hard to make itself important that it is appalling.What can be defined as the plot (and it's a stretch to call it that) is trite and a clichÃ©. The lead actor is successful but inwardly unrewarded. He has also ruined his family in search of celebrity and wealth making Hollywood action movies, which he now considers to be junk. So, he wants to redeem himself and try his hand at serious theater. Throw in a disturbed junkie daughter, a long-suffering but understanding ex wife, and a producer pulling his hair out because the play isn't a success and you've got all you need to know.The rest is a montage of hackneyed hallucinations, fake suicide red-herrings, gay kisses and naked male asses.A bunch of Academy Award hype and a monument to pretentiousness.I wish I could have those 2 hours of my life back. I hate wasting time on junk like this.Michael Keaton was trying too hard and Ed Norton was totally wasted, and the rest of the cast were stereotypical stock characters. If actors and other creative types are really so messed up, it is even more of a crime than I originally thought that we make them so rich and honor them so much.",1,11,24,1 March 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," What a piece of vile trash
","What is wrong with everyone? I see absolutely nothing of value in a movie that shows non-stop violence and horrific abuse. 99% of the abuse shown is toward children; which is incredibly disturbing. AND it is constant. The slums are horrifying. The camera pans the slums while showing adults and children being constantly abused. Children always running in fear. Throughout the whole movie you will see every kind of abuse that evil thinking can imagine.The accolades that Danny Boyle is receiving are totally beyond my logic and understanding. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, ever. I so wish I wasn't talked into seeing it. If I were in that situation again, I would definitely walk out. It was a horror to sit through. The movie definitely would turn one off to ever visiting India.",1,1,5,20 January 2010
