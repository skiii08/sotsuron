Casablanca," An Over-Rated piece of bad.
","2.5I think thats all i really need to say. Its OK, its obvious that almost all other reviews of this turd are nothing but hive-mind badtardation. A totally mediocre movie without much in the way of meaning or expression, mostly mediocrity.",2,6,13,22 June 2017
Pretty Woman," Female domination theme. Great Movie.
","An over-the-top elaborate extravaganza which pushes woman power down your throat like a roided up school bully. This is the kind of movie a woman with an extreme power complex would love, if she was straight, that is, and its a wonderful feeling. Most of the circumstances in this movie are absurd and very unlikely but it does posses a kind of class and a type of female domination theme. Great Movie.",7,0,2,22 June 2017
