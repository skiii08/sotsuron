The Perks of Being a Wallflower," PG Perky
","Finally! The Perks of Being a Wallflower was on my hit list of movies to watch but likely put on the back burner due to the predictability of coming of age films that aren't always very enticing. How can Stephen Chbosky remix the classic plot of the protagonist having to introduce his external world with his internal complexities? He doesn't but he confirms that it's not always necessary to reinvent the wheel. The writing was impressive from the outset of the movie. Chbosky does a phenomenal job at juxtaposing Charlie's best self narration to his awkward social executions. It wasn't cringe worthy but it was difficult listening to and understanding Charlie's intentions and then watch him struggle with expression. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller deliver natural performances and never let us get too confident in Charlie and his abilities to adapt. The movie evolves true to the title in that there remains incomplete advantages to being a non-participant.",8,1,2,24 September 2013
