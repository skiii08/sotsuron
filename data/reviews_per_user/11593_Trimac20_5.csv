Vertigo," A little strange...
","I must say I don't share the same high praise as the other reviews here, and I thought a little balance was needed. Not that this is a negative review of Vertigo (its not really a review as such, just a little musing), but its just that I don't think it quite deserves its title as one of the Top 100 films of all time. While I admit I have only seen the film once, that one viewing is more than enough for this type of movie.Firstly, I found the storyline a bit over-dramatised and at times confusing. While the basic plot is fairly simple, the various plot twists and turn can often one wondering where the film leaves off. For example, when the main character John 'Scotty' Ferguson (played by Stewart) meets 'Judy' who was playing 'Madelline' the whole time. The viewer is not told whether Stewart knows Judy is Madelline or not as if would seem pretty obvious they are the same person. I also don't get the end scene, how is 're-enacting' the scene supposed to cure Detective Ferguson's vertigo? But that's probably my lack of understand.In addition, the characters were often inconsistent. Why does Judy suddenly become so trusting of Det.Ferguson? In the first half of the film, there's a sense of unreality of the whole story that's quite hard to pick. As if the entire movie is a whole dream. Stewart's character of a hard-nosed detective is played out well, although he quickly becomes obsessed and paranoid later in the film. Indeed, his character is multi-layer and in many parts of the film we see a darker side to his nature. The character of 'Madeline/Judy' obvious differs from the first part preceding the 'real' Madelines death, and the second scene. In terms of technique, the movie was perhaps typical of detective type movies of the period which used music scores to add drama and suspense. I thought the score was a bit much at times, and could have just been toned down a bit. What I mean is that what was actually happening on screen was not sufficiently suspenseful to require such a soundtrack.Anyway, I'll give it 7/10 stars. Its a fascinating movie that everyone should watch, I just found the plot a little messy",Null,2,6,29 November 2004
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," uplifting in parts, but felt the plot was a bit weak
","Given the hype surrounding this I was looking forward to seeing Ben Stiller's ambitious directorial and acting opus. I found it quite inspiring (yes, I agree with some reviewers it did feel like an ad) in parts, yet I felt there was something missing about the film. His quest to search out the legendary photographer he had been working with (but never met) becoming a sort of 'finding himself' through being adventurous.etc, I don't know if it quite worked as well as it should have. I mean was it really realistic that his main motivation would be to travel all that way for a simple photograph? I just felt it could've been done better. The cinematography and acting was pretty good, I think Stiller isn't bad at dramatic roles, although I agree with some reviewers he tends to play the same character in many of his films, whether they be comedy or drama, e.g. in Meet the Parents, Along Came Polly. I kind of miss him doing his more outlandish roles like Zoolander, Dodgeball or even his bit- part in Happy Gilmore. I wasn't a big fan of Tropic Thunder btw. But yeah, I can understand the mixed reviews. Still, I found it a reasonably enjoyable film.",6,1,2,7 January 2014
Lucy," Weak, clichéd plot, stretches the bounds of plausibility
","Just saw 'Lucy'. The premise is interesting - it definitely extends beyond the realm of transhumanism into territory usually the preserve of spirituality and religion, most explicitly in the scene where Lucy and the first humanoid 'Lucy' touch fingers in an allegory to the Micheangelo fresco. It was all too easy to think of Lucy attaining god-like status, as she progresses to fully using her brain and cerebral capacities. How that works is never quite explained. Although there is a theory I came up with that brains are sort of 'receivers' of universal consciousness that ties in well with this, but in reality, I don't think using '100% of your brain' will really give you all these superhuman or superhero powers. The plot was probably the most disappointing part of the film. Beginning in Taipei, Lucy's boyfriend sets her up (presumably) with a Korean drug ring that is using people as mules smuggle in a drug (although whether they know the full capabilities of the drug is seemingly unclear) that is synethesised 'CPH4' a chemical that mother's release that stimulates bone growth in fetuses. Their goal here is not that clear. Basically another 'catch the bad guy' plot, intertwined with Lucy's (Scarlett Johansen's) evolution into some kind of superhuman and beyond. A lot of the action scenes and pseudo-science (which in itself is not a sin if properly worked out in the alternative logic of the universe) have been seen before. I'll give it 5.5/10.",5,0,9,8 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Underwhelming and a bit boring
","Saw 'The Force Awakens' yesterday and I have to say it left me...pretty underwhelmed. After six films I think I'm pretty Star Warsed out. Thematically it just seemed like a re-hash of Episodes IV and V, this new character 'Rey' being just another Luke Skywalker, a 'nobody', a scavenger on a desert-like planet that bears striking resemblance to Tatooine, who is unwittingly pulled into the whole saga by destiny. The story of the renegade Storm Trooper didn't really resonate as much as it could have. The whole relationship between Han Solo and this new villain: we've seen it before, nor did he seem very menacing to me, at all (not that I would want to be stuck in a room with him). Just like a lesser Darth Vader. As one reviewer mentioned as a stand-alone film, this seems like so many PG-13 action films we've seen. The plot was a bit predictable and clichéd at times, though the pacing wasn't too bad, but overall I didn't feel much suspense. It's like we'd seen it a hundred times before. I don't think the presence of the original three - now middle aged - really saves it. Little of the plot seems to follow much of the Star Wars post Return of the Jedi mythology that some fans might be familiar with, it just felt very disconnected. I haven't really been a Star Wars fan for years anyway, and if this is a third trilogy, I doubt I'll be watching the next if it's more of the same. Just my opinion, anyone else feel the same? Possibly, I have to say, the most lacklustre Star Wars film since the Phantom Menace actually.",5,16,23,22 December 2015
The Godfather," Epic gets caught up in itself...
","Few other films revel in their sheer pompousity as 'The Godfather.' I must say that I do not dislike this film; it is a classic and deservedly so, and still one of the best gangster movies. Its just it tends to take itself too seriously, and you can't really relate to the characters. Don Corleone is not as violent and ruthless as expected (he fails to take revenge after Sonny's death). It would have been more thrilling to watch the Godfather carry out a brutal payback executive or unparalleled brutality.The film was too slow and long for my tastes, and lacked action and suspense. The best scenes include the scene where Al Pacino has to kill an enemy of the family, near the end when Don Corleone dies and of course the memorable 'Machine-gun death' of Sonny.",Null,1,3,24 December 2004
