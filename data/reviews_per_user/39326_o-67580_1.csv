Miracle," Amazing movie with a great theme
","Miracle, in my opinion, is one of the most inspiring, intense and spine chilling movies ever made. This is a true story of the USA Olympic hockey team prevailed against all odds and beat the Soviet Union hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid New York during a rough period in the Cold War.
One of the most intriguing elements of this movie is the background sound and sound effects. They play a huge role in the making of this movie, without all of the suspenseful music the entire movie wouldn't have as much of a dramatic flare and the effect of keeping you on your toes. One of my favorite scenes, is when the head coach of the USA team, Herb Brooks, comes into the locker room and gives an amazing speech to get his team ready to play one of the greatest hockey teams in the world, has great sound effects that make this scene by far the best in the movie for example, the hiss from the blow torch that is heating up one of the players stick or when another player is taping his stick and also a different player is rapping his fingers with tape back and forth. All of these sounds create a sense of focus and determination between all of the players.
Another aspect that contributes to the movie is the photography, specifically when they are on the ice playing hockey. The zoom of the camera is very close up. At times you can't see what is going on during the game which adds some good and bad effects to the movie. I believe it gives more intense feel to it, for example when Shnieder is on a breakaway and scores to tie the game at 1, the camera is zoomed in on the stick and puck and not the entire player which creates a more profound scene that makes it so much more interesting. On the contrary during other plays of the game you cannot see the puck or what's going to happen next because of the zoomed in camera work. In the end the photography both helps and hurts the movie as a whole.
A movie that has a similar theme to Miracle is Remember The Titans. Remember The Titans is a movie about a football team that was not solid throughout and didn't start out the season as they'd hoped, but through their hard work they came out on top. In the end both teams meet their goal and beat the odds. Also Remember The Titans was created around the same time miracle was so the film quality was about the same. Similarly each team had difficulties, not the same kinds of difficulties but nevertheless both teams struggled in their own way.
The movie miracle was an inspiring and dramatic film with a great ending. I highly recommend this movie if you are in to sports of any sort or if you love a good old fashioned feel good story. Miracle is one of my favorite movies till this day and I still get chills after every goal is scored by team USA.",9,0,0,24 January 2020
