The Avengers," Finally an action movie to smash the ranks!
","I've seen the 'big names' that claimed to be crowned in this sci-fi action section (Battlefield, John Carter, Prometheus, Wrath of Gods etc.) - but to my disappointment none of them were qualified to win my personal vote, apart from this one here - The Avengers! Babyyy! It's been a long time since I haven't seen such a powerful contender! It's definitely a riot! as Transformers 1 - years back! Good choice in actors - true champions, not fakes like the Spiderman nerd! I believe every character in this new movie rises sky high along with it, even the green Hulk has my sympathy in the end, 'though it's a simple computerized toon after all! What glorious times for all these guys - they go down in the movie industry's history with this one, big time! And the best part is that it's quite amusing at the same time - I had some laughs and it's definitely the key to an enjoyable show! You have it all - especially memorable special 3D effects! Well done! That's a movie you won't get tired of so easily! It's here to last!",10,2,7,2 May 2012
