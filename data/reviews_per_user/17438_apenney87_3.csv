The Rock," Great Movie
","The Rock is a action fans dream. It has action from basically beginning to end, a never ending supply of big guns, corny Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery lines that really only they can get away with. Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the 'bad guys!' That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!",9,2,3,28 February 2013
Horrible Bosses," Fun and not expected
","With Jason Sudeikis, Jason Bateman and Charlie Day I expect three different types of movies. This movie took all of their individual talents and combined them together to make a comedy that belongs in anyone (who doesn't get offended to easily's) collection. This movie was not only fun, it was unpredictable. We knew the idea from the beginning three guys have horrible bosses they want to kill but how it's played out is what's fantastic. Another great thing about this movie is the A list celebrities who play the bosses, (Kevin Space, Colin Farrell and Jennifer Aniston) and the 'murder consultant' Jamie Foxx. Lisa Beach and Sarah Katzman did a wonderful job in choosing the roles for everyone involved in this film. Horrible Bosses was a Hilariously Raunchy film that I couldn't get enough of.",8,0,1,23 February 2013
Here Comes the Boom," Predictable family fun
","I believe that kids will really enjoy this movie, with the fun lines and the repeated fighting scenes it could easily be constant fun for them. As an adult, I thought it was a cute movie, but, Here Comes the Boom was so similar to every other 'Got to come up with a ton of money to save the school, business, house...' type movie. Kevin James puts a fantastically lovable quality into this character but it's hard to believe someone in his physical shape could ever fight MMA and walk out of the ring without broken bones or at least a body completely covered with bruises. Salma Hayek, Henry Winkler and Gary Valentine also made you route for the music clubs success. All in all, I think it was filmed well, written well and played out well. Just maybe to similar to many others like it.",7,2,3,23 February 2013
