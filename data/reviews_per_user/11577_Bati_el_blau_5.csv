The Irishman," Same story as always but less rythm

Bohemian Rhapsody," Respectful with the music itself
","When a great artist dissappears normally you'll find biopicks of tortured people, but in this case, their lives are just the context to understand and enjoy their work.Is difficult to say what are the best things on this movie because you'll find many, but they are generous with the music lovers and guive you the almost complete perfomance of Queen on the 'Live aid'.",10,1,4,1 November 2018
28 Weeks Later," Good filming bad writing
","I really enjoyed this film, very similar to the first one but with one important difference: The writing. The screenplay should been rewritten because contains lot of mistakes. I'm talking about the way the virus returns, i'ts a good idea to find somebody genetically immune to the virus, same happens with AIDS, but that woman should be under vigilance (1st mistake). The army tries to keep safe civilians with nobody at the doors of the room (2nd mistake). OK let's kill everybody to make sure the virus does not expand, but an infected doesn't drives a car (3rd mistake). They are very common mistakes in this kind of zombie films, but it's common sense to fix those things in the writing, before filming.",6,3,6,1 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star wars is burnt
","My feelings about Star wars are disappointing. I feel they have burnt this universe without giving the best of it. As well as we have seen the best comic adaptations in Marvel, in Star wars we've witness how they wasted great universe once and another time. Precuels where disgusting, and these secuels are not getting better",5,6,10,14 December 2019
