The Avengers," Review of reviews
","This isn't a 9/10 review to talk about how glorious and amazing this movie was. It's not to go off on a shpiel about how much I loved the Avengers and how I've seen it 3+ times already. I came on IMDb to see how the reviews were going and was frustrated by all the negative reviews I sought out to see what insults and injuries people could inflict upon this film because their 'higher standard of cinematic experiences' has made them 'immune' to 'idiotic, tasteless' movies like the Marvel movies. First off, the thing I keep reading that is making me rage is reviewers comparing the movie to movies that have made the top 100 movies of all time. You cannot compare a comic-based action movie with the Shawshank Redemption, Shindler's List or the Godfather. They're just not in the same ballpark. If you want a serious movie with moving characters, deep plot lines and your precious scenery, why're you going to movies like Avengers, Thor and Iron Man?Granted, The Dark Knight was also based on comic books and they actually are very moving and serious, but that's just the direction Christopher Nolan decided to take with the DC comic. It's predecessors however, were just as corny, flashy and lame as you claim Marvel to be. Not every superhero film has to be cheesy, and clich√©, but they all can't be dark and depressing like the Dark Knight either. Most of the comics put our favorite heroes and villains in a humorous light and I'm glad Avengers made me laugh more than I thought it would. I didn't want to be traumatized the whole movie like I was with Dark Knight (good traumatized, mind you).Secondly, I've been seeing the movie being compared to movies that everyone else thought were fantastic, ones that I and others I know thought were absolute garbage (i.e. X-Men: Origins, the Spider-Man trilogy, etc.) Don't be biased in your review. Don't talk down to everyone else who loved it by saying that another movie was better (and that, again, many and more regard as a waste of time), degrading your own review since people will now see what bad taste you have, therefore leading others to believe you're no one but a bitter, cynical grouch who cannot be cinematically pleased no matter what.Thirdly, seeing a movie solely based on it's reviews is just brainless. If you hate action movies, or romantic comedies, but saw that a new release got great reviews... why would you go see what you're very likely to dislike? Especially since you're biased in your opinion of the subject matter in the first place. Save your 'grudge against all mankind' for movies you actually care to waste your time on.Lastly, I'm sorry a lot of bad reviewers see those of us who loved Avengers as 'low I.Q., stupid, brainwashed idiots'. I'm sorry we don't always crave movies with nothing BUT plot, in depth characters, history and challenging puzzles to exercise our brains. Though admittedly, there ARE a lot of people out there that are like sheep with the Marvel movies that go to be entertained like an infant with keys being shaken in front of their faces. Don't speak about Marvel-lovers as a whole like that. Some of us are capable of loving all kinds of genres and movie types. Some even watched it for the sentimental value of being reminded of our childhoods; the fact that our comic book characters have been brought to life alone was enough to make us happy. I adore my cultural movies, but at one point, I just really wanted to see a bunch of robots fighting when I saw Transformers 3. I was tired of twisted, hard to follow plot. Just...wanted to see some robot brutality for a change.What makes me appreciate the Marvel movies all the more is the fact that Stan Lee is directly involved, like he always is with the movies based on his comic books. The fact that the Marvel movies get his stamp of approval makes me confident that the movie has lived up to the creator's expectations and that if he believes it portrays the worlds he has created accurately enough for his fans, then that's good enough for me.As a closing statement, Tom Hiddleston literally is a god. His performance was spectacular, phenomenal, stellar; he cut a breathtaking figure on the silver screen and I was drawn into his character the second he was birthed through the Tesseract at the beginning of the film.",9,2,6,16 May 2012
