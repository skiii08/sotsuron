Marie Antoinette," Just an expensive awful & extremely boring movie
","What a painful film to watch! The costumes and horses are great. And of course many shots of Versailles which is nice to look at even from a tourist camera. But that's all and too much of that too.I thought it was made for the younger audience but actually it's made for children. Really the worse directing I've seen in a good while and a thoughtless editing to match it. What a waste of money and resources this director has committed, not unlike the actions of the heroine it tried and failed to portray. The characters were not at all developed. The dialogue was at the level of a bad high school play. The storytelling is so blah that you wonder what's all the talk about this Marie Antoinette character about! She is so totally misrepresented and made to be so uninteresting that you really want her to be really bad to at least be there. There is too much weakness in the movie to recount without reliving the pain suffered watching it. Unfortunately I sat through the whole thing hoping that it would finally go somewhere, come to something. But that was a mistake, because watching more of the same repeated shots and scenes just makes them more painful and boring. Take my word, don't waste your time. If you really want to see it for curiosity, wait for the DVD so that you can fast forward or eject.",1,37,71,7 June 2006
