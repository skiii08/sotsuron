Requiem for a Dream," put my faith back in american cinema
","that was the only thing that i could think for hours after viewing requiem. it is the most powerful and potent film that i have seen in years. the level of a clockwork orange without the sense of 'this is happening elsewhere.' requiem is happening here and now.with the exception of a few films like fight club american cinema on the whole is releasing empty films compared with our european counterparts. i'll take any 12 minute jean-luc godard film to most any american feature out there. even the supposed american, u.s. 'avant-garde' is letting me down. however i need to give kudos to canada for making some true(ly interesting) films. i just hope that those directors find a place like artisan to do their dirty work and not let hollywood eat them whole (scratch that miramax).",10,0,0,29 October 2000
