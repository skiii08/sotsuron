Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Unimpressive, 'safe' humor
","This film isn't as controversial as people seem to think it is. After all, the only group of people it's actually mocking are white, southern Christians-the only group of people it is politically correct to mock. And as for how unfriendly Americans are, well, what would you do if some insane guy with a false accent  who claimed to believe in rape walked  up to you and tried to kiss you? And the contrast between the black prostitute and southern dinner party was ridiculous. The southerners were actually being extremely open minded considering his behavior, up until the point where Borat tried to give them a bag full of his excrement and invited a prostitute into their home unannounced. And he didn't insult the prostitute, show her nude photos of his son, and hand her a bag full of poop, either. He took her out to the fair, bought her lunch, and brought her home. Obviously, she would act more welcoming than the people at the dinner party. And as for the frat boys, yes they were stupid. But did you really expect more from drunk frat boys? No revelation there. And the gay parade, notice how none of them were filmed speaking? That's because I doubt they were really that much better than the other people being filmed in this movie. To my knowledge, dancing with a total stranger, touching their dick, and going home with them to have sex, along with several other people, does not make you 'nice,' so I am left wondering why people seem so impressed by the 'openness' of the gay pride group. Overall, the whole thing feels very contrived. I'm not offended or shocked, just rather unimpressed and wondering why this movie is such a big deal. Really, the only feeling it invoked in me was pity for the unwitting people 'borat' duped. I am giving this three stars, because the ridiculous portrayal of Borat's home village in the beginning was a bit funny.",3,0,1,12 February 2013
Titanic," Haunting
","I don't even know how to explain how this movie affected me. Normally I am not a fan of either Kate winslett or Leonardo Dicaprio. But I can't image anyone else for the parts they played. except for the beginning, the entire movie takes place on the ship. It's like this beautiful, timeless little universe, apart from the rest of the world. The costumes were beautiful, and the ship itself was perfectly done. And you feel such a sense of loss when it's over. It really makes you realize what a tragedy it was, in a way that few movies can. It feels like there is nothing in the world except the ship, and the fact that you know whats coming makes it all the more bittersweet. The scenes of the older couple, the young mother, and old rose throwing the necklace into the ocean, and what come after that, especially made me break down.",10,2,3,11 November 2012
