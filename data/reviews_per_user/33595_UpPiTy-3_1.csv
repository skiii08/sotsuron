The Blair Witch Project," it sucked
","OK so my summary isn't all together true, but I'm a smart arse so bare with me. Most of the reviews I've read here on imdb have been negative, but with something this successful you have expect the inebidible(is that how you spell it? who cares?)backlash. Now moving along to what I think. It was a good movie but not brilliant or all that original and if you do think its a really great movie give the credit to the actors who made up the dialog as they went along and also filmed everything. I guess the 'film makers' just came up with a weak plot outline, handed it over to the actors, and went and took a nap. I heard Roger(Don't Ask Where My Other Thumb Is)Ebert say that the stick symbols in the woods looked like they were really made by witches, when in actuality they looked like they were made by my 6 year old brother in art class. It wasn't so much a scary movie as it was bewildering with all the friggin jiggly camera movement deafening screaming. I guess some people mistake nausea for fright. Even with its flaws its still much better than all the recent teen slasher flicks a`la Scream and all its clones. Lets just ban teen flicks all together shall we? These are my opinions and I am absolutely correct.  piece(_!_)I'm outta here",Null,0,1,13 August 1999
