Skyfall," True delight for true James Bond fans
","When I watched Casino Royale or even Quantum of Solace although the movie was good I always missed the old Bond and wished if the old traditions were followed the movie would have been even better. When Casino Royale was released the transition for Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig itself was not digestible. I mean the movie was great but again old ways were missing. Watched Skyfall, I wasn't expecting much from this movie apart from a good story or stunning action sequences. And I was surprised. There was a whole lot more in this movie than what I was expecting. And yes the Old Bond returns. If you are a true Bond Fan then movie will blow your mind. All I can say is If you love Bond-Babes-Britain then here is a treat for you.",10,3,19,7 November 2012
