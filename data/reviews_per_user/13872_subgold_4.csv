Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," meaningless
","As far as a movie is concerned, it has no point. Exaggeration is important in a comedy, but it is supposed to be based on real stuff, not bluffing. Most of the description about Kazakhstan is evidently untrue, which makes it a tacky political satire. And the film is also absolutely not about culture collision, which I thought it would be before I saw it. I don't see anything but the idea of 'we are civilized people, these are barbarians, so let's look how zanily they behave!' By the way, it's neither decent nor hilarious making fun of people who happen to be isolated from the entire modern world. Their ignorance is not their own fault. Sarcasm on them is just like laughing at retards and cripples.I cannot believe the script is created by a Cambridge graduate and this movie is rated 8 here.",1,30,59,10 December 2006
The Usual Suspects," Don't take two hours out of your life and waste on this total screw-up
","Before I watched the movie, I've read many comments comparing 'The Usual Suspects' with 'L.A. Confidential', which concluded that this one is even better. So I held an eminent anticipation on it. But two hours later, I just could not understand why this nonsense got so much higher votes and evaluation than 'L.A. Confidential'.I'm saying this, not because of the labels people usually will put on this movie: confusing, twisted and so on. Actually, I don't think the plot is hard to comprehend. To be honest, I figured out who Kaiser is just at the very beginning. It was so obvious.The reason is, many fabulous elements in 'L.A. Confidential', or should I say, a successful movie, are missing. First of all, the most important thing: the vivid sculpture of the characters. From 'L.A. Confidential', we remember the three young cops, the evil captain, the gorgeous hooker, the sly and sneaky little old news reporter So many impressive roles there. But what is in 'The Usual Suspects'? I feel sorry to say, nothing. Maybe Kevin Spacey's performance can be a little compensation, but not enough at all.Second of all, the conflict. In 'L.A. Confidential', conflicts are everywhere, between justice and crime, between righteousness and personal career, between love and cheat, between different parts or even in the deep soul of one part. While in 'The Usual Suspects', without these conflicts, the movie is not dramatic and attractive but cadaverous and boring.The third one, ambiance. In 'L.A. Confidential', I can sense the emotion the director planed to deliver to us. Sometimes intensive, sometimes thrilling, sometimes dangerous, sometimes love-filling, sometimes nervous, sometimes horrifying.Well, when I watched this one, I almost fell asleep in the middle.I don't think we need a fourth reason to prove this crap. I hate these plays which consider themselves intelligent and tricky enough to make up some mendacious tales to bluff the audience, and turn out to be so stupid and fake. There is always a wire-puller in such movies, who seems to be omnipotent and can do whatever he wants, conniving some brilliant schemes. But finally these schemes are always deliberately mystifying and illogical. I prefer real and organized films like 'L.A. Confidential'. You know, we audience are also smart.",1,24,50,5 November 2005
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Great cinematography, average acting, terrible storytelling
","I like the soothing but mysterious and sometimes spooky feeling that brought by the excellent cinematography. The acting is alright. Nonetheless, I have some problems about the storytelling.In most of the runtime of the movie, Jesse James is portrayed as a bandit who is highly wanted by the government by substantive rewards, who commits lots of robberies and murders, beats up armless train attendant, works over a young innocent kid, puts extreme mental and psychological pressure on his fellow gang members, kills people he is suspicious of although he has no firm evidence. All in all, he looks like a cruel tyrannical ruffian (except to his family). However, in the last ten minutes of the movie, after his assassination, out of the blue, he turns out to be a real hero, worshiped by the entire country, and his assassinator becomes the worst man in the world disgusted by every single individual.This just doesn't make sense, especially to those who have never heard about the story of Jesse James ever before (like me). It is OK for the director to have his own point of view (obviously as written in the movie title), but it is not supposed to be suddenly indoctrinated to the audience in the last ten minutes of the movie without any proof previously shown in the movie. To me, this movie looks like a report of the psychological interaction between Jesse and his gang members, and Robert's assassination is just a natural instinct of human being. The movie doesn't at all convince me that he is a coward.Besides, I have a pet peeve of too much narrative in a movie. I know it is a personal thing, but at least it manifests the director's incapability of the exhibiting some complex plot line, subtle emotion of the character, and so on. It is just a shortcut to avoid further thinking of a smarter way to organize the movie.",4,3,10,25 February 2008
The Departed," excessive adaption
","Since I saw the Hong Kong movie 'Infernal Affair' first, I cannot help comparing this remade version with the original one.'Infernal Affair' is a superbly intelligent movie. It is actually not telling a mafia story, it is about the conflict, compromise and confusion of living in somebody else's life, how people want to escape such a life but can't due to some objective and subjective motives.If the original work is already outstanding, the point of the remaking should be showing some different perspective on those outstanding parts. Unfortunately, this time 'The Departed' went exactly the opposite of that direction.'The Departed' hasn't closely and concretely portrayed the innermost struggle of the two moles, and how arduously and awkwardly they interact with the exterior world, especially for Matt Damon's role. This is the reason why many plots and behaviors of the characters make no sense. What even worse is, the most memorable, sensational scenes are still inherited from the original movie, Scorsese barely created any improvements.Scorsese abandoned the beauty of the original work and concentrated too much on the details of the gangsters and cops' business, which makes it a mediocre mafia film. How their tasks are conspired and operated, how their transactions are dealt, how the boss cultivates his jackal, these typical Hollywood scenarios are not supposed to be the focus of this film.Those, who think this movie is much better than the original version, certainly don't have a deep comprehension of the culture in the Far East countries. Since Hollywood now is going through an era of running out of the neat and innovate ideas, it's only fair to introduce some great foreign language films from other regions by remaking them and earn a hell lot box office. But please at least do some homework beforehand, to thoroughly understand an artistic work from a completely different culture and background. Don't make everything too 'Hollywood'.",4,0,3,30 December 2006
