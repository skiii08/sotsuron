Marie Antoinette," so many shoes!...but considerably less story
","Director Sofia Coppola certainly didn't scrimp on the visuals in this movie. The costumes and the settings are sumptuous, and, being secretly a girl who loves fancy fluffy dresses and dainty shoes and all that crap, I was definitely taken with the decadence of this film. It's a great movie for getting tipsy and eating cake with the girlfriends, but I'm afraid as far as the actual story goes, there is something lacking.While careful attention was indeed applied to the visual aspect of the film, most notably in a 'fantasy' scene, where Marie Antoinette, in the black lipstick of an evil queen, utters the notorious 'Let them eat cake' line, and in some of the scenery at her country home, not as much attention was paid to the structure of the story. The movie centers on Marie's adjustment to her new home in a foreign country, and her naivety, the latter causing her to spend lavishly while her new subjects starve. The main problem, however, is that Coppola assumes you already know the story of the French Revolution and the final fates of the royal family--none of which is shown in the film. The angry mob that confronts the royal family at Versailles comes seemingly out of nowhere. More attention to the country's affairs would have helped the plot seem more complete.Marie's innocence to the poverty and civil unrest is also somewhat dubious. You'd think she'd have SOME idea of what was going on around her, even if she maybe wasn't completely on top of things. It's ultimately a movie about a girl who just wanted to have fun, a feature-length excuse for indulgence, and Marie is shown as the epitome of the poor little rich girl.",5,0,0,18 February 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," twisted and beautiful
","So I've met a lot of people who have complained that this movie utilizes clich√©s, like it's raining whenever something bad is going to happen. And I really can't stand this because first and foremost, this movie is essentially a fairy tale, and fairy tales use devices like this. It's also definitely not a children's movie at all. The R rating should be a clue.I loved this movie. The effects were amazing, and luckily, used in moderation. They were also some of the most imaginative I've seen in a long time. It was at once incredibly beautiful and incredibly terrifying. I saw this in theaters and spent a good deal hiding in my boyfriend's jacket. If any movie can capture the wonder as well as the darkness of childhood, it's this one. It does not shy away from the fact that children are not all silliness and smiles--Ofelia is from the start a deeply tragic child, telling her unborn brother the saddest of fairy tales. I guess that was sort of one of the other themes of the movie--that children are just as affected, if not more so, by their surroundings than adults are, even though many adults don't realize it. Ofelia's mother, for example, is always telling Ofelia to smile, to tell happy stories, even though it is quite clear that Ofelia doesn't have much to be happy about.My only issue was the villainous nature of Captain Vidal, who seemed almost cartoonish in his brutality. But, then again, I suppose that goes with the fairy-tale quality of the film. (Interestingly, it's a wicked stepfather instead of a stepmother)In this tale, he is a fascist bloated with victory after the Spanish Civil War, and so the movie takes a slightly political turn as well.I would not recommend this movie for the weak of heart, or for those looking for something life-affirming and cheery. But if you're looking to have your breath taken away, see it.",9,1,3,5 June 2007
The Doors," Heavy handed, to say the least
","I have to admit that, not being a particularly huge Oliver Stone fan, I went into this movie with a certain amount of skepticism. I will also admit that this was one of those movies that I rented because I knew it ended morbidly. As far as biopics go, it's pretty typical--sex, drugs, rock and roll, all the usual things people like to experience vicariously, all executed with Stone's characteristically leaden hand. There were scenes I fast-forwarded. There are some (very) prolonged acid-trip scenes, and the only thing they made me realize is that Oliver Stone has never dropped acid. There is, for the most part, very little character development, with Jim Morrison portrayed as the drug-addled, misunderstood and frankly quite annoying visionary, his girlfriend as your standard nagging wife figure who holds back said visionary, and the other three Doors members as, well, totally interchangeable and expendable. I just couldn't admire the character of Jim at all, I think his portrayal could have been handled a lot better; he could have been made into a much more well-developed, sympathetic and admirable guy instead of the spoiled, egotistical moron that Stone favored. And that's not saying I'm not a Doors fan. I am. All I'm saying is that if the portrayal is true to life at all, Jim Morrison may have survived a little longer if there had been someone sensible to punch him in the mouth from time to time.",5,1,3,17 July 2007
300," xenophobia the movie!!!!
","So, this is a first for me: I am actually writing this review as I am watching the movie. I've never done that before. Usually, I take time to mull a movie over, to weigh its pros and cons, etc., but 300 leaves little for me to ponder. My boyfriend interprets this movie as a joke in and of itself, and I suppose he's right. You'd almost think it has to be a spoof of itself. Actually, I have to give this film a lot of credit. I have never, in my life, seen a movie simultaneously insult women, homosexuals, intellectuals, genderqueer folk, people who question authority, people with dark complexions, people who don't support war, foreigners (particularly those of Middle Eastern descent), and, most bizarrely, people with facial piercings. It's really quite amazing. Almost breathtaking. As the movie progresses, I find myself adding more groups of people to the list above.Now, yes, I know I can't help but take this silly movie a bit to heart, but, given the current political climate, I can't help but notice some not-particularly-subtle nationalism. I think the word 'insidious' is probably the best way to describe it, and 'propaganda' would not be inappropriate. Oh, but some say, it's based on a comic that was written prior to the events of today. I can't speak for the graphic novel, having never read it, but to separate this film from current events is nearly impossible. The mere presence of the phrase 'Freedom is not free' is enough to turn the movie into something of a recruitment video, along with the decision to release this movie in 2006, when support for other Middle Eastern campaigns is faltering. Possibly the most questionable is the obvious numerous phobias that abound--the villains are foreign, of different races than our leather-Speedo-clad heroes, they wear jewelry and makeup, their war animals are 'exotic' (elephants and rhinos), and the disfigured are continuously portrayed as evil, soulless and better off dead. Apparently, only the robustly beautiful and Caucasian are fit to be called valiant.Political and social reasons aside, the movie was fairly predictable, with lots of manly yelling and glistening pectorals, 'surprise' ambushes anyone in the audience can see a mile off, solemn intonations, and one very weird and uncomfortable blue-lit epic sex scene. The film retains its two final stars for the choreography (mildly entertaining, though not as original as I think the filmmakers hoped it to be) and some of the imagery (mostly CGI, not as good as Sin City's), and the surprisingly strong character of the Spartan queen, Gorgo (which, oddly enough, is also the name of a very cheesy English monster picture from the sixties. It was better than 300.), though that isn't to say the Gorgo character is a particularly enlightened portrayal. So, if you see it, try to laugh and don't take it as seriously as it takes itself, but I don't think that's possible.",2,2,4,17 August 2007
