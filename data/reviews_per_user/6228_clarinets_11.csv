The Sound of Music," One of the greatest musicals of all time!
","My parents rarely let me stay up late when I was a child, except for when 'The Sound of Music' was playing on television.  My brothers and I thrilled to the music, singing along, and enjoying late night treats.These were happy, nostalgic days, days which I remember happily as I now watch this in DVD format along with my own children, hopefully providing them with good memories of staying in on rainy days.We all know the story: Young flighty nun Maria (Julie Andrews, with a zest for life, has trouble fitting in the abbey, so she's sent to be a governess for the children Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer).Maria is the first governess who treats the children with love, and lets them learn lessons in a more natural way, and encourages them to sing and play and be children, in contrast to the strict, regimented way their father had taken to raising them since the death of his wife.This wonderful nature causes Captain to fall in love with Maria, and break off his engagement to Baroness Schraeder.  As a family, they must struggle to escape, as Capt. Von Trapp has been ordered to join the third reich.While the story is loosely based on the true story of the von Trapp family, what I enjoy most of this is the musical numbers.  I find some of the actual artistic license to be a bit corny, but it is a musical, so just sit back and enjoy.",10,1,7,5 July 2002
The Notebook," Beautiful love story
","At first I was slightly hesitant to see this film because I had seen 'Message in a Bottle' (also based on a Nicholas Sparks novel), and I thoroughly disliked it.However, I was in the mood for something romantic and decided to see it.  I was instantly absorbed in the story.The story begins with an elderly woman being visited by a man who starts reading to her.  The story is about two lovers, Noah and Allie, who meet during the summer and fall in love.  When they are separated, Noah writes to Allie every day, but the letters are intercepted by Allie's mother, who disapproves of Noah because of social status.  Noah gives up after a year and tries to move on with his life.  Later on, however, circumstances cause them to meet again and re-kindle their romance.This movie is a very good story about the staying power of true love, despite the obstacles which may try to tear it apart.  Noah and Allie work very hard to make their relationship work, and make choices to be true to their love, despite what others speculate about it.The ending is truly beautiful, if a bit unreal, but the whole romance is very watchable.  There was not a dry eye in the theatre when the movie was over.",9,0,0,1 July 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Editing blooper
","In the scene where Benjamin Barry (McConaughey) takes Andie Anderson (Hudson) back to his place, and they're starting to kiss and alternately say 'We're going too fast', notice Kate Hudson's real-life wedding rings get worn on different hands in the same scene.  I thought it was cute.As for the movie itself, I've seen FAR worse romantic comedies recently (Two Weeks Notice, or Maid in Manhattan, anyone?).  ALL 'genre' movies follow a formula, from action, to science fiction, etc.  So, that part of any romantic comedy I basically ignore in my criticism of it.  They're all pretty much the same, to me.This movie is funny and my favorite sequence was when Ben takes Andie to Staten Island to 'meet the family'.  I give this movie a 6/10.  It was not a super movie, but I enjoyed myself watching it.  I may get the DVD if they don't try to sell it to me for thirty bucks.",Null,0,0,21 March 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Cute Romantic Comedy
","I really enjoy this movie.  We first see 32 year old Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)at her mother's annual turkey curry buffet.  We see some of the main people in her life, her parents, her 'uncle' Jeffrey (How many of us have had an 'uncle Jeffrey in our lives that we've had to endure, because it's just 'harmless fun', raise your hand), and Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth), a divorced lawyer who his and Bridget's parents are trying to get together.Unfortunately, their first meeting gets off on the wrong foot, and Bridget spends that night drinking herself silly, alone in her apartment, listening and air-voicing to 'All by Myself'.  However, she decides to keep a diary. In her first entry she resolves to find a good man, and avoid her attractive boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).However, he starts making suggestive sexual innuendos to her, and, enjoying the attention, she starts dressing in a miniskirt and see-through top, and passing silly, flirtatious e-mails back and forth. She seeks advice from her 3 best friends on how to handle this. This sequence events leads to a purely sexual relationship between Daniel and Bridget, although Bridget is a bit too naive and insecure to really see this.We learn that Daniel and Mark are archenemies due to some events in the past which led to Mark's wife leaving him.  Also, because Mark and Bridget often travel in the same circles, we do learn that Mark's opinion of Bridget has quickly changed.  From the look on his face, it's easy to see that he now likes her (Hmmm shades of Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice)Anyay, Bridget eventually catches Daniel with another woman, and once again she is alone, and decides to seek another job as a television reporter. Mark rescues Bridget from being canned from her job, by allowing her an interview with people he was defending in a high profile case.  After this Bridget tries to cook a dinner for her 3 best friends and Mark shows up and is able to show his feelings for her.  Daniel also shows up, and he and Mark wind up in a hilarious fight sequence over Bridget.While we are supposed to root for Mark to win Bridget, (I did), I was bothered by one thing.  Bridget was the one he wanted, but he was too spineless to break up his romantic involvement with Natasha, his law partner.  He even let it get to the point of the two of them becoming engaged before the predictable ending.  You could tell, everytime Natasha snapped her fingers and said 'Come on, Mark', that he was kind of sheepishly following her.I saw one review here that criticized Mark's saying 'You are a bad public speaker, you tend to run off at the mouth, but I like you just the way you are.'  I like that honesty, and I like being unafraid to let myself show to someone I like, and still have acceptance.  I'd rather have that, than someone blowing false sunshine in my face.All in all, I gave the movie an 8/10, would have been a 9, had it not been for Mark's attitude of 'settling' when he thought he couldn't have Bridget.",8,0,0,15 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Inspired me to read the books!
","Reading Tolkien's series was always something I would 'get around to'. This movie, and it's sequel 'The Two Towers' inspired me to buy myself the books with some Christmas money I received.  I have been reading several pages of the book a day (It's a 1000 page volume) and am enjoying it as much as the movie.The movie is beautiful, but 3 hours is not nearly enough time to capture all the detail in the book.  It is a mere sketch by comparison.The scenery is beautiful, the adventure and acting are incredible.  I watch it over and over again, and I see something new each time.",10,1,2,29 October 2003
The Princess Bride," Not a single imperfect scene!
","I originally saw this movie in 1987 when it first came out.  Since having children, this was one of the first DVDs I bought for the entire family's entertainment.  None of us are tired of watching this movie even though we have lost count of the number of times we've viewed it.Every segment of the movie is well done.  The adventure, romance, and comedy are clean.It's hard for me to say which scene I liked the best, but 'The Battle of Wits' comes to mind if I must pick only one.  Also the scene with Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his wife.I am very thrilled to see this movie as #88 in the top 250.  It definitely deserves to be as well-loved as it apparently is.",10,1,2,29 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," What can I say....
","The movie is incredible.  The acting is incredible.  The scenery, incredible.  The romance and battle scenes are wonderful, and the gollum/smeagol character is brought more to light in this one.  The last scenes between Sam Gamgee and Frodo moved me to tears.My only regret was that the movie is over 3 hours long.  When it was in theaters I kept trying to find time to see it, but it was on at such weird hours, either requiring me to see it as a matinee or late late late, neither of which I was able to at the time.Go out and get the DVD, you will not regret it.  It's a movie I want to watch over and over again.Like I said in my review for FOTR, this series has inspired me to read the book, and both are very special for their own reasons.",10,1,1,29 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the prequels... but ....
","My criticisms are this: - Anakin's relatively quick descent into the dark side, and naivet√© despite his intense Jedi Training since childhood from Obi Wan.<ul><li>The cheesiness and overly serious romance (The Carrie Fisher/Harrison Ford romance of the 80s is, admittedly difficult to top). Starting in Attack of the clones, and continuing on in this movie, there were never any really memorable laugh out loud lines and humorous scenes between Portman and Christensen. The romance was very mediocre.</li></ul>Anakin: gazing dreamily at his wife - 'You're so beautiful'. Padme: 'Only because of the love in my heart'I had to stifle a laugh.Anakin (Hayden Christensen) played the role quite well, however, and the looks on his face completely showed his emotion. It just seemed so comical that he's revealing Palpatine and the fact that HE is the Sith, supposedly being disgusted by it, and then one minute later calling him 'my master'.But the scene stealer every time, in my opinion was that of Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan. The night before my family and I saw this movie we re-watched Star Wars IV (A New Hope), and the voice of Obi Wan was very good, and the physical resemblance to Alec Guinness was believable. The emotion was very moving.The Light Saber scenes were well choreographed.",1,2,5,4 June 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," No good thing ever dies...
","I never got the chance to see this when it was in the theaters.  I bought this DVD when I saw it on sale at a music store, keeping in mind its place in the imdb top 250.  Now that I have the DVD, I've seen it a number of times, each time not being my last.As to whether this movie 'should have' won the Oscar for best picture, my opinion is not firm on that.  In many ways I really do wish TSR had won, but I do love both movies (Forrest Gump, and this one) each in their own right. They are two entirely different movies, each well done, and moving for their own reasons.In 'The Shawshank Redemption', Tim Robbins gives a breathtaking performance as Andy Dufresne, a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time, leading to his wrongful conviction of the death of his wife and her lover.  He gets two life sentences, back to back, to be served at the Shawshank prison.It is there that he meets Red (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who has been at Shawshank for much longer and has establish status as 'a man who can get things'.  Through his friendship with Red, and his experience as a banker, he gains the respect of the corrupt prison guards, and the other inmates, and manages to be rid of the abuse he was enduring at the hands of two 'sisters'.  He also works very hard to build the best prison library in the country, and help illiterate men get their high school diploma.My favorite scene is the one where everyone stopped what they were doing and stood transfixed as they listened to the beautiful sounds of a Mozart opera. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  I also like the 'Beer on the Roof' scene, but the Mozart segment is the one that will always be among my favorites.",10,0,0,5 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Wow!
","I don't know what I can say about this movie that has not already been said. This movie was very profound, and one that I look forward to seeing again many times at the theatres, and owning the DVD.It's an incredible story of adventure, fantasy, and love.  It's a perfect climactic ending to a story told in three parts.10/10",10,0,1,23 December 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Incredible movie, best soundtrack ever!
","This movie is an incredible blend of Homer's 'Odyssey', and a very creative story.  The music is beyond compare of any movie put out that year.  The cast is incredible.Three inmates break out of a chain gang to seek a treasure.  In running, they encounter all kinds of adventures: An old man who prophesies that they'll get treasure, but not that which they seek, 2 of the fugitives 'get saved', and they meet a guitarist who helps them become a hit band.I can't think of a single thing wrong with this movie.The DVD version includes a video of 'Man of Constant Sorrow', one of the incredible songs on this movie, but you'll want to view this over and over again, and hear all the music and see the adventure again and again.",10,1,2,12 July 2002
