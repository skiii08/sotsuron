Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More than just a second part
","This movie has everything that first part didn't have. More dialogues, a lot if hidden details, outstanding characters. I consider this movie as a perfect sequel, that brings a lot to the story.",9,0,0,14 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Incredibly stylish
","I had never seen such cartoonish blood (is it even a real thing?) in movies before. Plot is good, cinematography is great, music and fight scenes are gorgerous - what else is needed? One of the best entertaining movies for me.",9,0,0,14 April 2020
