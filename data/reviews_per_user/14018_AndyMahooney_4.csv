The Lobster," A Missed Opportunity
","Collin Farrell knows exactly how to deliver his lines (with a satisfying native Irish accent) in The Lobster. Writer/Director Ygoros Lanthimos must've been giddy behind the camera, as his world of strangeness and deadpan humor was captured. A very promising future is set for the both of them. (See: The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Also see: my coming critique.) It's very refreshing to get a tone of weird, absurdest humor out of otherwise dull language. The way he writes his dialogue in repetitive, robotic flow makes for an intriguing study of the human condition. This is the movie's strongest aspect. Unfortunately, it becomes exhaustive and stretched well passed its welcoming universe. About the halfway mark, we leave the setting that promised obscure and terrifying things to take place, and instead the writer seems to go out of his way to make a more structured message on love. You will find such a message, but it's beaten and kicked to death, leaving the viewer a bit insulted that no confidence was held in him earlier to find it himself.Strange and uncomfortable movies are what I get most revved up about and this certainly had that charm, albeit for a shorter time than its 2 hour running. What really upsets me and irks is the useless interfacing between pointless characters
and a reaching climax that rehashes themes attempting to really hone in the message. In my opinion, Farrel, the dark hotel of lonliness and the animal conversion machine could have been cultivated toward a truly shocking 
twist and utter devastation that would have shaken the audience. Instead, its interesting rhythm fizzles, and we're left with what feels like a pretentious artist sticking with the flat-line tone he should have shed in the second act.",6,0,2,11 May 2018
Rocketman," Too Much Razzle Dazzle
","Something in me yearns to connect with Elton John; he seems like a totally nice guy. And Egerton portrays his outbursts and saddening addictions very thoughtfully. But there's something to be desired of this spectacle. Interesting dynamics involving family issues and personal life get glossed over too frequently in exchange for the grand splendor of musical performance.As a precocious child, Elton eases his way into a prestigious music academy and then we get a musical number to launch us into his young adult years. At the pinnacle and turning point of his career, he is nervous to perform in front of a packed house. Members which include a few of the Beach Boys and we are told earlier that 'Neil Young was here last week.' We relate to his fears and sympathize with the possibility of screwing up big time. The pressure is tangible and it's a great moment when he casts it aside and starts belting out some tunes. He becomes a star.His life becomes superfluous and carefree. It seems too good to be true. Then it is. 'It is a shame, choosing the route where you will get no true love.' His mother's words after his confession as a homosexual. Their relationship seems arbitrary and strange, while the father completely insults and disowns him. When his mother says this, his manager and lover also detaches, and then Elton disconnects with his world and falls into dismay. This world full of music, always a part of him, now forced in his face and he gets quite lonely. Do the drugs and alcohol fuel a sulking to feed into his loner profile? Does it feel good to cast aside everyone, declaring himself one of a kind? Is he creating a problem to have some fun? Maybe this was all too easy for him. When the thirst for success dwindles, and there is no one to connect with, you will turn to drugs and alcohol.And then it gets strange. When a metaphor in film works, it is like a light bulb in the head and resounds human emotions. A feeling of connection to the author and viewer. But we are fed so many and such big stage shows, we have whiplash. Someone mentioned here that this is what the film is: a musical displaying and not telling of his life. A film is visual medium and will be treated with some eye candy. But as humans, and this being a biopic, more thought could have gone a long long way into building tension so those extravagant scenes held more meaning, more truthfulness. Blasting him into space with rockets attached to his feet literally made me wince and I felt I needed some air. Perhaps a simple conversation would have sufficed.",7,3,5,4 June 2019
Baby Driver," That's my Baby.
","A red Subaru rolls into frame. Vivacious guitar riffs and drumbeats dictate camera cuts, alternating between the four characters within the vehicle. The three that exit are bank robbers, about to perform their rightful duty. The driver stays with the car. With sunglasses and earbuds intact, he begins to lip-sync coolly to the track that blares with immense energy. Soon, that sweet engine revs and we do not stop drifting, baby. During a movie, it is easy to disconnect and greet the monologue inside your own head. Baby Driver does not give you time to do this. It is so well paced that its two- hour run time breezes by. Upon my second viewing, I could not believe how fast one scene fell into the other. A cool rhythm propels the film (not just the rhythm from the expertly selected soundtrack). The quirky undertone and blending genre elements feel fresh and inventive. For example, when you're nicely tucked into the tender romance- BAM- uncomfortable anxiety-consuming situation ensues. Conversely, feeling overwhelmed by too much suspense? SHAZAM: very funny joke pulled from thin air. Edgar does not want you to be bored, not for a moment; he cares about us- it is very nice. Let us talk technicality. The camera is always moving; fluidity moves a scene along. Whether intensifying a car chase, or adding sincere style to the creation of a sandwich, Edgar Wright knows a camera. Pay close attention to the scene after the title screen- feels like a continuous shot. (His idiosyncratic close-up quick zooms are also present, albeit restrained compared to his other films.)It is not often an action movie- let alone any movie- has this much to offer. A car chase heist thriller wrapped in a comedy with romance on top. All clich√©s are steered clear of. It is fun, engaging, unpredictable and purely thrilling. Not one to miss. When to go to the bathroom: The driver enters a room and bubbles are being blown. You have around a minute and a half until important information is revealed.",10,8,14,5 July 2017
Atonement," Keira Knightley is My Gal
","Bright sun bounces beautifully off Keira Knightley, convinced yet? As she chats to McCavoy sassily- not without delightful teasing- I say to myself, 'Okay, a love story'. This film has much more on its mind than the happy lives of two pretty lovers. 
One (innocent?) lie and Jame's wonderful romance and whole life deteriorates. Such strong emotion only cultivated with years of British plays! You are really rooting for a happy ending love story and it kills you they aren't together- which is most of the film. The story is refreshingly clean of cliches framed in a war era which cinematographer plays around with some impressive results. (a Dunkirk gritty continuous shot is done with great sympathy and care.) McCavoy climbs the biggest hurdles and we see more of him, reminiscing about Knightley and seemingly bringing her on screen. Lighting is great and a soundtrack that's heartbreaking, a tragic love story with twists and turns and turning my upset tummy thinking about all that can go wrong- just like my relationship with women.",9,0,0,22 March 2018
