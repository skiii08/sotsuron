Skyfall," License to Thrill
","The end of a 'trilogy' of James Bond's rise to prominence as MI6's most able and deadly spy in its organisation, Skyfall provides what its two predecessors could not fathom, not only presenting an original plot and context to stand itself as against all Bond films, but fusions this with the traditional hallmarks accustomed to a 007 film, carrying with its modern visage of action and surrealism, with wit, charm, character, and other attributes that go with the territory of James Bond.Quintessential James Bond at its finest, well deserved of its accolades and fortune, and its place amongst the better films of this five decade spanning franchise.",9,3,8,16 October 2013
