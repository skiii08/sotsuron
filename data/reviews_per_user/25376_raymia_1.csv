The Ring," wonderful psycho- horror
","While it may not be perfect in all senses, The Ring is definently the brainy horror of the year.  Using hardly any (if any...?) gore or blood this film can make you shiver with things you never even thought could be scary. Not to mention the wonderful special effects and make-up artist really outdid himself.  This movie stays with you long after you leave the theater.",10,0,0,21 October 2002
