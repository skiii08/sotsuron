The New World," Awful movie
","This was a mind numbing very uneventful boring film with a few historical inaccuracies i would not recommend this film to any one at all it portray the Native Americans as stupid uncultured and sometimes savage people which is untrue and also there many long winded shots of just vegetation , also the battle scenes are some what dubious where the Native Americans attack the fought and even manage to get in and if that were true the settlement would have failed which it did not and this was due to the fact the Native Americans helped the settlers in the early years and with out this help the settlement would have failed. I was hoping for a enlightening film about the early days of America and the difficulties that both Native Americans and Europeans a like would have faced but instead received 2 hours of frustration and boredom",1,0,1,6 March 2012
