Hereditary," 80/20 Rule Applies
","I'll keep this simple for us:
<ul><li>The 1st 80% of the movie is very well done and interesting. The Characters are very interesting and the pace is fair (don't listen to the ignorants about pacing).</li><li>The negative reviews being 'boring' come from the 80% of the population that now is trained to want fast paced 'Paranormal Activity' style jump scare BS.</li><li>The last &lt;20% of the movie is a let down to me because it was rished. After a great build-up that could go either pyscho or paranormal, the director rushed down a cheap Exorcist inspired low budget scare muse that ends in teh devil worshiping theme I never found scary</li></ul>This isn't bad, but if you can only watch one scary movie and you don't want it to be a commercial dumpster fire like the Nun, watch GHOST STORIES instead - thank me later.",6,2,5,5 November 2018
The Irishman," Waaay too long (even for Scorcese)
","What was the point of making his daughter a recurring theme?
Scenes drag on far too long to belabor a points.
The story jumps around time suddenly, often and with little continuity.
Al Pacino is the greatest, but, he had no business playing hoffa, pacinos character is too strong.
The aging techniques were borderline creepy. An 80 yo deniro made to look like a 50yo deniro trying to act 30 was really really weird!!!
The acting was solid. The cast was big but perhaps people relied on that too much?
Something was missing. Im still trying to. Figure out.
90 mins could have been cut here easily....",6,10,22,28 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Yet another Abrams special....
","I watched a prescreening version of this but held off the review until i saw the final cut in order to be fair.
This movie is little better than bad because visual fx...
I used to ask questions like: why do they give clowns like Abrams and Shyamalan opportunities?
Rise answers both: Abrams couldn't give 1/2 a F regarding creativity, story telling or artistry. What he brings is a prolific ethic of making high budget movies that are just good enough to entertain the ignorant (m)asses while staying relatively wholesome in the context of our culturally bankrupt society. He also has a knack for slipping in whatever is in vogue on the societal progressive Left, which Hollywood loved because: money. Incidentally, the making of, being the only driver behind this guy... which studios- love! Also incidentally why Shyamalan gets movies, he at least he tries to be creative (though not very well), the delta driving enough story fans to stay with him and, you guessed it, create a market...$$$
So, you say, what's all this have to do with the movie?
Imagine all the most convenient, expeditious money maximizing decisions you could make in this film and general storyline, and you'll write, in your head, 90% of this movie. It's that predictable, it's that derelict and creativity, it's that boring to follow.
Maybe watch for free, home, sick... maybe.",3,8,13,18 January 2020
Bird Box," Kind of original?
","I mean...the fact that it's not more superheroes crap or YAF gets it 2.5 stars off the bat. I give it another 2stars for being kind of different, though its essentially the happening if the wind could talk and scheme. Shyam Has little talent but this movie gives him a run for his money. The 6.5 rating is pretty high. I suspect people have run out of what to watch and I doubt half of the 45 millions accounts that clicked it, fully watched it....skip this.",4,1,2,4 January 2019
The Exorcist," The greatest horror movie. Ever.
","Ive held off reviewing this movie for years as it is one of the few that deserve 11 stars. I'll need to update and and do it justice. but for now, I'll capture the high lights why it's so good.
1. This doesn't use CGI or jump scares to affect your fear. It doesn't need to. By building up a very unknown and alien evil that we never truly see, your imagination will take care of that. What are the beings inside Ragen? who are the 'us' referred to by the creature? Why does it get to boss around the others? Why do they feel it's fun to torture a little girl and kill priests. You don't need to be Catholic to be creeped out and deeply affected.
2. We can all empathize. Like The Fly, being taken over by an alien force that over powers us, is familiar to a teen in love all as it is to someone diagnosed with a disease. It's never easy, always uncomfortable and you'll never be the same after. And, we get to visualize the effects, in real time as Ragen transforms into the grotesque corporel representation of that foreign agency, which no one can control.
3. Plays on our fears of the unknown in the thereafter. Where do we go after death? Are there ghosts and demons? Is what we do in this world relevant in another? These are deep questions raised by this horror movie...
4. The visuals, sounds, score and language in almost ever scene is creepy, deep and/or dark. There's human pain, fear, triumph, redemption, empathy jealousy etc.. all raw emotions that move and control people. All this erases any thought of comedy or lightness that's built in to the horror genre.
5. The Devil is portrayed in its darkest form here.So, in summation, this movie has all the qualities of excellent dramas and thrillers wrapped in a scary package that hits all the right notes at the right time - terrifying us to the core. This is why, for me, this is the first and last truly scary horror fiction ever made. Period.",10,1,1,29 September 2019
1917," Good but overrated
","I watched this in the comfort of my bed (award consideration copy), its a good movie with great shots. However, when compared to saving private Ryan or black hawk down, it doesn't stand well. Why? There aren't enough in depth battle scenes to be captivated with. The friendship of the two doesn't have enough depth or poignancy to really make you care. It's almost as though the film is a private was created by one person's recollection of a father's tale.
This is a 5 movie because it missed an opportunity to be bigger and better than dunkirk but gets an extra star for not being more sc superhero drab...
It's worth the watch, but wait until you too can do it in the comfort of your own home.",5,11,26,18 January 2020
The Witch," Nothing scary about this
","You ought to read the high rated 1 star ratings. They do a fair and honest job. So, why 4 stars? A. Not easy to make a movie or be creative. B. There's worse.
Sure, it's better than the village. But that's like saying stepping on s*** is better than having it dumped on you. Few ppl are as overrated as Shyamalan. That said, this movie misses on all levels. It's not scary. It's not period interesting, there's no psychological depth like a secret window or exorcist 3.
All it does is build you up and leave you hanging bc there's no point to this stupid plot. If you like cliffhangers, you'd do far better with ninth gate.
If you like alt horror, check out ghost stories. But please be kind to yourself. Let me rewind your time and skip this flop....",3,1,3,26 September 2019
It Chapter Two," Is this a comedy??
","Firstly, this movie is way too long. Nothing wrong with time. I'll give you the time you need to tell your story. All i ask is that you take nothing more. The book was long bc it had to explain alot which the films drop (what happened to the tunnel gangbang???? ðŸ˜¥)
But why it was decided to add a comedy great (Hader) and then take every opportunity to make jokes, slow burn the clown and use campy monsters as foils... there's nothing scary about this! And you know the point of this movie? It's literally fear. That's what the demon feeds on... watch this alone, in the dark house DC sitting for someone off craigslist AND YOU STILL WON'T BE SCARED.....
I wouldn't say skip this... just watch way more movies before you watch this.
Atleast it's not more superhero crap.",5,1,1,19 January 2020
