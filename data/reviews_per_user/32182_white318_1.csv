Requiem for a Dream," This movie is brilliant
","Requiem for a dream is far from your normal movie experience. This movie looks at drug addiction more seriously and realistically than any movie I have ever seen. The majority of drug movies glorify the whole experience of drugs. Make any curious kid watch this movie and I guarantee they will not touch the stuff. The directing in this film is so fresh and different from anything we have seen for such a long time. The directing alone would have been enough for me to stay to watch it. The acting by the four main characters is absolutely brilliant, especially the mother and the girlfriend. Watching this movie does not lead to a positive outcome. However it does realistically portray the life of an addict (extreme).A word of warning this movie is certainly not for the faint hearted. One of the most powerful pieces of cinema that I have ever watched. AWESOME",10,0,0,18 March 2001
