Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I am one of the biggest Star Wars fans
","I am one of the biggest StarWars fans, and I should accept this movie to be a great addition to the saga, but I can't.  This movie was hindered and flushed out by the special effects and technology. The FX and technology overshadowed the movies storyline, and acting.  The worst addition to this movie is Jar Jar Binks, the digitally animated character.  He serves for poor comic relief in this 'should be' on the more serious side movie.  The much hyped Darth Maul only had 4 speaking lines and a battle at the end of the movie.  He barely did anything. There was also no character development at all either. I just assume that we have to know all of these people.  Keep in mind we do, but when future generations see this movie, they will be watching Episode 1 before Episode 4.  It also seems like a small universe if you will, seeing many familiar faces throughout the movie.  Obviously, Star Wars is more angled toward marketing and children now more so than ever before, and I think it hurts the more older fans of the old trilogy.  I hate to imagine watching the 6 chapter Star Wars saga and starting out with this one.  This movie would have bombed if it didn't have the Star Wars label attached to it.  On the plus side of this movie, the battles were well done.  It never really re-captured for me the Star Wars feeling.",7,0,0,25 February 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Ultimate Movie Indeed
","All I can say is that Terminator is one of the only sequels to out do its original. T2 is just a little better overall than T1.  The movie came out in 1991, and on DVD in Ultimate Edition with Dolby Digital Sound and DTS, its the paramount movie for sound and picture quality. Wanna test out your home theater? This is the movie to test it on.  Great cast in the movie with Arnold, but especially Robert Patrick as T-1000, his unforgettable role. Don't miss this one. 10/10.",10,1,2,26 February 2001
Psycho," Hitchcock At His Very Best
","Psycho is the all time greatest movie ever made in movie making history. It has this special style that could only be achieved through the eyes of Alfred Hitchcock and the excellent actors in the film.  There is this mysteriousness that presides over the movie, and that is what adds to the overall feeling from Psycho. Hitchcock's eye for great suspense really does the trick for this movie. He also chose to go Black and White in this movie, instead of color for his own stylistic purposes (and to hide the redness of...yeah.) The B&W really makes the movie more 'scary'. No one can forget the Bates Motel or the mysterious house on the hill behind it with 'that person' in the window.  Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates also has his best performance of his career in this movie, bringing the character of Norman Bates to life. Even 40 years later, no movie is able to stand up to Psycho or make a larger impact on world culture.  Truly the best movie of all time, definitely a 10/10.",10,11,19,26 February 2001
