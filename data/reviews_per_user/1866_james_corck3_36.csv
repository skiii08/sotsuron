Howl's Moving Castle," Requiem for a child's dream
","If we go back to Spirited away, and more backwards to Mononoke Hime, we discover that Miyazaki has done with Howl's moving castle like a testament of his artwork. It has all the elements that made him what he is right now. The young hero (Sophie in this case) fighting against events that are over it's understatement, the cursed prince, the war feeling, the evil witches, the bizarre monsters, the charming characters... Is like a crossover of all his movies, like a gallery of paintings where you walk and you see each frame of his devious imagination. With the aid of Joe Hisaishi mesmerizing score, Miyazaki takes us to another ocean of original ideas, without being completely original (well, not every animation movie has a moving castle, and such a twisted plot of spells, curses, war and conspiracy). In a year full of Tripods, remakes, polemic movies and some flaws in the box office, Howl's moving castle is a relief. As they said in a Spanish comic book: I think like go to heaven is like enter in a Miyazaki movie. With Howl's moving castle that's a reality.",10,2,3,29 March 2006
Alien 3," Ripley's cathartic adventure
","First of all, I am surprised to find the global note over 5. I thought that the people hated Alien 3. I understand everyone who gave the movie from 4 to 1 stars. If you go watch this movie with James Cameron's superior action film, then you will be disappointed. You will hate the movie and you will bann it and spank it.First advice: Forget about Cameron's version. David Fincher made the opposite to that movie.Second advice: Forget about Ripley good, intelligent and Alien-killer. Here is not only bold, but a little bit brain-less and very annoying.Third advice: You know Ripley will die, that's not a surprise. If you are going to get bored because you know the ending, do not watch the movie.The most disappointing thing of all is that Alien 3, with all the darkness, all the creepiest atmosphere and all those pipes, corridors and candles, is not scary. It doesn't gives the creeps like Alien, or has no suspense like Aliens. Is a very good visual movie, okey. But that's not enough. I like Alien 3, I defend Alien 3 every day, but this is the worst Alien movie ever made. As for David Fincher, this was a tough work to do, without a screenplay and trying to make a decent movie. Thanks to Fincher, and not to Ripley, this movie gets so many stars from my side.",8,1,5,12 February 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Third parts are good...sometimes
","Tom Cruise rocks. Yeah, he does, why don't admit it? He made this series of movies what is now, a lot of fun to watch. Just look at the action packed in less than two hours and you will understand that, sometimes, third pats are good.Why? First reason, a great director trained in TV series media like Lost who is expert in character construction and flashbacks. Second reason, a squirmy loath able villain with the face of Seymour Hoffman (far far away from his Dusyt in Twister) and the mannerisms of Blofeld. Third reason, The Cruiser.Because Tom is the star of the movie. He saves the day, he fights three guys in an elevator with handcuffs! He runs more than a Cheetah with steroids! And knows how to take a human soul in the middle of all those awesome (awesome=noisy) action sequences (take into account the windmill chopper chase). Take the plot out of the equation (what the hell is the rabbit's foot?) and you will get the best action movie of the year.",8,1,2,10 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The digital menace
","OK, long time waiting this movie, great spectations, many many years ago...in a galaxy far, far away. Ta ta ta chian!!! The Star Wars title, we all are rocking into our sits! That's awesome. OK, but twenty minutes later in the film (maybe less than 20 minutes) that thing appears. The digital weapon of massive destruction, Jar Jar Binks. What the hell is that? No idea,a I prefer don't ask, and stick to one of the best scenes in the entire Saga. The PodRace scene. Not only rhythm but quality that takes like 10 minutes, with Anakin making our jaws drop to the floor. Thats a real race and not the Formula 1!!! We met the city planet, Coruscant, pretty but scary, looks like a future earth. And then another BANG in our hearts'! The Double, triple light saber duel with the choirs! The movie ends and you go like: mmmmmh, it could be...better. Is funny, it has funny jokes (not concerning Binks but Watto and Sebulba) and it has good performances like Ewan McGregor and Penrilla August. Snd John Williams score is great but far from the original. I think that this movie is a little bit weak, it has more PC than Heart, but still Star Wars, and who doesn't like Star Wars?",7,1,1,17 November 2005
Se7en," The evil into our brains
","***Spoiler warning***If we go all the way to the end we finally get an idea of what happens with humans. We all are bad, we all have a little evil into our brains or behind our ear that says constantly: Kill that guy, you got to kill it, kill it!!! David Fincher learned a lesson after direct (and almost terminated) the third movie of the Alien franchise, so he waited to have a good finished screenplay to work with. His next job is now one of the best 50 movies of all time (if Saw doesn't take the place sooner or later). The idea of the screenplay is simple, not very twisted (with the plot) but enough interesting at visual level to make it dark, moving, brainy and scary. Using the seven sins as a way to kill (and exorcise our fears) is as intelligent as use internet to write a review on IMDb (but not so scary :P) Bradd Pitt is eaten (at performance level) by the great Morgan Freeman (he deserved an Oscar for this movie too) because his William Somerset is more human and deep and near than the detective David Mills (a little bit mean and angry, as you can see at the end). The end of the movie? Pure evil, pure madness and pure sadness, is absolutely a huge exercise of horror film condensed in two things. That cardboard box and the evil murderer, whose name is not been reported in this review.",10,0,0,25 October 2005
Dawn of the Dead," With the dawn comes the end
","This commentary has spoilersBased in the original movie 'Dawn of the dead', this remake is everything but that. Not only a great work by the novel director Zack Snyder but a great example of performance and acting that show us the value of fantastic and horror movies. Actually this kind of movies have a level of acting very high, and lots of quality. What's the difference between this remake and other zombie movies? Well, is not a comedy but it has funny bits (the first musical number with the Shopping mall robbery) it has drama (like the end of Andy) and the rest of the movie is horror, horror and more horror (Scariest scene: Zombie birth). Sarah Polley does a great work as Anna the nurse, Ving Rhames is a perfect Kenneth, and Zack Snyder the best director to make it. It makes you wonder why this movie looks so much like Resident Evil, and why the RE movies doesn't look like the video game. Can't wait for Rainbow Six.",10,0,0,25 October 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Recommended for Alien fans sickos
","Alien Resurrection is like a too much European movie. The director is french, Jean-Pierre Jeneut, what a master, what a maestro of the camera angles and the atmospheres. This man who lives in his own world of imagination enjoys showing his madness to the world and he gets paid for it. That can't be legal.The last Alien-Ripley movie is not: A suspenseful movie (despite some quite scenes), an action movie (despite so many weaponry), or a tragedy (despite the creepy and magnify clone room scene).Alien Resurrection is: A comedy (very black but still the funniest Alien movie, you can have a really fun time watching it), a gore movie (blood, guts, exploded heads, freeze people, more brains and guts, etc...), a nightmare (is a nightmare, no more twists, is like a french nightmare, very Gothic, not very intelligent).For the performances, let's forget about sexually behaved Ripley (that mixture of Alien and human really affected her). Ron Perlman, Gary Dourdan, Dominique Pinon and even Winona Rider give perfect performances that will never be forgotten into the Alien universe.In general is another Alien movie, better than Alien 3 of course, but that is far away from Alien and zillions of Light years away from Aliens. But for the ones who are French or Spanish (in Spain the movie was a good success of critics) it still a fantastic horror-fantasy movie.",9,1,2,12 February 2006
Shaun of the Dead," You will have such a good time...
","OK, this movie had in my country one of the worst promotions I have ever seen. Even they changed the great title from 'Shaun of the dead' to 'Zombie's party'. Impossible to explain, this shows that great horror movies like this one have a bad promotion because of the thematic. Looks like the premise of ROM-ZOM-COM wasn't interesting enough for my country, but sadly I can't change that.About the movie, I have to say that I have never laugh so much with a horror movie like with this one. The duo of Edward Wright and Simon Pegg is genius, their screenplay has nothing to envy the ones written by George Romero, and the powerful comedy is not an excuse to show us really gruesome zombie gore moments.There is no political background here, here is social background. A guy passing through the crisis of his upcoming 30's, he has to move on to survive. So he has to keep living without friends, without his mom, without his step-dad (Bill Nighy, such a joy), and to fix things with his girlfriend.As the tag line says, this is a romantic comedy with zombies, and you can't dig much more in that basic plot, which makes it delightfully simple.",8,1,3,23 January 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," We need Chris Wedge back here
","Just saw it just commenting it.Ice Age 2 starts in the same premise as the original. The Squirrel is that Apocalypse Angel, armored with a deadly nut. The meltdown happens both in the movie and in the theater, as the jokes are not as hilarious and original as the ones on the first movie, the 'love' affair between Manfred and Ellie is funny and believable enough to satisfy adult viewers.Technically the movie is not better than the first one, as it's low and rush design is a card on favor of this, soon, franchise. You wont find better water textures or amazing creature designs. Just the classic characters we saw and that we all know. A positive point: There is no humans, so the connexion with the old cartoons is completely lost, and this is more based on a screwball comedy.Negative point to finish: It doesn't reach the heart as much as the original did. But is worth it to enjoy it in the theater.",7,0,0,13 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," One of the best sequels ever made
","If we expect action, thrills, jumps on our seats and being in the edge of it, let's go to watch this movie. If we want heart, soul, moving moments and comedy...let's go and watch this movie too. Sam Raimi's first part of Spiderman shows the executive producers that he can make a great blockbuster and also gain a lot for strength against the academy producers. So they gave him total freedom with this sequel, and thank god they did. Sam Raimi returns to his beginnings, those beginnings into that creepy cabin, and reaches his high point during that scary surgery operation to Doc Ock (a terrific Alfred Molina) when his independent tentacles kill (without blood, yeah, but Jesus, I still shaking in fear) the whole operation team (do not lose that out-standing chainsaw moment). But this movie is not only special effects and ultra-realistic fights between a giant octopus and a spider. This movie is a heart opener experience. Peter Parker becomes that tortured hero who can't balance between his personal life and impossible love for Mary Jane, and the bless/curse of his super-hero powers. He is like everyone of us. Okay, we don't have special powers, but we have jobs, hobbies, things that take too much of our times to expend with the family. Spiderman is just like that. And with this fantastic sequel, he gets the story he deserves. An Odyssey where friends became enemies, where his identity is revealed to protect others, where the heart is challenged every time with chills and thrills and you feel the life that makes the rhythm never stop, even when the movie turns slow with only one or two moments (I don't understand why Cliff Robertson appears again, but he is the trigger for one of the most dramatic moments of the film). Conclusion: Unmissable movie, this is worth to be in the podium of best sequels ever made, between The godfather part II, and Aliens.",9,0,1,26 December 2005
Finding Nemo," This is not a movie...IS A MI-RA-CLE!!!!
","This is the movie of your dreams. If you can dream with a movie, it will sure be Finding Nemo. Or maybe that close to it. Director Andrew Stanton wanted a really deep father and son movie, and he get such deepness that even the sea became such a little pond compared to it. Nemo's odyssey in the tank is a great contrast and irony (the poor kid wants the exterior) compared to the odyssey of the father, who is scared of the outside, and fights his fears and demons to save not only his son but himself, and find the real sense of life between those jellyfish that create a beautiful and deadly pink forest. From the De-intoxication center sharks to the creepy angler fish, this movie has a rhythm compared only to a roller coaster, it never stops, and when I say never stops I mean that it always keep your attention. You wont yawn, you wont get bored, not only because that terrific screenplay, but because the production design is almost perfect, maybe even perfect. Every bubble, every little fish, has a meaning in every frame. Every scene is like the final result of thousand of previous decisions and discussions. This is Pixar's gold to it's pure status, shinny, beautiful and very heavy (in terms of multi-layered messages) and makes a big mark in the animation world and history. Now next to the black ears mouse, we can see a small orange and white clown fish. Welcome to the history, Little Nemo.",10,1,3,4 December 2005
Insomnia," Dramatic atmospheric story
","Christopher Nolan is one of the best British directors in the world, and actually the more productive if we talk about atmosphere, characters and presentation. With Insomnia, this follow up of Memento, he returns to the regular structured plots, but stills into his world of insane and maniac situations. We see this poor detective performed by Al Pacino, who has a terrible insomnia for many problems and the damn light of Alaska that never really leaves the movie. In a couple of minutes we have the same feelings. We feel tired, but not because of the movie but because of that overwhelming atmosphere, oppressive and uneasy. Our eyes adapt to the few light spots, so when a sun ray hits our retinas we almost got blind. This kind of feelings are hard to introduce to an audience, but if you are so prodigious and intelligent as Chris Nolan, is a piece of cake. But if you are looking for another backwards plot structure like his last movie, dude, you must go to bed and keep trying to get rid out of that damn syndrome.",9,0,0,29 December 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," The apocalypse from the ice
","Well, Roland Emmercih's movies are far from human sense of feelings. Those movies (ID4, Godzilla, Stargate) have a very huge sense of megalomaniac film maker than a human and intimate movie maker. Roland Emmerich is not Steven Spielberg. He is the next Irvin Allen (The towering inferno, The Poseidon Adventure) he likes disaster movies with predictable plots, but the power of his movies are (now) in it's characters and in the visual effects, now used with the dramatic purpose of show the worlds destruction.Many critics hated the movie (check out the critic of the Rolling Stone magazine)and it is understandable. You must like the following movies: -Twister. -The perfect storm. -Volcano. -Dante'speak. -Apolo 13. very very much to like The day after tomorrow. If you don't like (almost) one of them, then is not your movie.",10,1,2,17 October 2005
Silent Hill," Best. Video game. Adaptation. Ever.
","I was like this. 'Ok, now you will be disappointed, you will feel the sickness for two hours while they make you feel like in the video game without achieving that'. After watching the movie I was like this. 'Let's go to the next screening'. And I did. Had watched a movie twice in a premiere is something I never did, but I did. Because Silent Hill is a very good movie. After watching it the second time it makes you forget about it's based on a video game, because is so savage and wild is just too good for a video game based kind of movie. Christophe Gans is the right director. Radha Mitchell is the right actress. Maybe the studio is not the right one, but they did a great job also. The town is the town itself! In it's three different shapes, it makes you feel like you are there. The plot is of course changed to fit the screen, but is one of those movies that makes you think that 2 hours and 4 minutes is not enough. Can't wait to see the director's cut for more gory moments and more Piramid Head.",9,2,3,29 July 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," The best movie of the year
","If Guillermo would have born in the past, eh would be the friend of Goya or of the Brothers Grimm. Why? Because his imagery and the aesthetic is unique. Del Toro knows perfectly how to transport the people to his own personal world, only existing inside his 'insanily brilliant' mind.Using a historical reference as a point of start (somehting he did in Devil's backbone) he builds a story of fantasy that happens in/outside of the girl's head.Having Sergi Lopez as a kind of Kroenen (from Hellboy of course) armed with a bloody gun and his bad mood, perfect as a franquist lieutenant who enjoys killing reds. The little girl makes a great performance far away from what we saw on Narnia (which has a lot of opposite things respect to this nightmarish movie), and the creature design is award worthy.The story is perfect. You cant add something else, or take something else, is a perfect story for a great movie. The rhythm is kinda slow with some scenes, but without them, we wouldn't have such memorable images. To resume, if you take Hellboy, The Devil's backbone and Silent Hill, you will get this movie. But much much better.",10,5,10,14 October 2006
Alien," The (sexual) monster from the outer space
","(I am Spanish, so more alien than that is impossible) Directed by Ridley Scott, this still one of his five best movies, and my favourite movie of him and of my lifetime. Despite the plot (space ship, derelict spaceship, bad-ass alien) the power of this movie is in the visual side and in the both repulsive and frightening use of the sexual elements to encrypt and describe the alien world. What can be more horrible to terminate your life than use the very first thing that started it? That's right! That alien is the freudian attack to everybody's fear, the human sex in rampaging state.Feel the fear in every nerve of your skin, this movie will scare you even 20 times after see it.",10,1,3,17 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pure classic on digital format
","George Lucas was influenced by Flash Gordon serials when he was a little kid. And this movie (and the title also) is am homage to those cheesy and cheaply serials. From the ridiculous jokes to the great sense of adventure. This movie is just not as bad as many people said during the last years. The most interesting moment for the upcoming events (Anakin's mother death, Padme and Anbakin's romance) are free from digital effects known as CGI, meanwhile the most thrilling moments are full of them (like that chase inside the factory of droids, the real attack of the clones, Obi Wan trying to get Jango Fett). The Star Wars movie for the new generation of fans, is good even in the making of the poster., with such a simple design and effective results. And thank god that Sma Jackson gets a bigger, cooler and better part in this movie as the master Mace 'I am so cool' Windu. The Yoda/Dooku showdown is unrateable, so there it goes. The almost final step to the dark side, and many people said that this movie is bad. Do not listen to them.",9,3,5,17 November 2005
The Village," Approach to it, if you dare
","If we take a look to Night Shyamalan's filmography, we see a different message for each movie. Three messages now, and four with this one. The messages are: 1, we are the dead people (The sixth sense).2, The super-hero is a construction of the super-villain (Unbreakable).3, Every apocalypse becomes into a within reborn (Signs). No we add to it the message of Fear con kill you and the ones who surround you. Despite some interesting (I mean silly) performances of some actors (Joaquin Phoenix is not in his best, he looks boring, like Sigourney and Hurt) this movie is an absolute speech about the actual situation of the world. A couple of people who hide in a Villagebecause they are afraid of the murders, the dead, the war, the bombs, the politics, etc...they scape from the pain, but the pain caught them into their ideal place for living. This is like a weird version of Lord of the flies. You can't hide from the primordial instinct of the human being of being auto-destructive, evil and became a murderer. And the worst thing of all, that the lies will never get away from your life, doesn't matter where you go. But Night, please, do not cheat us again with a surprising ending. No more surprising-no-sense endings.",7,1,2,26 December 2005
Aliens," Best sequel ever made
","I give this movie a 10. But it deserves an 11!!!When Ridley Scott directed in 1979 the first Alien he had no idea that, a young director called James Cameron, was planing to make his first big feature, The Terminator. After The Terminator came out, he took the control of the Alien sequel. And then he made history. James Cameron took everything from the Ridley movie, and absolutely not copying it, he made his own movie. Not only a really scary, suspense and horror movie, but a great combat, war and action movie, using the ultra-violence and the hyper-realistic special effects for his purpose. He makes the Aliens evolve, he moved from one spooky Alien that moved half-slowly, to many dozens of aliens that move like demons in fire. He gave us the alien nests, full of cocooned human bodies attached to walls and a very powerful chest bursting scene (please kill me!!!) not so gory and pretty much more effective. He gave us creepy corridors, scary spots to hide an entire alien colony, and sense of humor (Bill Paxton is a genius!). And he gave us the best villain ever. The Alien Queen, Mommy alien for friends. She is the beast (I am trying to not use the other B word) that hides behind Ripley's brain, the monster within. That final battle with the power loader and the Queen is not only epic, is an anthology encounter between two females, two mothers, two enemies. Such both brutal and poetic dance of destruction is the best movie moment in the James Cameron career, not even achieved by his Titanic. Such a great Sci Fi movie that will never have a conquer.",10,1,2,4 December 2005
Spirited Away," Alice in wonderland, by Miyazaki.
","Project instigators: Ghibli studio and Hayao Miyazaki, with his shiny Oscar glistening on the shelves of his bedroom with the company of his silver bear in the Berlinale.Essentially isAn adventure movie. Lewis Carroll will surely wrote this if he had lived in Japan and his eyes crossed with the lovely little eyes of his best friend little daughter. A powerful pulse of innocence that moves this disturbing fable about the evolution of the people into a world, that is bigger than their expected, which became bigger and twisted every step we give into it.Clones and bloodsucker: Nobody dare to copy Miyazaki except Miyazaki. And I hope that nobody will copy him ever.That movie moved us becauseThe little girl Chihiro and the dragon Haku are very helpful examples. One of the most moving characters is that no-face spirit, misunderstood and only-loved because of his golden gift. But the backgrounds, the light, the production design and the music are big moving characters into this living moving masterpiece.A sceneThe moment when Chihiro has to face the horrible-nasty-fetid bath of the God Putride, an authentic performance of bizarre cinema with PG rating.A sequenceThe travel into the train, is a travel from the sane state of mind to the total insanity and to the deep world of dreams and creation, with the company of shadows from the men that lost their innocence and imagination.Watch it ifYou want to discover the Miyazaki style and finally get access to the anime world through the big door. If you are into the anime world already, you can discover the movie that gave the Oscar to the Einstein of animation.Don't watch it ifYou can't hold the anime style in every of his forms, something that is much extended because of the problem with the cinemas and the Box Office.",9,1,2,27 October 2005
Pearl Harbor," Bad and fascist war movie
","Propaganda with capital letters. That's the subliminal message of the movie. Show that the Americans will never be stop by anyone. Talk about Pearl Harbor means to talk about politics, and that's impossible to avoid. When Balck Hawk Down shows such that thin red line from the side of the madness and lost heroes, this shows that war is not just funny, but is a place to meet the perfect girl and to save your country without getting dirty. How many people like this movie? well, the percentage of lovers is almost the same as the percentage of loathers, so it's pretty equal. I don't like the politic plot of the movie, but the director's work is impossible to spank. Michael Bay stills one of the best action directors in the world, and his editorial work is award worthy. But the screenplay is not good, damn, is just not good, and that's all. Ben Affleck is not a war hero, in action movies he loses the expontaneous genius of Chasing Amy or Dogma, and Cuba Gooding Jr is impossible to make another believable work since Jerry Maguire. My verdict: Good action movie. Bad war movie. And their attempt was to make a war movie, not an action flick.",3,0,1,29 December 2005
Resident Evil," Not scary, but entertaining
","Well, Paul WS Anderson said that this movie happens between the first game and the second game...OK, with that in mind, we can first thing the following. This movie, like every video game saved game, is very subjective. Is a one man vision, so this is a vision that few people will join, or few people will understand. The ones who played the video game will miss the fear of the environment into that creepy and scary house, changed for the underground laboratory, that is not very scary. There is no Tyrant, but we have a nice mutating licker that dies in a super silly way, like one of the Fallas in the typical Spanish celebration. Well, let's just say that Resident Evil is a very subjective adaptation of that famous cult-indie video game, that changes the creepy house for the weird wacky scientist laboratory. At least we have the Dobermans, Milla Jovovich kicking asses (and heads) and the PWS Anderson Direction. What do we have in the other hand? Bad special effects, too much editing and a Michelle Rodriguez that is more a guy than a woman. Now I understand why she did SWAT.",6,0,1,26 October 2005
Alien vs. Predator," The showdown of the year...well, the showdown of the month
","I saw AVP in theaters, the first Paul WS Anderson movie I see in a theater, and I love it. I love it, just that, is that simple. I will explain why, because I am sure many people will find this odd and extrange. As an AVP comic book collector that I am, is worth to say that this is a very good adaptation of the comic book with a nice touch of ancient history. Despite the silly dialogues and focus on the performance of Saana Lathan (she is just great, she is terrific, beautiful and an alien ass-kicker) and in Lance Henriksen (When he attacks the Predator with his breather). Also the creatures are nice too, well, not nice because they are slimy and some find them revolting, but they are cool, they are funny and they rock a lot, specially when they get together to have some fisting fun. If we add the great visual style of Anderson (more near from Event Horizon that from Resident Evil) and the re-introducing of our 'Queeny' we have a good Sci Fi movie, based on two great franchises, that is not a sequel or a remake. Is another crossover that will not have sequel, so big deal, great job, well done Paul. At least you didn't try to direct Van Helsing.",8,1,3,27 October 2005
28 Days Later...," When London (and many other countries) collapsed
","Is funny that two of the scariest and most worrying parts of this great apocalyptic movie involve just humans, not infected guys, but normal humans. One, that opening, with the activists or Eco-terrorists releasing the virus when they are trying to save the earth. And two, those soldiers trying to abuse the two girls, when its supposed they are for protect the world.That's a very scary message. When the world is ending, not even the ones who have to protect it can protect us. This is the right screenplay with the right director and the right performers. Cillian Murphy is amazing as Jim, the hero of the story and the real core of the tragedy. What he see, we see, and what he doesn't see, we don't see.Those first 10 very long minutes with London deserted, not a human being on the streets, no cars, just silence and devastation, are both freaking and lyrical. It shows you how it's going to be the whole movie, that the power of it's images it will be equal to the power of it's characters and plot.Is a zombie movie, yeah, but with so hyper-realistic production design that it's closer to the documentary than to the horror movie. And that's what, at least, makes this movie so scary and horrible.",8,1,2,4 January 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Very decent sequel
","I am probably one of the few who like this movie. First of all, I read the Best Seller novel before see the movie in theaters, so I had like an idea of how the movie would look like. I felt disappointed because many things were deleted (many attack scenes, gory moments, some more dinosaur deaths) and some annoying stuff was added (Ian's daughter, Nick Van Owen, Arliss Howard character...)But the movie has a scene of T Rexes attacking more vehicles (this dinosaurs have problems with the Car company or something, maybe they hate Mercedes) which is very cool, and has lots of tension, including that cliff-hanger moment when Sarah Harding is on a shattering glass (scary, creepy, bite your finger nails to the bone) Spielberg said that he would never make a sequel of his movies. Well, he didn't plan this, so he did his best on Lost World: Jurassic Park. Is not as good as the first movie, but well, we have some good things not related to the movie. The cinematography of Janusz Kaminski is just outstanding, with those forests and rain-forests full of mist ready to show their danger. The score composed by John Williams is quite different, with more tribal sounds than elegant movements of violins and flutes like in the first movie, is a more pure, rough and finally WILD MUSIC. The special effects are better OK, we see the T Rex attacking some Japanese people like a Godzilla homage. And Jeff Goldblum expands Ian Malcolm to his most acid and ironic characterization, turning him into another Jurassic beast like the T Rex. And for the raptors? Well, let's say that they got stripes and orange skin, instead they grey and brownish colour. Not a good decision.",8,1,2,27 October 2005
Hellboy," Fantastic adaptation of various Mignola comics
","With this movie, we know now that Guillermo del Toro is for Hellboy, like Peter Jackson for Lord of the Rings. A fan that translates the story from the book to the film, with a lot of respect and dedication.Looking carefully, having a Hellboy comic next to you while you watch the movie, you see that every frame is an exact representation and reproduction of Mignola's work, done in the film-making media. This is not Sin City, we all have to know that, so our imagination has to fill those spaces.The story of big monsters and evil societies trying to conquer the world is as old as the common cold, we all know it, but the power of this movie is not the screenplay, that has a couple of flat line dialogs, is the images. Huge rooms full of pendulums, impossible bridges hanging over the void, talking corpses, huge guns, demons that multiply if you kill them, blue fire, and in the middle of that, a red demon, with his heart split between his two fathers. The good one (Trevor Broom) and the evil one (Rasputin).So many sub lectures to name them all. But interesting enough to keep watching and watching. Only one thing to complain about. Is impossible to believe that the movie is set in New York, but who cares about the city when a Red guy is chasing a weird demon with tentacles on the head?",9,2,2,23 January 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Gmae over. Next player?
","Well, I am not sure if cheer or not because the choice of director for this movie. Alexander Witt did a great job as a second unit director in M:I and Black Hawk Down, but turn him into a director is a kind of huge risk. Anyway, RE: Apocalypse (known before as RE: Nemesis) is a good movie for this director to came up with a visual style, that is like a copy of Ridley Scott visual style with some acid added. The story of RE evolves and now we move to the city of the second and third video game, we have characters from the original games (Carlos Olivera and Jill Valentine) and the bad-ass villain known as The Nemesis. Milla Jovovich is cool as Alice 'The gamer' as I am used to call her, and finally, hearing the voices of the ones who saw the original movie, we don't have licker puppets anymore. This movie is more a monster movie than a zombie movie, and I still missing a couple of them like The Tyrant and the Mutated Sharks. In general, and to finish this tedious critic, this movie is better than the first one, and really, I can't wait to the third movie.",7,0,1,25 October 2005
The Descent," It takes you to hell and let you return to tell the experience
","The previous movie of Neil Marshall was, in essence, a black comedy. There is no comedy in The descent. Everything is horrifying, terrifying, thrilling and scary. Six girls trapped underground and a common enemy. Not the crawlers, but themselves and their paranoia.The origin of the movie, that car crash that will traumatize the leading female (Shauna McDonald) right from the first scene, and the next sequence, running through a hospital hallway with the lights going, tells you that this movie is not kidding. This is pure fear with steroids. This movie is to watch it behind your hands, or under the seat, or just to keep in tension until your veins pop out.If we make a math, this is Alien+The shinning+Death line. Horror is horrible again. Horror movies have their mojo back, and a final advise. The less you read of it, the most you will enjoy it, and stay on your seat until the end of the credits. There is a final surprise that will give the whole movie it's true meaning. That cave is not the trap, is their own minds.",Null,4,9,23 January 2006
Titanic," Ship happens
","When I heard 'Titanic' and I heard 'DiCaprio' I thought 'Romeo and Juliet 2'. How wrong I was! James Cameron takes his amazing film making and, with maybe a weaker screenplay than in all his other movies, he makes this impressive and unforgettable exercise of construction, and I mean building the ship and building a rising climax that will go with you after watch the movie. The story jumps from the predictable stuff (you know the ship sinks, that never changes) to the heart and soul of characters that have no idea of their future, for good or bad. All starts with a simple drawing, and from that simplicity we move to jaw-dropping chases in the guts of the ship, hear-breaking love moments and many extras falling. The rhythm is a little bit slow in the first two acts, but from the moment the iceberg and the ice enter in scene, wow, here is Mr Aliens again. Kate Winslet moves from classic first class lady to Lt Ripley's daughter, the ship of dreams turns into the bath of nightmares, the history accuracy fights against Cameron's Machiavellian film making, and at the end, you just cry in joy, sadness and suffering. The best sequence of all this? The ship splitting is awesome, but Nearer my God to thee is a heart-touching, tear-jerking, whimper moment, with that Irish mother cuddling her children before die, the Captain facing his destiny and the band playing to the very end. 'Gentlemen, i's been a privilege being with you tonight'. Maybe that line and not 'I am the king of the world' Cameron should said in the Oscars.",8,1,2,19 January 2006
War of the Worlds," The end of our world...almost
","First of all, we must despite the first version of War of the worlds, with George Pall and weird flying saucers moving scarily across a model of a city. Cheap effects, but effective enough to make us tremble in our seats.Steven Spielberg made, here, a movie that fits his regular summer blockbuster. This is not Dinosaurs, giant sharks, benevolent aliens or bullets and blood. This is nasty aliens, anti-heroic Tom Cruise and paced rhythm with John Williams notes lost. This is a report of the end of the world seen across the eyes of a regular American family.The revealing tripods sequence is, so far, a lesson of how to build the suspense in a movie. You see the lighting's, the hole on the road, what is that rumble?, oh noes the floor is breaking, look that cathedral, is being tear apart!, take cover with that car!. What is that three legged thing? All that from the lower POV of the little humans, that suddenly became a bunch of flying ashes.While we are more or less safe into that repaired working car, the menace turns from the three legs to the two legs of humans. That violent attack on the car, beating Cruise to the ground while we see his daughter being suffocated by the mass, that can only make two reactions into us: Tear the seats of the cinema screaming, or look in the other way. I tore the seats, not very nice really. So this is another message in David Koepps effective screenplay, a not very welcome message: Even in the worst situations, humans are dangerous animals. Some people wont understood this message, but is a kind of irony about how the world is being destroyed by invaders, and we keep destroying between each others.The film is ironic to the very end. Specially the part dedicated to the regular cold killing the rampaging tripods and their evil pilots. Tim Robins' part is far from pleasing and nice, is another scary moment.So to finish this long comment, WOTW is a Spielberg movie, where the Cruiser is far from his hero status, and that ending part with so many anti-climax and 'it's-over-get-out-of-the-theatre' is a direct copy from the HG Wells book. Now looking forward to the other versions of this never ending alien invasion.",10,24,36,4 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Rises the franchise to epic point
","Knowing George Lucas as we all know him, is very odd (and with I mean, great) to see such a dark movie about the Star Wars saga. This final chapter is when the light goes, the brightness and positiveness flies away from that far away galaxy, and the fairy tale turns into a devil nightmare.Anakin's final destination is one of the most poetic moments in this now epic Saga of movies, very well performed by Hayden Christiansen, closing that un-easy relationship with his mentor Obi Wan and his love, Padme. There is no part in this movie where the light is present.The starting battle is all full or red, browns and blacks, not a single part of bright blue, green or white. Not very brainy dialogs, but when you are flying across huge spaceships with everything exploding around you, words are unnecessary.Following Lucas narrative style, this movie is the final part of a poem, it rhythms with all the previous ones. Anakin Vs Dooku, being watched by Cancellor Palpatine, like what happened (or what's going to happen) between Darth Vader and Luke in Return of the Jedi).To finish, is needful to say that George Lucas' work on this movie is very personal. There are visual effects all over the film, that's right, but action is always focused in the characters, their faces, their suffering and pain, knowing that the end is already there.",8,5,8,23 January 2006
The Lion King," Shakespearian movie with lions instead people
","Project instigator: Rob Minkoff, with the help of Michael Eisner, into de last serious managerial job of his career as Disney's president. I think that Minkoff must do the same that Don Bluth did and became independent.Essentially isA drama. Is the version that Shakespeare had made of Hamlet if he had been a lion and he had live in California. A male lion, with the destiny written since birth, found his life broken because the envy of his jealous uncle about his dad. In his escape to exile, tortured because he thought that he murdered his own father, he found the peace and forgot his problems. Then, he sees that escape from problems and past only makes the pain bigger, so he decided to return and change his life.Clones and Bloodsuckers: Both sequels, the third worst than the second, those movies de-valuate a very original film that gets more poetic layers every time you see it.That movie moved us becausethe great-magnify-epic music of Hanzs Zimmer and the work of the photography director, showing us those elephant graveyards and huge environments full of beautiful-not-gaudy colors, like those skies full of stars, big-fat trees and precipitous that turn into deadly hallways to the execution.A sceneSimba, that facing his father, who is represented as a cloud. The end of the scene is Simba, screaming: 'Father!!! DON'T LEAVE ME!!!' A sequenceThe stones tremble, the walls hum and shake, and the poor Simba pup stares at the sky, while we see since his point of view a really-huge-lethal stampede that runs to his position.Watch it ifYou want to enjoy the old school Disney style into the 20th century. This is the perfect movie to watch with a lot of popcorn, after have had a session of National Geographic documentaries.Don't watch it ifyou are a squared-old fashioned racist that doesn't accept new ideas and alternative forms of moving artwork and masterpieces, I mean, good cinema.",10,1,2,27 October 2005
Signs," A viewed-from-the-basement alien movie
","M Night Shyamalan is used to take usual and known subjects to make the screenplays of his movies. Sixth sense was a ghosts love story. Unbreakable was a super-hero movie. This is an alien movie. And, unlike any other alien movie, we never see the menace. But this is not quite the fear that the actual War of the worlds gives to us. Signs is REALLY SCARY. It makes you jump of your seat, or maybe fall of it because you are always at the edge. When you are not screaming or bumping, you are laughing, so the few and really funny humor touches are that funny because of the fear around the whole action. Without fear, that humor is just silly. And the players are just another nail in the filmography of Night. Mel Gibson gives a lot sense of sutile performance, just because he moves no muscle of his face. Joaquin Phoenix is a solid brave little bro for Mel, like the protector of the family in the physical sense. And the kids are both enormous, so good that the adults are dwarfs compared to them, specially the little girl, Abigail, who's character became important in the last five minutes of the movie. They said there is no surprise at the end. I say there is, and a big one, one of those surprises that make you want to see this movie again as it's finishing. And it defends one of the basics pillars of Night's movies, the family. Until he did The Village and he killed everybody. Ha ha ha!",8,0,2,26 December 2005
Munich," You are not ready for this kind of experience...
","---This comment has many spoilers--- I don't like politics, so I am not going to enter in the huge, important, polemic and problematic background of politics and conflicts that the movie is depicting. In fact I watched it with my father, and he told me: For what I know, the movie is pretty accurate. Since Munich then happened a lot of bombing, explosions and murders, and nobody has any explanation. And I answered: Well, we have now.Munich is a risk project, that's what everybody will tell you watching this movie, and at this moment is like a cliché in every Munich film critic. Is a risked project, is a brave project. Spielberg is, with this movie, a full grown adult in film making. If Minority Report was a masterpiece of film-making, this movie is like a step beyond the Phillip K Dick adaptation.A cast of good supporting actors making very important roles (Mattieu Kassovitz, Daniel Craig, the always BIG Geoffrey Rush and a fantastic Oscar-worthy Eric Bana) giving life to this avengers Mosad Agents in a very different role that we used to see in previous Spielberg movies. In Munich the Jewish are not better than the Palestinian.Even they say that in a point of the movie: We are becoming like them.Steven has no repairs about showing us things right to the face, he didn't refuse to show us the blood of the wounds, the cold behavior of the five agents, the noisy sound of machine guns, that uneasy sex scene inter-cut with the death of the Olimpic Team, and many other things.To close this critic, a final detail that has a spoiler. The ending shot of the movie is the skyline of New York, with the Wolrd Trade Center in the background. That's a final detail that will make many people rock uncomfortably on their seats. For me, it just make me think that this movie will be forever remember, for good and bad.",10,0,0,29 January 2006
Apollo 13," Ron Howard's best movie
","It's sad to discover that the world now remembers those space heroes thanks to a movie. But it's great to see how a movie can show with so much respect and keeping the rhythm what happened during those very long seven and something days into that tight space ship while down to earth and in the middle of the empty ocean outside our planet the technicians and astronauts tried to keep them alive. Howard's casting is almost like the casting of The Aviator. Tom Hanks doesn't look like Jim Lovell. Bill Paxton doesn't look like Fred Haise. Neither Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris or Gary Siniese. But, despite the casting, the rest of the movie is pretty accurate. Is very exact to what happened in real life. The sense of disaster movie is always there, never leaves the screen during it's almost 2 and a half hours, but is basically a human drama with realistic touch. Ron Howard uses his great heart to make us tremble and sob with the agonize tragedy of this three astronauts, and when you reach to the end and see the resolution, you just have to clap! Claps for the heroes, claps for Ron Howard. My verdict: The best realistic space movie ever made. And I mean space movie, not sci-fi movie.",9,0,2,29 December 2005
Jurassic Park," Healthy scaly entertainment
","OK, this movie, for a start, is not a good adaptation from the novel of Michael Cricthon. I read the novel, I like the novel a lot, but this movie is just the example of the best thing you can do with such complicated material. Dinosaurs back to life using DNA from fossilized mosquitoes. Why I didn't have that idea? It sounds logical, even with the fractal errors about clone extinct beings.But let's stick to the movie, not to the science. Let's say Fiction, no Science Fiction. Jurassic Park is one of those movies that will pass to history, not only because the massive Box Office, but for it's amazing visual effects and animatronics, that nowadays are scarier than in the sequels. The rhythm and narrative pulse of Spielberg is in every frame, in every scene and every sequence of the movie, with a prologue of 45 where you see the exposition of the moral problem about cloning, then everything goes down the hill after that prologue. As it used to say, all the hell breaks lose, the fences stop working, the dinosaurs scape, we are lost. The attack of the T Rex to the jeep with the two children inside is breath-taking, makes you feel shivers down your spine and cold sweat. Just see how it crashed the vehicle with them trying to scape makes you see the scene almost from the spots between your fingers 8at least I was that way the first time I saw it, well, I was 8 years old :D) But hey, that action doesn't end there, it continues. The Dilophosaur eats Neddry after let him blind. The T Rex runs behind the jeep of Malcom and Ellie. The raptors scape! COOL!!! That kitchen scene, another creepy moment with the funny 'tac-tac' of the raptor's toenail. And the big ending of epic proportions in the Visitor Center, makes you cheer for the T Rex. Yeah Rexie! Eat that raptor again! Crunch it's spine against that giant skeleton! A blockbuster that will not suffer the past of time, in fact, the most time since it release, the most value it takes, like good wine.",9,2,3,27 October 2005
