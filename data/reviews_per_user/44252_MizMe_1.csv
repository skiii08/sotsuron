Marie Antoinette," Do your homework!
","Copola's Marie Antoinette is an eye-popping cinematic roller coaster of joy. Well cast, well written, beyond well costumed and scored - Antoinette's pink satin journey unrolls (to-the-extreme!) for all us lucky voyeurs.But please do inform yourself! Don't sit through this movie if you know it's not for you - watch a trailer, watch other Sofia, check out the poster - a good indication might be whether you 'get' or are intrigued by the design choices. Do this for our sake, we fans will not stand for your prosaic protests! The quality of thought and detail that went into the production of this film is more than evident - have fun and enjoy the buzz.",8,1,4,28 October 2006
