A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's prediction of the future society (predicted 1970-1971)
","An amazing movie, Stanley Kubrick has had other movies about predicting thefuture, e.g 2001: a space odyssey. A Clockwork orange is a great movie, it is interesting and one of the best movie's I have ever seen. A great idea from SK. SK is a natural born genius. One of the best movie directors of all times. This is my favorite movie of SK. Kubbrick's movie predictions for the future were always correct, yes, this is the society now, raping and violence. The experiment in the movie was a complete failure, and the subject (Alexander DeLarge) has lived the consequences of this experiment. When you get the chance, watch this excellent movie",9,0,0,16 May 2004
