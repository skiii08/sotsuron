Black Swan," Hauntingly psychotic
","Incredibly difficult to stay sane during this film, anxiety ridden confused dream.It had its own sense of mastery, and is definitely among aronofsky's most impressive work, but hard to 'enjoy*, easier to appreciate from a distance.",7,1,1,11 November 2019
Batman Begins," Definitely the worst in the batman Saga
",Cheese and snooze fest with horrible one liners littered everywhere. Predictable storyline without any real character development.Probably Bale's worst role.,2,2,8,7 March 2020
Avatar," Pitifully unoriginal and borderline plagiarism, cringefest dialogue
","I have no idea how this movie continues to get listed among the greatest, and why it soared so high when it did. Every word spoken is forced, unoriginal, one-liner quality annoyance that should be left for high school plays.The story is no different than Pocahontas on a different planet. The most predictable movie I have ever seen. Borderline plagiaristic.",1,7,13,11 November 2019
