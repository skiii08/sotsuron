Scarface," Scarface - Al Pachino is really God.
","I waited years to watch this movie. I never even thought about watching it. Then a friend suggested that it was really good. Now, usually when I go into a movie thinking it should be really good I am dissapointed no matter how good it is. Not with this movie. I agree with the first guy, it's not what I expected. It is Al Pachino at his very best. This movie has replaced Die Hard and The Usual Suspects as my favorite movie. I loved it. I never knew Michelle Phieffer (sp?) was in this movie. And the DVD has a real nice interview segment with the stars!!",Null,0,0,12 November 2000
