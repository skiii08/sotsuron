Walk the Line," Wow... In the genre of RAY !!!
","This one, I didn't even want to see. I just couldn't grasp Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Just didn't seem right to me. I couldn't have been MORE WRONG.Phoenix made Johnny Cash real and his story totally believable and his delivery exceptionally strong.NOT to mention that the guy can sing, and quite well !!!!As for Reese, well, all you have to do is mention her name and know that the part will be done and done well.The over all picture was to the point, straight forward, and factually close to the way I have heard of John Cash all my life.It should be up for more than one Academy Award, and Phoenix and Witherspoon both should be nominated.This winner will leave you singing and happy and wanting to go home to pop on some Cash Records...Tuffy Sams Garland, Texas",10,0,2,27 November 2005
Lost in Translation," not much excitement
","dull, pointless, slow, unappealing picture of 2 lonely people. a waste of 102 minutes.murray is good, but i didn't see any 'academy award' portrayal.too much time spent on 'lonely' pictures and poses and not enough dialogue.i was totally disappointed. really almost embarrassed i sat thru the dvd.it was so bad, i didn't even watch the deleted scenes, figuring if they were deleted and i had such a hard time staying awake watching what wasn't deleted, i really wouldn't want to see the scenes that weren't good enough for the pathetic show i watched...Tuffy Sams Garland Texas",1,12,26,8 February 2004
