Walk the Line," Reese steals the show!
","I saw this movie twice in the theater and will buy it when it comes out on DVD. I was raised on the music of Johnny Cash, and always knew he lived a hard life, but I discovered I was pretty much ignorant in what I knew. That he survived the early years of his career is a miracle, thanks in large part to June. Both Joaquin and Reese gave amazing performances in the movie, and had John and June lived to see the final product, I think they would have been extremely pleased. Joaquin was born to play this role, and he embodies it heart and soul. The scene in Sun Studios when he sings 'Folsom Prison Blues' for Sam Phillips, was for me the defining moment of the movie. He went from being a nobody to being Johnny Cash. As great as he is however, Reese steals the movie from him in practically every scene they are in. She is phenomenal in this part. From the first moment that we see her, she lights up the screen and blows everyone else out of the water, with effortless grace. As the first couple of country music, Johnny and June, and Joaquin and Reese reign supreme.",9,1,3,28 January 2006
Inside Man," Great thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end!
","I just came from seeing this film and I thought it was great! The pace is non-stop and it is not your run of the mill movie thriller. It keeps you guessing until the very end and the end is a doozy. Denzel is as always, superb, and as the charismatic leader of the bank robbers, Clive Owen dominates the screen. In supporting roles, both Jodie Foster and Willem Dafoe stand out in a very solid cast, and as the head of the bank (with a whopper of a secret) Christopher Plummer has never been better. I found it rather ironic for an actor who is probably best known for his portrayal as Baron Von Trapp in 'The Sound of Music' to be playing the character he does in this movie (and you will have to see the movie to see what I am talking about!). Nothing about this movie is predictable.I do have a question though, for anyone who has seen the movie, what happened to the hole they dug in floor of the supply room? And where did the dirt from this same hole go to?",9,3,5,26 March 2006
