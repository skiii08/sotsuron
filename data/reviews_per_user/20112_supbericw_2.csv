Hereditary," It's a Slow-Cooker style in Super Horror! Not like Hostel Style! But Very Deep...
","Family, family, family!!! Hereditary gives frames to relax... audience wouldn't be scared if not take in seriously during the movie. Some others would even laughing about it... Rude... But I felt the movie is really deep and very well constructed. Fear beneath the calm, Actresses give outstanding performances, shock me that's an act ?... or facing it in reality with real life person... Should have Horror movie Oscar... Scared, but enjoyed and feels good still life... What a lovely day with this movie! I give 10",10,16,31,17 June 2018
Annihilation," Who is first? Egg or Chicken! Rethink again after watch this movie
","Well, of cause... Egg first, Why? It could be a smart egg with a little bit different than another regular egg. Love this sci-fi movie, unless we could know something about where we come from. Have fun to watch it, it will keep the audience thinking and shocking.",8,0,3,12 April 2018
