The Benchwarmers," Absolutely dismal
","I was so moved by the complete awfulness of this movie that I actually wrote up a comment on IMDb - the first time I have done so.My girlfriend and I spent the movie in a state of shock looking at each other from time to time to reaffirm that yes, we were witnessing the worst movie we have ever seen.Jon Heder fails to move on from Napoleon, yet also fails to recapture any of the humor of his previous performance. Never again will I go to see a movie with him in it based on the excellence of his performance in Napoleon Dynamite. He built up credit which he has now thrown away. Oh dear..Weak jokes, clich√©d slapstick, attempts at coarse humor that a 5-year-old child could beat, implausible plot line. Absolutely nothing to recommend this movie.I can only think that the positive comments for this movie are execs for Happy Madison desperately trying to leverage IMDb's popularity into some kind of buzz. Avoid this movie.",1,14,30,18 April 2006
