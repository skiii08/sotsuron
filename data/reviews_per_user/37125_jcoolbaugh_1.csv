10 Cloverfield Lane," Worst Film of 2016
","Viewers looking for the type of stellar performance we're used to from John Goodman will be sorely disappointed by this complete hack of a film.The writers couldn't decide whether they wanted the film to be a sci-fi, drama, or psychological thriller film. Our 'heroine' starts with relationship drama, moves into an apparent (long and boring) abduction by a psychotic conspiracy theorist (played by Goodman), and ends with the worst alien encounter since 'It Came From Outer Space'.I can't decide whether it was the lack of a solid plot, the completely predictable (and horribly botched) 'plot twist', or the horrendous acting that made this film so terrible; all I know is that by the time it was over, all I wanted was my 97 minutes back.",1,4,9,27 July 2016
