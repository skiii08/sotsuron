The Ring," Not quite as effective as the real one, but a very good remake.
","I was looking forward to this remake, after seeing the original a while ago. And I enjoyed it a lot. Though it does change quite a bit of the story, it does a very good job of staying close to the bleak and spooky feel of the original. It's probably because I saw the other one first, but so far Samara hasn't had me lying awake at night or frightened of reflections and televisions, like Sadako did. But I did jump quite a few times. A very good effort.",8,0,1,24 February 2003
Pride & Prejudice," Wuthering Prejudice
","After seeing this film, I came to the conclusion that if they had taken the same cast, sets, costumes etc, but instead of making Pride and Prejudice they had made Wuthering Heights, it would have been absolutely fantastic.As it was, in my opinion Colin Firth has nothing to worry about, his well-deserved reputation as THE Mr Darcy isn't under any threat.The pr√©cis of the story was very well done considering there is an awful lot of content to get into 2 hours of film, but at the cost of much of the characterisation, comedy and humour.And I'm not sure what the long scenic shots of Elizabeth staring (into the distance, at statues, at herself in the mirror) were meant to achieve. There could have been more actual content instead. Jane Austen didn't bother with elaborate scenic imagery and the film didn't really need to either.It's definitely worth seeing this version, but for me the definitive one remains the 1990s BBC adaptation.",5,26,55,19 September 2005
