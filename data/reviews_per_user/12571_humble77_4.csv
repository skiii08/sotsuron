",Maybe I watched a different movie. I truthfully didn't connect with any of the characters. I had high hopes but I walked away stunned but not in a good way.,1,0,3,13 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," OMG

Black Panther," If black panther was white would there be all of this hate?
","Why are Caucasians so angry with this movie? We have grown up with mostly white superhero's with the same tired story line, glorifying white pride and privilege. The one time a African American superhero with black pride comes out, it's a problem. I'm really not a superhero fan, but I did enjoy this movie as well as Dr. Strange.
