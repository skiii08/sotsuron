The New World," The New boring go to sleep World
","I watched this or tried to on DVD last night..what can you say about a movie that says nothing itself...this is one slow world, thank goodness for fast forwarding... The photography is okay but it just gets so hard to watch without squirming around. Going off to make your fifth cup of tea gives some light relief from a very slow, heavy, movie. This is one movie I will not be seeing the sequel to. If Malick moves as slow as this movie it will never get made. It looks like I have to write another 7 more lines of text before my review is allowed. That would be more text than what is in the script for Pocahontas. Colin Farrell is terrible, you will need subtitles to work out what he is mumbling about. I can't believe Terrance Malick could do a film like this after A Thin Red Line. What gets me about picking up a DVD like this is if this was a take-away pizza you had ordered and it was this bad you would return it and ask for a refund.",1,0,4,15 September 2006
