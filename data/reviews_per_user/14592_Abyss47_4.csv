Love and Death," Allen's greatest achievement? Possibly.
","Out of all the Woody Allen films I've seen so far, this is the one I can safely say I found hilarious. The comic timing on display is nearly perfect, and the film does a great job of staying unpredictable with the visual gags and constantly moving forward. Allen and Keaton have never been more fun to watch on screen, and they're aided by a strong supporting cast. The writing is extremely clever as well, satirizing Russian literature and making references to such films as 'The Seventh Seal' and the works of Sergei Eisenstein. The film doesn't require you to have seen those films to find the references funny, though, and that's due to the brilliant execution. The film also contains Allen's trademark mock-philosophical debates that have been seen in his other films, except this time I found them far more engaging and funny than usual instead of rolling my eyes.The use of music was also clever, especially during the big, epic battle scene, which makes use of the music from Sergei Eisenstein's 'Alexander Nevsky'; an excellent touch. That scene also winds up becoming one of the funniest in the entire film. Those who are fans of the likes of Charlie Chaplin and The Marx Brothers will want to check this film out as well since it pays tribute to them. Diane Keaton played her best character in all of Allen's films here, as it's both fully developed and charming. Demonstrating Allen at his most eclectic and creative, it's here that he made perhaps the most entertaining period piece (if you can call it that) of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, I can't recommend it enough. Even if you don't find it as funny as I did, it's likely you'll still be amused by it. As of right now, I'm proclaiming this as Allen's masterpiece. Every element just clicks to form a great, wondrous whole that never ceases to be entertaining or get a laugh out of me.",9,4,5,21 March 2013
American Gangster," The Black Godfather
","When I first saw the film, I didn't find it all that engaging, but by the time I got around to seeing the extended cut, I warmed up to it. It's a terrific crime film that accomplishes damn near everything it set out to do, and with an amazing cast of performers along with a stellar lead performance and riveting direction from director Ridley Scott (in top form here), it's one of the essential American crime movies of the past decade, drawing influence upon genre classics - such as Superfly, Goodfellas, and Black Caeser, while effortlessly carving its own identity. If you're not big on crime films, most of your enjoyment from this will be based on how much you like the cast and how familiar you are with their work, but one can't deny how well made and polished the film is.",8,7,8,15 December 2013
Ran," Kurosawa's last epic is an extraordinary achievement.
","Saw this for the first time today, courtesy of the StudioCanal Blu-ray, which looked and sounded fantastic on my set-up.Great, great film. I'm not entirely familiar with the story of King Lear, but I thought 'Ran' had a wonderful story with all kinds of layers. It was almost overwhelming for me at times as I was trying to keep up with all the various character names and motivations. The photography was so lush and colorful as well, probably the best-looking Kurosawa film I've seen to date. Then again, this is the first one I've seen in color. The framing of shots, the scope and scale, all of it was just so.....magnificent. I love huge epics like this which have so much to them in regards to subject matter; this one deals with loyalty, family, and the bloodthirsty nature of war, among other things, and in the sort of poetic way that would make Shakespeare proud. The battle sequences are stunning and somehow manage to be beautiful and brutal at the same time because of the way they're filmed and the use of music. The score is very haunting; I thought it was used best in the big battle scene towards the middle of the film which causes Hidetora to go mad. I was even smiling during it because the execution was so breathtaking; the type that makes your eyes widen. And the opening set the mood extremely well; I knew from that point on I was watching a film that would instantly become a favorite. I'm glad I blind-bought it, because I will definitely be seeing it more than once.",10,0,2,7 July 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," A mixed bag.
","So, here we have it, the other big Whedon film released in 2012.This one could've fared a bit better in the sense that it packed more surprises for the viewer. Problem is, before those surprises come along, we're subjected to a rather conventional horror structure. A group of unsympathetic youngsters venture out to a cabin in the deep, isolated woods, and weird stuff happens that changes their entire day for the worse. Throughout the story, the film cuts back and forth between the youngsters and a mysterious facility later revealed to be underneath the cabin, which we quickly realize is filled with folks who are not only aware of the youngsters' location, but are watching their every move and collecting their blood when they die for a sacrifice detailed at the end of the film. Creepy and interesting, but like with the youngsters, Whedon's dialogue is more corny than it is funny, a far-cry from some of his other work. Drew Goddard's direction was iffy at best. He doesn't seem capable of keeping up with the action and filming it in a way that is both coherent and sustains your interest. His direction improves at the end, where the entire film gets better, but too often are there moments where I got the sense that he didn't know where to place his camera.The actual scenes involving the youngsters, for the most part, are as standard as they come. Whedon tried his best to mix things up a little, specifically in a scene involving 'Truth or Dare', but by the end, you realize all that nonsense was nothing but build-up to the main event, and quite a main even it is. Without giving anything away for those who haven't seen it, I'll just say that it raises the quality of an otherwise dull film drastically, not only because it is unexpected, but because it keeps going long after one would expect the film to come to a close. Whedon could've easily had the film end right after the two survivors are revealed to be in the middle of several different creatures in the facility we see throughout the film, but that would've been lazy and not satisfying enough. Instead, he kept the excitement building from there to reach one of the most memorable finales in any film this year.It's just a shame that the rest of the film wasn't as strong. Instead of giving us characters to care for, we're given caricatures with little to no personality, so when all of them are killed of, it's really hard to give a care. Our two survivors' final moment is needlessly contrived and without meaning because of this and the fact that the characterizations simply were not there. Thus, we're given Terminator 3.5 instead of an affecting and powerful closer. Whedon should know better.",6,1,3,5 October 2012
