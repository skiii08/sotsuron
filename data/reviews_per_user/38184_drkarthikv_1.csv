First Man," Good one but kind of boring towards the end!
",A good dramatisation of a historical feat which starts off intense but towards the end it felt boring and lagging. The actors have all given their best and it would have been nice if they would have made it feel the same instense or thrilling as it was in the beginning.,6,2,4,13 October 2018
