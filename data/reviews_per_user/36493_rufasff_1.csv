E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Thrill Is Gone
","I have to admit, when E.T. hit the theatres in 82 I was a big a suckeras anyone, compleatly drawn into the wave Speilberg had going at thattime. Going to the re-release, I was expecting to see one of those rareperfect, or near perfect, works of pop art only a Scrooge can resist.     Well, I'm not a Scrooge, but alas, viewed with a light touch ofobjectivity, this movie is barely good. Perhaps in the years since wehave been clobbered with so much Oprah type  ca ca that E.T.'s warts allbut scream at you from the screen, and who need a screaming wart?     The script has one, very limited virtue: it's cute. Speilberg wouldlater try to cute his way through stinkers like 'Always' and 'Hook', buteven well modulated Cute can only take you so far. We all know thestory, what really surprised me this time is, that's all there is.       Major gripes: One of the things that no doubt made this a hit isJohn Williams, endless sledgehammer score, bashing every moment overyour head. Terrible. And Drew Berrymore, for all he hype, wasn't a verygood child actor. On the other hand, Henry Thomas is good, and ispossibly the one honest thing about this bombastic adorablefest.
       The cult of Saint Steven better get used to it: cooler heads willno doubt start to size up 'E.T.' more honestly as the years go by: Inote the rerelease was a big box office let down. Salon's Charles Taylorsomewhat comicly gushed over it recently, but it's no surprise he's oneof the mainstream critics who slobbers over porno as well.  Well, somethings are of their moment and that's no disgrace. It's just tough topretend hack movie making like the terrible E.T. gets drunk scene are genius anymore.",Null,1,2,18 April 2002
