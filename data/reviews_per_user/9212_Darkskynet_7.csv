Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Good camera/editing.
","I never watched the first one, I am not a big fan of Sherlock Holmes,however I though this sequel had some good camera work and Brilliant editing techniques, particularly while the cast were running in the woods, my fav bit. As Plot goes, for me it just doesn't hit the spot, but as I said, I am not the greatest of fans, just a little predictable. I new he wasn't going to die on the train since it was only halfway through the film, and I new he didn't die in the end, Only thing I got wrong was I thought he was going to pop up at the funeral :P If you are looking for a film which is an easy watch, and you'd rather spectacle like Avatar, than watch this. However if you want something a little more though provoking, with less predicting characters and plots, then this isn't for you.",6,1,2,27 December 2011
Sucker Punch," The representation of women...
","I went into watching this film not expecting much, as I could tell from the adverts the females are only there for the male gaze. This film turned out worse then I thought. The representation of women were awful, being over sexusalised, and over 'perfect'. Highly unrealistic! Plus, was there really any need for the imaginative Brothel?! No! That was an excuse to get them wearing sexy clothes..The directer explained that the Brothel was her escape from the mental hospital, however I don't think selling your body to sleazy men would make her feel any better about herself. I also wonder when Baby doll is doing the erotic dance to distract the men, what was she really doing in real life? I personally feel, that if they had never used the Brothel idea what so ever, I probably would have taken the film more seriously. With all the imaginative scenes of war fighting to symbolize their 'mission', surely that was enough!",2,1,7,7 August 2011
The Favourite," A period drama with a twist
","I did find in some places a little slow pacing and the style of directing is a little artistic which is to a particular taste. But, the acting for all three Stone, Colman and Weisz was superb. I thought the costumes, lighting and sound was well thought out. It's not your usual conventional period-drama - it's incredibly dramatic, edgy, comedic in places and almost obsurd, but if you can stand an intense 2 hours, then it's worth a watch!",7,4,9,7 January 2019
Get Out," Okay, but over-hyped
","Plot wise it's intriguing they've taken the race card, but not original in it's concept (Invasion of The Body Snatchers) anyone? Daniel Kaluuya & Catherine Keener stood out in their acting as you genuinely believe them all the way through. It's raw.I felt the directing could of been improved. Take the scene when Georgina poured tea at the table. That whole scene of her standing there for a long time, the awkward staring into the distance and clunky editing.. It was almost forced when it needed to be discreet so only Chris noticed, but the blatant try- hard of the scene made me say, 'really? if this really happened, someone would of seen it'.. Shortening the stare would of made a greater impact. The music in the revealing of the surgeon room scene was far too 'epic' and made the scene almost comedic. It ruined the 'creepy' undertones.Finally, the connection or should I say lack there of between Chris & Rose was cardboard. Though, that could be down to the flat script writing between them. A good film to compare this to is, 'The Invitation' as they follow a similar structure/directing style. BUT, is much more put together than 'GetOut'.",6,2,5,22 July 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Beautiful film
",An incredible and realistic portrayal of ones first-love experience. Realistically directed and set in a beautiful climate. Acting was spot-on for both of the protagonists. My only criticism was it felt too long.,8,2,4,4 October 2019
In Time," Timberlake ruined it!
","In my view, the concept of In Time was brilliant! This idea that we physically live around time (which we do in real life), the way the rich and poor (Ghetto) was structered and how time is organised around the rich and poor, altogether was fantastic, a real eyecatcher. However, Timberlakes presence and false acting really ruined it for me, I dislike him as a singer and think he is a rubbish actor. The scene when he explains when his time 'started', the dramatic pound he felt, was over exaggerated. Even though Olivia Wilde wasn't in it for long, I felt she upstaged him completely. I wasn't a fan on the little woman (Amanda Seyfried) either, but that's the Hollywood narrative for you. Saying this, the casting of the time keeper Cillian Murphy was fab! Overall the Film had such an interesting concept, but the star casting over who would fit the role let it down. It's just a shame Hollywood got a hold of the script before an independent company.",7,0,2,27 December 2011
Joker," Beautifully shot... if a little coincidental
","Beautifully shot with excellent lighting, this film certainly goes all out on visual pleasures. Joaquin phoenix puts on a strong performance as Joker, taking influences from The Machinist and Taxi Driver. Music score is done really well and they don't force Gotham down your throat - it's clear that this is its own film.Unfortunately, the film felt a little 'too good to be real' - With lots of 'coincidental' plot elements to establish the Joker, I found myself rolling my eyes a little and saying, 'C'mon, really?'. Perhaps this could have been avoided if the film was a two-parter? But other than that, an enjoyable experience.",7,1,3,10 October 2019
