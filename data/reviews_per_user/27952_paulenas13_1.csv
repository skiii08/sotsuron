United 93," Typical American drama with doubtful content
","Typical American drama, which has all the 'necessary components': pain, goodbyes, sorrow, and of course its own heroes... it only ends not like 95% of dramas - 'Happily Ever After,,,' It is a very sad tragedy what happened on 9/11. However, I am a bit sceptical about the conformity of the events shown, even it is thought to be based on true facts. There are many scientific researches done and let's say one of them concludes that chances of making a successful phone-call from mobile phone on the plane at that altitude is about 6 out of 1000, or less than 1 out of 100. However, heroes seem not to have that problem at all ... and that is only one out of mane inconsistencies. Generally, it was disappointing; it didn't even reached my minimum requirements. Overall story is being told very abstractly and superficially. I really was expecting more.",2,5,15,17 June 2006
