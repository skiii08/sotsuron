Casablanca," Great movie with an excellent story line
",This movie was a great see; I'd definitely recommend it to family and friends after watching it because it tells an interesting story (which is hard to find if you're looking for a drama). The photography was excellent and uses many different types of shots to really expose the film as much as possible and give you good views on conversations and the actions by following the 180 - rule. The sound was in sync and sounded great and not muffled or distant like some movies seem. I'd just like to note that I saw the original black & white film and it had a great picture.Overall I rated it an 8 out of 10 because it was was a great movie however it just doesn't tell as good of a story as many other drama's that I have seen including 'Seven Pounds' and 'Forrest Gump'.,8,1,4,8 April 2012
Taxi Driver," De Niro at his best
","Now I may be a little bias in this review being that Robert De Niro is one of my favorite actors; but this film is in all honest one of the greatest films every made. De Niro's character is excellent and entertaining in that he just wants to impress some women and save some from their ridiculous careers. The film is shot both at day and night and features great cinematography and many moving shots because De Niro is a Taxi Driver. The film was shot in color and features sound, overall I'd say this film is definitely a 10/10. Everything about this film is interesting, from it's entertaining plot down to the itty bitty details it's definitely worth a watch.",10,0,0,2 May 2012
Forrest Gump," Greatest movie of all time
","It almost seems pointless to write a review for this movie because by now I would like to hope that everyone in the world has seen this film. This is truly one of the greatest films ever made because it explores many important events in American history and explores the life a seemingly slightly retarded young man who manages to make out in life even when all odds were against him. The filming is fantastic throughout the film as is the sound and the orchestra. The orchestra actually does a lot in the film, just the sounds of the violins and the moments that the orchestra plays seems to bring audiences to tears. It's really unexplainable how touching this movie is, honestly anyone if you're reading a review and have never seen this movie I advise you to watch the movie and you will love it. Nothing is more heartbreaking then the ending of this story so if your not one to like tear-jerkers steer clear because even as a tall muscular man I still break down in tears every single time. I'm honestly surprised this movie isn't rated a solid 9.5, I give it a 10 because everything about it is perfect, it's got probably the biggest Hollywood actor of modern time starring in it (Tom Hanks), and truly is a phenomenal movie.",10,1,2,2 February 2012
Annie Hall," Eh, not a big fan
","This movie wasn't particularly interesting in my view, it was a romantic comedy and just failed to really grab my interest. The camera work was decent, nothing extraordinary, and the sound was okay as well. Overall I wouldn't watch the movie again just because it's not really a genre I like to watch and I didn't really like the acting of Diane Keaton in this either. Her character just really annoyed me and I wasn't really interested in her at all.I rated it a 3 out of 10 because Woody Allen is a funny and great actor, that's the only part of the movie I enjoyed though were Woody Allens jokes, they got some giggles out of me and made the movie at least somewhat watchable.",3,5,10,7 May 2012
The Graduate," Hilarious movie with a twisting plot!
","I really enjoyed this movie, it tells a great and hilarious story of a 'nerdy' college graduate who throughout his college years never once had an intimate moment with a woman. The cinematography is fantastic and the color is very good for a mid-sixties movie. Lots of different angled shots and many shots in rapid succession at different angles. The sound was great as well, all the words and music were synced up and the movie was just overall a great one.I'd recommend this to family and friends seeing as how it's a funny movie and quite entertaining. Dustin Hoffmans acting is great throughout the movie and this is one of the films that helped to make him a major Hollywood star.",9,2,3,23 April 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Excellent and hilarious musical!
","This movie was just all in all great and I'm glad I watched it! I love musicals and this was just another great musical in my opinion. The songs were great and the audio with the movie sounded crisp and clear. The shots were great especially during the songs because the photographer had to follow the dancers around which can be difficult to do smoothly. The photography excellence can be seen the best during the song 'Make 'em laugh' where the camera follows the actor throughout the dance and as he jumps on top of a piano and such. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheery funny movie, even if you hate musicals you'll still enjoy 'Singing in the Rain' it's just that great!",9,0,2,8 April 2012
Groundhog Day," Fantastic classic; a must see!
",This film was one of my most favorite films as a kid because it always made me smile and really got me thinking. The movie is interesting because it explores the ability to figuratively restart a day and live the same day over and over again. With a comedian like Bill Murray the film is for sure a funny one and will get plenty of laughs from any age audience. The filming is excellent so is the editing especially because they had to recreate the same scene over and over and over with slightly changed characteristics. Overall I rated the film an 8 out of 10 because it's a great film and what's really nice is that it's most certainly one that you can watch with your whole family and everyone will find it funny!,8,2,4,2 February 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," No doubting why this film won so many awards; simply fantastic!
","This film was absolutely outstanding, but of course it doesn't need any appraise after winning best picture and numerous other prestigious film awards. The film tells a somewhat dark and racy story and features rape, sex, and alcohol. The story was beautiful and featured amazing cinematography and great acting; especially that of Nicholson's character Randle. On top of the wonderful picture the sound was crystal clear as well and provided an all around great atmosphere for the movie. Except for two shots in the film the film featured very bright and distinct lighting, mostly natural lighting as well. I'd recommend this film to friends and family not only because it's an award winner but because it still thrills today, 37 years later!",9,1,2,2 May 2012
The Woman in Black," A true horror film, had me biting my nails the entire film!
","This movie was magnificent. It's so dark and just sets such a deep tone that it really pulls you in to the film. I can't say I've ever been as scared as I was when viewing this film, it's almost like being in the perfect haunted house. The film mainly takes place in a dark creepy house on an island, the house is haunted and every little thing in the house just makes you jump. The music and sounds used really get your heart beating fast as well. The film used many vintage toys, added some cobwebs, and ended up making some of the scariest and most horrifying toys you will ever see. Radcliffe's performance is something to really be applauded as well, this is truly his first breakthrough film since Harry Potter. Hopefully Radcliffe continues to do films such as TWIB because he truly is a great actor.",10,0,2,13 February 2012
