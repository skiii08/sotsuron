Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Juvenile Humor
","When my brother and I were far younger we would make comedy tapes on our father's reel-to-reel deck. The comedies made us laugh, they were very funny to us, however they weren't something we wanted out parents to hear and if any one of them appeared today I would not be very happy about. Making gross jokes and fun of those who can do nothing about it should be done with care as it can hurt, those who are the butt of the joke and perhaps those who make the joke.Initially I thought this would be a fun film, which would satire the government of Kazakhstan and some of its leaders. It has nothing to do with lampooning the government. Instead found a film that it was going far in belittling the people. It was effectively the same puerile humor my brother and I carried out, except there is a developing story in the film. It isn't much of a story and continues to pain the kazaks as a backward and idiotic people. I'm surprised this sort of thing sells and even ranks an 8.4 rating (as of this comment.) I rather wish I had my money and time back.",4,6,13,11 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Rich Special Effects, Sometimes Entertaining, Too Long
","Immediate reaction was I was wasting a beautiful afternoon watching a pirate movie which is only about half as entertaining as (recent DVD release) Yellowbeard.Dead Man's Chest is yet another film turning to moments of crushing boredom as it drags through scenes which really answer the question 'at what point does brilliant become passe?' The first Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Peral was pretty good. This I had high hopes for, but found myself suspecting Dead Man's Chest was going to become a marketing vehicle for a whole new theme park of pirate rides.This isn't to say there aren't some good bits, I rather think Bill Nighy as Davy Jones delivers a delectable amount of menace, but Bill's an outstanding actor (see him in Love Actually or Girl in the Cafe.) The rest really fit into B movies in terms of credibility. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, however, is unconvincing as a pirate captain. He strikes me as a twenty-something in charge of a ship of 40 somethings. (Might this be a parallel to the way today's businesses are managed?) Perhaps Tim Curry could have reprised his Long John Silver from the Muppet caper.All in all, the viewer should know by now that PotC is another in a series of films with the second and third installments largely done at the same time to form a serial. There will be the culmination (one hopes) of this buccaneering (without ever actually looting one Spanish galleon of a single piece of eight) featuring Keith Richards as somebody'd father in 2007. Cheers to the juniour pirates who enjoy this sort of thing. I think I'll pass next summer and see something else.",6,2,5,24 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Avast! Good old fashion swashbuckling fun. Rated Arrrr!
","The only thing which really seems to slow Disney's PotC juggernaut is the love story. Swann and Turner just look too made-up and clean for all this grime, brine and sea life, which is such a stretch it seems to detract at times. I guess the love-interest must be there for mom's and dad's who are dragged into the cinema by the kids.I've admired the versatile Bill Nighy's work in other films and he continues (with Geoffrey Rush) to be among the strongest actors, who project some menace and give the film some real meat, which is needed to balance so much silliness. These are supposed to be Pirates after all. I'm certain contemporary pirates consider this all high comedy as they board ships, take hostages, etc. Somewhere in the myth Disney has woven, we are probably forgetting what pirates were really about.The tale is largely entertaining and a pretty good pace and thankfully no repeat of the tumbling through the jungle bits from PotC II.Spoiler Warning! At the end, why the fleet turns away is completely a mystery. No character appears to challenge why they shouldn't be finishing off these scourges of the seven seas, they all just bugger off! Why? Oh, and wasn't that an Errol Flynn pose near the end by the new captain of the Flying Dutchman?",7,2,5,28 May 2007
Milk," A Page From History and a Civil Rights Story
","I'm a stranger to California. When I heard of the assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk I had little idea what it meant, aside the tragedy of two lives stolen through murder.The film tells as much a civil rights story as it does the personal story of Harvey Milk. Sean Penn gives such a convincing performance I'm frequently believing I'm watching Milk, but Penn isn't the only strong performance in this film, the entire cast is strong and I feel I'm watching history re-enacted in the place and time of events.How faithful is Milk to actual history? That I cannot say, aside liberties must have been taken at various points because the dead are not here to tell how it was, but as a film underscoring a branch of civil rights it makes a convincing point. Particularly after the passing of California Proposition 8 and other anti-gay rights measures around the United States.",10,9,18,8 December 2008
Quantum of Solace," More Bond For Your Buck
","Yes, I did rate this a 10. I found Quantum of Solace to be an excellent continuation from Casino Royale with action, plot and good acting.Quantum of Solace is not your father's James Bond, he's tough, resourceful and has his flaws, all the more to keep interest pegged. Daniel Craig is still a very convincing 007, Mathieu Amalric (brilliant in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) plays a ruthless and delightful part in the cast of villains, Olga Kurylenko a fantastic Bond Girl (almost scrubs the horrible Halle Berry part from memory.) There's a bit of travel, to locales not as romantic as in the old Bond films, this is a back to basics thriller, not all special assignments are to the beauty spots of the world. CIA and MI6 are painted in more shades of grey then before. It's murky business when politics, business and intelligence collide, isn't it? I'd see this one again, so much happening I swear I missed quite a bit. Good stuff. I also appreciate where there appear to be jumps in the story, with potential scenes left out - really, did I need to see some mundane stuff to stretch out the film and slow the pace down? Nope. I'm fine with it. A super popcorn flik if ever there was one.",10,7,15,16 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Brilliant! The rest is details.
","A gritty tale, not just of crime and people who will do anything for drugs and money, remember the title and how the film starts. Definitely not your typical Hollywood fare with predictable actions and outcome, it this didn't play out in real life somewhere at some time, you could easily imagine it could the story is so well written and the film so well acted.Some may get the wrong impression, how such a film should end based upon their training by scores of films and feel let down by the ending. Again, recall the title, this isn't Pulp Fiction.I highly recommend and would see again.",10,3,9,18 November 2007
Cars," Once again Pixar Exceeds Expectations
","With Pixar's long relationship with Disney I've been expecting the inevitable decline of things associated with the big corporation which takes fewer risks than it once did, aside from shutting their old animation studios and banking on half-baked in-house computer animation. Simply put, Disney is tired and only rehashes stereotypical characters to bank on old successes. Pixar has delighted us with new characters every time (including in the sequel to Toy Story, BTW there is a Toy Story 3 on the way) by mostly abandoning everything it already knew and starting with a totally new story and totally new characters. There was no letdown in this film. Wise of someone at Disney to keep Pixar in the fold. I dearly hope that same wise influence keeps Disney's script writers out of Pixar.Regarding the film, it's a fairly predictable story, as becomes apparent as time goes on, which is the only reason it I didn't give it a 10. As for their telling of the story, well, as was said of James Bond, nobody does it better. Eye candy galore, stunning vistas, utterly charming, magnificently hilarious and wonderful nods to the legacy of the automobile.Take a close look at those bugs flying around and be sure to stick around for the early credits. I'll have to get this one on DVD just to catch all the background and quick one-off in-jokes. I'm sure there was something about Emeryville in there, but it flashed by too fast.",8,1,2,18 June 2006
Shrek the Third," Third Time Not the Charm
","Of the three Shrek films, they appear to go from good to bad in their order of appearance. This was clearly the lamest, and hopefully last of the lot if the writing continues in this vein.Plot was the tired 'Oh, I'm not cut out for this, I'm not good enough, but I need to learn I really am the hard way.' Gah! Right out of Saturday morning cartoons. Donkey is actually getting annoying too, at some point I was hoping he would go off on his own and take those ridiculous offspring which only a marketer could have dreamed up. (Exactly how do a donkey and a dragon, you know... ?) The morals of the story are rather ham-handed as an ogre and make the time seem to drag. Arthur's shallow highschool chums, good grief, could we try something original? Arthur has to believe in himself, too. Yawn.The music, desperately missing Smashmouth, it was a grab-bag of old pop hits, including a ill-considered 'Live and let die' which only brings to mind James Bond. I genuinely felt the original writing team left and someone was pulled in to tie it together to meet a production schedule. It should have been shelved until the producers could come up with something as good as the first or second films.",3,4,6,28 May 2007
Transformers," That there's one Awesome flick
","I'd been psyched up a bit after hearing about this film for months, back into 2006 even. Leaked pictures and rumours piqued my interest and I hoped beyond hope it wouldn't be bogged down in some meaningless tale (a la Spider-Man 3) or be utterly preposterous (geared towards fans or kiddies only.) As it turned out the film has a couple human threads entwined in the tale of the Transformers. Some of it's cute, a good bit of humour and doesn't get bogged down in it. Some of it is silly, but it still works well as an action movie. Optimimus Prime (and the other autobots) are bit bit impatient and it's inspired comedy to watch these metal monsters creeping around and trying to hide.The action sequences are fast, very fast. I have been informed I missed a couple details, not necessary to enjoying the film, but perhaps meaningful to the character of a certain Decepticon. The action moves along very well and when the final battle takes place it's fast and furious. Saturday morning cartoons were never like this. The Transformers were never like this and this, this is GREAT! For those looking to nitpick plot-holes or the re-imagining of your childhood, you may as well stay home and play with your Rockem-Sockem Robots, because this is going to be different. I didn't mind one bit as I was watching a spectacle which suited the big screen. I'll see this again and again. Fun and exciting, well executed.To Mr. Bay and his team, well done lads! Well done!",9,0,3,4 July 2007
Invictus," Inspirational and uplifting story
","Clint Eastwood can seemingly do no wrong as this is yet another masterpiece from the veteran actor and director. A strong cast, including Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon. Portrayed is the the conversion of a lackluster South Africa national rugby union team to 1995 Rugby World Cup winners and focus for a reborn South Africa.The setting and music paints an image of a bitterly divided country being gently brought together. Echos of apartheid linger and Nelson Mandela artfully turns the Springboks from a symbol of white South Africa to the team of the nation. Music and stadium scenes are quite overwhelming, while scenes of the mostly white team touring the black townships and building bonds with the children of black South Africa are heartwarming to say the least.",10,3,5,13 December 2009
The Holiday," Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Eli Wallach and some other people
","Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Eli Wallach give stellar performances and a tale of two women wishing to get away from the pain of failed relationships. Sadly, Cameron Diaz and Jack Black are out of their depth among such accomplished actors. Kate and Jude can be warm and human and utterly convincing, while Cameron and Jack often appear spare of character. That doesn't mean they totally miss out, as Jack does sparkle at times and Cameron is convincing as a successful business owner/producer, it's just a bit uneven. While following Cameron's character I kept wanting it to get back to what was happening elsewhere. Eli puts in a thoroughly charming performance, which had I a say in things, would warrant an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.Other films this put me in mind of, which I'd recommend, are Love Actually and Crossing Delancey.",7,0,1,11 December 2006
War of the Worlds," gadgetry, Cliché'd plot, Mutilated Characters, Fair Special Effects
","*** Spoiler Warning *** So I had everything done for the weekend and an afternoon to kill, I figured I'd gamble that the crowds had abated nip on down to catch a matinée showing.I appreciated the opening and closing narration by Morgan Freeman, but the obvious CGI water drops were a bit tacky. Why not just shoot an actual leaf with water on it? That theme of overdoing CGI was persistent throughout the film, Alien warships too gadgetry, though overall appearance was good, I wondered why they looked like they all had a giant car headlight on the front.The energy shields were rather idiotic, the tension would have been better served if a few were shown going down, as in the original book, but they still succeeded by their overwhelming might. I didn't appreciate the Astronomer/Curate/Artilleryman combined character who looked like some sort of child molester. What was up with that? People around me laughed quite a bit, like where there's a convenient path to drive through every time they needed one and various script holes, like why are these craft planted under the cities and only now the aliens arrive? That one's a real head scratcher.The general feeling was the film suddenly stopped with the only living family left in Boston intact. I thought the 'disfunctional-family-united-by-common-cause' was really a bit of a stretch. Most characters were fairly shallow, which was a real shame considering the material this originated with, but seems par for the course these days. But people will call pretty much anything a blockbuster now, including the truly regrettable Cat In The Hat.Not the best of Steven Spielbergs work, but not his worst either. I'm not in any particular hurry to see this again. Undoubtedly this film will serve as some inspiration for others to check out the 1950's classic. Hopefully many will sit down and read H. G. Wells' book which inspired all this.Also, do give a look at the other War Of The Worlds, directed by Timothy Hines, which was released earlier this year on DVD and attempts to tell the story in its original setting on a much smaller budget.",6,0,3,4 July 2005
Love Actually," Loved It, Actually
","January 2, 2004 - Solely upon recommendation of friends I took this film in. I was utterly charmed by it. I'm fond of films with multiple plots and, though perhaps not all were to my liking, it worked quite well and fits into the top films I have seen. All performances were far above the usual holiday rubbish Hollywood peddles. It'll be in my DVD collection ASAP. Sadly, the nudity and sexual references of one sub-plot limit the audience to adults.Follow Up - December 2008 I must have watched the DVD of this film 10 times since obtaining it. I still love this film and tremendously enjoy watching. I continue to be utterly amazed such a rich cast was assembled and carried this off without being crass, boring, stupid or predictable. It ages well, five years almost since I first watched it. Richard Curtis and his writer(s) carried out a brilliant production which is still great fun to watch.I've purchased the soundtrack CD to add some of the Christmas music to a playlist for a party, including that 'Festering Turd of a Record' by Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) Good stuff!",10,0,2,2 January 2004
Prometheus," A Good Summer Popcorn Muncher
","As I don't watch television or read pop-culture magazines I only became aware of this film via mention on the BBC World Service. Ridley Scott on a prequel to Alien, eh? As long as it doesn't have the beaten to death theme of people being picked off, one by one I could probably sit through it. Professional review was something Luke-warm, which doesn't bother me, some reviewers are too long in their own cocoons, forgot their childhoods, whatever.Out to see it this afternoon and went the extra yard for 3D, which did add a bit to the experience, as there's some nice scenes in there. The film moves along a pretty brisk clip, the only issue I have is what a load of cowboys anthropologists of the future are -- not spending any time at all to screen for biological problems, possibility of inhabitation, dangerous fauna, they charge right in. Well, that's par for the course I guess, otherwise I rather enjoyed seeing how things would develop and was quite happy there wasn't a lot of dwelling on one scene or other. The opening sequence certainly left a riddle. Also I see the prequel offers a new fork for it's own path of exploration. Neatly done.All in all, a good film if you can detach yourself from reality or being too skeptical about things. Wouldn't mind watching again.",8,0,7,16 June 2012
Iron Man," Finally, one gets it right
","Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect match for Tony Stark. Well cast and well played. Performances by Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard are also a marked step up from the pale fare of supporting actors. There is good delivery of dry humour and the acting doesn't feel in any way forced. Well done cast and director Jon Favreau! The film moves along well, the story is interesting without being inexplicable and ends with my interest piqued to see where this next goes. Hopefully Robert will be back.Iron Man received very good reviews from people whose opinions I respected. Prior Super Hero/Comic Book crossovers to film had left me crossing them all off my theatre-going wish-list. Trailers before the film mean I will most likely be passing on the latest installments of Hulk and Batman and I was a bit worried I was in for a let down. I'll wait a week after opening on those titles. Hopefully we will never see another Spider-man 3.",8,1,2,12 May 2008
La Vie En Rose," A fine film, but keep your head
","For me the song La Vie En Rose was only known through the performance of Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong, though I did see the trailer for this film and was quite intrigued enough to view it.It is a powerful film, though at times I grew tired of the timeshifting, sometimes without warning (only deducing which period it is by the colour of the character.) Astoundingly missing is the period of WWII, where Edith assisted the french resistance. There is simply a jump from 1940 to 1947 with no explanation.Cotillard gives a very strong and sympathetic performance which, as a prior commenter suggested, rivals all performances in other bio-pics. Though the characters around her are rather confusing. Just who is her husband anyway? If you knew her life story you would be wondering if the script became too complicated and key telling footage was left on the cutting room floor.An interesting film for one new to Edith Piaf.",6,2,6,18 June 2007
300," Arty and cartoony, and just not enough of a story.
","First off let me state I never read the comic books, so whether 300 remains true to Frank Miller's vision I can't say. As to impressions throughout the film, it wasn't something one should expect historical accuracy as it's largely visual effect and setting with a lot of over the top comic rendering of characters. The good guys (assuming you side with the spartans) all look like they stepped out of Charles Atlas ads, have too much adrenaline and speak like they could bark out 'Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!' for a monster truck rally coming up on the weekend. The persians are depicted as decadent and monstrous, as if they just finished their last engagement at Jabba the Hutt's palace.I found the return visits to Sparta, to see what was transpiring there while Leonidas and his hunky warriors took five, distracting. Sort of unnecessary 'Meanwhile back at the ranch...' goings on. What was going on was pretty farcical at best and distracting if you mostly just wanted to see more battle. The plot, that there was didn't gain much from whatever antics.Battle scenes, well, gosh, I mean if we're going over the top, why isn't there more blood? When a limb or head gets lopped off, did the heart stop beating already? When there was any it looked like it came out of a squirt gun. Fighting with swords and spears is extremely bloody business and with all this testosterone running amok, why so little blood? It had a World Wrestling Ensemble sort of look and feel -- fighting but no serious injuries sustained -- like some were actually just rubber suits or sommat.All in all, it may be comic fare, but I didn't think an epic historical battle of such significance was treated respectfully. So, is this back to comics being for juvenile minds or can we expect artistic representations of more world history to come?",5,12,26,10 March 2007
