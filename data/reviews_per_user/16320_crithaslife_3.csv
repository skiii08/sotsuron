The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Introduction of a movie
","It seems that nowadays it's a trend to make two movies for one book and fill it with scenes that we don't need to watch. I haven't read the books, although i've heard good things about them, but since nothing happened in the movie I automatically assume that it didn't cover many things from the book. We see endless 'boohoo' scenes that are not even touching that lead to nothing and when we think that 'finally, at least we will watch the first battle of this war in this movie' again nothing happens. The only good aspect of this movie is the interesting game with politics between president Snow who tries to scare everyone and prevent them from joining the rebels using Peeta and president Coin who tries to rouse everyone to fight using the Mockingjay, Katniss; all of this propaganda using the media. But again, it takes too long for nothing. At least the previous ones had some action.Of course the problems of the first two films continue. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth just can't make you care about these characters. Everyone is like 'come on go with Gale he is more pretty'. In this movie we think for some minutes that Gale might die but no one really cares! Jennifer Lawrence gives an average performance, but doesn't live up the audience's expectations comparing to her talent.I will watch the last film hoping it will be better but this one... Pretty bad 3/10",3,16,22,29 December 2014
The Maze Runner," Booorrriiiiinggggg
","I can't believe that this film has 7/10 rating on IMDb. Jesus Christ people is your taste in movies that bad? seriously... I'll try to explain how bad this film is without spoiling much. I haven't read the book but even if I did the result would be the same- boring below-average action movie. Action movie? Wait i might be wrong there because there is no actual action. Even the 'action' is boring in this film. There are endless pointless scenes, and the plot is very predictable. Beginning? Confusing and uninteresting. Ending? Very bad. Bad directing overall. The acting is also below-average, these guys are just not convincing. You don't care less about the main character, nor about the brave leader, for whom the film tries to create some touching scenes, or the main character's 'best friend??'. The only female one is like non-existing. These boys had perfectly styled hair and they were totally clean... in a valley outside civilization. We don't learn anything about these people during the film, their community and how they survive; we only learn their 'rules'. Generally it's a very bad film full of plot holes and unnecessary drama scenes. Stay away {1/10}",1,4,7,4 January 2015
Mr. Nobody," Just awesome
","In this film we see 118 year old man as the last mortal on earth being asked to recall who he was, what he did in his life. Then the story begins; its about a man called Nemo Nobody and the life he has or might have if he makes a certain decision. Should he choose his mother and run to catch the train? Should he choose his father and stay? As long as he doesn't make a choice there are many possible lives he can have. Another question is: Which is the right one?In this theme director Jaco van Dormael presents the butterfly effect, the paradox of theory and the chaos theory more than perfectly. We see a man go with his father meet the love of his life and push her away by saying something stupid and meet her accidentally in a train station, and on the other hand he says the right thing, they fall in love when their parents get together, lose each other because their parents split up, and meet again after 20 years of searching for one another without thinking about career and success. If he goes with his dad there is another sequence of events. He meets Elise, and they marry each other; She might die on an accident and he ends up going to mars to carry out his promise or they have 3 children but he is not happy because his wife is depressed. Else he doesn't go with Elise but he marries Jean without any love but becomes powerful and rich, he 'reaches the top'. So Nemo is in an impossible dilemma which life to choose. This dilemma he overcomes with the opinion that 'every path is the right path'.Mr Nobody is a film that can make you talk about it for days. Its meaning, its ending, the choices he can make. It makes you wonder about all the decisions you made in your life and puts a lot of ifs in your mind. It's surreal in a very beautiful way, dramatic and breath- taking when it should be and not excessively touching. The director did an outstanding work and Jared Leto's performance was admirable.If you find it boring go watch some james bond. Pure 10/10 and in the list of my favourite movies",10,4,6,29 December 2014
