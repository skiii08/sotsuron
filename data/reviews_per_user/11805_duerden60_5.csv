3:10 to Yuma," Ridiculous twaddle. Contains many spoilers!
","Reading other people's reviews, I wonder if I saw the same movie. A fan of Mr. Crowe, I looked forward to seeing his performance compared to the original, which I am old enough to remember. Rancher Dan Evans and family, haven't got a pot to pee in, yet his Mrs. looks like a glamour model. Robbing the coach, the gang risk getting shot up by the well armed Pinkertons until Ben Wade drives a herd of cattle in front of the coach, why not do that in the first place? Byron McElroy gets gut shot, then is seemingly miraculously cured, able to go along riding his horse and seeking revenge. Amazing. Ben Wade proceeds to hang around town, drinking and having his wicked way with the local beauty, (who as usual has TB,) apparently just waiting for the posse to turn up and catch him at it. Ben Wade, the nemesis of the region, then seems to realise what a rotten person he is and appears to help Dan Evans get him onto the train, as if! Of course, rancher Evans has to die, his son now realising his father is a hero. By the time Mr Crowe decides to shoot all the remaining members of his loyal gang who are attempting to rescue him, I was fast losing the will to live. Talk about a cop-out, bang! bang! and everybody fell down dead, is no kind of an ending for me! A big disappointment.",3,9,15,18 May 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," mediocre at best
","Come on, I'm all for a fun movie with a beautiful girl and a macho bloke doing amazing stunts, and I can suspend belief up to a point, but the trite dialogue, the impossible plot and too much makeup made it laughable. Gemma was miscast in my view, it needed someone who could play posh totty, not somebody who sounded as though they had just stepped off the bus from Essex. (and Gemma is fine in things such as 'Hansel and Gretel; witch hunters')but perhaps Keira Knightley would have been much better as the Royal Princess who could be tough when required. Where all the money was spent I don't know but much was wasted. Jake Gyllenhaal was great in the part but Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina and others obviously decided they were in a pantomime and just had fun then collected the money.",4,2,4,23 August 2016
Twilight," Dreary
","Oh dear was this dreary! Slow, ponderous and plodding, the minutes ticked away whilst we waited for SOMETHING TO HAPPEN! Okay, it made heaps of money, teenage girls may find it romantic and let's face it..it is a soap, a chick flick, call it what you will but don't tell me it's entertaining! Compare it to so many others of this ilk, even as far back as 'The Lost Boys' when there was nothing like the effects of today, they managed to inject some style and action. Look at 'True Blood' sex, gore, excitement, action, all the things this didn't have. I realise they didn't want a rating that meant young girls couldn't see it but give it some erotic content, isn't this what vamps are supposed to be about? Glamour! For me the actor playing Edward Cullen wasn't even particularly good looking for all the fuss made about him. (Okay, yes I'm a bloke.) A disappointing waste of time in my view.",3,5,10,16 November 2011
From Hell," Stylish but-
","Reading what others have said about this movie. I have to say, I thought most comments were spot on. What we have here, is the victory of style over content. Sometimes when a film is supposedly about a real person, I think it best to forget that, or at least try to enjoy the film for it's own sake. Some things are taken for granted. No-one knows who killed the girls, so how do we know the same person killed them all? The thing that comes across most strongly when reading about the murders, is the incompetence of the police. Was a huge 'cover up' in operation? Again, no-one knows. For me, the film would have benefited from better editing, more character development,and less of them. I would still like to see more from the Hughes, at least the film was a brave attempt at something different.",5,1,3,29 June 2005
Jack Reacher," Oh dear!
","I have read and enjoyed most of Lee Childs 'Reacher' books. Like most people, I had a mental picture of Jack in my mind's eye, Tom Cruise is not it! As Tom produced it, I assume he can put whoever he likes in the part, was it just an ego trip that made him decide he was perfect for the part? the money? what? And we can only assume that Mr. Childs gave the go ahead, again, was it the money? Whatever the reasons a pretty boy actor, no matter how good, at 5' 7'' can't play a huge man of 6'5''. On top of that, the screenplay was a million miles away from the book, a cracker of a read, if you have not read it, forget the movie and read the book. If the movie had been made years ago, someone like Lee Marvin would have made a great Reacher, rugged, not too good looking and looks the part. Someone has suggested Ray Stevenson, an actor who also looks the part, good choice I think. The movie itself should be watched as an entertaining action movie, it's not at all bad, but it's not Jack Reacher. Will there be a franchise? I hope not!",5,1,4,3 February 2015
