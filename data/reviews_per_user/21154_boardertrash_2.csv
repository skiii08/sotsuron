Blade Runner 2049," How is BR2049 only 0.6 pts ahead of The Force Awakens
","????????????????????????
Please tell me because I thought IMDB was supposed to be a good representation.Blade Runner 2049 is an expertly crafted, stunningly beautiful work of art.If you enjoy Sci-Fi, have more than a few brain cells to rub together and can understand why some movies may have a slower pace than others you will love this.
If on the other hand you like a movie to hand everything to you on a plate, get impatient at slow movies and can't sit still for more than 2hrs then stay away. Stick to Daddy's Home 2 and anything with Nicolas Cage or the Rock in it.AMAZING",9,1,3,21 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last time...........
","Sadly this could be the last episode I watch.Myself, my wife and my best mate watched this during the opening weekend and we all came out disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original three, tolerated next 2 and enjoyed the revenge of the sith and the force awakens but this movie was jar jar binks poor.After 10 minutes my wife started looking at her phone and that probably tells you all you need to know. For the casual fan it is boring, too drawn out and contains forced, obvious and cringeworthy comedy.It just doesn't really go anywhere, the entire move is a chase scene where the pursued are running out of fuel, except they never do. Fin buggers off to phaff around a bit and comes back essentially empty handed and looks like a bit of a plonker. Don't even get me started on the bad guys, one is a complete cry baby, are we supposed to fear him?! and the other may as well be a long lost chuckle brother.I despair.I'm sure die hard fans will gush over this movie because it has Star Wars in the name but as a stand alone movie I'd rather sit through an episode of Towie whilst simultaneously receiving electroshock therapy.",5,1,2,21 December 2017
