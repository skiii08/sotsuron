Hereditary," Watch it twice
","I watch this movie for the second time recently, and i forgot how amazing it was. Even beyond the horror genre, the psychological drama is just portrayed so incredibly tormenting even more when i watched it for the second time since i'm already aware of the plots. Highly recommend to watch this movie more than once",9,2,4,20 June 2020
Us," The creepy atmosphere is fantastic
",But the pretentious and overly awkward storyline fails to keep interest,4,2,2,27 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Everybody's here
","A nice conclusion to the saga, it'll give you nerd chills",9,3,5,3 November 2019
Midsommar," Never do religions kids
","First of all, art direction 10/10. Yes it's somewhat predictable, just like any other thriller nowadays, but unlike some that takes overly pretentious route (*cough 'us'), this feels much more perceivable.",8,1,3,27 October 2019
Parasite," As someone who grew up with live-in maids and chauffeur
","I promise myself i wont get one myself when i'm older, for a good reason.Yes, One might argue there are plausible plot-holes, still the movie is easily one of the best thriller this year.",9,1,6,9 October 2019
Mother!," So absurd it's boring
","The way it's written it's just so laughably theatrical, none of the character make sense, none of the plot-points make sense, it's just infuriating for the sake of infuriating to the point it gets boring to watch. It's just a weak attempt of recreating 'rosemary's baby' nuance.",1,1,2,16 May 2020
