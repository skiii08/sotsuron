Minority Report," one of the best movies, ever.
","**SPOILERS** 'minority report' is one of the best movies i have ever seen. perhaps it was the suprise factor that took me, as i was sure im going to see just another action movie.the actors were great, one by one. the effect looked really good, and realistic. if you saw 'ai', you can see how well spielberg arranges his futiristic worlds. theyre never too made up - for example, the ads - when ppl at the minority report world walk into a shopping mall, each 'ad' uses the person's personal name - and actually, it IS quite reasonable that in the near future, ads might use your name.the script itself was quite amazing, thrilling, suprising, i can go on and on describing it, but a picture show is worth a thousand words. :)i am definitly buying the dvd.
SPOILER ALERT!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!these are my opinions on an alternate ending to the film:-
i think that the movie would have been 3 times better, if they had cut it when we saw a closeup on cruise's face when he's entered into jail.as in, when he goes to jail, BOOM - 'the end'. y'know, a 'brazil' homage. :)",10,0,0,7 October 2002
