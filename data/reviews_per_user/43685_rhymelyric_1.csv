Skyfall," A Good Bond movie for the die hard fans but not much else.
","This is a good movie. I just want to get that out of the way because I don't want to come of as bashing this movie as being bad, because it's not. The problem then is that this movie is not great. The feeling I got when watching this film can be compared to the feeling that fans of the Miami Heat had when they watched their team play it's first season after picking up LeBron James, they must of felt like ' this is good but should't it be even better?' This movie should have been better.If the movie was judged based on the intro song alone, it would easily be ranked higher than the previous Daniel Craig bond films but that is the only part of this movie that I liked better than the previous two. The things I like less are many, for instance, the mystery seemed to be solved too quickly, the villain never really seemed threatening enough, and the action seemed spaced to far apart and awkwardly implemented. In fact the pacing was probably the biggest killer for me, it was as if they did't know where they wanted the film to go next and they just added scenes until they figured it out. Then there is the character development that seemed to be nonexistent how supposedly important characters never really made an impact enough to be adored or loathed by the audience, they literally just seemed to come and go without attributing much at all too the story. I counted two charters that could have had most of their scenes cut and it wouldn't have made much of a difference at all to the movie. The villain never seemed crazy enough, or intelligent enough, or diabolical enough, he just seemed silly. I never felt suspense, I never felt surprised, I never felt on the edge of my seat or amazed by what I was seeing unfold before me. I felt all these things with the last two installments. Quantum of Solace for all it's negative reviews, can never be called boring but I was bored watching this. So why if there are so many things I dislike about this movie can I still call it good? Because I am jugging based on the extremely high standards set by the two D. Craig bond films before this one. Those movies were great and this movie is merely good, so this seems worse because of it. It all comes down to expectations and like the Heat fans who expected a championship performance every time their team hit the court, I expected a movie that left me wanting to buy a second ticket for a re-watch be got a movie that left me ready to go when it was over like some non-bond movie so leave your expectations at the door.",6,1,7,12 November 2012
