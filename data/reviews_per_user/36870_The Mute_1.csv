Requiem for a Dream," Yawn
","The cinematography in this film was amazing.  Ellen Burstyn was great. Overall I sat there wondering, am I supposed to care about these characters? They all bring their downfall upon themselves, so why should anyone care? Yeah drugs and addiction are bad...I think I saw that afterschool special already.",3,3,8,27 December 2001
