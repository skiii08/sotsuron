Blade Runner 2049," The movie loses its plot way too often.
","The first Blade Runner was a master piece.
I've watched 2049 now for a second time and apart from the visual aspect of the film, it doesn't have the impact of the original by a landslide.
The only reason I see for this is because the movie fails to hold on to its plotline, whichever one that is. Even at the end of the movie I'm not so sure what the story was.
The original Blade Runner had a simple story. It's a movie about a blade runner, hunting down skinjobs (with their own dramatic need), falling in love with one of them. That's it. The fact that there is a major philosophical undertone in this movie is what elevates it from an ordinary action flick to one of the ultimate cinema classics, BUT at no point during the movie does the movie deflect from what its plot is, a blade runner hunting skinjobs, falling in love with one of them.
Every single scene in the movie is in service of this plotline. Either Deckard is following a clue to get to his mark, or the marks are following their dramatic needs, or the love interest is established.
It does not go off on tangents to explain how this world works. It does so through scenes that at their core are serving the plot.
Priss charms Sebastian and we get to know about his disease and off-world and whatnot, BUT these scenes are in service of the plot. They want to get to their creator. Charming Sebastian is a way forward in their dramatic need.This is exactly what I missed in 2049.
Too many scenes do not drive the plot. Sure enough, it's because the plot itself is all over the place.
The movie is a visual wonder, but the story is severly lacking.
The scene with K and his 'girlfriend' at home, serves 0 plot function. It was just there to fill in an aspect about the world.Story mechanics, the way to write a screenplay, all the rules and do's and don't to construct a story are important. They are as fundamental to screenplay writing as are the rules for writing music.
Sure, you can string along any number of notes from amazing instruments in any way you like, but the resulting cacophony will not attract a lot of people.
For music this seems obvious to everyone, because we are all used to hearing songs (and subconsciously all the rules that come with music), so we naturally feel when something is off.
With movies, it seems a bit more difficult somehow.",7,1,3,7 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Either manipulated reviews or no clue
","This movie is not good.
It's plot's interesting (somewhat ripped from The Last of Us), but what the writers have done with it is absolutely dreadful.
It steals scenes from other horror greats and braids together this insufferable, nonsensical, clich√© ridden flick.
Suspension of disbelief is no longer needed, because apparently 10/10 reviewers will believe about anything, and they're proud to broadcast their clueless reviews made possible by the internet's 'everyone's opinion on anything counts' policy, and the fact that superlatives has been worn out to the stub, leaving them to rate everything on par with the greatest movies of all time.",4,4,7,23 May 2018
Warcraft," Sensible review from a movie-lover and long time wow-player
","Once you've plowed through all the tens and zeros fans and haters brand on frankly any movie these days, you might be looking for a sensible review if you haven't thrown your arms in the air yet by now. Well, let me make an attempt. As a movie, Warcraft fails on a few levels. As a fanpiece there's enough there to make you smile and enjoy the world you're already very familiar with...except there where the lore takes off in a direction I can't for the life of me remember happening that way.The movie suffers somewhat from an all too familiar ailment when making these epic multi-character stories. Not enough investment in the characters leads to you not caring for them at all. The story centers largely around Lothar, Garona, Khadgar and Durotan. Now for people who are familiar with Warcraft lore, there's not a lot to fill in for you. You know these characters and what their feats have been, you have already an emotional investment in them even before the movie started. For people who are not familiar with them however, the movie largely fails to deliver on that front. I went to see with a friend, who is not familiar with the universe, and at the end he admitted not caring for any of the characters in the movie. There is no real exposition of who these characters are and what they believe in, except maybe for Durotan, who gets a little more color. They were also looking for a female lead and I guess Garona was it, for lack of any other alternative. She gets a bit pasted onto the story, and gets more screen-time than her character actually deserves story-wise. Good stories are either plot driven or character driven. It becomes a bit of a mess if the story can't really decide which one it wants to be, which is the case in Warcraft. It tries to tell us who these character are, but we don't get deep enough into any of them for them to drive the movie; and the plot is not really all that impressive either, there is no intrigue or suspense, just a lot of clobbering, the occasional spellcast and a bit of character parading. Stories are driven, because they should literally move you emotionally from one place to another, be it through a fear, an anticipation, through experiencing a characters emotional change, etc. None of that was present in Warcraft.The acting is not very good. In fact the acting of the cgi orcs was far better than most human performances. The human side lacked a bit of presence, while the orcs are quite impressive. Travis and Paula do what they can with the little they have. Again due to a lack of character development, which even a romantic nudge between the two and the storyline with Anduins son can't help, they remain very two-dimensional. Seasoned actors will often fill that void themselves with what they believe should be the character, but that's not a given when working with a fairly young cast. I've seen better performances from most these actors in other movies.The music is one of the better things in the movie, from Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi. The score definitely felt Warcraft. The cinematography is not bad, and manages in this cgi heavy setting to deliver some awesome pictures. Fans will smile at accurate depictions of familiar settings...even flightpoints in Stormwind.Overall, this is a fanfilm. You'll enjoy the familiarity of it's settings and you'll fill in the blanks with your own knowledge and in the end you'll find it OK. For movie-lovers without any warcraft knowledge however, this movie will not entice you at all.",6,2,3,3 June 2016
