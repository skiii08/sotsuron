The King's Speech," Wow...completely not what I had expected!
","I'll keep it short...if you are having thoughts that this is another docu-drama - WRONG! I complained frequently about not wanting to see this , but after being persuaded I realize now that I almost missed one of the goodies! I normally don't get emotional about any movie I watch...but this one had me moved. And as a subject of the British Empire, I'm proud! The cinematography is excellent and the actors deliver such a compelling account of this unique relationship. And of course that subtle British humour pokes through every now and then...seriously, a guffaw is in order. I will not give anything away...but think about your very best friend and think about the best thing you have done for each other...then watch this movie and think again. The bond of friendship that develops based on random encounters will make you appreciate that best friend. 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,22 July 2011
