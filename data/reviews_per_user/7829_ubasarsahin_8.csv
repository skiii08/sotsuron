Us," Wha?
","I've seen a lot of good reviews about this movie before I watch it and I believed that was gonna be really good movie. But it wasn't at all.. I am really regretful right now because my 2 hours has gone to garbage.. How the people liked this movie and how can they write good reviews about this garbage? I don't understand them... Actually, I didn't like the other movie of director called 'Get Out' either. It was garbage in my opinion, like this movie. I wanted to give one more chance to director. I wish I hadn't. So, poor me.. My 2 hours and money won't come back..",4,3,7,27 March 2019
