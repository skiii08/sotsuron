Requiem for a Dream," Really Messes With Your Head... Kubrick Would be Proud
","My friends and I joke that this movie should take the place of the Dare program, but with the intense visuals, engaging story and characters, and the last 15 minutes, I can't help but to wonder.The story revolves around four individuals (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connoly, and Ellyn Burnstyn) who become victims of their own addictions (Heroin, Cocaine, and Diet Pills), and thus begins the downward spiral. I'm not going to go into great detail about the spiral, because, quite frankly, it's not something I want to think about.The combination of great acting with superb directing is what places this film among some of the best ever committed to celluloid. What particularly surprised me was Marlon Wayans; having only seen him in dumb comedies (Scary Movie 1 & 2, Don't be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the 'Hood), he actually proves his acting chops in this role. This isn't to diminish the other actors, though. After all, 'Requiem' is an ensemble effort.Arronofsky really takes care in building up the characters before breaking them down, and by the end, you're left with nothing but a requiem.On a side note: I've sat through slasher flicks, I've seen my share of ghost stories and psychological thrillers, but this is the only movie to date that has ever given me nightmares. If that doesn't say anything about a movie, I don't know what does.",9,0,1,1 August 2005
Spider-Man 2," BETTER! THAN! THE! FIRST! (some spoilers)
","I was excited when the first Spidey movie was finally going to be released, seeing as I was waiting for it to see theaters since I was 12 years old. Once I finally saw it, I was rather satisfied. There were a few flaws, I will admit, but overall, it was still a dream come true. I believed that Spider-man re-defined the standard of what comic book movies should be.Now that I've seen 'Spider-Man 2,' I was beyond floored! Whatever flaws that were apparent in the first movie have been rectified. The story was fantastic, it was almost like it was a living comic book. You can definitely suspend and disbelieve in this one.Tobey Maguire has also become more comfortable in his role as Peter Parker. He's just as I envisioned him to be, a normal guy who happens to have superpowers, and is trying to maintain a semblance of a normal life.Kirsten Dunst is once again fabulous as Mary Jane Watson; my only complaint about her is since she liked the red wig in the first movie, she tried dying her whole hair red in the second, and it really didn't work...she looks more strawberry blonde (I know, I know, I'm nitpicking).The choice of Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus was fantastic; Doc Ock is my favorite Spider-Man villain, and he did the character justice.Most improved award goes to James Franco. His Harry Osborn seemed a bit wooden in the first movie for my taste; this time around, he's a lot looser, and his ability has improved drastically! I can't wait to see what Sam Raimi has in store for him come Spider-Man 3.The supporting cast was just as good as in the first movie. Bill Nunn as Robbie Robertson, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May Parker. I loved every minute of them on screen.What really floored me was seeing Willem Dafoe make an appearance as Norman Osborn's ghost! For those familiar with the Spider-Man comics, you all know how much of an influence Norman Osborn has had even after his Death. Which brings me to...Sam Raimi. If I ever get a chance to meet him, I want to give him a hug. He is the best example of getting a director who knows the source material (are you listening Warner Brothers?). He knows that if you stay loyal to the story, the moviegoers will come.Spider-Man 2 is now the third example of a comic book movie surpassing its original; the other two examples are Superman 2 and X2: X-Men United. It's also earning its honor of being called not only one of the best comic movies, but rather one of he best movies ever made!",10,0,0,28 July 2004
Crash," One of the most powerful movies I've ever seen...
","...and that's saying a lot.I managed to catch this movie with some friends who brought it on DVD, and I must say that this is a very intense viewing experience. For those of you who are looking for a blow-by-blow summary of the movie, all I can really say is that I can't explain it; you really have to see it for yourself, and that's to be taken literally. All of the characters and plot lines are so intricately interwoven together that it takes a flowchart to truly understand it without it being seen.This isn't to say that 'Crash' isn't without its flaws. Some of the twists seem a bit far-fetched to me, such as a racist cop who feels a woman up ending up rescuing her the very next day, or another cop trying to intervene on a black screenwriter's behalf, and that's only two small parts out of over 40! One last thing about this movie; no film has ever driven me to tears before; 'Crash' is the first. And I am a very hard man to drive to tears.",10,6,14,11 September 2005
Dreamgirls," Superior Performances by All
","Dreamgirls is a movie that explores the highs and lows of the singing business that parallels the rise and fall of Motown. It features a cast that screams 'black star power,' and fortunately the movie isn't carried by its star power alone.First off is the plot of the movie itself. It flows smoothly with the musical numbers actually being a part of the plot; enhancing it, without stopping any of the action, which is the sign of a good latter-day musical. The only flaw in this section is that it's all too short. There wasn't any time to show any of the characters' growth (or in some cases, downfall), but seeing the events unfold will definitely capture the imagination.Most important is the performances: Jamie Foxx does a fantastic job of acting and singing; it may not be Oscar-worthy, but he definitely didn't phone this performance in. The dubious nature of his character makes it difficult for the viewer to want to either side with him, or despise him.Beyonce shows immense potential as an actress. While her character is obviously based on Diana Ross, Beyonce takes the role and makes it her own. It will be interesting to see what she puts forth in the future.Most people my age will remember that a long time ago, Eddie Murphy made a record album. While we tend to make fun of it nowadays, his performance is nothing to laugh at. He makes the most out of his character who wants yet another shot to be at the top again (perhaps a parallel for his career?).Last, but definitely not least, is Jennifer Hudson. Now, I'm proud to say that I've never watched an episode of American Idol, and I didn't hear until after I've seen it that Ms. Hudson lost somewhere close to the end. That being said, she definitely doesn't sound like a loser to me. She takes her role and gives it everything she's got, which goes to show that Simon Cowell is not the end-all be-all when it comes to talent.The set design and camera-work is nothing to behold, it's very straightforward, but there is nothing that distracts from the overall product either.Overall, this is a movie that's worth paying full-price admission to, highly recommended!",8,0,3,3 January 2007
The Truman Show," A Masterpiece
","I remember when this movie first came out in the theater, and I had a chance to catch it. Back then, it was considered a vast departure for Jim Carrey, seeing as he's only been in comedies such as the Ace Ventura movies. In retrospect, 'The Truman Show' was only a harbinger of the kind of acting he could do. But it wasn't his movie alone, Andrew Niccol's script and Peter Weir's direction and the rest of the cast that make this movie work on so many levels.One level in which 'The Truman Show,' along with its counterpart, 'Ed TV' works, is that both movies pre-date the whole 'reality TV' craze by a good 2 or 3 years. Oh, we had 'The Real World' but that was the extent of it...this was before MTV was milking its incarnations for all its worth, and definitely before 'Survivor,' 'The Simple Life,' and those 'Celebreality' shows on VH1. The scenes in which people react to the things Truman does and hang on his every movement is no different than how people tune in for the next episode of 'Survivor' waiting on who will be 'voted off the island.' Another theme that is evident in the movie is the desire for absolute control as shown in the character of Christof. He has structured Truman's world as to who could or couldn't talk to him, using any means necessary to keep him on the island, and ultimately losing. While it seems that Christof has a connection to Truman, he is merely a means to an end, which is a televised life, from cradle to grave.One thing that I need to point out again is Jim Carrey's acting. 'The Truman Show' is his first serious role, departing from the sight-gag movies of his earlier career. His acting is so reserved, and yet, there are funny moments of his, but it doesn't break from the tone of the movie or his overall character. Everyone was caught by surprise in this apparent 180, especially film critic duo Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. They were so impressed by Carrey that they publicly apologized to him for panning 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.' Overall, this movie, I like to fall under the category one of the best films ever made. On my hierarchy of movies, I would put this under 'Worth full price/add this to your DVD collection.' Grade: A+",10,0,0,6 January 2006
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Most Triumphant!
","Long Ago, I caught this movie on cable, and have since regulated it to my VCR. I don't know what happened to the tape, but just for the sake of nostalgia (and because I had a friend who has never seen it before) I checked it out on DVD and was pleasantly surprised again.For those of you who don't know, Rufus (George Carlin), an agent from a future Utopia is sent back in time to ensure that Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) pass their history report so that they can form their band, Wyld Stallyns, and bring peace to the universe.There are some very cheesy elements to this film, such as the pair acting like total dimwits (Joan of Arc was NOT Noah's Wife), and the aspect of bringing figures from history to our own time is completely unbelievable, but the cheesiness is what makes the movie enjoyable. it doesn't take itself very seriously, and it has a pretty good running length.'Bill and Ted' spawned forth an animated show (with the actors from the movie doing the voices, also recommended), a live action show (somewhat enjoyable, but you could tell the franchise was running out of steam) and an enjoyable sequel that wrapped everything up nicely. Overall, a good way to kill an afternoon.",8,4,8,1 August 2005
Rock Star," What do I say about a movie that is, by definition, bad, and yet, I like it anyway?
","I say, 'best nothing I ever spent,' that's what! A word of explanation: I went to Hasting's to take an unrelated movie back, which was really scratched, explained that some scenes didn't even play, and they gave me a rain check for a free rental, and I came across Rock Star.Mark Whalburg plays a lead singer of a cover (or a 'tribute') band and gets the chance of a lifetime when he's called forth to replace the lead singer in the band that he idolizes. Not much to it, really...it kind of speeds through the whole story, which is a good thing. If it got bogged down in the whole clichés of rock-and-roll, it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable.Acting was pretty much solid, nothing too much to complain about. Not too shabby from the guy who directed 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.' Good for a rental, especially a free one!",6,1,2,9 August 2005
