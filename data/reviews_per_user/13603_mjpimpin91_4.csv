Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Starts the Final Road to Finishing George Lucas' six movie saga.
","First off, let me put this up front right away. I am a MAJOR Star Wars fan. I read everything expanded universe (stuff outside the movies such as books, comics, etc.) and could write you humongous essays on Star Wars lore. One thing that people who are uneducated on Star Wars lore fell to realize is that THIS. IS. NOT. A. REMAKE. IT'S CALLED EPISODE ONE FOR A REASON. IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE TALE OF STAR WARS. THAT'S WHY DARTH VADER IS A LITTLE BOY CALLED ANAKIN. HE'S NOT DARTH YET. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE TWO MORE FILMS FEATURING ANAKIN GROWING UP AND BECOMING DARTH VADER! Now that I've yelled that, I'm going to quote Carlos Mencia. All the people who say that it's not as good as the original, that's because you were kids when the original came out. NOTHING will be as good as it was then. So just shut UP! Yes, the film was targeted at children. Now, to address Jar Jar. I liked him. He showed an advancment in CG. This is what George Lucas does. He is a brilliant film-maker (excluding Howard the Duck) and his forte is film-making advancement. He practically LIVES to advance technology. If not for Jar-Jar, people might not have a lot of advancements in cinematography that they take for granted. Now for my actual review...the film starts off at the beginning of Anakins Skywalker's tale...A.K.A. Darth Vader. But he's not Darth Vader yet. He is a small boy, approximately nine years of age, who starts off on his journey to being a Jedi in this film. Episodes II and III continue this epic, finishing with Anakin finally becoming Vader, which opens up for Episodes IV, V, and VI. Most people will hate this rant I have went on, but oh well. I personally applaud Mr. Lucas for making this film. He has a voice, and he had a dream, and he had a story, and he was going to tell it one way or the other.",10,3,6,12 October 2008
Underworld," A very good movie with strong acting and good fight sequences.
","The darkness in this movie was what initially attracted me. I am a fan of things dark and macabre, and the cover art of the film almost made me salivate with joy. I went into this movie thinking, 'Dark, creepy, Gothic setting along the lines of Gothic horror...', and I wasn't disappointed. From the opening scene, I was enraptured by the visuals. The costume design is stunning, as are the special effects. My favorite thing about the movie is the depth of the vampire and Lycan history. I also love the scenes involving Bill Nighy, who is an excellent actor. I would recommend this movie to vampire aficionados as a must buy, because it is simply excellent. My only one complaint, however, was the lack of martial arts action, which the movie threw out and instead focused on guns. I know the only way to kill the Lycans was with silver nitrate and the vamps with UV bullets, but I was anxiously waiting for an actual fight scene, and I was rewarded at the very end. Hopefully the sequel will fulfill these wishes to a better degree.",10,0,0,12 October 2008
Schindler's List," Amazing heartfelt film.
","This is one of the few films that has ever made me cry. First off, I have to say that the cinematography in this film is beautiful, and the acting is off the charts. Liam Neeson gives a heartfelt performance, and Steven Spielberg's directorial skill give this movie and edge not to be messed with. I have to say, this movie touches your crying spot with the final scene, showing all the surviving members of the List. Absolutely amazing film. Another comment on cinematography was the girl in the red dress. I applaud Spielberg's choice of allowing her dress to show, highlighting her in the crowd and the later when bodies are being loaded, her dress shines bright among the dead. This proves to be the catalyst that makes Schindler's quest all the more important. The last act when all the Jewish people are freed and Schindler goes on the run, one word comes to mind for this...Enthralling. Liam Neeson hits the character spot on, and his heartfelt sentiments at not being able to save more induces tears in your eyes. Bravo. Bravo.",10,13,22,12 October 2008
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Visual Feast!!!
","Watching this after reading the novel by Roald Dahl shows that Gene Wilder's interpretation of Willy Wonka was off by miles. Johnny Depp IS Willy Wonka, and steps into this role with such panache that it's almost as if the version with Gene Wilder doesn't exist. I have encountered nay-sayers that swear this film is to dark for children, and that Johnny acts to much like Michael Jackson. I say...shut up! This movie is so faithful to the book, it's as if the characters are stepping off the page. And Willy SHOULD be creepy and dark...I mean, this guy makes CANDY for a living, and his factory is UNDERGROUND. Tim Burton is a genius, and this movie is just one more added to his reportoire of brilliant movies. I love how everything in the film has a surreal quality, as if your constantly on an E-trip (for those socially illiterate, E is a drug...). Beautiful movie that gets across the message...kids shouldn't be spoiled little brats.",10,2,4,12 October 2008
