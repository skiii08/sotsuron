Mission: Impossible III," Good Job Cruise!!
","I did not like the 2 first MI movies at all.. but this one was great - It's entertainment at it's best.. It's got all a good action movie needs to have. Cruise was very good; more convincing and natural in his role as Ethan Hunt than in the first 2 movies.Story line had a very good flow and the entire cast showed some good acting skills. The action scenes are superb and the fights are not overdone, like in MI-2 (e.g Cruise's kung foo kind of kicks in situation when good old street tactics would have done the job)- you'll be delighted to find that MI-3 fights are just right.All in all it's one of these rare action movies that gives you a positive exciting feeling. It is definitely worth your while!",10,1,2,10 November 2006
