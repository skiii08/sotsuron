Black Swan," Why?
","I must say... I can see why Hollywood went crazy over this movie. It has all that they promote. Cursing, alcohol, drugs, sex, lesbianism, self-gratification,self-loathing,craziness... It was somewhat confusing in it's theme. It skipped back and forth between reality and fantasy. I wasn't sure what was what. The mother's role was a little twisted, I didn't quite understand her role. The other dancers associations to 'the swan' were strange, jealousy, anger, pride, revenge... I saw no real caring from any character toward another. It took ballet to a whole new dark level. I know that was what the director wanted, and he succeeded.",1,6,13,31 December 2011
