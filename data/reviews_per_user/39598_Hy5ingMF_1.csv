The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch lives up to the Hype!
","There has been a lot of hype surrounding the Blair Witch Project, so much that it has been sold out around the country and rightfully so.The 'Project' is an innovative and ground breaking film.  This film proves that a good story can overcome any other weaknesses within a film.  The greatest images that the 'Project' provides are those which are left to the viewers imagination.  This film definitely lives up to the hype behind it.",9,1,2,20 July 1999
