Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," this movie is very good to hell with all you phonies
",first i am sick of all the whining i always ignore those who whine and complain i saw the phantom menace more than once and i had no problems with it.its one of my favorites and after may 19 i will know which one i liked the best.who cares about the reviews i liked everything about it and it was very different and it was weird not to see Darth Vader but i still liked it very much. the whiners are not real fans so i just do not care what anybody says. between the first 2 this one is my favorite there was nothing wrong with the story at all the only problem is the whiners and the phony fans who say they know everything about star wars.,10,2,5,22 March 2005
