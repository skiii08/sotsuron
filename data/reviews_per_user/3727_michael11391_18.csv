Changeling," One of the best movies of 08'!!
","Angelina Jolie gives her best performance of her career. While Jolie shows her beauty and classy looks her, she was absolutely picture perfect for the role of the brave, strong & emotional Christina Collins. I praise Clint Eastwood for making this movie and casting great talented actors for supporting: John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffery Donovan and Jason Butler Harner gives one of the best supporting role performances in a movie. Changeling is beautiful, heartfelt, haunting and amazing brilliant film that captured my heart and made me feel so bad of what happened to Christina Collins. Not only the movie is so amazing, it sends a strong message about how brave single mothers are and would give their life away if their child was found missing or taken. Angelina Jolie did that without overacting, she did everything an actress could do to give the Oscars a hard time and give them some second thoughts of who they would choose. I've seen this three times and I'm very sure that Angelina Jolie deserves the Oscar more than Streep, Winslet, Leo & Hathaway. She was the better of the five, in my opinion.",10,6,7,18 February 2009
42," Uplifting, earnest, brilliantly-acted, well-told & entertaining translates to being one of the best baseball movies ever made.
","The first movie of 13' i've seen, well actually the straight-to-DVD spoof 30 Nights of Paranormal Activity with the Devil Inside the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was but doesn't matter. 42 is exactly what I expected: an uplifting, earnest, well-told with honest emotion, well-acted & often entertaining flick of the legend Jackie Robinson. Chadwick Boseman (I remember him in the underrated The Express) soars as Jackie Robinson with great emotion & intensity, he hits it out of the ballpark. Harrison Ford gives one of his best performances of his career (award-worthy) as General Manager Branch Rickey. Nicole Beharie (who was also in The Express) is rock-solid as Robinson's wife Rachel.The supporting players are great especially Andre Holland as Wendell the reporter, Alan Tudyk as the very mean-spirited Phillies manager Ben Chapman, Lucas Black as Pee Wee Rose, John G. McGinley as the announcer Red Barber & Christopher Meloni as the Brooklyn Dodgers manager (Robinson's as well). The classic use of music is awesome. 42 is one of the best baseball flicks ever made, it's that good IMO. Star-making performances from Boseman & Beharie, hopefully we'll see more from both in the future. A great movie from Oscar-winning writer/director Brian Helgeland (as writer, L.A. Confidential, Mystic River, Man on Fire). Now, let's make a Roberto Clemente biopic on the big screen please.",10,2,4,12 April 2013
Finding Nemo," One of the most stunning, amazing animated films of our time!!!
","Finding Nemo is one of the all-time animated feature i've ever seen, it should of gotten nominated for Best Picture and it was the best film of 2003!! It's one of the most visually, entertaining & classic animated films in years. Albert Brooks & Ellen Degeneres (especially) did their most & unforgettable performances of their career and had many memorable lines!! Others did excellent, Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) made a memorable Australain pelican and Gill (Willem Dafoe) did well, too. One of greatest animated films ever made and funniest. It's one of Pixar's best. It was like i said, the best film of 2003. Pixar are just unstoppable!!",10,0,3,3 November 2004
Yes Man," Yes Man is Jim Carrey's best film to date and he is back!!
","I saw a free screening of this hilarious movie in my hometown and it was MAGNIFICENT!!! It starts off fast and never slows down (never a dull moment in the movie) and for fans of Jim Carrey (like me) who wants him to be himself, prepare to laugh so extremely hard that will have your sides in excruciating pain from all the laughter you made!! Jim Carrey was at his very best & he made me laugh non-stop till' the end of the movie but it was not a one-man show, the supporting cast threw in some fantastic delivery lines, humor & craziness. Zooey Deschanel was surprisingly very funny (didn't know she could be THIS funny), Bradley Cooper was funny, Terence Stamp did great as well but out of all of the supporting cast, there are two of them that had some of the funniest scenes in movie history: Rhys Darby plays the memorable and hilarious boss of Carl Allen (Carrey), he had some classic and unbelievable delivery lines in the movie that were just funny. And the other person: Fionnula Flanaghan who plays the nasty, sexually & very funny neighbor of Carl Allen and delivers us one of the most disgusting & very funny scenes in years (not giving you spoilers)!! Yes Man is not only a very, very funny but it sends a good message about how do you want to handle your life.",10,40,74,13 December 2008
Shutter Island," One of Scorsese's best work & the best film of the year so far.
","Just saw it 30 minutes ago or so and I absolutely loved it. Martin Scorsese is one of the best and most intelligent directors of all-time and proved it once again in this, his new movie 'Shutter Island'. The movie is interesting, crazy-minded & creepy from beginning to end. Leo Dicaprio gives another Oscar-worthy performance here and it's one of his best performances of his career. The score is also Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is superb. Now, a lot of people thought coming in this was going to be a scary, horror film based on the previews. It is not, it is a psychological thriller that messes with your mind and keeps you guessing a lot. Shutter Island is an amazing achievement from Martin Scorsese who redefined the genre that Alfred Hitchcock created. Despite it's confusing, seemed forced 'twist' ending that didn't work, Shutter Island is an instant thriller classic in my books. The movie should get nominated for Best Lead Actor Performance by Dicaprio, Cinematography & Score. Can Shutter Island not be forgotten by votersof Oscar chances for a year?",10,1,7,21 February 2010
Watchmen," Watchmen is a visually, eye-catching great movie.
","Let me start off with the visual effects. The visual effects are amazing to say the least, the visuals for Dr. Manahattan were exhilarating and very well-made! One of the best visual effects ever put on film and for fans who loves Dr. Manahattan, will not be disappointed. Which brings to performances, Malin Akerman was absolutely bad ass as Silk Spectre and was awesome in this, in the next few years people are going to remember her for this role, look for more of her in the future of movies. Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg/Night Owl II gave a very good performance, good actor. But the highlights of the film are: Billy Crudup and Jackie Earle Haley. Billy Crudup was absolutely perfect and wasn't just playing Dr. Manahattan, he was him. Jackie Earle Haley had my favorite performance in the movie, let's just say he OWNED as Rorschach and was just as good as Heath Ledger's amazing performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight only difference, he wasn't a villain. Both Crudup and Haley gave Oscar-worthy performances, they both should get the nod. And last but not least, Jeffery Dean Morgan did a great job as The Comedian but I expected it more from him.Who do watches the Watchmen? I do and i'm telling you to watch this spectacular film, you won't be disappointed. Watchmen is indeed a very long movie but that doesn't matter because the visual effects, performances and action-packed cool sequences won't bore you at all. The movie is complex & doesn't have any villains, there's just good guys/bad guys all around and that's the brief spoiler I will give you. P.S., another spoiler: those who are expecting crazy & unnecessary slow-mo's are wrong, the slow-mo's were awesome and wasn't used that much, Snyder put those slow-mo's at the right and perfect scenes.",9,2,5,7 March 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Monsters Vs. Aliens is one of Dreamworks Animation best work, it's very fun and entertaining.
","I just saw MvA and it was fun, entertaining & sometimes very funny. It was better than Kung Fu Panda & Madagascar 2, it was one of Dreamworks Animation best. Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett & Rainn Wilson as the main villain Gallaxhar were great and fun to watch. But Seth Rogen as B.O.B & Stephen Colbert as the President stole the show with memorable characters, they were funny as hell!! I liked the good visuals, the nice 50's look at alien invasions and mainly the action-packed sequences (surprised how great the action was in this). It wasn't as funny as I expected it to be but I still laughed hard out loud a couple times as well a few more laughs at other scenes as well. The action sequences though, is surprisingly well-made and loved it. Monsters Vs. Aliens is like The Incredibles of Dreamworks Animation, The Incredibles is the best & most action-packed feature from Pixar and this Monsters Vs. Aliens from Dreamworks Animation (more action than Kung Fu Panda, in my opinion). Monsters Vs. Aliens is a very fun, entertaining, very funny & action-packed and one of Dreamworks Animation best features yet!!",9,2,10,27 March 2009
Ratatouille," Pixar is 8 for 8!
","The best pixar movie yet! After last year's disappointment Cars, pixar came back big with probably one of the greatest animated movies we ever had. The most enjoyable movie i've seen this year (also: Spidey 3 and Transformers.) I've seen this movie two times already and i will buy it on DVD! I mean you can watch this movie a billion times and you never get tired of watching this!! It has a great look of the always beautiful Paris, France, fantastic voice work, of course beautiful animation, some good laughs and even a little bit of drama. plus: the short film is the funniest 5 minutes of any Pixar short! Ratatouille is the kind of a movie that attracts a million people.",10,1,2,7 October 2007
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Thunder hands down, the funniest movie of the year and one of the most unforgettable, funniest films in years!!!
","Lights, Camera & Action!!! Just what i expected: non-stop laughs, action, Ben Stiller being Ben Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr. stealing the show, Tom Cruise's funniest role of his entire career, up and coming actor Brandon T. Jackson showing us everything from his arsenal and Jack Black finally being him old self at being very crazy and absolutely hilarious!! Tropic Thunder is an instant comedy classic and will have you laughing out of your seats a bunch of times, it is better and funnier than Pineapple Express & Step Brothers in my opinion and just blew them out of the water!!! Being a Ben Stiller fan, i think this is his best film since There's Something About Mary. What Robert Downey, Jr. did for Iron Man, he did for this movie and quickly becoming one of my favorite actors and definitely gets an Oscar nod from me for either the roles of Tropic Thunder or Iron Man. Jack Black did a great job at finally doing his special talent: making people laugh and haven't been doing that since Nacho Libre (I thought that was his funniest movie since, that movie was very funny, in my opinion.) For those who wants to know what Tom Cruise did, i'll give you two big words: FREAKING HILARIOUS!! He was absolutely crazy and had me falling out of my seat every time until his role came to a close!!! And for Brandon T. Jackson (mostly everybody don't know who he is but i think this show should refresh your minds: Nick Cannon's Show: Wild N'Out.) He also was in 2005's Roll Bounce with Bow Wow. He was amazingly hilarious with the back and forth action between him and Downey, Jr. Well, the movie was hilarious throughout and had my sides burning just what expected from the movie and it's a comedy classic!! Cut!!! My work here is done.",10,11,26,12 August 2008
Wreck-It Ralph," One of the most adorable & enjoyable animated flicks to come along in a long time.
","One of the most enjoyable & adorable animated flicks i've seen. First off, this could have easily been a Pixar film. It had that feel to it, storytelling, characters & short before the movie 'Paperman', which was one of the best animated shorts i've seen. I loved the hell out of that short. Terrfic vocal performances from the actors. John C. Reilly is excellent as Ralph. Jane Lynch is great as Sgt. Calhoun. Alan Tudyk is awesome as King Candy. Jack McBrayer is one of biggest highlights here, giving an enjoyable & hilarious vocal performance as Fix-It Felix.The best actor of the lot belongs to Sarah Silverman who gives one of her best if not the best performance of her movie career. I'm a fan of Silverman's (weirdly), I weirdly like hearing every single crazy thing that pops out of her mind that also comes out of her mouth. She has that 'Kewpie doll' personality and puts it all on the line with the character Vanellope. Just a very adorable, very cute & lovable character voiced brilliantly by Silverman. I've always wanted the Oscars to have a animated vocal performance category, had they done that, I would immediately just give the Oscar to Sarah, period.Wreck-It Ralph is hands down, adorable, funny, action-packed, entertaining & well-made. I'm a video gamer (of course, PS1, PS2, PS3, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Gamecube & Gameboy), I used to play arcade but not anymore. Brings out nostalgia & all gamers will easily get pleased (like me) with this. This is a just a good, old-fashion hopefully Oscar-winning animated movie.",10,1,1,5 November 2012
The Dark Knight," One of the best movies in movie history and one of the greatest superhero movies ever made!!
","Just saw it and MASTERPIECE!!!! One of the most fun and amazing experiences i've had at the movies ever. Terrific performances from Christian Bale, Gary Oldman (the most under-appreciated actor today), Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman. The best out of them is of course The Joker himself: Heath Ledger (RIP, this guy could have been one of the greatest actors we would ever see). He stole the movie and delivered one of the most thrilling, powerful & amazing performances in movie history. For those who haven't seen it, GO SEE IT IMMEDIATELY, it has everything you want out of a Batman movie or any action movie: dazzling action sequences, amazing acting, funny, epicness & Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's powerful, amazing and emotional score. Nolan is a genius filmmaker.",10,1,3,18 July 2008
Up," Pixar launches their funniest film out of their tank to date.
","What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.The movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.Just brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of 'robot' dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.Up is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10.",10,165,258,21 May 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," More Than Worth The Wait.
","It was a gift!! More like a huge gift on my most anticipated film of the year, my god what a film! Transformers 2 is non-stop action-packed, exciting, funny & visually stunning. Reprising his role, Shia Lebeouf does a great, great job (did better here than in this first) using his own comedic style and full of emotions. Megan Fox is hotter than ever, had a little more to do here than in the original and did barely OK but still NEEDS to work on her acting, needs to fire her agent pronto!! Newcomer, Isabel Lucas does fairly well with her part. As for others reprising their roles: John Turturro, John Duhamel and Tyrese does their part very well like they did in the first. The Autobots and Decepticons were awesome and cooler than ever.While, I loved the first Transformers, I loved this one even more. For those awful negative reviews, what you expect? Iron Man, The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2? Transformers is never known for acting or it's plot, just robots beating the crap out of each other, full of non-stop action & the spectacular special and visual effects which is all we probably need from a Transformers movie. Back to the movie, like I said the visual effects are spectacular and the action almost never lets up. Steve Jablonsky's score is not as epic as the first but still, it's outstanding, very different (in a good way) and ONE of his best in my opinion. Transformers 2 might not take the title for the best summer movie of the year with Up and Star Trek in front of it but it's sure hell one of the best this year!!",8,51,99,25 June 2009
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Two very talented & comedic teen stars are on the rise!!!
","And their names are: Michael Cera and Kat Dennings!!! Cera and Dennings really made a good team in this movie and they nailed it. The movie was just I expected: funny, romantic, gross & sweet. The breakout role belonged to Ari Graynor (Caroline), she stole every scene she was in!! She came out of nowhere and brought her A game, getting so drunk, being gross and last but not least: The chewing gum scenes!! It was absolutely disgusting & so gross that will keep you thinking how in the world could an actor pulled those stuff off easily?!! Really a good romantic teen comedy and if your fans of Cera or Dennings or enjoyed Superbad & Juno, then you won't be disappointed!!!",8,5,11,3 October 2008
Defiance," One of the most amazing true war stories i've seen in a long time!
","First off, let's start off with the performances by Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber & Jamie Bell. They gave extraordinary performance especially Craig & Schreiber, Oscar-worthy performances by both & for Bell, not an Oscar-worthy performance but an excellent performance for a bright young star. All of them did the accents very well and gave as good as they got!! Defiance, one of the most amazing movies i've seen is a Oscar-eligible film for me because of how powerful the scenes were, the epic score by James Newton Howard & the acting. It's a great movie treat for the start of 2009. The movie is so moving and powerful that you can't even imagine after the movie is finish, you'll want go back and buy tickets again for this movie because you won't get enough of it!!",10,11,27,8 January 2009
WALL·E," WALL-E is one of the most cutest, lovable characters Pixar ever invented!!
","Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar best film so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which I thought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is the best Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind and Finding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one. WALL-E will forever be remembered as one of the most lovable characters ever created on film!!!",10,385,578,26 June 2008
Toy Story 3," The best of the series in one of the best trilogies of all-time.
","11 years of waiting for a third and it was worth the damn wait. My goodness what a fantastic film, one of the best second sequels of all-time. It's great to see all (well, almost) the characters back. Randy Newman is back as the composer and gives another Oscar-worthy score. Toy Story 3 from the beginning to the end has very clever storytelling (they better win for screenplay at the Oscars next year), laughs, tears & action thanks to Pixar as is the case with them. This movie is amazing, mix with lots of laughs & tears. The ending will make you cry even if you don't want to, it will make you cry. Very easily, the best film of the year kicks Kick-Ass off the spot of the best film of the year. Toy Story 3 is another masterpiece from Pixar, their second best in my opinion (behind a three-way tie Wall-E, Finding Nemo & Ratatouille).",10,1,2,19 June 2010
Looper," One of the already many best sci-fi flicks of the last 4 years along with The Adjustment Bureau, Source Code, District 9 & Inception.
","Looper is thought-provoking, original, entertaining, action-packed, funny, intelligent & well-made movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is terrific as usual with the makeup most of his face to make himself look like Bruce Willis physically, toning down his voice and mannerisms to Bruce Willis as well. Bruce Willis is great, he's back in action once again (he's having himself a good year with this, Moonrise Kingdom & The Expendables 2). Jeff Daniels (reunited with both Gordon-Levitt & Johnson the director) is terrific in his small role. Emily Blunt (who is one of the best working young actresses today) gives the best performance of the cast as a vigilante mother who lives in a farm with her 'gifted' son.Rian Johnson is definitely a director to look out for after this, The Brothers Bloom & Brick under his belt, very talented guy. Nathan Johnson's score is worth-mentioning. Looper is now one of my top 5 favorite films of the year. Fantastic stuff.",10,0,3,20 October 2012
