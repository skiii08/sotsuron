Captain Phillips," Very good film.
","Awesome! Fantastic! Nail biting tension! Heart pumping action. This movie really depicts the reality that is behind the current Somali pirate situation and is so realistically done- with every attention to the smallest detail- that you almost feel you are watching a doc. and are in the actual real situation- and this is awesome/fantastic.Making for nail biting tension.Loved the film- one of the best I have seen this year - and recommend it to everybody- because this is no fantasy or entertainer - it is highly realistic, true and real life. I learn't something. Awesome ! Just loved and enjoyed the film. Very good. A must see.The only criticism I can think of- is that it could be criticized for possibly being racist in its story- pro US, pro Western big power, pro hi- tech, pro white, typically showing the US to be the big good guys, US dominating, anti black, anti third world , anti Somali- but unfortunately this is the reality. Those Somalis were pirates/the bad guys and had to be killed. This is the only criticism. But I enjoyed the film thoroughly and loved it esp. since it a true story. Very entertaining. Would like to see it again, and recommend/ask everybody to see it! Fantastic! Excellent film.",9,0,1,7 November 2013
