Despicable Me 2," A must see.
","This movie will honestly have you crying of laughter. It's as if this franchise will only continue to be better and better! With lots of lovely little twists and silly little gags Despicable me 2 will warm your heart and leave you smiling like silly! Definitely something to watch if you're upset, definitely will cheer you up.The movie has you smiling straight from the start with the cuteness and the willingness emitted from Gru when it comes to the kids. Despicable me 2 was absolutely worth the wait. With lots of highs and lows Gru has managed to prove to the audience that we should be able to put our faith in him, much like our common superhero movie Gru is put in difficult situations we question how he will get out of, but of course, he does.This is not just for children either, people ages 30 could easily be caught smiling at this heart-warming movie.",10,12,16,3 July 2013
