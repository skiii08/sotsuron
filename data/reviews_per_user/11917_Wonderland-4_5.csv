The Blair Witch Project," Don't expect terror.
","What can one say - everyone I spoke told me that I was going to find this film scary, no matter what I had seen before. The way I would rate this film starts with the letter 's' but i think rather than scary - either the word sad or stupid would be far more appropriate.The characters are quickly outlined, one annoying, one fairly normal and one maybe a little slow. And so it goes on. From here we go for a wander in the woods, interview some people to give the film at least the semblance of a mock documentary. And so it goes on. Strange noises at night, river crossings, the slow slide into insanity (only a couple of nights). And so it goes on.I can scarcely find the words to explain how boring i found this film. Characters - slow and irritating. Plot - unlikely (no matter how much you suspend disbelief). Script - OK, considering the whole thing was meant to be ad libbed.On the whole, i would say the one thing that saves this film is that it is nothing if not an interesting premise for a story. I would say the appropriate level of fear for the viewer would be achievable - as long as you watched it at night, in a tent, in the middle of a forest, probably by yourself.Interesting but slow - 4 out of 10.",Null,0,1,25 June 2000
Tigerland," Cinematic Revolution?
","I saw 'Tigerland' with very little expectation as to what it would be like. I knew it was some sort of Vietnam film but I had no idea just how wrong that really was. In the case of this film, the war that is going on at the time really doesn't matter. All that does matter is the association that everyone in the cinema feels with the characters.Schumacher has delivered in this one. The use of hand held cameras gives a sense of total immersion. This amplifies scenes of mental and physical hardship on the screen and leaves the audience feeling exhausted.I feel that in a comparative sense that the best parts of 'Full Metal Jacket' have been captured and then expanded on rather than repeating the same old jungle war scenes.A must see.",Null,0,0,25 October 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Could it have been worse??
","Upon entering the theatre, i had a couple of ideas already in my mind. The first was that i loved the first Mission Impossible film and knew that it would be hard for the sequel to match up with it in quality and entertainment. Secondly was the fact that the sequels director, John Woo, wasn't going to turn out anything like Brian De Palma in the first instalment.Both mental projections of the film came true.Try to imagine a film that tries to be the most over the top film of all time and this is what you have. Every action sequence seemed as if it was tacked on to the film as an afterthought, which was important because otherwise it might have outdone the appalling script, and one thing we like to see in film is continuity.It is said that to watch a John Woo film you have to put your brain into neutral - i think more appropriate for MI:2 would be to put your brain in reverse.Tom Crusie tries hard and should be respected for it - but i think it is safe to say that martial arts should be left to the professionals (Jet Li). This and so many of the other action sequences leave Cruise looking nothing short of unconvincing.I cant really say it's worth a look - but certainly do if you are having trouble sleeping - it nearly did the trick for me.PS - Australians do not sound as they are portrayed in the film.",3,0,1,18 June 2000
Casino," Classic Scorsese
","As films of around 3 hours go, this is one that will be able to keep you glued to the screen from start to finish - and it is easy to see why.Looking first at the director, Martin Scorsese, he has once again turned out another masterpiece through not only his standard creative cinematography but through the use of an extremely clever and entertaining series of narratives from both central and cameo roles.The lead actors have also done themselves proud in this film. Each of them allowing you a truthful and honest insight into  their individual persona's, giving the viewer a closeness to the characters and their plight that is rarely seen in films of today.This film is frequently compared I think unfairly to 'Goodfellas'. Although the underlying theme is similar. 'Casino' has much less down time for the viewer and allows you to work away feeling less empty than 'Goodfellas' does.With some of the most violent scenes since 'Reservoir Dogs' it is certainly not for the squeemish but certainly well worth a look.9 out of 10.",Null,2,2,21 May 2000
Gladiator," Braveheart again - with snappier dialogue
","Russell Crowe has now proved himself as one of the truly great actors. With nothing less than an inspiring performance, he has managed to make up for the shortcomings of many of the other cast members. Gladiator opens with one of the most creative and entertaining (though bloody) battle scenes. Crowe, playing the most successful of Roman Generals, plays a multi-faceted role, from brutal warrior to loving husband which has been enhanced by the films continuously interesting and original cinematography.Through this film, Ridley Scott will be able to through of the Sci-Fi master tag that seems to have dogged his career since the 'Aliens' series (irrespective of their acclaim and box office success).Aside from the continual excitement that this film offers, there is an interesting storyline that goes along with it. Although it will not go down as a classic of all time, 'Gladiator' offers excitement and keeps the audience glued to the screen despite the long viewing time.All in all a wonderful must see film.",Null,0,0,16 May 2000
