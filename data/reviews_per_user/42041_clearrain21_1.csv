The Benchwarmers," This movie was hysterically funny
",I would like to state that this movie compared to Napoleon Dynamite was excellent in executing the purpose of it being a comedy. I laughed throughout the whole movie and also thought it had a positive message. There are many kids who are not given the chance to be popular or participate in activities that the most popular kids do just because they are not cool enough for society. This movie is great for kids and adults who just want to have a good time watching a film that is funny and also has an empowering plot. The actors in this movie are very good comicsand will make you laugh till the end. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I do encourage you to also acknowledge other comments but on the end it is really up to you to make the choice!,10,1,3,13 November 2006
