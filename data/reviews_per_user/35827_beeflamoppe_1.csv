Mission: Impossible III," Not so bad...
","The action was nice. The story could of been better. The actors were so so But gosh why did Julia(Michelle Monaghan) was that stupid? She said about 6 times in less than 6 minutes ''Oh my god, when are you going to tell me why we're in Shangai?'' That's actually the first thing she thought after killing two men for the first time and when her husband(Tom Cruise) almost died. And I can't watch Laurence Fishburne on a big screen from a close range. I do believe that the explosions and the gadgets saved the movie. Plus Tom Cruise's insane popularity from the past few months didn't hurt either. To finish this, Philip Seymour Hoffman was okay, it wasn't the kind of movie like Capone but he was fine in an action movie. Oh and one last thing, I hated the fact that their were jokes coming out in the middle of the action, it was irritating. When I see a James Bond movie I expect jokes, not in a MI movie",6,0,1,9 May 2006
