Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Just not that funny
","This was the worst $9 I've ever spent on going to a movie. To me, it was completely lacking in originality and, well, humor. A few of the attempts at humor were based on a 'look at the unattractive naked people' approach, but most was more of a 'I said something that's meant to be very offensive. Isn't it funny?' technique or a 'Watch me make these people uncomfortable' approach. I'm pretty difficult to offend, and I can't say that any of the movie really offended me. It was far too stupid to be offensive. The problem was that the movie just didn't entertain me at all. I held out hope that at some point, we'd get to see someone snap and really go after Borat/Cohen. I'm sure it's happened enough times, I wish they'd captured that on film and shown it to the audience so we could've gotten a little bit of satisfaction from this waste of time.",1,331,668,19 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Boring, cliched, and wholly uninteresting
","Wow, I just don't get the appeal of this movie!!! OK, the settings were impressive, and everything and everyone looked great. The sound effects were also impressive.However... the plot was painfully boring, the characters (both good and bad) were completely uninteresting and uninspiring, and the whole theme was as predictable and cliched as in a Disney movie about a dog playing basketball.There was absolutely no sense of rising action or drama or suspense, just a seemingly endless series of interchangeable conflicts. I can't remember the last time I was so eager for a movie to end.",3,1,2,26 January 2002
