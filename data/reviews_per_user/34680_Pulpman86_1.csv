Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good Ending
","Even though this one didn't have as much action as the first, its still a great movie over all.  This second part mainly brings everything to an end nice and simple and very unique as well.  Quentin once again did a terrific job on directing and writing and producing.  The Acting was once again perfect like Quentins other movies.  Uma did a great job as the bride and no one could replace Dave Carradine for the part of bill.  Most people need to make sure they go into this movie with an open mind, if anyone were to expect as much action and violence as the first one they will be disappointed.  Hopefully Volume 2 will also make the top 250 just like volume 1 because thats what it deserves.",9,1,2,16 April 2004
