Marie Antoinette," Remarkable...
","Remarkable indeed that a film can make the French Revolutiuon dull! This is one of the most pointless films I have seen in months. The characters may have been huge hisrtorical figures. In this movie they have all the 'elan' of cardboard cutouts. And what's with all the rock and roll music? Did I miss something in history class? I thought rock started in the fifties. Nope. It's shot in lavish surroundings with lavish costumes. But it's deadly dull. We don't even get to hear Marie Antoinette hurl her defiant 'let them eat cake' line ('cake' was an idiom of the day for horse manure) or see her get the chop on the guillotine. I used to think history class was boring. It was knuckle biting excitement next to this plodding, pitiful, pointless portrayal of lumpen history.",3,1,2,7 January 2008
United 93," A dark day brightly done
","This is not likely to turn up as an inflight movie anywhere or anytime. It captures the horror and the terror of 9/11. And although it captures the reality of the situation, the endless aviation jargon in the tower and the cockpit gets confusing and even boring. It's also difficult to understand how the producers of such an important film got so much so wrong. Cinematic licence or carelessness? (Look at the error file here on IMDB).
Nevertheless it is a graphic and important re-telling of the events of that horrible day. Most intriguing to me was the fact that I knew what would happen, but none of the passengers, aircrew or ATC officials did. Their false hopes and attempted explanations of what was happening make compelling drama.
Not likely as an in-flight movie? I don't even think you should watch it if you are booked on a flight anytime in the next six months!",6,0,1,22 February 2020
Gravity," Fabulous effects.Lousy movie
","This film is preposterous. But you tend to overlook its absurd plot, scientific inaccuracies and impossible scenario and become totally entranced in the exceptional effects. They're probably better than those in 2001 and that may be due to the huge advances in computer graphics since that classic was made. After stating in the titles that there is no sound in space, the film proceeds to present a cacophony of bangs, clangs and clumps. How does an American trained astronaut know how to operate both Russian and Chinese vehicles with all the controls marked in those languages. Likewise the handy instruction manuals on both the Russian and the Chinese vehicles. How is it possible for a space capsule to descend to earth without being tracked and without rescuers standing by. Without guidance from the ground, how do you ensure that the space vehicle doesn't land in the middle of the ocean or, conversely, in the middle of Times Square. Great as the remarkable scenes may be, this film merely reinforces my long standing conviction that there never has been a really great sci-fi movie.Even 2001 was preachy and ponderous",5,0,1,25 April 2014
Darkest Hour," A well done piece of fiction
","When history provides drama, suspense and spectacle in abundancer, why does Hollywood try to improve on it? Gary Oldman is superb as Churchill. The settings and the atmosphere are first rate. The cinematography is rich and compelling. They have done a superb job of fictionalizing history!. But why? The scene in the Underground was compelling. But it never happened. Edward R.Murrow wrote some of the best words of the millions written on World War II. Yet his memorable line about Churchill mobilizing the English language is attributed to Lord Halifax. King George had a speech impediment yet there is no hint of it in this movie. There are many other goofs and gaffes. You can excuse the occasional wrong auto model year or minor geographic discrepancy. You can even put a certain spin on history. But a supposedly serious movie like this should not stray from the basic facts.",10,1,3,30 October 2018
Amistad," Overdone
","There are some memorable moments in this film, notably Anthony Hopkins' superb portrayal of John Quincy Adams and especially his summation to the supreme court. But having said that, the movie suffers from an excess of gravitas, an surfeit of flashing lights and special effects and too little English dialogue. Just as Hollywood became obsessed with penitential films about the US treatment of native Indians --- for a time it was the 'flavour of the week' --- so too this is a belated cinematic act of contrition about slavery. It has its moments. There are several fine performances and much excellent film work. But when you put it all to-gether, it comes off as overdone and overwrought.",4,14,22,21 June 2007
The Mummy," Be sure to take the cat to bed...
","I gave this movie a 9 and was surprised to see so few others had rated so highly. Maybe it's the lack of a big name star. But this movie is fun, going one up on Indiana Jones and Romancing The Stone. It's one of those clever movies that keeps you laughing and jumping in terror from start to finish. A well done flick, with good acting, clever script, non stop action, lots of laughs, creative photography and great special effects. We made sure the cats were sleeping with us when we went to bed after watching it. (See the movie. You'll understand why.)",9,0,0,23 November 2000
Brokeback Mountain," Was ready to hate it, but...
","Okay, I was wrong. I recorded Brokeback Mountain at my wife's request and wanted no part of it. But I ended up watching it and now understand why it did so well in the Oscars. It's gorgeously photographed in gorgeous country (Alberta, not Wyoming)although they overdid the polarizing filters on the blue skies. It examines homosexuality in a mature and responsible manner. Indeed, I was more offended by the constant smoking than I was by the frequent gay grappling scenes. The story and the acting of it were excellent. It captures both the feel of the west and the emotional dynamite of the situation without overstatement or exploitation. These were believable, likable characters caught in a human dichotomy. I would have given it a 9 were it not for all the cigarettes. I thought the Marlboro man had died of lung cancer!",8,19,22,30 December 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Excellent except for one thing
","It's difficult to imagine the inhumanity and horror of the Rwandan genocide. Yet this film does a good job of conveying it without resorting to excess gore. It also leavens the horror with well timed moments of humour or tenderness. From all accounts it is factually correct. Why then did they not portray Gen. Romeo Dallaire as himself instead of inserting some trumped up fictional character played most unsuitably by Nick Nolte wearing a Canadian flag on his shirt? This detracts from the film and angers Canadians. Most of us regard Dalaire as a compassionate, highly principled hero who was betrayed by the UN. (Read his book, 'Shake Hands With The Devil.') The movie tells a terrible story very well. But eliminating Gen. Dalaire is a little like eliminating Eisenhower from 'The Longest Day' (Dalaire, incidentally, just recently was appointed to the Canadian Senate.)",7,2,3,15 April 2005
Horrible Bosses," *****in Mother****** of a C*******er Film
","Yeah, this is a very funny movie. It's an excellent farce with some original twists about three guys who hate their bosses and decide to kill them. It's silly and funny and well done with good performances by all. Kevin Spacey does an excellent 'boss from hell' and Jennifer Aniston is great as a nymphomaniac dentist. (Why was Donald Sutherland's role so brief?) But... Is the constant stream of profanity necessary. Does the F word, used endlessly, really add to the humour. The movie could have been just as funny without all the foul language. There are some terrific situations here that would have worked just as well without the potty mouth stuff. We've reached a sad moment if film producers feel a movie won't sell without gratuitous profanity.",7,1,3,30 August 2012
The Ottoman Lieutenant," Superb!
","Puzzled by the number of bad reviews and one star ratings! This film gets one of my not too frequent tens. Where do we start? The superb performances, especially the incomparable Ben Kingsley... The stunningly beautiful photography... The fascinating locations...
The effective dialogue... The realistic recreation of 1914 in both the US and Turkey...There also is an intriguing plot with an unconventional love triangle... It's a war movie, a love story, an historical drama and a travelogue all wrapped to-gether in one very nice package.",10,5,14,2 January 2018
Capote," Snooooozzzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeee
","This is the most incredibly boring and stupid movie I have seen in a long time. Endless lisping mumbles, uninspired camera work, confusing scenarios. And, most significantly, it is a movie about a bitchy, self-obsessed, limp-wristed, thoroughly unlikeable and overrated writer and two savage, worthless killers, an aggregation of humanity I want nothing to do with, much less watch an empathetic movie about. Capote is dead. The killers are dead. Let them all rest in peace, undisturbed and forgotten, without disinterring them and giving them an extra fifteen minutes of fame with a dreadful nd pointless movie such as this.",2,8,14,2 June 2006
Lost in Translation," Pointless!
","I've seen home movies of Japan  that had a better story line than this.Middle aged man and pretty young girl find themselves to-gether in Tokyo so they have drinks and go sightseeing. They don't even make the sack.  Indeed it's more of a father-daughter relationship than a love affair. The scenes of Tokyo and Kyoto are quite fascinating but if thats all I'd wanted, I'm sure there is a National Geographic special on Japan available at my local library. Bill Murray, usually a funny guy, says and does nothing remotely humourous in this motionless motion picture. It simply goes nowhere! It was pointless and plotless.",3,2,4,25 April 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," Fun in the fumes
","In many ways this is a delightfully off the wall film using creative and novel script and production techniques. But I was angered and repelled by the constant and pointless smoking! Okay, cigarettes have a slight role in the plot because Bridget tries to quit. But in a world where almost nobody smokes, it seems that EVERYBODY in this film smokes. There are numerous other product placements in this movie. Can we assume that the tobacco industry also paid big bucks to promote its vile product. I gave the film a 7. Were it not for the smoking, it would have been a 9!",6,0,1,2 June 2002
Fargo," Odd movie
","I'd given it a 7 rating and then read that it is not based on a true story, as stated in the opening credits. So I bumped it down to 5. This sort of sham/scam was common in the eighties and nineties but it is unforgivable! A breach of the vital trust between moviemaker and movie watcher. It's an odd sort of movie combining gruesome brutality with quirky comedy. It's an original dramatic device. The bad guys are so bad that you need a little relief. And that's provided by the pert, perky (and pregnant) cop. There also are some very loose ends. What, for example, was the point of bringing in the Japanese ex-boyfriend? It didn't seem to have any link whatsoever to the plot. It also overflows with plugs and product placements. However despite these shortcomings, it is still a pretty good nailbiter.",5,0,2,29 April 2010
The Revenant," Machismo in the mountains
","We watched this film on the basis of several rave reviews when it first came out. I fail to see why it rated so well. There is spectacular scenery and dramatic camera work. (Although splatters of artificial blood on the camera lens during one of the many violent scenes seem surprisingly sloppy. Nor did the frequent appearance of lens flair serve any artistic purpose as it sometimes can. This was simply careless cinematography.) The whole movie is relentless machismo, one disturbingly violent scene after another and frequent, gratuitous use of the 'F word' which was not even in the thesaurus of early nineteenth century profanity. If you're intent on watching this appallingly violent, lengthy, sexist and pointless film, turn the sound down and enjoy the scenery. It is the only positive aspect of a very disappointing movie.",3,1,2,19 November 2017
Dark City," Sorry... I'm not that artsy dartsy
","I've always claimed nobody ever made a science fiction movie that was good (yes, including 2001.) And I like and read a lot of sci fi.I'm glad my premise remains unchallenged. This is yet another well done stinker. The movie has an intriguing premise, a Kafka like and gloomy false world where reality is all in our minds. The whole thing takes place in a sort of Gotham City on steroids. Mind you, the effects are superbly done. But it just doesn't come together. Much the same experience can be had by eating pickles with ice cream before going to bed. You wait for Batman and Robin to swoop in. Alas, they never do. It would provide a moment of comic relief to the unending Gothic dreariness. I'm still not sure why Keefer Sutherland speaks his lines as though reading them from a teleprompter with a broken gear. And as much as I admire the magisterial Ian Richardson, he is miscast here as the head bad guy. Not my cup of tea. But then, maybe in an alternate reality I would like it. Several times in the film Richardson says in that plummy, commanding voice of his 'Shut it down.' He's talking about the pseudo universe. Too bad the production crews didn't think he meant the movie.",3,3,9,13 February 2007
Cross of Iron," Possibly the worst war movie ever made!
",This is an appallingly bad film. The story is murky and absurd. The acting is overwrought. The cinematography is dark and hard to see. The effects are at best adequate. Maximillian Schell is the prototype German bad guy yet again. (how many times is that?) James Mason (rest his soul) is totally unconvincing as a Wehrmacht officer. And John Wayne might have been a better choice than James Coburn. Indeed the whole dreadful mess might have had a better chance had it been shot as a western with Indians instead of Russians and cowboys rather than storm troopers. That at least would justify the beards. moustaches and long hair which were 'verboten' for the German soldier. A really really bad movie!,1,17,51,27 February 2003
The Intouchables," Superb!!!
","A brilliant film. Hollywood simply would not understand what this film has. It certainly would never shoot it. It offers a wonderfully candid study of an unlikely human relationship between a handicapped white aristocrat and an uneducated and unsophisticated black caregiver. Their chemistry is improbable magic. There are many messages here. But the basic one is that people are people. Not only is the story warm and human, the cinematography is superb...inspiring camera work! There is so much that Hollywood can learn from Europe about creating rather than manufacturing movies. This is a thoroughly wonderful and engrossing story beautifully told and brilliantly presented. There is so much dross on television today. A moment like this restores my faith in the medium.",9,0,1,18 January 2015
Pearl Harbor," Y&R meets Admiral Yamamoto
","Given the generally ghastly reviews, I was prepared to hate this film. But I rather liked it. It's more of a love story than a war story. The special effects are outstanding. And the mood and feel of 1941 has been well captured. Negatives? Good as the effects may be, there are too many of them. I was wondering which was shorter, WW2 or the movie. Jon Voigt stinks as FDR. There is far too much shouting and yelling and too many war movie cliches. It's a three hour film which easily could have been trimmed to two. But overall, it's not anything as bad as the reviews have suggested. (Had an interesting thought while watching... Wonder if it had been shown on flights to Hawaii.)",7,0,1,26 February 2002
Remember the Titans," A football fairy tale
","Disney is famous for creating never never lands. They've done it here as well. The film is well produced, reasonably well acted and compelling in its own way. But it's as much a morality play and about as realistic as Little Red Riding Hood, full of soap opera scenarios, predictable turns of plot and guys in white hats and black hats. (Or is that football helmets?) And of course, they all live happily ever after. (Except one guy, but we can't give that one away, can we.) Based on a true story it may be. But I suspect the politically correct bunch at Disney took a lot of poetic licence. If you like 'nice' pictures you'll like this one. Maybe if they had animated it, it would be more believable.",4,1,2,22 May 2001
The Pianist," Turn off the (Warsaw) ghetto blaster
","Thats all we need, another overwrought, epic length (but not epic quality)tale of the Warsaw ghetto. Sure, it was terrible. But so are many other historical events including the Nazi like treatment of Palestinians by the Israelis. Why doesn't somebody do a movie about that? There probably have been more movies about the Warsaw ghetto than about any other aspect of the war. Quite apart from the politics of it, it's a tedious, predictable, uninspiring and far too long film with endless scenes of shouting and shooting Nazis, starving children and buildings blowing up every few moments. That last part is good because it does tend to wake you up during this class A snoozer.",3,5,15,4 November 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Incomparable! An incomparable stinker!
","Tbis may be the worst film ever made, a pretentious, self-indulgent, immature, to-hell-with-the-audience-because-they-won't-understand-it- anyhow-but-what-the-hell-do-they-know-anyhow sort of movie. I stuck with it to the end only because I had invested in a pay-per-view showing and because I wanted to post something here. WARNING. THIS MOVIE MAY BE HARMFUL TO YOUR EVENING. What was the point of mixing modern music with a fin-de-siecle theme. Why was nobody ever on screen for more than two seconds. Why did they use blurry pan shots and amateurish zooms that looked like something from a new vidcam owner. I cannot find one redeeming feature to this film. I gave it a 1 and would have voted ZERO is that were possible. A brobdignagian stinker! Jeeez.....",1,40,67,11 February 2002
Rules of Engagement," Almost a nine...
",This is a great movie except for three things. 1)The Vietnam battle effects are poorly done. You can't get by  with 1960 effects in 2000. 2)Obviously I can't reveal the ending because there is a great deal of very effective suspense leading up to it. Let me just say it was disappointingly predictable. 3)This is a work of fiction and a good one. Yet the closing credits use the unethical gimmick of scrolling documentary style titles outlining the (supposedly) subsequent destinies of the main characters as though it were history rather than a Hollywood nail biter. I would have given it a nine (rather than a 7) were it not for these three factors.,7,1,3,29 November 2000
Pi," Pretentious self indulgence
","'Pi' likely was the darling of some obscure film festival in Akron of Moosonee, gushed over by the cognoscenti who ask each other in solemn tones and all seriousness 'what was he trying to say?' This is simply a bad film ineptly shot by a self-indulgent filmmaker with no concept of what film should do. Bad hand held high contrast black and white photography filled with pointless camera gimmicks is no substitute for true film art. When I do photographic work and my results are this bad, I replace my chemicals and vow to use my tripod next time. Laughably bad!",2,12,21,10 November 2000
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Worthwhile movie
","As a former news broadcaster who lived through the era, I was fascinated. If I were 40 years younger and had never worked in media, I might not be so enthusiastic. In fact, I might be very confused. So this film may not be to everybody's taste. But it's a good thing that it was made. David Strathairn has done such a fantastic job of emulating Murrow's whole persona --- voice, appearance, body language --- it's spooky. The decision to shoot only black and white was a gutsy one. It captures the spirit of the era and helps with the integration of historic news footage. As good as it is, I wonder if it might have been even better if it had done Murrow's whole life story, rather than concentrating only on the McCarthy broadcasts. For example, his radio broadcasts from London during the blitz, a high tech marvel and a journalistic innovation in 1940 and their impact in both Britain and the US and on the future of radio news, were historic. The one disappointment was the lack of much substance in the extra features on the DVD. There should have been some archival footage of the real Murrow and maybe even something about the 1958 RTNDA convention where Murrow gave his famous speech. There are a lot of people who were there that night. For the benefit of younger viewers, there should be an epilogue concerning Murrow's subsequent life. He had a falling out with Bill Paley, left CBS to take over the Voice Of America under Lyndon Johnson, an unhappy time for him, and eventually paid the price for his years of smoking in a long and difficult death from lung cancer.",8,1,2,22 April 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Wow!
","This a movie that hits you in the gut. It's beautifully shot and very well performed. The ending... Well let's say it left me sitting in front of the TV as though someone had just given me a hard punch in the gut. (Thus the 'wow' above.) But of its many powerful elements, the most effective is the portrayal of the family. Here is a man who runs a concentration camp yet he is a loving father and caring husband. (It's said that Josef Mengele used to feed the birds.) Nor are the military characters the stereotyped jack booted Nazi shouting in bad German accents. Indeed, the characters are restrained and speak in slight British accents. That technique doesn't always work but here it does. It also paints an interesting portrait of 'the good life' in the Third Reich in 1940-41 when they had occupied most of Europe and were winning the war. One of the great scenes is when Bruno falls off his swing and a concentration camp inmate working in the commandant's house bandages his leg. His mother, brainwashed to believe that Jews are non-human, has a great struggle with herself before saying a halting 'thank you' to him. The scenes between Bruno and his friend behind the wire --- the boy in the striped pyjamas --- are compelling. What a credit that two child actors could achieve such depth. A must see movie and a novel inside out view of Nazi-ism at its height of power.",10,2,3,8 October 2011
Mission: Impossible II," A bad hi tech circus
","This may be the worst film  of the new century, so far anyhow. A mindless plot studded with inane dialogue and absurd and excessive special effects, all of it shot with pointlessly artsey dartsey camera techniques. The worst of Hollywood with bad writing, bad acting and bad production. With all the bullets that fly for two hours, it's too bad one of them didn't put this turkey out of its misery. But then, lousy shots all, they didn't hit much in the movie either.",2,0,1,3 July 2002
The Dark Knight," What a disappointment
","Okay. Heath Ledger was worth it. He has created a classic screen villain with his Joker and he deserved his (posthumous) Oscar. The rest of it? Whaaaa... Batman seems to be another classic film franchise that now takes itself seriously. James Bond has become a serious guy and the movies no longer are fun. Same here. Remember both the old Batman TV series and the early movies with their WHAM POW graphics and their delightfully camp dialogue? (Holy hockey pucks, Batman....) (Come to think of it, where was Robin in this Batman outing? Probably auditioning for Hamlet.) Chicago just doesn't make it as Gotham City which used to have such a dark, surrealistic quality. And I had trouble sorting out the good guys and the bad guys. There are no white hats and black hats here. They're all varying shades of grey. Even Batman is a bad guy. Or is he? The effects are good but no better than what the computer now has made routine. Really. They have to do better than blowing up everything in sight and rolling police cars like yo-yo's. Been there, done that! I won a voucher for a free movie in a scratch and win promotion. It was due to expire yesterday so I thought I'd pick up a movie I wanted to see. I had read all the rave reviews about this one and about its various awards. Even the IMDb rating is a rare 9. Gotta be a great evening. Uh uh. At least it didn't cost me anything other than a couple of confused hours.",2,6,12,2 April 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," It has aged badly
","I first saw 2001 on a rainy Sunday afternoon in 1968 with my two daughters, then 10 and 12. I recall animated discussion about the film on the drive home and at dinner that night.It was new ground! Sadly the film has not aged well. The special effects, so impressive some thirty years ago, look mediocre and sometimes plain silly. The fashions and furnishings, designed to predict today, more resemble Montgomery Ward circa 1960. In an age of today's short takes and busy camera work, 2001 seems stodgy, glacial and boring. Kubrick reportedly made his characters one dimensional on purpose. Yet today it amounts to just plain bad acting. This classic has not aged as well as others of the period.",5,6,13,6 January 2001
The Artist," Gimmickry
","What's next? Will musicians release their work on 78RPM disks? Will television delay programs using kinescope technology. This movie admittedly had its moments. The whole thing was something of a send-up. And the old cars are certainly a treat to see. But the movie is essentially a gimmick and one of those 'outre' works that that film festival crowd clucks and coos over. I fail to see what the purpose of the whole exercise was beyond film makers making a film for other film makers. The reality is that most of the audience has never seen a silent film (or, for that matter, a black and white one.) It is an interesting and well done conversation piece for film buffs. Maybe that rather than the public appeal accounted for its Academy Award success.",5,0,3,15 November 2012
There's Something About Mary," Tasteless and puerile
","About the only thing they didn't do here was light farts with matches and giggle. It's that kind of movie, a new low for Hollywood. Sex is one thing. Puerile humour is another. They are richly combined in this insultingly tasteless film. I imagine a group of thirteen year old teens watching it would find it hilarious and even crudely educational.To me it was proof of the decadence of contemporary Hollywood and the corroded moral standards of the United States.Sex is a great form of humour. This was not humour but embarrassing vulgarity laced with needless foul language and premised on the validity of lies and deception.I was tempted to turn it off after the first few minutes but forced myself to watch because it is such an excellent example of the moral vacuum that has engulfed the United States. I have no problem with sophisticated sexual humour or even shocking sexual farce. That does not offend me. This did!",2,1,2,6 November 2010
The Hurricane," Superb stuff
","Norman Jewison's name on a film is a hallmark of quality. That certainly is true here. A brilliantly conceived and creatively produced film that handles immensely emotional material without sinking into bathos. Denzel Washington was the perfect choice to play Reuben Carter. The black and white ring flashbacks, evocative of the old newsreels, are immensely effective. Jewison has tampered with the facts, mainly by omission. But a great director is entitled to a bit of cinematic licence. And how nice for once to see Toronto represented as Toronto instead of as a stand in for some US city. This is a film well worth seeing.",8,0,2,30 January 2001
The Legend of 1900," A wonderful fantasy
","Perhaps a critic shouldn't be too critical of a modern fantasy, for thats what this movie is. The story is unique. The photography is compelling. The acting is top notch. The mood and decor are just about perfect. It's one of those films to be remembered. Nevertheless... >It would be impossible to fix a broken phonograph record as was done in the movie. >It is unlikely that a black, even one of Jelly Roll Morton's stature, would have been allowed to book first class passage on a steamer in the twenties. >The yo-yo as we know it was not invented until the thirties. Yet there is a reference to it in a scene set in the twenties. >The Royal Navy trucks supposedly in use in WWI were of WWII vintage. >The vintage of some of the movie cameras filming the piano 'duel' is questionable. But despite these flaws, it's still an intriguing and memorable film.",8,1,4,9 March 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Tasteless violence
","Hollywood has no monopoly on crass, vulgar, tasteless, blood spewing depravity.This ghastly piece of British trash is as good (bad?) as anything the schlockmeisters of US cinema have ever done. The film runs 110 minutes. The F word is used 125 times. !!! There is not one character with one redeeming quality. Indeed, if I was a British criminal I would be offended. The story line is complicated enough --- you can't tell the bad guys from the good guys because there are no good guys --- but the thick east end London accents make the dialogue incomprehensible for the most part. There are two or three attempts at comedy. But none of them is funny. Cinema can be so downlifting!",2,21,44,15 December 2010
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," I'm puzzled...
","A wonderful film...humour...love...bad guys...good guys...gorgeous scenery...

There may be sound production reasons for that, But I find it impossible to accept.",9,1,1,2 April 2020
Casino Royale," Hated it!
","To enjoy a Bond film, it was always necessary to suspend belief. The villains were over the top. The stories were close to fantasy. The violence had almost a Tom And Jerry quality to it, not to be taken seriously. This new Bond film changes all that. 'Le Chiffre' is no more menacing then your average mugger. All he does is scowl a lot. The new Bond girl looks like a school teacher. And this new Bond is gritty and blue collar, not at all the classy, glib gent portrayed by Sean Connery and his sophisticated successors. There are no gadgets more exotic than cell phones and GPS sets. There is no Moneypenny. There is no 'Q.' And the action scenes lack the tongue in cheek aspect of the earlier films. Nor, with one piddling exception, are there any of the neat one liners and double entendres that were a trademark of the earlier films. It's as though Hannah-Barbera suddenly decided to do thoughtful cinema rather than have fun.The earlier Bond films were good fun. This one attempts serious drama but produces only run of the mill hash.",4,4,7,5 December 2006
Sweet and Lowdown," Brilliant!
","This is something a little different but excellent. Like him or not, Woody Allen is a genius and this is one of his most brilliant films. The atmosphere of the thirties has been exquisitely captured (other than the modern trains), there is lots of great music and plenty of laughs. I have an ethical problem with the fact that the film is entirely fictional yet is presented as a biography. There should have been a disclaimer somewhere. But I still gave it an 8.",8,0,0,19 February 2001
Amélie," Wonderful characters in a wonderful movie
","A fairy tale for adults? A fable? An off the wall comedy? A love story? All these and more! This is a wonderfully refreshing and original movie. Amelie is the girl every man has loved at some time in his life. She is surrounded by a wonderfully drawn cast of characters. There are clever, creative film effects that stay in perspective. The producers wisely didn't allow themselves to get carried away by gimmicks and effects as so many do. A bonus is the splendid photography in  and around Paris and especially of French railway stations and trains. Nor, despite the happy ending, does this fit into the standard Hollywood genre. It is European and French to the last frame. 2003 is young as I write this but I doubt I will see much else this year that will be as good!",9,0,2,3 February 2003
Shall We Dance," Impossible to dislike
","Despite some of the negative reviews and the modest viewer rating, my view is that this is still a movie that is impossible to dislike. It's a warm, wonderful, funny, feel good fantasy, set in an almost 'never never land.' (Winnipeg never looked so good!) The casting in perfect. Susan Sarandon is ideal. So is Gere. All the others are made for their parts. Much of the film's charm is the soft pastel hue of the colour and the delicate, sometimes diaphanous lighting. It's also very sexy without being overly erotic. Jennifer Lopez has a great body but it is a dancer's body more than that of an ingenue. I thought Lisa Ann Walter was fabulous although she works too hard at being a Bette Midler clone. But that's okay. I like Bette Midler too. I'm surprised at the lukewarm reviews of the professional 'literati.' But I suppose these days a movie is regarded as hopelessly ineffective if it does not brim with groping, gunfights and in your face grossness. Surprisingly, in a script refreshingly free of profanity, the 'F-word' makes one appearance. It was totally needless and its presence surprised me. This is a charming, creative movie. Sure, it's not hard to guess how it will end. But getting there is a delightful way of spending an evening!",9,0,1,4 February 2005
Life," Superb with one huge fault
","This was an absolute knock-out sci-fi flick with incredibly great effects. I'm still very curious how they simulated weightlessness so very effectively (and disappointed this was not revealed on IMDB. )
Sure, the plot is far fetched. But this is science-fantasy fergawdsakes.
What turned me off and stopped me from rating it a 10 is the constant, needless profanity. The F-word bounces around as much as it does in a gangster movie. It serves no purpose. It ignores the fact that this film will have strong appeal for youngsters and also that highly trained scientists would be very unlikely to use crude street language and certainly not with the frequency they do in the movie. But other than that, this is an edge of your seat, nail-biting, spectacular work.",9,5,9,28 March 2019
Thirteen Days," Superb!
","I looked at this film, expecting it be good and was quite surprised to find it is EXCELLENT. A superb and compelling piece of work! It is historically accurate. It does not sentimentalize the Kennedies or even over dramatize a very dramatic and dangerous moment of history. The actors and the props both look right whether it's a Dean Rusk ringer or a 1960 style desk telephone set. And the story captures the very real tension that gripped the world that autumn. At the same time it does not portray JFK as the saviour of humanity as have so many other accounts. This is a big movie, big in scope, in production and in length --- two and a half hours --- but it never lags! Wonder if they'll do as well in forty years when they shoot a movie about Guilliani and the WTC...",9,0,0,15 January 2002
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," How awful? Very awful!
","The occasional good horror flick can make an interesting evening. Vampires are always fun. And hey, here we have some name stars: Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. And it all does come to-gether. To produce one of the most gawdawful, boring, nauseating, DUMB movies ever made. You can't make out what's happening because of the dark lighting and artsey dartsey camera work. You can't hear what's happening because when Pitt and Cruise aren't screaming their lines in anger, they're mumbling them. Okay, we all know that vampires drink blood. But a 90 minute vampire movie should offer a little meatier plot than an infinity of back to back vampire attacks. The stock of the company that makes fake blood must have jumped the week they filmed this epic/schlepic. Rarely has so much of it been shed, spilled, saved, sprayed, sucked, sipped and swallowed. Maybe if I tried watching it again while munching on some garlic....",1,12,35,21 October 2005
The Ugly Truth," Dee-lightful
","Oh dear...looks like another low budget movie with a lot of nobodies. And it is. But it is absolutely great!!! Delightful!!! Well scripted!!! Well acted!!! Well shot!!! I laughed heartily while watching it and again while just discussing it. No heavy message. No social impact. No human analysis. Not even much logic. Just some damned fine entertainment! Yes, this is very much an adult film. You don't want your seven year old watching it. There are a lot of 'naughty' words and frequent sexual situations. But they are in context and not at all offensive. It is a sex comedy after all, a highly original spin on the endless battle of the sexes. I'll bet you'll guess right from the start how it ends. But it doesn't matter because there is a lot of fun before you get there.",10,1,2,26 June 2013
