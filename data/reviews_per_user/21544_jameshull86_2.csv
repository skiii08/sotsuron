The Hangover," Interesting premise; Fell short on delivery
","WARNING SPOILER. The movie kept on ranting about how crazy they were at the hospital or at the wedding chapel and all the other events that happened the night before. Why couldn't they have shot three or four more quick flashback montages for each one so we could be in on the fun like they did with the Mike Tyson security camera. This would have made it a much better movie. The ground work was there, it was fun, but they fell short on delivery. Can't rely on a dozen or so snapshots at end to tie it up and satisfy the audience. It seems they all put on the make-up for the photos, had some kind of location, and someone forgot the film camera and so they couldn't shoot it live. So they took photos instead. Disappointed with lack of vision on whoever made that call. Also, a little anti-climatic with finding friend they were searching for entire movie. Payoff dismal for all that set up, and again, no flashback of how it actually went down showing us the event.",3,34,67,20 June 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol Big Budget Lots of Action!!!!!
","Money makes the world go round and it also gets movies made. Wow and wow. The action is intense. It's big in the sense that it's just that, really big budget, and, at the same time, it keeps you on the edge of your seat because it's nerve racking in a good way. Action and Suspense. That's the Movie. The story, ah, who cares, it's dumb really. I know they try to pass it off as being high tech but whatever, it's not. It's a little spy stuff thrown in there with some tech stuff, as in the paperwork can magically print in the suitcase and the contact lenses can act as a camera (lol). I'm laughing because in the end everything they do technically falters in the end and it reverts back to big action and suspense. For example, the woman notices the contact and it ends up in a big shoot 'em up anyway. Will give it that the suspense leading up was great, but in the end it's about the shoot out... and of course the girl fight ... and then the chase. Even the 'spiderman' gloves don't work in the end, and it comes down to Tommy boy winging it, just like in the end and when the guy is in the vent and that plan doesn't work out in the end either, so Tommy boy, with the Latin chick (who changes in the carnicehaha) have to go and that ends up the action and suspense route. And losing contact in the elevator and so on.It's kind of let's do this elaborate scheme that if we do this carefully and time this right out to the minute ah, never mind, the wiring has gone faulty, back to brute force strength, I'm not complaining, I went there to see action and suspense and got my popcorn's worth. Fun Ride. I'm on board with Tommy Boy and his crew of Outcasts. Make another one right away.",7,2,4,18 March 2012
