Requiem for a Dream," A Review of My Review of a Movie
","Since it has been about 8 years since I first saw this movie, it may seem counterintuitive that I would review this movie now. If I had reviewed this movie 8 years ago (at 15), I would have given it 10 stars. It was the best movie I had ever seen at the time. I was way into the drug culture and had already experimented with half of a dozen. The ironic thing is that now that I have cleaned up (no drugs and no cigarettes), I find the movie to be an abstract piece of art. The abstract nature of the movie is why I give it three stars. The message is foul: drug addiction is a slippery slope and inescapable. My life experiences have shown this to be absolutely untrue. While Aronofsky does a great job with the visual and dramatic aspects of this movie and the Kronos Quartet empowers it with beautiful noises, the moral is dead wrong. It is almost as if the director has never done a single illicit drug. If you want a more realistic experience of drug addiction being inescapable and miserable, read or watch 'A Scanner Darkly'. If you want a more realistic experience of drug culture, watch 'Trainspotting'. In 'Trainspotting' the characters clean up multiple times willingly and they almost make it look easy -- until you see that they slide back into it easily. The beauty of this movie is deceptive. This is the ultimate poison of the film industry. With dramatic elements, you can make a lie seem so unquestionably true. You can see this mentality seeping into modern film and 85% (according to the rank of this movie) believe the lie. The best analogy I can provide is to tell the tale of a vegetarian. This vegetarian killed a pig once and went around swinging the corpse and attacking people out with it, screaming, 'Meat is murder!' How could something so beautiful be so wrong? Simple. Ask an American blonde to assimilate gravity into molecular theory.",3,0,1,30 May 2011
Memento," A Dome Rumbler
","Leonard Shelby wakes each morning to find that he can't remember anything past the date he and his wife were attacked in their home. During the attack, he received permanent brain damage and is unable to store short-term memory. Memento is a film depicting his journey to track down and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. You experience the movie just Leonard Shelby experiences life -- unable to draw on the past to determine how to perceive the present. Shelby is often confused and disoriented, but his drive to track down his wife's murderer gives him the ability to act on instinct and a few small notes and tattoos. The story itself is an incredible one, and you will certainly enjoy it. The telling of the story engages the brain in a unique way. As the film progresses, the viewer finds the information being presented explains scenes from earlier in the movie -- because the movie is presented basically in reverse. This style is similar to Pulp Fiction, but rather than a loose correlation of characters intimated in brief encounters, most people catch on to Memento's pattern rather quickly. This causes the viewer to desire sources of information that are the basis for Shelby's actions. The movie is an excellent story and presentation with a powerful climax, but some viewers may find the style of presentation tasking. I continually found myself waiting for information and paying less attention to the occurrences of the film. I truly sympathized with Leonard Shelby by the end of the movie, but since the presentation allowed viewers to know what the end result of each scene would be, I really had a feeling that I wanted the key element of the scene to appear. After that element appeared, I completely lost interest in the rest of the scene. Viewed linearly, the characters might be a little unrealistic. The musical score was extremely outdated -- it reminded me of something from a 60s or 70s film. The acting was excellent, with the exception of Guy Pearce -- incidentally the main character. I understand that it is very difficult to play a handicapped person, but I found his blonde hair and clean-cut look to be insufficient in compensating for his overly cool demeanor and emotionless performance. Watch this movie. It is a fair picture of a rare medical condition with a brilliant ending; however, I can only credit Jonathon Nolan with brilliance and Christopher Nolan with some pretty sub-par directing.",7,0,2,2 January 2011
There Will Be Blood," Well worthy of the hype
","I really enjoyed this movie. The three most valuable aspects of the movie are the music, acting, and story. I am a big fan of Jonny Greenwood and I've read a lot of complaints about the soundtrack to this movie. You shouldn't review a film if your idea of a good movie is Wall-E and you shouldn't open your mouth about music if your idea of good music is 50 Cent. I own the soundtrack to the film and I occasionally listen to it while studying or on the train. There are two or three songs that only belong in a movie, but the rest are excellent and all are fitting for a soundtrack to such an eerie and violent film. I honestly put the soundtrack in the ranks of 'Amelie'. As for the acting, Daniel and Henry Plainview were well played. HW Plainview and Eli Sunday weren't truly very convincing, but it wasn't devastating to the film. I truly felt the need to review this movie because I read reviews by so many people who didn't understand the story or thought the movie had no plot. Of course, like any good movie there isn't a linear plot built as predictably as a tunnel with a light at the end. I think many people didn't like the end because it was unsettling to their worldview. I think the director, whoever he is, was trying to give an accurate portrayal. Perhaps it is because I am an environmentalists but the character of Daniel Plainview is still alive and kicking. I liked the theme or religion throughout because it demonstrates how people will allow others to take advantage of them because their focus is on divinity and eternal life. Daniel Plainview is the man on top. He is easy to hate for no reason, but this movie gives plenty of reasons to hate him. The movie is an accurate representation of the aggregation of power and the path to success, especially in the business of oil.",9,3,5,14 June 2011
