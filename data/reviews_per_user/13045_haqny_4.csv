Catch Me If You Can," More please
","Selfishly, I wish there were movies like this. It's just a good time at the theater. Beautifully directed and acted.",9,0,1,1 December 2019
The Irishman," Another classic by the master of film
","Excellent film in every aspect. It was possibly the last time we'll get to see all of the living legends together in the same movie. If it were a major theatrical release, the Irishman, would rack up Oscar nominations and win quite a few of them. It was three and a half hours of pleasure; time well spent.",9,5,10,3 December 2019
Drive," Among of the greatest movies ever made!
","Drive is among the best movies ever made. It's on par with Citizen Kane. It's rare when every element of filmmaking works in sync. The movie is beautifully shot, written, and acted. It makes no excuses by making absolutely no attempts at pleasing people. The violence is raw and the love story is awkward. I'm sure there are people who didn't care for Citizen Kane but think Shawahank Redemption was the greatest movie ever made. These are the same people who enjoy reading children's book as adults and think anything literary is a waste of time. Drive is not for them. If I have insulted anyone, I'm glad. If you were insulted by this review, good.",10,1,4,30 March 2012
A Beautiful Mind," Beautiful movie
",This is an great movie. Masterfully told and directed story of a genius.,9,3,3,1 December 2019
