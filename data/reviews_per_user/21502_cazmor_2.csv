Blade Runner 2049," Excellent
","The original Blade Runner although not unanimously received upon release has grown into a cult mega star, one of the first DVD releases sort of says it all.Many critics have waned in the light of the sequels and spin-offs that are been pumped out, but here with this cult classics sequel there is a lot to like.The combination of Villeneuve's direction and the actors performances is a pleasure to watch. Gosling should be proud of his performance, going beyond stoic, the one scene of emotional outburst the pinnacle of his performance. Hoeks as Luv was another standout, an excellent counterpart to Gosling's K, even Bautista's cameo lifted the whole performance.With the return of Ford and Olmos grounding the movie in the original, the true surprise was the awe inspiring return cameo of Rachael, with a combination of actress Loren Petra and stunning visual effects is one of the greatest CG achievements I can recall of late.Villeneuve's direction, visual backdrops and cinematography, although with much more muted tones than the original, stayed true to form. It didn't have the impact or awe as the original but that been said we have been inundated with visually demanding films from the original to now.The plot is similar in pretense to the original, more of an extension than original screenplay, creating the feeling of an ongoing battle, be that good or bad.We certainly were not bogged down in dialogue, with good action scenes, reasonable character development and an uncluttered timeline. However this time round the punch and depth didn't appear, nor does this critic feel pulled into the story line as the original so aptly achieved.All in all an excellent film, one that all involved can be proud of and one the viewers can enjoy, as a fan of the original or not.",8,0,3,28 January 2018
Incredibles 2," Purely enjoyable.
","This is what animated movies are all about, forget the fact you can take your kids to watch it, adults will be dragging them to it.Often films that fall into the action genre can find it hard to keep it relevant when moving on from the success out of the gate. But Incredibles 2 does an incredible (insert eye roll here) job of moving the story forward and adding to an already enjoyable cast of characters.The story is a winner, and without overly expanding the universe, this is a film that engages from beginning to end, with plenty of tummy laughter to brighten the journey.We have a few changes with Helen taking the lead, but the real fun lies with the baby Jack-Jack stealing the show. All the main voices return with Nelson, Hunter and Jackson been the most obvious, and we are joined by some great characters in our lead villain and some new fun filled superheroes like Voyd (Sophia Bush).Although we only got glimpses of these new superheros, we wait in anticipation of their return in future films.But the main premise of a superhero family trying to run their 'normal' lives, whilst equally trying to find their place in the world and acceptance from family, friends and public, keeps it all relatable and filled with laughs.Pixar have out done themselves again, the animation is for the lack of a better word flawless, aesthetically pleasing, and light, which is so pleasing to watch.Pixar did take their time with this release, but it is worth the wait, so grab some pop-corn, put your feat up and enjoy.",9,1,2,2 March 2019
