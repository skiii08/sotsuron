Vertigo," An amazing film that takes the viewer beyond their expected destination.
","Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo is an adventure into the human mind. Scottie Ferguson, the main character, has to deal with his vertigo. Hitchcock takes an interesting turn in his storytelling when the viewer believes the tale is through. His use of the color green plays a very prominent roll throughout the film. The dialog is well thought out, but more importantly Hitchcock's use of vocal silence during the chase scenes between Madeleine and Scottie really brings a level of suspense normally not seen in today's films. Generally television shows rely heavily on dialog to tell the twenty minute story that the writers have created. Hitchcock's style allows him to fully demonstrate his vision to the audience. He takes the time to completely elaborate the suspense in various scenes, bringing the emotional draw to a peak. I enjoyed the twist where the film seemed to be over after Madeleine dies. The story had all its loose ends tied up, everything seemed to have fallen neatly in place for what was a good movie. Then it continues and Hitchcock runs with a continuing storyline that builds impressively off the first. He successfully follows through in giving a compelling presentation of the human psyche as seen in Scottie's development and decline in Vertigo. I highly recommend this film since it is a masterpiece of what film should be. Hitchcock's brilliance shines during the entirety of this picture, ranging from the great camera setups and impressive panning shots that really show off San Francisco to the simplicity in the colors of a scene. Hitchcock was very talented in bringing together the cast, sounds, images, and his vision to create this masterpiece on film.",10,5,6,15 October 2007
