The Blair Witch Project," Did I miss something?
","Call me crazy, but I didn't like it.  Everyone I went with and everyone else I know who have seen it said it was the scariest thing they'd ever seen.I'm not saying it was a horrible movie, but I just kind of sat through it, and it was done.  I never jumped, never held my breath, nothing.  I actually found it to be funnier than it was scary, because  of some of the one-liners thrown in there every once in a while.It was predictable.I guess if I went into the theater blind, not knowing anything about the movie, it might've been a little scarier...but alas, I saw some clips from the commercials and read about HOW the movie was made, so the whole experience didn't seem as real as everyone  makes it out to be.
Oh yeah...I felt like slapping that girl after about ten minutes.  She tried way too hard.",Null,1,3,19 July 1999
American Beauty," Perfect.
","It's the perfect movie.  Words  can't explain.  It's bound to be a new classic.  Easily the best movie of 1999, most likely in the top 5 movies of the 90's.  It's so funny, yet so tragic, and so beautifully made.  'It all goes downhill from here.'",9,0,0,27 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Wow.
","This movie is one of the strangest (but funniest) movies I've ever seen. The chase scene through Malkovich's subconscience, the chimpanzee's flashback to the jungle, and of course, Mr. Malkovich's trip to his own mind (I couldn't breathe, I laughed so hard)--all some of the most odd scenes I've ever seen.And yet, as novel as the story of becoming John Malkovich for 15 minutes at a time sounds, it really plays well--not just as a gimick, but as a vehicle to tell a love story (a very very odd love story).  Never once did I mutter 'This is stupid--that can't be done.' The writer and director (I can't believe it was Spike Jonze!) simply make us accept the fact that these people can enter the mind of John Malkovich...the rest just unfolds around that.(Best Original Screenplay?)Oh yeah, and the puppetry was beautiful, too.",9,0,0,30 October 1999
