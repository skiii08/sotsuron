Catch Me If You Can," Lost Boys come of age
","Don't believe I've ever seen a Stephen Spielberg, before this one, that was NOT branded with his particular mass-appeal style. At some point in his films, I usually feel poked in the ribs--okay, here's the punch-line from your All-American Boy, I-Love-The-Movies Director. His direction in Catch Me is coherent and strong without being intrusive, putting the story first.
Not that I want to start on a negative note. Catch Me is a really good film--funny, human--and different, for Hollywood, which usually likes its young male heroes to be hip, horny and heartless. Frank has a disarming vulnerability and attachment to his family. That lost-boy thread saves his story from being about someone who uses people, and it makes the movie.Fine acting from Di Caprio and Walken. Even the opening credits are first-rate--clever and entertaining, but leading the viewer to the credits, rather than distracting from them.",9,0,1,11 January 2003
Stop-Loss," A 'Deer Hunter' for the Iraq War
","Just saw this film in an advance screening and once the tension and threat (very real) of the opening battle scenes were borne and past, the film grew on me, as the story became one of the soldiers at home: their war aftermath and their war that just won't quit or let them go.It occurred to me at one point this was quite like watching a 'Deer Hunter' for the Iraq war. There were certainly similar aspects, including aspects of the soldiers' relationships with each other and with others at home, and in terms of the casualties and injuries that continue to pile up well after leaving the battlefield.Stop Loss is perhaps a more political film than the 'Deer Hunter' was, because of the timing of its release, while the issues of the war in the film are still very much on the boil in the USA. I think it intends to position itself in a relevant and timely place, and time will tell whether it has staying power as a lasting and powerful war or antiwar film.There is enough humanity, good drama and strong acting in this picture that it may deserve a place in the lineup of memorable or important American war films.",8,67,109,27 March 2008
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek hijacked by Hollywood terrorists
","An old WWII movie on TV just now had the lines, 'Just think about the peaceful past,' 'I've almost forgotten it.' Right. Went to see a Star Trek movie and a sequel to the last one, which I recollect as alright. Hollywood, though has not only forgotten the peaceful past, the Rodenberry vision that set Trek part from any other space operas. They've deliberately hijacked the characters, made them into a terrorist sleeper cell now activated in our midst to bring us explosions, Star Fleet on steroids, Spock jumping from the roof of one in-flight vehicle to another to show us he's not really that intellectual wuss Hollywoood hates-- he's a tough street fighter--get ,im, Spock!All 3D and action clichés, no ideas or vision, cartoon characters not worth...no wait, this is no accident or lazy business. The terrorists are on the bridge and they're going to land this ship where they damn well planned to--straight down the lowest common denominator path, shearing off the tops of buildings, sucking the wallets out of the pockets of customers satisfied with overpriced popcorn special effects, and landing right in the money. Kaboom. If you want big popcorn, go get it.",4,55,89,25 May 2013
Shutter Island," A little head game and a good watch
","My partner and I both read Dennis Lehane's book so went along cautiously, expecting this might be another case of a film not matching Dennis Lehane's reader experience—like Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River.' Fortunately, Scorcese had a better idea of how squeeze film juice out of book pages—he surprised me, from the opening shot, with the noirish and at times, Gothic gloom. Scorcese makes the story his own, and there's no need to worry whether the adaption is either faithful or energetic.We were both happy with the use of CGI special effects only to enhance the story and the audience getting into the head of Leo DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels character. In pre-computer days, a director such as Hitchcock didn't have this particular kind of paint in his paint box. We noticed the younger-than-us-audience was completely gripped by the film and we were also highly entertained, finding ourselves discussing it at length afterward—one sign of a good movie.Any quibbles I have with the film have nothing to do with Scorcese's movie, really, and more to do with how Lehane's story promises at the outset a fresh and perhaps subtle look back at mental health and its treatment in earlier days but in the end, never rises above certain contemporary stereotypes and fixations about what makes minds fall apart.Who won't enjoy it: the people who want to see the action-packed special effects movies pumped in the trailers before Shutter Island. Who will enjoy it: people who like a little head game with their moving pictures",8,1,4,22 February 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Pretty good, but don't drink the latte
","I've treated myself to two of the magical spectacles of the season, this one, and Harry Potter, and my money's on Harry Potter, simply because it didn't take itself so seriously, and at such length, as does this first instalment of the Tolkien Trilogy.Okay, so maybe my big mistake was the large latte at the beginning of a LONG flick, but jeesh, maybe an intermission was warranted?One feature of this movie that drew me to it, was the thought I missed something when I put the book down in my early '20s, unable to make myself continue, avid reader though I am. My imagination was captured by the t.v. teaser, with Liv Tyler telling Frodo (paraphrased): 'this task was given to you -- if you do not not succeed in carrying it out, no one will.' What I like about that is its beauty as a metaphor for life, for all our lives, not just those of hobbits and heroes. In essence, we are all given the special task of our own life, and if we do not succeed in our quest to live our own life to the hilt, then no one will.This film, though, doesn't quite live up to the large metaphors and the deep symbolism I went looking for. It's entertaining, nothing too extraordinary, and it does lag considerably, at times, ESPECIALLY if you had the latte.",7,0,0,29 December 2001
Hugo," The D in 3D stands for dimensions
","What Martin Scorcese has managed to do is add story dimensionality to a family film that has 3D technology. Some of the dimensions he's included which don't always make into Hollywood blockbusters are an imaginative and original concept, thematic unity and resonance and deft homage to film itself, in the story of Georges Méliès, French film pioneer.Saw the film in an advance screening and we were among the many there who were obviously not standard family film consumers. This being a Scorcese film is likely to bring lots of adults to Hugo and I would think many of them, like me, will feel the film stands up as entertainment for all age groups.I especially enjoyed the resonance and intricacy of the theme of clocks, clockworks, animatronics and 'the ghost in the machine'--our fear, in the post industrial age that perhaps we are just a rather complex machine, rather than a divine creation. This is all beautifully rendered cinematically. I doubt the little ones will be bewildered while older viewers can pick out levels and layers in the film.Good fun and visually interesting throughout. The 3D is used in service of the story. I hope Hollywood is watching and notices that special effects are only special when they get the heart of the machine working, like Hugo's little man.",8,97,170,22 November 2011
The Pianist," Making it real
","The Pianist is a masterpiece film--not only because it brilliantly depicts the stark reality of war--a particular war--and the persecution, specifically, of Jews in Warsaw. For me, this film attains the universal by way of the particular. It continually pulled me into its present moment and the challenges confronting the characters, making me question myself--who would I be in these circumstances--the brave one? the broken one? Would I steal food from my neighbours, ask another to her risk her life for me, fight back, give up?  The Pianist reminded me of my essential sadness about the kind of world we've made. It torqued up the tension I, and perhaps most people, possess but effectively evade, much of the time. That tension comes from hoping for something better, wishing that the best of who we are will pull through the worst circumstances--just as we hope for Szpilman to survive. I don't particularly like being made to bleed a little, but I am grateful to Polanski for rendering me a little more real and awake.",10,0,1,24 January 2003
JFK," A country incapable of scandal?
","The power of JFK as a film is affirmed for me when re-watching our director's cut video of the 1991 film. New information jumps out of the dense montage every time I watch this movie again, usually every 3 to 4 years.After nearly a decade, however, there is no longer a 'frisson' for me in the the courtroom line delivered by Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, pronouncing the JFK assassination to be a 'coup d'etat', a secret murder at the heart of contemporary US history. As a Canadian, I witness right-wing US political shenanigans like the recent Presidential election, and it's the same old stuff. It's been said that a country incapable of scandal is like a body incapable of pain, or a mind incapable of guilt. In my estimation, Stone does his capable filmmaker's best at trying to rehabilitate the scandal muscle in the American body politic. It is not at all clear he succeeds, though, even though his film is great entertainment and a viable 'counter myth. It seems that most often when Stone is mentioned in the US media, it's with an angry and derisive rejection of this film, and a deliberate effort to deny him stature as a filmmaker.Incapable of scandal? Perhaps not, perhaps merely unwilling.",9,2,14,29 December 2000
Pride & Prejudice," Bringing the characters out of the costumes
","I have to scout for (mostly female) friends to take in a drama like P&P as my mate won't go with me to 'costume dramas.' Now this 2005 version of the Jane Austen classic outdoes the previous dramatizations to the degree, I can see now, some of his objections to many stories set in European drawing rooms, especially those fussy with decorative but mercenary matchmaking. Joe Pike's P&P puts many formulaic or less than excellent period pieces in the shade.P&P's characters wear their costumes rather than being worn by them, dominated by 'period' gestures and stereotypes. P&P frees the characters from confinement in a quaint past, when women's independence was laughable and their lives and happiness were gained through scheming strategies to attract husbands.In Joe Pike's P&P the arch statements, the simpering younger Bennett girls and endless conversational references to the annual incomes of wealthy bachelors play out in a context of normal and recognizable human behaviour. Every raised eyebrow and fingered ribbon is naturalistic, the characters not mere types from a lamentable era whose strictures we shudder at.The casting in this film is sublime. Donald Sutherland is seldom used so much against type, and so well. Judi Dench is authoritative, as always, but not overpowering the feisty Miss Bennett. Keira Knightley has remarkable presence and strength (it's almost prejudicial to say, in such a young actor.) Add a convincing recreation of pastoral English countryside and country dances at which the dancers robustly enjoy themselves. Add also a finely rendered musical score, mostly of solo piano, integrated into the story line. And the panoramic sweeps of the camera, from the character's viewpoint, putting the viewer, too, at the centre of the experience. Well, as you can see, I'm just like a duck on the pond on Mr. D'Arcy's grand estate. Lots to feed me there, and I can certainly see going for a return visit or two.",9,0,1,2 February 2006
Groundhog Day," Rare! Philosophical Hollywood
","I enjoyed the film as entertainment and for Bill Murray at his best, with a serious flip side to his well-known flip attitude. More than that, though, I just LOVED Hollywood going philosophical on us, and doing a great job of it.Without giving too much of the story away, Murray's character faces the same situation most of us face, at some time: every day looks the same, the routine is unshakeable-- enough to drive you out of your mind. So what can you do?Well, naturally, you can try one sleazy thing after another-- Bill Murray's usual schtick. Then after all that has been tried and has failed (and here's where things become unusual, for Murray and for American popular movies) you can give up and do something really unusual, like trying to transform the rut you're in, by transforming yourself.Try it (the film) -- you'll probably like it. And if you're anything like me, you might even think of the movie, from time to time, when you feel stuck in a rut, and wonder what to do about it.",9,0,0,7 February 1999
12 Years a Slave," A tough watch that's worth watching
","Just returned home from seeing 12 Years a Slave with a friend, and this is one of those powerful movies that has me thinking about the film, the real story on which it was based, as though it were an event in my own life. If Steve McQueen directed no other film but this one his reputation as a director would be notable (I'm not familiar with his other films.) The hook of the story is that Solomon is not just 'another' slave—he's a kidnapped free man from the North, shipped to southern plantation life to line someone's pocket. By the time the film is over, you realize, it's a horror for human society that it takes a special case to draw us to this story and to witnessing the wretched immorality of slavery, when every case is equally wretched and hellacious—regardless of the birth or status of those made slaves. The moral wasting of those who enslave them is a full element of the piece.12 Years has the effect of making the audience feel as though we have been made captive along with Solomon. It's never prettified or softened and the ugly self-serving rationalizing of slave economies, slave masters and mistresses is omnipresent in the film. The horrors are bearable because we know Solomon must survive or his book of the same title as the film wouldn't have been written and his story told. Brad Pitt as producer cast himself in an unglamourous but positive role in the film—one of the few white characters to act honourably.See it with company, not alone. Just as with Solomon, we want a little less solitude to go through this.",Null,5,10,7 January 2014
Sherlock Holmes," Rock 'em Sock 'em Sherlock (yawn)
","Having no faith in A. Conan Doyle's original cerebral hero and doctor sidekick, or in the capacity of North American audiences to enjoy that, Hollywood's given us a Holmes who's into martial arts and girls who wear lots of eye makeup and look really cute getting into trouble (not Rachel MacAdam's best turn, to say the least.) I had a premonition, sitting through all those action-oriented trailers before the movie started, this wasn't going to be what I expected (maybe Downey Junior acting, as he can do very well--here, he's mostly mugging.) Oh well, next time read up beforehand and know what's on offer before shelling out for the big-screen, slug fest holiday season blockbuster.",5,6,12,27 December 2009
Signs," Eek, low-budget xenophobia
","I was really looking forward to this one, as friends reported, 'a really good ghost story' and the trailers suggested strong suspense. It was tense for a while, but by its conclusion, this film left a sour taste in my mouth. It seems 'symbolic', alright, of a US state of mind tuned up to xenophobic hysteria, in the wake of 9-11.Lacking imagination, all the writers and filmakers could come up with is a confrontation with laughable invading monsters lacking feeling or rational motive, thwarted by fearful but righteous and practical Earthlings, who win out 'cause they're hewers of wood and drawers of water--salt of the earth types. And the Lord, too, IS, on their side, and delivers up miracles to order.This being Hollywood, we could have at least been treated to some decent effects--sound effects aside. It really is rather low-budget. Pitter-pattering feet were about the biggest scare that Signs could muster. I think Hollywood, or this director, anyway, thinks an American audience hears pitter-pattering at the barricades, and served up some signs made to order.",5,0,1,17 January 2003
