Scarface," F***ing Great!!!
","Al Pacino is nonetheless, the greatest actor ever, his performance in this milestone is one of the many great ones he's had throughout his career. He is never short of astonishing, and never ceases to impress me and his viewers, nobody in my opinion would have played Antonio Montana better than Al. NOBODY!! The whole cast, plot, violence, and even humor are great. This is my alltime favorite movie simply because of everything it shows. This movie will be admired and known of forever, i don't care what criticism it might get. People should thank Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma for giving audiences this amazing masterpiece.",10,1,2,21 October 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Covering fire!!!
","hmm, Steven Spielberg was as phenomenal as usual with the directing of this epic milestone, Tom Hanks's performance was as intriguing as it can get, all the characters had their separate uniqueness. Captain John Miller, played by Hanks is a retired school teacher who struggles to accept the reality he and his men are in, even though he hides his true emotions from his group, he afterwards shows his feelings towards the mission, Sgt. Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore) plays one of the most important parts in this film, he's the captain's closest friend and companion, his respect towards the captain is more than acceptable, Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns) is the desperate soldier who shows his frustration and anger towards the mission, and another guy, Private Jackson (Barry Pepper) is the silent and confident sniper, his character is to me the best in the film, part of it is because of how he praises The Lord while blowing the Germans away. It all gives the viewer a sense of belief. The story characterizes the true monstrosity and utter horror that is war. Especially WW2, until i saw this did i realize the importance of knowing what our heroes went through every day then, something to admire. Plot, Cast, (only minus was the apparently non-existent allies) but nevertheless, great film. The large content gives the viewer an overwhelming view of reality and how gruesome people can be during war time, its an emotional film and definitely one to remember. 10/10.",10,1,2,27 October 2004
