Catch Me If You Can," High schoolish
","A garbage performance. Poor casting of DeCaprio in this role. Not quite to walk out on, but not very good either. This thing just doesn't fly.",Null,1,2,13 July 2003
Seabiscuit," Best movie I have seen in a couple of months
","After sitting through Charlie's Angels (a bummer from the darkest and hottest crevices of the Underworld) and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, I was really yearning for a movie to enjoy, something that had a reasonable story and did not insult the intelligence of a cabbage.Seabiscuit is a very nice story, with nice people, entertaining, if a bit too long.I kept subliminally pulling for old Jeff to make the deadline and really get those 'Tuckers' completed in time, but was brought back to reality by the chimes of the race track announcer.Actually, an evening well spent...",Null,0,0,3 August 2003
Gangs of New York," Say, what?
","A strange movie...lots of violence, making me wonder if this is historical or just coke dreams.Leonardo,'you say it best, when you say nothing at all', although this effort was not nearly as amateurish as 'Catch Me If You Can'.Surely better movies are on the horizon.",Null,0,0,16 July 2003
