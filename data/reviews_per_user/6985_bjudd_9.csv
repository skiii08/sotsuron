The Blair Witch Project," Did I miss something?
","Boy, I sure would like to see the film that most of the reviewers and those writing comments here have seen.  The film I saw wasn't scary in any aspect. Yes, there were a few creepy moments and nice build up at the end, but is there anything truly scary about this film?  No.  I honestly cannot fathom why people are calling this the scariest movie in history.  Most of the film was watching these people walk through the woods.  There was a chance for them to build psychological terror of being lost in the woods, but that was put on the back burner in favor showing night time events where nothing materializes.  I was highly disappointed in what I saw as false advertising for this film.",3,1,4,18 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A surprisingly intelligent film
","I believe this is the first film I have seen that was very funny, obscene, violating, often in poor taste, and addressed social issues all in one. There are some parts in South Park that shocked the hell out of me.  There are were also parts that had me crying with laughter.  Rarely has a film been so out to shock the most unshockable viewer.  It also addresses pretty much every social problem/issue in America.  South Park really should have been rated NC-17--adults will enjoy this movie and should see it.  The kids should be taught the good messages in the movie by their parents and not allowed to see it until they are old enough.",10,0,0,20 July 1999
American Beauty," The Best Film Of The Year
","Films like 'American Beauty' reinstall my often decreasing faith and love for American cinema.  This film showcases in heartbreaking clarity the desire to connect with another human being that each one of us feels. Lester is trying to connect to his daughter through her best friend, his wife is trying to connect with him through having an affair, and his daughter is trying to connect with him through her boyfriend.  The boy next door is trying to connect with the beauty he sees in the girl next door, and his father has a desire to connect with his 'secret,' but pushes that away through his homophobic rantings.  This film vividly portrays how disconnected American society has become by showcasing the 'American Dream' as a dreary, empty bore.I also applaud this film for both laughing at and deeply appreciating all the characters.  In the beginning each is a stereotype who evolves through the movie's progression into real people who feel empty and who eventually learn how to enjoy life on some level.I hope there will be Oscars all around for this film and Kevin Spacey will inevitably win Best Actor.  However, I fear this film may suffer a similar fate that 'Bulworth' did in 1998.  That too was a biting social satire that was grossly underrated by both the public and the Academy.",10,1,2,20 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Original
","I found myself often dumbfounded during 'Being John Malkovich.' Not because I did not enjoy the film; rather, I could not believe Hollywood actually produced this wonderfully innovated and creative script.I have little to say about the film, since it speaks for itself and is quite indescribable.  Just see it.  There is nothing else like it on the video shelf.",Null,0,0,8 May 2000
Man on the Moon," A very satisfying movie.
","'Man on the Moon' comes at the tail end of a year of great movies, including 'American Beauty,' 'The Insider,' 'Fight Club,' 'The Sixth Sense,' and 'Summer of Sam.'  Although I was a bit frustrated with the lack of exploration into Kaufmann's childhood in beginning of the film, I soon realized that the film did not deeply explore certain aspects of his life because nobody (even those closest to him) did not know a whole lot about him.  I then realized this movie was perfectly capturing this enigmatic character.Jim Carrey's performance is absolutely phenomenal.  He captures the essence of Kaufmann's insanity, while still allowing him to be human when they show Andy with his performance 'hat' off.  Being completely ripped last year by not receiving an Oscar nod for 'The Truman Show,' Carrey should gain his long-deserved respect from the Academy this year.  If it does not happen again, it will be an absolute crime.The movie as a whole is also tremendous, with Milos Forman doing a top-notch directing job with this bioptic.  R.E.M. also provided great music for the film.  There should be Oscar noms for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Original Score.  I would even like to see a best supporting actor nod for Paul Giamatti, but that will be a long shot.The best part of the entire film is the beginning, which would probably be how Kaufmann would have started the film himself.  Absolutely perfect!",10,0,0,25 December 1999
The Insider," Enthralling from beginning to end
","It is amazing when a film close to three hours long can keep the viewer glued to the seat the entire time.  This film is wonderful, filled with tremendous performances (the best by the underrated Crowe) and lacking in silly car chases and murders that usually define this genre.  This film is filled with true style and masterful storytelling.  Bravo!",10,0,0,6 November 1999
The Insider," A vivid and compelling film
","'The Insider' could have been a troublesome film, since most people know how it turns out and the controversy captured in the film is often material taken on my TV movies.  However, Michael Mann directs a film that captured me from beginning to end and never once did I feel restless throughout the entire three hours.We all know the story and probably most know how it ends.  This film is about standing up in the midst of strong opposition and doing what one feels is the right thing to do.  This theme is often portrayed in cheesy sitcoms and dopey films, but this film shows how much of a struggle it was for Wigand and how he almost gave up doing anything at all, making him all the more human and inspiring.  Michael Mann's film shows Wigand as a human being, rather than an idealized hero.Russell Crowe gives the performance of his career, which is saying a lot since he has continually impressed me with outstanding performances.  His work, along with the rest of the actors besides Basinger, on 'L.A. Confidential was ridiculously shut out of most award nominations.  Although Basinger did a great job, Crowe was just as deserving of recognition.  I believe he will give Kevin Spacey a huge run for his money when Oscar night comes around.  Spacey, Crowe, and Carrey will all battle it out for what may be one of the most intense Best Actor competitions in recent memory.Al Pacino gives his usual powerful performance and, since this is expected, his fabulous work will probably gain little fanfare in terms of nominations.One complaint about the film: it the last 20 or so minutes of the movie, Wigand is completely forgotten and Pacino's character becomes the central focus.  This seemed to shift the movie in an entirely different direction and it seemed to run of course.Overall, an excellent film that will compete heavily with 'American Beauty' as the best movie of the year.",10,0,0,25 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Another slice of genius from Kubrick
","Being very biased toward anything Stanley Kubrick records on film, I really enjoyed Eyes Wide Shut.  Although the plot of this film was not as interesting as his previous, the performances by the most of the cast (kudos especially to Kidman), the director's stark visual style, and the eerie musical score came together to create a great movie experience.  My only complaint is the casting of Tom Cruise.  He seems sorely out of place in a Kubrick film.  Most actors seem to blend quite well into the 'Kubrick-world,' but he sticks out terribly and I never truly believed his performance.  That aside, I enjoyed this film tremendously.  Just like what a previous person wrote, this film is not for the mainstream, but it will be enjoyable for all us die-hard Kubrick fans.",10,0,0,20 July 1999
The Green Mile," Confused about its message
","So was this movie about a Christ-like figure who is killed because his actions are misunderstood?  Or is it about the guilt one man feels because he allowed someone innocent to be executed?  Or was it about what happens in to people who do not speak up with the truth?This confusion is at the center of 'The Green Mile,' a film that is wonderful in some place, but baffling in others.  I loved the prison guard characters, especially the empathy and 'humanness' at each of their cores. They establish relationships with the death row inmates, and seem torn apart when one finally has to die.  I also thought the movie as a whole moved quite quickly through its 3 hour plus length.However, I am still quite confused after seeing it.  Was the prisoner with the healing powers supposed to symbolize Jesus Christ?  It seems this was the road the filmmakers were taking in the beginning, but then the character did certain things Jesus would never have done.  And what about the ending? This movie seemed to be moving toward a more upbeat, uplifting ending.  As a result, I couldn't help but feeling that the whole 'curse' ending was tacked on and really did not have anything to do with the rest of the film.  I think this opitimizes the confusion it seems the filmmakers had about what this movie was supposed to say and stand for.'The Green Mile' is not a bad film, but it should not gain that many Oscar nods.  I think the Golden Globes made the right call, it was a good film, but not one of the best of the year.  With a great year of films, including 'American Beauty,' 'The Insider,' and 'The Man on the Moon,' 'The Green Mile' does not cut it as one of the best of the year.",6,1,2,25 December 1999
