Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Duel
","Regardless of your feeling about the rest of the film, you must agree that the lightsaber duel at the end of the film is nothing short of amazing. It's like watching a space-age ballet choreographed to John Williams' 'Duel of the Fates.'  The sound is also unbelievably outstanding.  With lightsabers spinning around the room and flashing before your eyes, you can't help but feel as if your heart is going to pound right out of your chest.  I've seen the film 9 times now and I still get a chill down my spine every time the 'duel' begins.  If you've needed a reason to justify seeing this film here it is. Go!",10,0,0,11 July 1999
