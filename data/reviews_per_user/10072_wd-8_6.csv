Blade Runner 2049," A Masterpiece of modern cinema
","The finest film I have ever seen.Yes, a masterpiece of canon, and style, and production. Spare and sensual, with an extraordinary central performance by Ryan Gosling, great plotting and dialogue in an examination of the nature of love, of memory and of identity. The best of science fiction in that it explores who we really are under almost inconceivable stresses.You can feel the love and effort poured into this movie in every second of film. The music evokes and expands on the original, returns us to this future we know so well from so long ago now.Remember: Science fiction has no ceiling.10 stars.",10,9,22,5 October 2017

I've just seen Blade Runner 2049 for the third time today. I've never done this before for any movie.Extraordinary. Wonderful. A true masterpiece. Each time I see it, it gets better, deeper, and more profound. The script, direction and performances are flawless.
The gentle love scene with the hologram Joi actively blending with the real girl Mariette, matching their movements, to allow Joi to physically express her love for K is exquisite. Astonishing. The best and most extraordinary love scene I've ever experienced in the cinema. I wept.So much of this movie is so profound, so searching and wonderful. The themes of identity, memory, and love are explored with joy and respect. I will see the movie again, in a week or so.",10,2,6,15 January 2018
Gravity," Compelling, Exciting, Stunning and spare - perfect
","I love 'hard' science fiction, where what you see is entirely within the laws of physics, a re- made true universe in which human beings are subjected to the most unusual of 'true' circumstances not found on earth. The level of accuracy here is quite amazing, and only minor truths are changed to advance the plot and keep it compact and breathlessly well- paced.Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney shine in this spare and amazingly well-paced movie. This is not a 90 minute movie stretched to 2.5 hours, this is a 90 minute movie presented as it happens. Outstanding!Ms Bullock's best ever role, after a mostly wasted career (in my rarely humble opinion). She is a mission specialist, not a 'full blown' astronaut, with limited space training, as compared to Mr Clooney's faultless performance as the seasoned, 'true' spaceman. The balance between their performances is nuanced and true.This is the first movie (after the jungle scenes in Avatar) which truly benefits from the 3D treatment. I wish we could return to active-shutter 3D glasses, the current ones noticeably reduce brightness and color, sadly. But nonetheless, the 3D adds amazing depth in the optical airlessness of space.I also found shades of the first Ripley re-born in Ms Bullock's space girl. She truly grows in the roll before our eyes, showing that women truly can be just as competent and creative as any man.I award this movie my highest rating. See it on the big screen NOW.",10,9,21,6 December 2013
Ready Player One," Very disappointing, and I hated the book.
","This movie was better than the atrocious book. If you love high school, acne and teenage angst, this movie and book are for you.Speilberg was asleep at the wheel here, focused on technical mastery without any heart whatsoever. We don't care about any of the characters, and find their struggles to be just a giant boring cartoon.Save your money, ignore this movie and the book, too.",4,2,5,1 April 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen
","This abortion of a movie should never have seen the light of day. With a credits list of OVER 1,300 people, you think someone would have put their hand up and said 'Umm... Wait a minute'This is supposed to be 1974, but apparently no one bothered to check any actual history. Even the props are more modern, with an office full of DEC-VT100 display terminals from 1978 and later. Many other items in this movie are clearly more modern than they should be. Totally lazy for such an expensive project.I guess if you cast Samuel L. Jackson into anything these days, it must pass his 'cartoon silliness test' to be produced. Tarantino can get away with this with great dialog and action. The clowns producing this hairball should hide their faces in public.You can tell from the very beginning that this is going to be bad. Even if you, as did I, go into it expecting very little. The setup of the movie is long and face-slapping cliché. The actors, whom we know to be quite skilled, are entirely wasted by bad bad bad dialogue and bad direction. The editing is not so good either.And when we get out onto the ocean (1974 remember), we are insulted by Hollywood physics and meteorology. A huge storm doesn't even churn up the waves near the ship *facepalm*Of course, the dorks then fly their non-vintage helicopters into the hell-storm, with super-fake lightning all around, and get through to see the beautiful islands.Within a few minutes, ALL of them have been knocked down by insisting on flying close enough to Kong to get bashed *facepalm* holy crap.Things only get more clichéd from there, with the grizzly 28 year survivor (with the 20 year old son at the end), the demented Samuel Jackson staring and almost drooling as he chews the scenery.Vietnam veterans are insulted by their blind obedience to a ranting idiot. Civilians and military alike enter 'the valley of death' in spite of the writers allowing some of the characters to suggest it's a bad idea.And then it gets really bad. 'OMG bad'.And in all of this, you feel incredibly bored. It's dull, and bad, and stupid.Oh, and the 'teaser for the idiots' sequel' comes after the 1,300+ lines of credits, if you are not asleep or barfing in the toilet.Astoundingly bad.",1,295,556,17 March 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Very unusual, NOT a movie for young kids.
","Very unusual, NOT a movie for young kids. A sensitive and extraordinary way to tell this story of a young boy's realisation of the horrors of Nazism. Performances all around are superb, especially by young Roman Griffin Davis. Highest praise for the treatment of a very difficult subject.",8,2,4,11 February 2020
