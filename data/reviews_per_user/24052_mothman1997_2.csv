Raiders of the Lost Ark," Truly a Masterpiece
",***SPOILERS*** even before this movie steven spielberg & george lucas had given themselves a name in Hollywood with by making such masterpieces as Starwars and Jaws they casted Harrison Ford as Indy at the time he was mostly known has Han solo from starwars but did incredible job as the hero Indiana Jones the story is extremely creative and complicated but not to the part where its to boring or complicted to enjoy there is a very subtle sense humor that will keep you entertained its a great movie and through out the the years there were 3 sequels and maybe I will get to those later but right now if you want a great movie to watch at anytime i highly recommend this film,Null,1,2,26 August 2011
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Masterpiece
",!!!!SPOILERS!!!! Wes craven can go to his grave knowing that he made two of the best horror movies (nightmare on elm street & Scream)in this classic a teenage girl and her friends are having nightmares about a burned man with knives attached to a glove. that right there is got to be the most creative plot ever the idea of someone killing you in your dreams which causes you to die in real life is terrifying that and the fact you cant run away from it you have to sleep and sooner or later you will fall asleep and then Freddy will get you and unlike Michael myers or Jason vorhess who you can just simply run away from if the characters would stop being dumb-asses and learn to run Freddy can do anything in the dream so running away isn't going to help speaking of the dreams at times in the movie it would blur the line between dreams and reality which would confuse the people watching the film which was a genius idea. this movie also has some of the most gruesome but creative deaths for example the scene where johnny depps character glen falls asleep and get pulled into the bed he was sleeping on or Tina Grey who got drug up the wall and the ceiling its amazing that they were able to these special effects considering the extremely low budget the character devolpment is great they devolpe Freddy just enough well this review cant do this movie justice just go watch the movie and see for your self,10,0,0,14 July 2011
