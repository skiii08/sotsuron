Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How could anyone not love this?
","People are going to tell you that this was an awful film.  Don't listen to them.  It really was superb.  And yes, Jar Jar will annoy you, but the good thing about him is this:  There is no reason for him to be in the next 2 films!  YAY!You are going to see things done with lightsabers that you never expected, and the battle scene at the end with Darth Maul will blow you away. Absolutely incredible, and not disappointing at ALL!!!!",10,0,0,21 May 1999
