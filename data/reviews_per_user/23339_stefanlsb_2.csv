Skyfall," Truly epic film
","This film is without a doubt one of the best Bond's ever. This 'it's not a proper Bond' line is simply rubbish. There is a crazed Villain, Money Penny, M, Q, some sex, great music (including a proper theme tune), an Aston Martin DB5 solid action scenes and unexpected twists and turns in the plot around every corner. This was the only way you could do a modern Bond film without breaking too many traditions. Die Another Day was awful, Casino Royale was good but not 'Bond' enough (for me anyway) and Quantum of Solace was simply a terrible film.If you preferred Quantum of Solace, then I suggest that you go see a Bourne film. The plot holes people here mention are not plot holes, as they are explained in the film. I believe this to be a 'relaunch', so that we can have some even better films in the future. This was Mendes' 'Batman Begins'. I for one cannot wait for his Dark Knight.",8,1,6,2 August 2013
Quantum of Solace," Poor direction, poor plot, poor film.
","This is my least favourite Bond of all time. The plot is just dull. Damien Greene is probably the most boring villain in Bond history. The idea was that he was creating a monopoly using the water. Heardly destroying the earth while stationing your humans in space, is it? Fleming would have hated this. There is no great tech, no Q or Monney Penny and he doesn't even sleep with the Bond girl. Every action scene is just a rapid flash of images. The beginning scene is particularly poor, as both Bond's car and Quantum's car are black in colour, making it difficult to follow. The music is also poor. Another Way to Die is just not a Bond song. Thank god we didn't get another one of these, otherwise the Bond series would simply be lost.",4,3,4,2 August 2013
