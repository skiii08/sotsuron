The Avengers," Not impressed.
","Was not impressed. Wouldn't go as far to say it was as bad as Transformers 2 and 3 but it was aiming to be.Story wise it was a piece of crap. Typical good vs bad. Acting not so good. The only thing that was protecting these flaws was the special effects. Buildings fell, things blew up, blah blah blah. The end of the movie was meant to be epic but it was very underwhelming. I was thinking that this was meant to be an advanced alien race. I also thought that Cpt America was meant to be a badass but it turns out he wears pyjamas not chainmail.It was memorable... only because it was so disappointing.",3,7,16,23 December 2013
