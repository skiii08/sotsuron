Love and Death," Woody does a Shtick-dump.
","Woody Allen used a plot-thread from 'War & Peace' on which to hang his backlog of jokes.  And he never lets up, even when you try to groan your surrender.  Even his lampoons of Tolstoy's philosophical passages and Bondarchuk's close-ups fish for laughs.This was the old Woody at his height.  He had maxed his joke-writing career. If you look carefully underneath it all you can see his later self ready to hatch;  the self that flew so brilliantly in 'Annie Hall' and never quite since.  As it is, enjoy this, the last portrait of the artist as a young man.(Given that it's Woody Allen, I say 'artist' with great caution.)",7,0,1,29 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Rated Z - as in 'Zzzz...'
","Anyone who saw 'The Godfather, Part III' knows what happens when you try to make a movie-sequel with one eye on the 'legacy' of the pic instead of both eyes on the story.There are way too many things to go into but I'll mention three: 1)  I thought Anakin comes into this story way too young. 2)  Young Obi-Wan Kenobi isn't wild enough - 'young & wild' go have been in the movies for decades - they're great when they work together.  We should meet him earlier, when he hasn't yet learned Jedi discipline.  Nor should he quite learn all of it for some time after. 3)  I couldn't keep track of which was the queen and which was the servant girl.And now, for the cliches:  I wanted to like this movie but I couldn't. All the right Star Wars ingredients are there but they just don't gel. There's really nobody to root for and we already know what's going to happen to the kid.It seems to me that Lucas can't decide whose story this is:  the Skywalker family or the Jedi Knights.  They're 'inextricably linked' but, like I said, in this pic they don't quite gel.",5,0,1,26 May 1999
Fight Club," Style and attitude do not a story make
","Sorry, gang;  I'm giving this a thumbs down.  This pic has great cinamatography and art direction but that only makes it a video, not a movie.The director and writer had a few ideas for half a movie but couldn't think of anything else while the bills piled up.  The first act was good enough but would have been better if it had made up it's mind where it was going. Too many scenes which promised something proved to be red herrings while others just plain dragged.  The last act summed up nothing which went on before;  it also introduced character relationships and elements which hadn't been seen earlier. Thus the story arc was a complete wreck.  On top of all that, the whole movie runs some 30 to 40 minutes too long.  All of which are the classic signs of poor direction and writing.  It brings to mind the fiasco that was Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991).
It started out as an off-beat buddy movie and ended as cheesy, pyschodramatic wish-fulfillment shlock on a par with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) except with a bigger budget and no catchy songs.  It calls out, `look at me!' but then says nothing else, hoping a fashionably alienated, post-ironic attitude will make up the difference.  It never did and never will.",4,1,4,9 August 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Anybody remember 'National Lampoon's Animal House'?
","Remember when NLAH was the gross-out comedy flick of all time?  20 years from now, SP:BL&U will seem just as tame as its food-fighting predecessor does now.Long after the gross-out factor fades, though, this flick will be remembered for holding up a mirror to the idiocies of its time like no other movie has done and only certain books have.In the meantime, I went and bought the soundtrack, before the anally correct, holy uncle-f**kas had it taken off the market.  But I'm still having a hard time understanding Cartman singing 'Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch.'",8,0,0,12 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Filthy, Foul-Mouthed, Funny

(no telling when it will be illegal.)But it's all in a good cause that has nothing to do with bombing the fertilizer out of Canada (why are we allowed to swear in cartoons but not on this website?)The point is, Parker & Stone are telling us that political rectaltude is a non-cure far worse than the diseases it says it's trying to cure.They're right.They once said in an interview that they've been going through this since they were in film school in Colorado where '[they] were the only ones there who didn't want to make black & white films about lesbians.'One thought:  where the hell was Jesus, the local call-in talk-show host, when all hell was breaking loose in South Park?",8,0,0,6 July 1999
Elizabeth," Yeah, yeah, it's great and all that ...
","History pix are impossible to 'get right' 100% and they're subject to the director's and the time's interpretation.  So I won't go into the details here;  suffice to say this was a well-made movie.And well-acted.  It's a big break for Cate Blanchett but my concern is that she may have done this role only too well; i.e., that she ends up remembered only for this role -- worse yet, that she ends up in Elizabeth-esque roles (tough, regal, remote, &c.) the rest of her career.  Just look at 95% of Al Pacino's roles since 'The Godfather.'",Null,0,0,1 December 1998
MASH," Vietnam Attitude in a Korea Setting
","Brutal humor, if you can take the smugness.  The 'Oscar' people couldn't; they gave the Best Picture Award to 'Patton,' although 'MASH' won for Best Adapted Screenplay.  Evidently, even the Academy was a battleground for the 'Generation Gap' (remember that one?)'MASH' sets the tone for irreverence early by first shooting at the biggest sacred cow of all:  religion.  Hawkeye and Duke mock Frank Burns for his arrogant, outwardly-sincere-but-inwardly-fascist religious beliefs.  Does Frank forgive them?  Just look in his eyes:  he hates them.  A cinematic first:  never before was dress-yourself-up-and-get-down-on-your-knees White-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant American Christianity so undressed.'MASH' doesn't pull punches, not with the humor and not when they're operating on the war's wounded - gore galore.  They may be clowns outside but inside they're 'the Pros from Dover.'  And here institutional religion takes another, if lighter, touch:  Duke calls Army chaplain Father Mulcahy from giving the Last Rites to a dead patient to help save a still-living one.  Frank Burns is a fraud, Father Mulcahy is genuine but this is the real world.Whether they're dealing with too much blood, not enough blood, Frank Burns' poisoned soul, Hot Lips' Army-superbrat attitude, ripped-open live humans, Painless' idiotic self-misdiagnosis, snotty Army brass, sick babies, power outages,  or megalithic football machines, our heroes stay sane in an insane place by PLAYACTING insane.  'We don't care who you are or what you think you're entitled to.  We don't let our friends or our enemies go insane. We'll do it by out-insaning you.'  They've found the medicine for Sartre's dictum 'hell is other people,' or Fall's book 'Hell in a Very Small Place.' These doctors are anti-doctrine and pro-good-sense.'MASH' is chock-full of tweaks, takes and jokes at any and every self-satisfied cultural assumption that was mid-late-1900s America - many of which, sad to say, are still here.  Insanities reincarnate left and right but a dose of 'MASH' will always be the remedy for what ails you.And it does it all without foul language.",Null,1,3,17 March 1999
The Aviator," A bitter disappointment
","I loved it for the acting, especially Cate Blanchett (qv) as Katherine Hepburn (qv), but otherwise I was left wondering if it was ever going to develop a story line on his personal life. There's absolutely no mention that Hughes gave Hepburn the money to buy the movie rights to the Broadway hit 'The Philadelphia Story,' which turned her career around for good. Blanchett may well be the first actor or actress to win an Oscar for playing another Oscar winner, and would well deserve it.Kate Beckinsale (qv) as Ava Gardner (qv) is as radiant as the real thing but if this part of Hughes' life wasn't in the movie as written I would never have missed it.Leonardo DiCaprio (qv) fills the screen like he always does, but not even his star quality and his talent don't make up for the movies meanderings from the plot. His gives and takes with Alan Alda (qv) as Senator Harry Reid are well enough, but it's like watching a rehearsal instead of a finished product. Alec Baldwin (qv) as Juan Trippe, the boss at Pan AM, seems to be grateful to phone in his character from GlenGarry Glen Ross (1992) _(qv)_.The airplane scenes, whether flying, building or even just talking technicals, held me in place. In fact, these were the only scenes which did. A movie shouldn't let me wander. This one did, and I hold Martin Scorsese (qv) responsible. He should listen to his film editors much more as well as his writers.",6,84,159,27 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'Star Wars' pales in comparison!
","All too rarely does a movie match the inspiring book in both spirit and text.  The Fellowship of the Ring does so far better than I'd dared hoped. Thank humanity for modern technology!  Thank Peter Jackson for his sweat, his time and his heart!  Thank J.R.R. Tolkien for setting the bar so high!",10,0,0,14 January 2002
The Usual Suspects," Great; could have been greater.
","This movie should have been titled 'Keyser Soze.'  Like eponymous prop in 'The Maltese Falcon', Soze isn't even mentioned until halfway through the movie but he comes to dominate everything and everyone.  Instead, we start off with the five title characters but soon it's not their story.  It's almost as if it were the start of one move and the last half (but not the end) of another.The movie never lets up in building tension and new twists.  Events pile up on top of one another until every one is caught up in Soze's net.  You can almost see writer Christopher McQuarrie bahing on the keys and then stopping & asking himself, 'and THEN what?!'Still, I have to wonder about that line 'The gretest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.'  It's great but it sticks out like a sore thumb.  If that's supposed to be a film-noir throwback (the great era for lines) then the rest of the dialogue should have supported it, or a wise-crack like in the film-noir era or it should have been the unspoken subtext.Whatever your opinion on that line or the twist ending, you can't deny that McQuarrie earned his Oscar nor Spacey his.",9,0,1,20 February 2001
Blue Crush," Gidget goes out there.
","This is light-years better than it should have been.  Director John Stockwell has reinvented the surf flick for the '00s generation.  He wisely lets the Hawaiian waves do most of the acting.  I can only hope the Academy offers Oscars for Oceanography.
The plot is bare but bearable:  a competitor must overcome her demons to grow up.  Exactly what a surfer's demons are you'll just have to go see for yourself.  No great talents are taxed by this story but the scenery and the setting make everything look great.  Kate Bosworth may well have a future on the screen, especially if she keeps working in sunny climates.",8,0,0,16 August 2002
Saving Private Ryan," What's it worth?
","Being an amateur historian, SPR confirmed a lesson I had already learned: next time the USA gets into a war -- WIN IT!  And don't let up or pull punches until the enemy is beaten and *knows* he's beaten.  FDR was the last US president who could make up his mind to win a war.  Truman split the difference in Korea -- granted, a good move in an uncertain world.  LBJ sent millions into a war he had absolutely no intention of winning or even settling for a Korea-style armistice.  Bush, with his hazy, myopic talk about some 'New World Order' and 'the vision thing', is now unemployed while Saddam Hussein still butchers Iraqi civilians and blames the UN (read: US) for it.  And Clinton -- great at negotiating a peace, for those who want peace.  But for those who don't...?I refer, of course, to the scene dripping with face-to-face hate where the German SS trooper (betcha didn't notice he was) whom they let go on a promise to turn himself in ('be-e-e-e good!') shoots and knifes some of them while the last one sits in a soiled diaper of his own fear and self-pity. Minerva was the Greco-Roman Goddess of Wisdom;  she was also the Gs. of Just Wars.  But this was the image of Mars: the God of Combat in War.  Even von Clausewitz refers to the Hate in combat.(Pause.  Deep breath.)That much said, I have to agree with just about every comment on SPR.  The story is weak.  The bits with the flags and the strings are maudlin, to say the least.  And all the other stuff about plot development/character development.  Yes, Spielberg himself admitted it took the disillusionment of the Vietnam War to make this movie, yet he still blatantly tugs at your heartstrings -- he's been doing that since ET;  I've long since learned to ignore his saccharine ploys.  And yes, this is one of the best movies ever made, even if there were better war or antiwar pics made.  Only the battle scenes really make this movie -- it should get the Oscar for Cinematography.But the thing I got from SPR throughout was from the characters griping about why they should risk their necks for one man.  The general theme of the movie appears, to me at any rate, to be 'this $%^& better be worth it!' -- the universal gripe from the universal soldier.  Now, you tell me, is any of this $%^& worth your neck or mine if your side has absolutely no intent of winning or even getting something out of all this?  The US military morale went down the toilet after 1968 and spent the '70s in a drug-induced haze.  It took Reagan's 1980s build-up to rebuild morale;  without it the Gulf War would never have been so one-sided.No, I'm no soldier, nor some fascist war-freak in a rathole filled with white-trash-militia collectables.  I've watched the horrors of war comfortably on my TV or my PC, just like many of us surfing this site.  I'm as revulsed as anyone else at the pictures and the news-stories.  I get an impotent rage demanding 'do something, Powers-That-Be!', knowing full well they have no idea what to do, given the limits they set on themselves.  I'm as pro-peace as they come.  But I'm also pro-good-sense -- not just 'common-sense.'  There was a difference between Chamberlain and Churchill. One saw hell coming and tried to buy it off; the other saw it coming and said, 'get ready!'  And this, certainly, was a disciple of Minerva.(Pause again.  Another deep breath.)I'd say more but the guys with the butterfly nets have traced me.  Just let me sign off by saying that if we want a world at peace then we best make our minds up to make that peace and *enforce* it!  Nobody did in the 1930s; that's why there was a *Second* World War.One other thing -- I wonder how will SPR play on home-video?  Will it be as horrifying?",Null,0,0,2 November 1998
Lawrence of Arabia," Very Great . and Very British
","I don't mean my title to this commentary in a perjorative sense.  I'm simply pointing out that there are more than one side to a story.  An Arab director would have made a movie about Prince Faisal, where Lawrence would have been a featured but peripheral character.  Indeed, I sometimes wonder why one hasn't yet - you'd think that some altruistic patron of the arts from the Fayed family would spring for it . oh, well.During the Persian Gulf War, there were a lot of columns in the American newspapers about American stereotypes of Arabs.  One ethnic-Arab columnist in The Washington Post used L. of A. as his source.  I'm not directly quoting but he described Anthony Quinn's Auda as melodramatically over-the-top and Alec Guinness' Faisal as oily.  He found only Ali a believable character but only because Omar Sharif himself is an Arab.In any case, I couldn't possibly add to the superlatives already attached to this movie.  It's a simple story, grandly told.And this is just the stuff they didn't leave out!  For what they did leave out, there are dozens of histories and biographies, starting with Lawrence's own 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom.'",Null,0,1,7 June 1999
Pulp Fiction," Devils and Angels, Damnation and Redemption
","The rock 'n' roll packaging is a spoonful of sugar for this movie's theme: 'damnation or redemption?'Every character is either redeemed from their sins or damned for them; they're either angels or devils, or souls beset by the latter and in dire need of the former to show them the way out.But who would care if PF hadn't been so well written, directed, produced or even acted in the first place?",10,0,1,3 October 2000
Mystic River," Note to Clint: novels aren't screenplays
","(Spoiler below)Sean Penn does the best Robert De Niro impersonation and even tops him by crying three times, ostensibly for his on-screen daughter's death but for what dramatically is difficult to say.I kept waiting for plot and character developments to develop into a story; what few actually did seemed taken from any formula cop show.  Eastwood seems to have stuck with the original book in the hopes of 'original intent' at the expense of letting develop on screen.All in all, it's an actor's movie, not a director's movie.  In fact, it's about three re-writes short of a movie.  A pitiful waste of location, celluloid and pulled strings.",3,4,9,20 October 2003
The Good Shepherd," I wanted to like this
","I went to this movie wanting to like it. I left wanting to like it. I still want to like it. It has everything a movie needs to make you like it: stars, drama, tension, production value, yadda, yadda ...But ... I don't like it. I like what it tries to be, but I don't like it. I kept waiting for the dramatic climax that would justify the whole three hours of jumping back and forth in time. Eric Roth's script tries to be The Godfather movies all rolled into one, with its elements of 'family,' secrets, trust, betrayal and overall paranoia through the career of an early C.I.A. agent, spiced with elements taken from actual history. Robert De Niro's direction is the classic Sergio Leone technique of leaving everything in, regardless of whether it could have been shortened, told in backstory or even left out altogether.Since I knew the general course of history of the time covered, and many of the elements of the story, I was able to follow without wanting to 'go for popcorn.' But that was the only reason. When this runs on cable t.v. I'll channel surf through it.This was a few edits from greatness, which shows that the scissor is as much a part of movie-making as the camera.",5,6,12,24 December 2006
Platoon," Paranoid but Great
","Oliver Stone let his paranoia run rancid in 'JFK'.  Here, he kept it well camouflaged in the subtext.  Without it, there would have been no picture.This movie set the modern standard for cinematic portrayal of war.After it was released there were dozens of Nam-flick knock-offs and T.V. shows in the late '80s, which goes to show the big need for a catharsis from the '60s generation about VietNam, especially for those who actually went there.After 10-odd years in which Stone's paranoia has become a Hollywood cliche, plus a new generation that yawns at 'Platoon''s level of violence, it still holds up as a simple coming of age story, horrifically told.",Null,0,0,4 June 1999
