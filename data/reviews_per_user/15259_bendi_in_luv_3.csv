The Avengers," Loki for an Academy Award please
","I read a few of the other reviews, and while some mention the incredible performance Loki gives, none capture the true brilliance. I expect Tom Hidelston to win an Academy Award for his role in this story. Loki is not evil. Not purely sickeningly evil. Heath Ledger takes top honors for that portrayal as the Joker. Loki is different. He has goals, motives, desires, and pride. He is above all else mischievous, cunning, and calculating, as he attempts to and temporarily succeeds in turning the world's greatest heroes against each other. He truly delivers one of if not the best performance of the movie, and in particular shines a little after an hour into the movie, when Black Widow confronts him on the carrier: 'Your ledger is dripping, its gushing red, and you think saving a man no less virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayerâ€” pathetic. You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors; but they are a part of you, and they will never go away. ' All other main characters give stellar performances as well. The Samuel Jackson (an actor I usually despise) brings back all the greatness of Pulp Fiction, except this time bald and with an eye patch. Captain America dominates every moral issue, and though one of the weakest of the team, is the greatest unifier and leader among them. Thor brings back the elegance and civility of a bygone age, combining with Iron Man's sarcasm and cocky swagger in just the right ways to leave everyone grinning. And Bruce Banner finally gets a chance to shine as a brilliant yet conflicted man more than as a raging green beast. Even Black Widow and Agent Caulson have their moments. The only slightly disappointing acting was by Hawkeye, but most of the time he's not fighting, he's brainwashed, so you expect him to be acting a little strangely anyways. And the ACTION. Incredible. Once the final battle starts, there is no letting up. It is brilliant flash after brilliant flash, punch by punch, hit by deafening, glorious, hit. It never lets up, and it is almost impossible not to cry out in excitement. I felt like a little kid all over again. Each team member gets their cameo time fighting off hordes against all odds, and then comes scene after scene of team work. At one point, you follow Iron Man as he blazes a trail, literally, through the oncoming horde, pausing briefly to help each hero as he rushes by. Captain America leads the ground assault, Thor dominates the skies, and Hulk smashes with such agile speed and deadly efficiency you are left squirming in your seat. I am an action junkie, and while I found the opening salvos somewhat dull, especially the car chase, I loved every mini hero battle and almost cried in delight through out the finale. The only Marvell movie I think that stands up to The Avengers as best comic based movie is Woverine: Origins. While Avengers did have better and more exciting action, including the finale, Origins had a more heart wrenching and slightly better told story. The end of Origins, when Wolverine's love dies in his arms, I have a hard time not choking up. That gut wrenching, heart tearing, happy-and-dying-inside-all-at-the-same-time feeling, that make movies like Spartacus and Romeo and Juliet so great, that helped make Origins great, never once came to me in Avengeres. For that reason, I think Avengers did not appeal to me as much as it could have. I just did not feel it inside like I have other stories. Overall, an excellent movie. It started a little slow for me, probably because I was so anxious to see the heroes fighting an alien army. And while I did find the movie very funny at times, I think the trailer kind of ruined it for me: there were lines I remembered loving from the trailers that, in context, were much more serious, and hearing all the laughing in the theater, even though they were lines I laughed at when I watched the trailers, seemed somewhat inappropriate. I rarely give out 10 stars, but I'm still riding the adrenaline from the finale, even without which, I'm not sure I'd lower my score to a 9. Out of 100, this movie definitely scores somewhere in the 90's.",9,10,21,29 April 2012
Captain Marvel," Enjoyable but not memorable.
","George Lucas's unedited ideas of how Star Wars: A new Hope would have began should be taught in all theater classes; that movie was truly saved in the edit. Captain Marvel, however, was not. If Captain Marvel was our introduction to the Marvel universe, we would not be seeing a sequel. That is not to say it is not a good movie, but it is flawed, and enough so that it cannot stand all that impressively on its own.
Three great things about the movie:
1) Thalos/Ben Mendolsohn plays a convincing and relatable villain. He possibly played his role better than anyone in the movie.
2) Nick Fury/Samuel Jackson plays his role very well too. Fury and Thalos were the high points, definitely carrying the movie. I never felt myself getting lost in the movie, or even really drawn into the story, unless one of them was on screen. And I did notice myself losing interest in the movie with their absence. Not all of the other performances were bad, but no others really stood out.
3) Goose/The Cat was a surprise and had the entire audience laughing. Without spoiling anything, being reminded of Rathtars from Disney's 'The Force Awakens' was depressing and being reminded of Groot felt like an uncreative knockoff. Otherwise, the ever-present orange tabby was fun.
Three not so great things about this movie:
1) Pace. There is a good story here, possibly a great story. But it is not well told. The characters and plot are poorly introduced; not so much that we, the audience, feel like we are being hit over the head there is so little subtlety, but enough so that it felt mundane. It is like picking up a new video game and spending the first hour just grinding through tutorials. There is no room for the audience to question anything, or wonder what will happen next, let alone make mistakes. And by the end, with all of the shout outs, references, and cameos spilt, I wonder if there will be anything entertaining enough left to merit a second viewing. Action and music can help fill the void, or cover it up, but in the end this movie lacks substance.
2) Physics. Science may not matter to everyone, but sticking with the established physical rules of a given universe is key to believability and immersion. The Avengers universe is OUR universe, and while we are asked to just accept some things, like magical gem stones, less magical things should follow the laws of physics. Too many times, this movie traded out our universe for the Harry Potter universe, each time disconnecting anyone over the age of 13 from any sense of awe or continuity.
3) The main gal herself. Brie Larson/Captain Marvel is either poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly written, or just a bad actress. perhaps all of the above. While she wasn't unbearable to watch, like Black Panther's mother was, she wasn't a side character with 3 minutes of screen time either. If the writers were trying to make a snarky, sassy main character, well, they almost got it. Captain Marvel comes across as a stuck up and immature teenage glam girl catastrophe. And that worked at first! When you have an invincible hero, you make the story interesting by having said hero fail to their inner demons. The problem here is that Captain Marvel never overcame her inner demons, and won out anyways. While the character development was better than Superman's, it still felt hollow. A better editor would have cut introductions shorter, left out unnecessary flashy action, and focused longer on showing some character progression. Oh, and Brie Larson cannot run. Perhaps blame it on an awkwardly tight costume, but the first time they showed her running down a hall, I just stared dumbfoundedly wondering what on earth she was doing. Fighting, they did a passable job of making her look like a somewhat competent hand to hand combatant (she's got nothing on Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow), but for the love, please do not show her running on screen any more. Especially not next to people who do run. Might as well be showing Phoebe Buffet running around D.C. with Captain America yelling 'On your left.'
In closing, some reviewers argue that this movie is simply another attempt by Disney at promoting their feminist agenda. I did not get that impression at all, and I think the anti-feminist and anti-Disney agenda may be being unjustly driven by extremists in this case. The only times I was concerned that bad morals were being promoted were in the immaturity of the hero and the idea blatantly put forth at one point that glory seeking should take precedence over motherhood and child-rearing. In short, if your moral standing is such that you took no issue with Frozen, you will likely have no issue with Captain Marvel either.
Overall, it was a fine film. Samuel Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn elevated it at times, and there is a pretty decent story here. It could have been better. I would suggest watching it without any grand expectations and you will likely not feel like you just wasted two hours of your life.",7,0,2,9 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Legacy of Luke Skywalker: Now naught more than a Disney cash-grab.
","While I am a Star Wars fan, I am not a fanatic. I would, however, classify myself as a purist, as I refuse to watch the 'remastered' original trilogy, as in my opinion, not a single change made the films better and many changes made them worse. I only own Episodes III-VI and Rogue One, as Episode I is a drag that adds nothing of import to the Anakin story arc, and Episode II adds important points but is still hard for me to watch. Episode VII had equally terrible acting, script, and plot contrivances, not to mention being a glaring knock-off of Episode IV, and I have no qualms about standing nearly alone in saying the Force Awakens was a relatively terrible movie.If you feel the same, this review is for you.The Last Jedi (TLJ), as the title suggests, is a story about Luke Skywalker. You may not realize that while watching the movie, as there are so many other mostly meaningless plot points and story arcs demanding your attention, but this is clearly a movie about who Luke Skywalker has become juxtaposed to the legend of Luke Skywalker that commands the minds of both Rebels and their enemies (not to mention Star Wars fans).
Unfortunately, we are at least a half hour into the movie before Luke is even mentioned, with multiple superfluous characters and plot points being introduced in the meantime. And over the entire length of the film, there is so little Luke time, it is easy to understand that so many do not even realize that that is what this movie is really about.
And here we have the first major flaw in the movie: When you have to explain to people who just watched the movie what the movie was about, you know something is wrong.From the get go, it is evident that Star Wars has not escaped the influence of Guardians of the Galaxy. But what made a talking raccoon and walking tree adorable does not work in other movies, not even in the Marvel universe. The first TLJ scene starts with Poe's immature, slapstick humor, and then tries to switch to a 'desperate hour' tone as Rebels sacrifice their lives for their comrades. Which is immediately followed by more pointless attempts at slapstick humor as Fin makes his first appearance. That trend continues for the duration of the movie, with scenes that should have felt dark or desperate being interrupted by forced attempts as humor. Possibly the only times the laughing came easily was with the nun-like caretakers, who constantly chide and berate a novice and unwieldy Rey as she tries to use the force whilst destroying Luke's island sanctuary. Overall, TLJ's humor came off about as well as the one-liners teenagers come up with in their homecoming skits: funny only to the writers, traumatizing to the dutiful audience. The Last Jedi continues with another hour of two simultaneous plots, that are both completely pointless, as the disorganized Rebel forces flee. Not to mention the introduction of at least two more major and pointless characters. The acting continues to be bad all around, but part of that may be to blame on the writing, as it is obvious the audience is intentionally left in the dark, but also left without any curiosity, only frustration. By the two hour mark, it becomes pretty clear that, save Rey and Kylo's moments on screen, the movie up to that point was pointless.Stories usually ramp up to a climax, something neither the writers nor director of TLJ seem to have mastered. Time after time after time, I found myself getting a little on edge as the final conflict seemed to be drawing near, only to have that faint glimmer of hopeful anticipation doused as the plot line took an abrupt turn and the story continued. After a few of these moments, my excitement simply could not be provoked; I became numb as over and over again, the movie seemed to drag on. At least in the last half hour, the story did seem to have a purpose, even if it was not an inspiring or even very interesting one.
If it were not for Rey's fight scene, and Luke's cameo appearance, it is quite likely fans everywhere would have rioted and burned down their respective theaters. Rey's final fight, and Luke's final appearance were the two bright spots in the movie, the two times I actually, genuinely enjoyed sitting there.Overall, TLJ had an interesting story to tell. It was simply a poorly told story, as if by a grandmother who wanted to emphasize her part in events past, even though they had no bearing on the actual story, nor its unfolding, nor its outcome. The story is about Luke and the effect his Legend has had, and how far he has strayed from that path. The story is about the gray areas, the things that are not extreme enough to labeled either right or wrong, just told so poorly I feel like I may come off as justifying the movie instead of explaining it. It is about the evolution of the minds of people, their good and evil, their pride and fear, their courage and complacency. The movie could be said to be showing that moment when you realize that something you hold dear and true is wrong, the crush of betrayal, the loneliness that follows. But The Last Jedi doesn't convey those feelings. You have to read deep between the lines to see those contrivances. And so the movie ends as it begins, ultimately a failure, as evidenced by the fact that the story told has to be explained.I left the theater torn, not hurt. There were a couple of genuinely spectacular parts, buts so much of the movie was so bad I could not leave with a smile. I wanted to smile, but I couldn't. As the days past and I had time to reflect on the story I was shown, and what that story could have been, my opinions solidified: this is another Star Wars movie that I will not own.*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***Now, for the nitpicky stuff, as some of you are, like me, very nitpicky.
The space physics are distractingly bad. Someone on the production team must have known something about physics, must have said something, but someone, perhaps the director in his creative genius, chose to ignore said advise and make a movie that not only exhibits false physics in multiple, unreconcilable ways, but who's entire first-hour-plot revolves around bad physics. It drove me nuts. I will accept the laws of a given scifi universe as long as that universe obeys them; TLJ does not.
Military strategy is nonexistent. It is not a matter of inexperience or immaturity, as when Kylo commands his troops; these are the leaders of the First Order, professional military men. Yet points established in Poe's assault in the first five minutes are completely gone against five minutes later when the bad guys have the upper hand. It doesn't take a brilliant tactician to see the flaws, and asking even the averagely intelligent viewer to buy into the subsequent plots is disrespectful.
The endless 'just' moments. Just big enough, just far enough, just hard enough, just fast enough. I can usually take a lot, but when the Millennium Falcon flies through a hole JUST big enough for it to literally scrape through for the fourth time in its five movies, I was left shaking my head. I cannot even call it a spoiler that the hole actually turns out to be a tunnel. And with as many times as it felt like this movie was about to end and didn't, we are blessed with more 'just' moments than usual, definitely more than bearable.
And of course the pointless plots. The film could be cut back to only scenes containing Luke and Rey and all it would be missing is Snoke's taunting of Kylo, and we would still have to watch Luke trying to traumatize and scare away Rey, and the awkward hand touching of Luke and Leia at the end.A note about me, for all those who think I rated this too high or too low:
I watched the trailer, maybe twice. I was not impressed, and went into the theater with low expectations, not so much because the trailer made me think this film would be bad, but because the previous entry in the series was bad and also, because I have learned that I like movies more when I go into them with low expectations. I think a lot of the backlash to this film only exists because there was so much hope, and so much of that hope was crushed. I watched this film opening weekend, and rated it before reading anyone else's reviews. I decide on a rating before I visit a film's IMDB page to guarantee I am not swayed by the film's current rating. And I have not changed my rating; 6/10 stars seems fair. I judge relatively harshly, but as long as there are not aspects of a movie that literally sicken me, the lowest I will give it is a 4/10. I consider a 7/10 a movie worth owning, and rarely give out 9's or 10's.",6,1,2,26 December 2017
