Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than the others
","Hip hip hooray. After some local critics downplayed this totally awesome movie and with some fear after hearing some of the comments of quite abit less than jumping up and down,my family and I saw this wonderful addition to the three only one day after it opened. Wow I'm sure glad I didn't wait almost two years like I did for the first one because I thought it was no big deal. Well let me tell you that I thought George couldn't outdo the special f/x of Empire but I was way wrong,not only did he match them but far surpassed them as well. Young Anakin was played superbly as well as all of the water people. I can't wait for what I hope will be a quad set of videos especially now that the Phantom Menace is out.It is definitely a must see film.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
