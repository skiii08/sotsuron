Scarface," Entertaining but Flawed
","'Scarface' is not the masterpiece many believe it to be.  It is also not as terrible as many others believe it to be.  What it is is a prime example of De Palma's over-the-top style of directing.  Everything about this movie - the script, the acting, the directing, are all overblown.  And while it shows no restraint whatsoever, perhaps that is part of its interest.The story chronicles the life of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban immigrant who rises to power in the Miami underworld.  It begins with his rise to power from nothing, and continues on through his downfall.  The script is well written for the most part, except it tends to drag in places and is quite loose.  The acting is solid, but as said before, perhaps a little over the top. Pacino is convincing as Montana, and most of the cast performs well, although everybody seems to be in an extremely emotional state at all times. Much of the dialogue is angry, and the characters are never really fleshed out to any great extent.  The major flaw in this movie is the fact that most of the characters are rather despicable, eliciting little sympathy from me.The directing is interesting to watch, but needlessly flashy.  Take, for example, the scene where Montana is getting in the car and the camera does the track out, zoom in trick, used most notably in Hitchcock's 'Vertigo.' Obviously, this is a display of Hitchcock's influence on De Palma, but what De Palma forgets is that Hitchcock used it for a reason. In the context that it is used in 'Scarface', it is totally unnecessary. But, it fits in with the over-the-top appeal of the movie.While I wouldn't say this movie is excellent, it does provide some solid entertainment.  And despite the fact that it does drag a little, and is lacking in character development, it does succeed in providing some excellent action sequences, which will definitely please many fans.*** out of ****",7,0,1,20 July 2002
Minority Report," *** 1/2 out of ****
","Spielberg's sci-fi film noir about a police officer (Tom Cruise) in the pre-crime division, a division of law enforcement that predicts who's going to commit a murder, is entertaining and thought provoking.  While it has the darkness and plot twists of a 1940s film-noir, it also falls into many of the genre's cliches, not to mention the fact that a happy ending manages to destroy much of the power of being a film-noir.  Still, the movie excels despite these limitations, and while short of being a masterpiece, it is a solid effort.",8,0,0,2 September 2002
The Big Lebowski," *** 1/2 out of ****
","The Coen brothers' best comedy manages to be hilarious and flat out weird at the same time.  Lots of great jokes and gags, but some odd sequences that may turn some viewers off.  The movie has no real plot, just a series of short pieces that happen to have the same characters.  Everybody performs well and the characters are great - except for John Goodman's character, who gets a little bit annoying at times.  A definite must see for Coen brothers fans, but some non-fans may not buy into their sense of humor.",7,0,1,18 September 2002
Fight Club," ** 1/2 out of ****
","As much as I admired the ambition and uniqueness of 'Fight Club', I couldn't force myself to like it.  It's dark and gritty atmosphere felt like it was borrowing a little to heavily from 'Taxi Driver' and films of that like. The plot twist at the end was interesting, as was the story in general. What bothered me was the direction.  There were some brilliantly made scenes, but a lot of them felt a little silly - almost like Fincher was trying too hard to be fast-paced 'MTV generation' style.  On top of that, some of the dialogue, especially Tyler Durdan's was poorly written - especially in cases where he was meant to throw in little witty remarks. Pitt's performance was weak, especially put up against Ed Norton, who was impressive, as usual.  Thematically, the bottom line is that, when all was said and done, this movie had no idea what it was about, and suffered because of it.  Fincher is a superb talent, but this is not his best showcase - 'Se7en' was a much better application of his style.",7,0,2,1 October 2002
12 Angry Men," An excellent 'jury room drama' - ****
","Especially in our current state, the focus is more and more on special effects and visual appeal than on strong plots and good acting.  While many great movies have told their stories through visuals, '12 Angry Men' takes the opposite approach, telling the story through its characters, creating the feel of a stage play.The premise is that a young minority boy is charged with murdering his father.  Every jury member except one (Henry Fonda), believes that the boy is guilty.  Fonda doesn't necessarily believe him to be innocent, but rather that he just isn't sure.  He begins his attempt to point out how he feels and why he feels that way.  Through this, he reveals the insecurities and prejudices that are within everyone.The acting is first rate, from the angry, stubborn Juror #3 to Fonda, who creates a sense of integrity that he does so well.  Each man has a unique angle, and every actor portrays them well.The story and script are as close to perfect as can be.  I don't mean that the movie is perfect, but rather that this is a premise that is difficult to execute.  It would be easy to write this story so that it would not flow well, but it flows smoothly.  Perhaps one of the best screenplays of all time.The themes of this movie - it is more or less a character study - are beautifully written in.  They never become heavy handed, but are still easily seen.  Every man on the jury has some reason to quickly decide guilty, whether it be indifference, their own personal struggles, or prejudices.This movie is not a masterpiece of visual achievement.  It takes a rather unique approach to cinema, and makes itself a masterpiece in its own way.",9,0,1,31 May 2002
The Others," ** 1/2 out of ****
","Strong performance and good cinematography are the only real redeeming values in this film.  The plot really goes nowhere, trying to rely on only moderately creepy atmosphere.  A final plot twist attempts to save it, but instead just feels very gimmicky.  Not a bad effort, but really nothing to distinguish it from the standard horror film.",6,1,2,8 September 2002
The Hustler," Worth it just for Newman's Performance
","'The Hustler' is a truly great movie not because it is filled with outstanding performances, exciting pool scenes, and beautiful cinematography, but because of its depth as a character study.  The story is of 'Fast' Eddie Felson (Paul Newman), one of the truly memorable characters in American film history.  He is a pool hustler, living off money he conned out of others.  He challenges Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), who is managed by the cold Bert Gordon (George C. Scott).  When he loses, he falls into a pit of anger and internal suffering.  He meets Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), an alcoholic cripple, who he lives with in his misery.  He goes on like this, driven only by his desire to defeat Fats.The movie shines in its character development, which is boosted by incredible performances from Newman, Gleason, Scott, and Laurie.  The story is about selfishness, greed, and the desire to win.  Gordon tells Felson he is a loser, who lacks character.  Throughout the story, Felson comes to realize just what the cost of his lack of character amounts to.The lighting and camerawork are first rate, capturing the atmosphere of the pool halls and bars beautifully.  The setting lends itself to the story, which happens to be about pool but could really be about any form of hustling.  The dark, dreary halls are a perfect setting for the lowlifes like Gordon, who make their money off the suffering of others, to exist in.Even if you don't like pool, this movie is a must see for two reasons: Newman's performance, and the fact that you won't find a better character study anywhere.",9,4,6,31 July 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Newman and Redford at Their Best
","'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest westerns ever made, although much of the movie takes place in South America.  It is a great look at two likeable outlaws, full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are two bank robbers, chased by the law.  The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do.  The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them.  There is really no connection all the way through, for the most part.The story isn't about the plot, however.  It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It is a close look at two criminals, the talented Sundance Kid, and Butch Cassidy, the one who does all the thinking.  The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film.  Watching the two interact, with a superb script full of great dialogue, is what makes this movie so exciting.See this movie if you are a fan of westerns, or just a fan of good movies. It is exciting, superbly made (with lots of interesting silent scenes to music and montages of photographs), but it also has a lot of depth.**** out of ****",9,81,93,31 July 2002
The Best Years of Our Lives," Incredibly Moving Look at Three Men Returning From War
","Post-Vietnam, most of us are used to movies that tell about the problems that face vets once they return home.  In fact, movies of this time have become commonplace for Vietnam.  But the original one of these, and the best, is a World War II one.  It is long, and complex, combining the stories of three men.  But, in the end, despite its large scale story, it provides a personal, intimate look at each of there lives.Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) is a young captain who returns to find that his talents as a bombardier are of no use to him back home, and that his marriage now isn't what it used to be.  Al Stephenson (Frederic March) returns to a family and a job, but now has a cynical attitude towards all of it.  Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) lost his hands during the war.  While his family is ready to accept it, he is not.The movie is an incredibly fascinating, heartfelt look at three men and their struggles to return to their normal lives.  The characters each have their unique problems, and the audience can sympathize with every one of them, as well as with many of the family member who must also deal with their struggles.Few movies have been made that are as moving as this one.  It never falls to the level of being manipulative or overwrought.  It simply tells the stories as they are and lets the viewer fall into it.  A superb film, the best of its kind.**** out of ****",9,2,5,20 July 2002
Taxi Driver," **** out of ****
","'Taxi Driver' is an amazing movie in every sense.  Beautifully directed, scripted, and acted, it is one of the most outstanding pieces of cinema created in the 20th century.The story revolves around Travis Bickle, a lonely, disturbed man totally out of step with society.  He takes a job as a cab driver because he can't sleep at night.  He goes through several different events that have an impact on the story.  First, he meets Betsy (Cybil Shepherd), a campaign worker for Senator Palentine, a man running for president.  His relationship fails with Betsy, and he moves on.  He then meets a young prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster), which leads to the bulk of the rest of the movie.I have deliberately left out many important plot points, because the movie should be viewed for itself.  The themes and characters of the movie are among the most well developed and complex in any movie ever filmed.  The beauty of the film is in Schrader, Scorsese, and De Niro's ability to present a character so off the wall, so despicable, and so unique, but yet one that we can all relate to in some ways.  There is a little bit of Travis Bickle in every one of us.How so?  Travis is 'God's lonely man'.  He sees himself as being different from everybody.  He describes them as 'cold and distant'.  He doesn't approach it in a hostile way, rather going about his business, blending in as a nice, charming man.  But, the loneliness is there.This theme of loneliness is central, but so is the theme of redemption. Travis needs to do something big.  He doesn't know what, but he has to do it.  However, as he attempts to do it, he slips up, several times, because of his inability to connect with the real world.Everybody has felt this way, some of us more than others.  We've all felt out of step with society, in need of some form of redemption, if not on the scale that Travis Bickle has.  De Niro's flawless performance, in my opinion as good as or better than that in 'Raging Bull', communicates this loneliness to the viewer.Aside from the themes, the characters, and the performances, the movie is a technical masterpiece.  The lighting, camera angles, the editing - all are perfect.  Scorsese created a work that technically stands up to any film ever made.Watch this movie.  If not because it is a cornerstone of modern cinema, a must see for any movie buff, then because it can present an emotional connection to the main character that few films have ever done before.  Many viewers will dislike it because it lacks a fast pace, a Hollywood storyline, or an action or explosions.  But, for those who can truly appreciate cinematic greatness in all of its glory, this movie must be seen to be believed.",10,1,1,9 August 2002
Fargo," A Unique Sort of Movie
","Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) needs money to invest in a parking lot. He devises a plan to get it, by which he will have two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) kidnap his wife, and then have his rich father-in-law pay the ransom, keeping most of it for himself.  As usual, the kidnapping doesn't go as planned, and a pregnant detective (Frances McDormand) is sent on the case.What makes 'Fargo' so great is its total uniqueness.  It is almost written as a straight thriller, and it seems as though the comedy makes itself.  The little observations about rural life in Minnesota combined with the uniqueness of the characters makes the movie funny.  It is this strange blend of comedy and drama that makes 'Fargo' what it is.  This is probably the best screenplay since 'Pulp Fiction'.Add excellent performances by all, particularly Macy, McDormand, and Buscemi, to this great script and you have a superb movie.  Funny, thrilling, and unique, this is certainly one of the best movies of the 90s.**** out of ****",9,0,0,1 August 2002
The Killing Fields," **** out of ****
","Beautifully filmed, beautifully told story about a journalist and his translator covering the civil war in Cambodia.  Brutally honest and disturbing, and emotionally powerful at the same time.  It is a story about friendship and social justice, taking a rather liberal view towards the American involvement in the situation.  Won several well deserved academy awards, especially for Dr. Haing S. Ngor as the translator, although Waterston delivers a superb performance as well.  Definitely worth watching for anyone interested in historical films.",8,1,3,13 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," *** out of ****
","Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's legendary work is of interest mostly as an entertaining three hour action movie.  While the production values are stellar, the script doesn't offer anything insightful, and with the very notable exception of Ian McKellan, none of the performances really stand out.  Towards the last hour or so, the movie begins to drag.  Most of the movie's flaws are due to the difficulties of adapting a novel of such proportions, and the movie succeeds in some while failing in others.  It would probably be best viewed in the context of all three movies, as the movie itself lacks in constructing a cohesive story due to the nature of the books.  All in all a very worthwhile effort, but somewhat flawed.",7,0,0,24 September 2002
The Shining," **** out of ****
","Kubrick's delve into horror succeeds in one level that most horror films fail on - it's actually scary.  Nicholson's performance is fantastic - yes, over the top, but perfectly fitted for the role.  This movie contains some of the most genuinely frightening scenes ever committed to film.  The common criticism is that Nicholson goes crazy to quickly, but it is a full hour into the film before he even begins to, let alone actually does.  This building anticipation towards the actual event is part of what makes this such a great horror film.  On top of all this, the film is technically masterful, with some of Kubrick's best camerawork, including some impressive long tracking shots.  Not just for horror either - there are lots of Kubrick themes and symbols woven into the story.",8,0,0,1 October 2002
Apocalypse Now," One of the most ambitious epics of all time - ****
","I've always seen there as being two types of movies:  Solid, well written movies that follow most basic fundamentals, and ambitious epics, that take risks and create something that is maybe a little unorthodox. 'Apocalypse Now' is virtually the epitome of the latter.  It throws away standard narrative rules, and establishes itself as a tour de force of visually achievement.The plot is interesting, but flawed.  Adapted from Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', it moves the story from 19th century imperialist Africa to Vietnam.  Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is on a mission to 'terminate with extreme prejudice', a renegade colonel, Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has created an army of natives and holed up somewhere in Cambodia.  Willard is to travel up river to find him.  Along the way, he comes across many encounters that make him realize the insanity and horror of Vietnam.  While it is mostly excellent, the ending is a little unfocused.Willard is a superbly developed character.  He begins in a paradox - he hates to be in the jungle and he hates to be on leave, trapped in the city. He is simply following orders.  Along the journey, reading about Col. Kurtz, he begins to identify with him.  Every character is acted perfectly, except for Kurtz.  It seems that Brando had little focus about what he wanted his character to be like, and it shows.  Robert Duvall particularly does an excellent job as Lt. Col. Kilgore, who is obsessed with surfing.The technical achievements of this movie are in its visuals and its atmosphere.  The atmosphere of going up the river, further into a strange, unknown land, is incredible.  As Willard travels into the jungle, he becomes more and more like Kurtz, the setting parallelling his descent into madness. Visually, this movie is one of the greatest of all time.  The entire helicopter raid sequence is perhaps the best fifteen or twenty minutes ever committed to film.  It is indescribable - rather, it must be viewed to appreciate.This film is rich and complex in its themes.  The insanity of war, and a man's descent into madness are in the forefront.  Willard originally sees the reason to kill Kurtz, but as he encounters the horrors of Vietnam, he begins to more and more understand Kurtz's actions, and almost become him. Obviously, there are also parallels to 'Heart of Darkness', viewing Vietnam as an imperialistic undertaking by America.'Apocalypse Now' is not a flawless movie.  However, it is an incredible epic, extremely well made, which presents important themes.  It certainly ranks as one of the most influential movies of the latter half of the twentieth century.",9,0,0,31 May 2002
The Battle of Algiers," **** out of ****
","Brutally honest look at the Algierian uprising against the French remains powerful to this day, and even more pertinent in light of concerns about terrorism.  It takes an objective view of a bloody and tragic situation, looking at the fact that each side was right and wrong, creating a cycle of violence not unlike that in Israel today.  Lots of raw power, due to the documentary-style filming.  History buffs will get a lot out of this, as will fans of politics-heavy films.  No matter what your tastes are, this movie remains an important movie - one which everybody would benefit from watching.",9,1,2,12 October 2002
Cross of Iron," *** out of ****
","Sam Peckinpah's only venture into war films is a mixed success.  The storyline concerns a German World War II captain who's main goal is to earn himself the Iron Cross (Maximilian Schell), and how he butts heads with a corporal who's just trying to do his business and survive (James Coburn). At a few points in the movie, the story seems to forget where it's going, and trails off into unnecessary subplots and action sequences.  Peckinpah's directorial skill is evident in these scenes  nobody has ever done action as good as him  but he could've used a better script.  For all it's flaws, it's worthwhile viewing  especially for Peckinpah fans  but it is far from the director's best.",Null,0,0,1 December 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Terrible
","'The Fast and the Furious' is basically your standard summer blockbuster - stupid, loud, and lots of explosions.  Amazingly, this movie sinks to depths that most summer blockbusters have never reached.The story surrounds an undercover FBI agent (Paul Walker) who is trying to find out who has been stealing electronics equipment.  This leads him to a group of underground street drag racers.  Despite the numerous plot holes, such as the idiotic way in which the criminals go about stealing the equipment, and Walker's inexplicable behavior, this movie actually could've been good.  The premise is interesting, and the drag racing scenes are fairly exciting.Where this movie falters is the characters.  None of them are interesting, and despite the script's best efforts, they are all two-dimensional.  The performances are awful, with the exception of Vin Diesel, who is merely average.  Walker delivers his stupid catch phrases inconvincingly monotone. Perhaps the script is much to blame here, for I've often believed that good performances are highly influenced by the script, i.e. a good actor can give a bad performance if the dialogue is bad.  Well, anyway, the dialogue is simply some of the worst in any big budget movie I've seen recently.On the plus side, the action sequences are pretty good.  However, this simply cannot make up for a senseless script and horrible acting.  Not really worth seeing, unless you really like action, with nothing to back it up.* 1/2 out of ****",4,0,1,6 June 2002
American History X," *** out of ****
","Well made, heartfelt story of a neo-nazi who is turned straight and tries to keep his brother from going down the wrong path is driven mostly by Norton's superb performance.  Flawed in that some of the characters seem a little too stereotyped and the theme is expressed somewhat heavy handedly, with a somewhat contrived ending.  Still, it is a well crafted story, and any flaws are outweighed by its merits.",7,0,0,2 September 2002

He is taken by a doctor (Anthony Hopkins) to a hospital, where it is discovered that he is an intelligent human being.  Beautifully shot, with two of the best performances of the decade by Hopkins and Hurt, this movie is a true masterpiece, managing to be moving without being sappy, and offering a message about human nature without being too heavy handed.",9,1,1,2 September 2002
Casualties of War," *** 1/2 out of ****
","Brian De Palma's only venture into war movies is a powerful, if somewhat melodramatic story about a squad in Vietnam who kidnaps a Vietnamese villager and rapes her.  Michael J. Fox sometimes is a little too much as the clean cut guy fighting against the system, but it still works.  Penn delivers a stellar performance as the squad leader he's fighting against. Some beautiful cinematography, with De Palma's usually flashy camerawork. The ending feels a little weak compared to the rest of the story, but all in all this is one of the most haunting films about the Vietnam War - made all the more effective by the fact that it is a true story.",8,0,0,1 December 2002

","'Mulholland Drive' is a movie that, like most of Lynch's work, will tend to polarize its audiences.  Many find the seemingly senseless plot to be unnecessarily confusing and annoying.  Others, like me, find the dreamlike atmosphere and nightmarish tone of the movie to be fascinating.  Either way, everybody will agree that the movie doesn't really resolve itself in the end, but that isn't really the point of the movie.  If you can just appreciate the excellent direction and acting, and try to ignore the fact that it doesn't really make sense, you will enjoy this movie.",8,0,1,8 September 2002

While it has tamed, even to the point that it feels like some of it was done only for shock value at the time, it still retains some of its power.

","Interweaving three stories about small time gangsters, 'Pulp Fiction' proved to be one of the most interesting, original, and entertaining films of the last fifteen years.  Using Tarantino's characteristic dialogue, in which the characters speak about everyday things rather than just the plot, the movie creates a light atmosphere, counterpointed by moments of extreme violence and intensity.  An infusion of many classic genres, such as noir, it manages to put a new spin on many old cliches.  A must see for any  appreciator of cinema.",10,5,11,2 September 2002

He is taken by his guardian angel in need of his wings, Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him just how important he has been.  Ultimately, it is perhaps the most emotionally moving film ever made, and it offers insight that everybody can use about what's important in our lives.

A criticism like that is like calling 'Airplane' too funny, 'Rear Window' too suspenseful, or 'The Exorcist' too scary.  The movie is so genuinely heartfelt that it's impossible to dismiss - and it has an interesting, well told story to boot.

Stalag 17," Superb POW Film, and one of Wilder's best - ****
","'Stalag 17' is one of the finest films set in a POW camp.  Obviously, there are going to be comparisons to 'The Great Escape' by everybody, but I think that they are each great in their own way.  Whereas 'The Great Escape' is an excellent action film, there is little action in 'Stalag 17', with the focus being more on the drama.The film begins with POWs attempting to escape they boredom of their lives. Two of them attempt to escape, but are killed.  The men know that there's a snitch somewhere, and they pin it on Sgt. Sefton (Holden).  This leads to all sorts of trouble, culminating in an excellent ending.The characters in this film are quite interesting, especially the cynical Sefton, whom Holden does a standout job of portraying.  Where this movie shines is in one area that is usually associated with Wilder - the sharp, witty dialogue.  The comments the men make around each other all create a sympathy that you can understand the suffering of the lives they are living. Technically, this is, as with any Wilder film, solidly made.All around an excellent movie, and my personal favorite Wilder film.",8,1,3,31 May 2002

While there isn't anything that hasn't been done in a psychological thriller before, it is a solid piece of entertainment.  The cast is solid all around, and Cruise delivers an unusually good performance, if maybe a little over the top at times.  It runs on a little too long, at nearly two and a half hours, but manages to remain interesting for most of the time.

Full of great ideas and images about the future, and despite being twenty years old it looks more convincing then most newer sci-fi movies.  The plot gets a little muddled and confusing towards the latter half of the movie, but if you can stay with it until the end, it offers a satisfying completion (in the director's cut at least), and plenty of questions for the viewer to think about.  A staple for any science fiction viewer.",8,1,2,2 September 2002
Signs," **** out of ****
","M. Night Shyamalan has been compared to Alfred Hitchcock, possibly as the 'new master of suspense'.  While these claims have yet to be proven, he is certainly on the road to such a title if he can keep up work this solid over his career.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a minister who's wife died in a car accident, causing him to lose his faith.  He lives with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and his son and daughter (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin).  One morning, he finds crop circles on his farm, leading to a series of events involving the possibility of alien life forms.  I won't say the rest of it, as any more information may spoil the suspense.'Signs' is the best movie made since 'Traffic', not because of any deeper meaning, although there is one, but simple because of the sheer suspense and quality of filmmaking.  It is in a way, reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock, although I don't like comparing the master to any other filmmakers, no matter what I think of them.  The style of suspense building and character development shows the obvious influence Hitchcock had upon Shyamalan.Aside from the spectacular technical merits of the film, it is a well told story, with solid characters and an interesting plot.  The heavy handed way the questions of fate and faith are presented may turn some viewers off, but like them or not, they can't overshadow a fine piece of filmmaking.  The 'twist' in the end, which isn't really a twist, but similar to one, is interesting but not impressive to the extent that the twist in 'The Sixth Sense'.  It certainly isn't the reason for watching the movie.'Signs' is the best movie of the year, thus far, and is certainly an excellent addition to the resumes of M. Night Shyamalan (who impressively wrote, directed, and produced) as well as Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. If you enjoy not so much terror, although many people do find this movie scary, but rather excellent suspense, that also has some intelligence, this movie is for you.",8,0,2,15 August 2002
Casino," **** out of ****
","A fascinating look at the mob-operated Las Vegas casino industry, Casino is a success on every level.  Despite being three hours long, it never gets boring  it's driven by brilliant direction, superb acting, and an interesting screenplay.  Covers familiar ground but never really feels like a retread of Goodfellas, although some make that claim.  The only real similarity is Joe Pesci's character  while he delivers a fine performance, I can't help but feel that his presence is largely their because of his success in Goodfellas.  Regardless, it can hardly be considered a flaw in the film, and it works very well.  An excellent addition to Scorsese's already impressive body of work.",9,1,2,11 December 2002

","Not one of Hitchcock's best, 'The Birds' is about two people (Tippi Hendren and Rod Taylor) who are in a small seaside town when the birds begin to attack people.  The filmmaking is brilliant, creating suspense with many of Hitchcock's trademark techniques.  The fault of the movie lies in the lack of any substance.  Sure, it is suspenseful, but it doesn't offer anything insightful like 'Vertigo' or 'Rear Window', and the quality of the plot falls short of the likes of 'North by Northwest'.  The two leads are far less charismatic then the normal Hitchcock leads such as Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Ingrid Bergman or Grace Kelly.  Good for little more than a couple hours of decent entertainment, and one that every Hitchcock buff should see.",7,1,2,2 September 2002
