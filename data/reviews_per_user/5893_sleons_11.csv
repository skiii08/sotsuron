The Blair Witch Project," Only for peasants!
",I love horror movies and I recently had the chance to watch this one. It is admirable to make a low budget film a main stream thing. I think this film is an achievement in its publicity. But as a movie it's a complete piece of crap. In order for you to be scared by this movie you must be like a XII century peasant.Nothing really happens in the film. If you are afraid of people standing in a corner you'll be pissing your pants at the end. Unfortunately I need something happening for a horror movie to work its magic on me. Crappy cinematography just doesn't cut it for me.note: I also hate Paranormal Activity. In both cases (PA and BWP) I've met people who think they are real documentaries (this people are complete morons).,1,3,6,11 April 2012
It," A computer generated abomination ofa film
",I hated this film after the opening scene. The actor who portrays It is great but Hollywood needs everything done on powerpoint so it ages like crap. Why use a great actor when we can create a clown with CG and take away any possibility of It being scary. This decision alone destroyed the film.I also think a horror film that doesn't manage to be scary is a complete failure. It's like a comedic movie that isn't funny.,1,2,2,21 October 2019
Us," One of the worst films I've seen
","This is one of those films were the protagonists are so stupid you are actually rooting for them to get killed.It's a disaster when it comes to tone. It's also really hard to understand the themes of the movie. I also hated get out, but at least through out its development I wanted to see how Jordan Peele would solved it, which was in a really stupid way. The most ridicoulous thing about Us are the 'scary kids', kids are easy to kill, there's nothing scary about them. They're fragile. Not exactly Michael Mayers types.Us is bland and got me more anxious than any film I had ever seen. Can we stop pretending Jordan Peele is a good director? There isn't a memorable scene in any of his two movies. To his credit he attempts to be an author, he fails miserably, but he attempts it. The other aspects of the film like cinematography and production design are well crafted, but with such a bizarre and poor execution its impossible to have a good movie. Half way through I wanted to kill the family myself. Such imbeciles can't be walking around out there. They're a danger to society.",1,4,6,21 October 2019
The Others," What an awful ending
","This movie is terrible!!! Alejandro Amenabar is one of the biggest talents in Spanish film but the ending to this flick is unacceptable.The movie ends when the main characters realize that they are dead. I think you could end any movie this way. Why think of a smart ending when you could end all movies with the characters realizing they're dead? You could either do this or make them realize that they were sleeping. Think about it Saving private Ryan: Tom hanks was sleeping, he never went to fight WWII.",1,1,9,1 July 2012
Aquaman," The worst super hero movie ever
","This film is gonna age like bread not like wine. Even the bodies of the actors are done in CG. I can only imagine all the idiots involved in this film going crazy after three months locked up in a green studio. The cast and crew must have needed psicological help after doing this. Its imposible to act properly when you have to imagine everything. There is something of practical effects that makes even the cast believe whats going on. This is like Captain Sky and the world of tomorrow. A CG abomination that will be used as a tale to scare kids in the future. 'Timmy if you don't behave I will lock you in a green screenstudio for three months', this puts the boogieman to shame. Congratulations on the crew not going postal.",1,0,0,21 October 2019
Interstellar," Overrated and dumb
","Don't waste your time watching this film. Every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through. I found fascinating the parallel story that's being told between the main character and his daughter. At some point Nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases. The film is a huge contradiction. And the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is. They are on a mission that's more important than any personal issue, man kind's future depends solely on the success of it. But fø©k that, in this kind of Hollywood bullshit protagonists can't die (just because test audiences don't like that, it makes them really really sad) so against all odds McConaughey makes it back home. Hooray for him, and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending.Mark my words... by the time Matt Damon appears you will be compelled to kick Christopher Nolan right in the balls.I read that they were advised by physicist in order to be 'scientifically accurate'. I'm sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001, event horizon, etc. Interstellar is a cash grab. If you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole. Christopher Nolan might have already had his way with you. My asshole is intact because I torrented this bad boy. Suck on that film industry!",1,13,26,16 March 2015
The Artist," The Best movie of the year!!!!
","This is by far the greatest movie of the year. I want to be a film maker and I can say that I felt absolutely jealous of the creator of this feature after watching it. The use of sound is magnificent. Jean Dujardin is a fantastic actor. And the story is so well written I cried through out the hole movie. It is a tribute to film in its purest form. When film language began there wasn't any sound and I've always thought image is the most elegant way to tell a story. Soap operas relate on dialogue to tell you what's going on, and that's why I've always thought their story telling is vulgar. This is the opposite side of the spectrum. I believe you should see this film even if you think that a 'silent' and black and white film isn't interesting. You won't be disappointed. It's funny, engaging, deep, meaningful and subtle.",10,1,4,17 February 2012
It Chapter Two," Computer generated abomination
","This film is hard to watch. There isn't a single 'scary' scene that isn't pulled of with CG. It's hard to be afraid of a creature that belongs to the digital realm. The creators should only be afraid of how poorly this technology ages. Film that rely on this end up aging terribly (within a few years). The actor who portrays pennywise is great, I don't know why they used him so little in order to use this powerpoint created abomination. The suits in Hollywood have taken the fun away from making films. Now they are done surrounded by green or blue screens and doing everything in post. This film isn't scary, and that's something a horror film can never be. It has the stupidest comedy to 'lower' the horror. The comedy and the horror doesn't work. Don't support films like this, don't be those test audiences that are shaping Hollywood into the computer generated disaster it has become.",1,1,1,24 November 2019
Parasite," One of the best films ever
","Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece.",10,29,48,21 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Iñárritu's worst film by far
","This film sucks in every way possible. The only thing that it has it's the fact it was made in a 'continuous sequence shot'. It lacks a central theme. By the end I was never sure if it talked about the creative process of artist or how society won't let you reinvent yourself as a creator, amongst thousands of other unfulfilled themes the script was never able to portray. One thing I am sure of, is this film is Iñárritu talking about himself in the most self centered way possible. I love all of his other films, and even though they are dramas with a longer running time than this one, Birdman is by far the toughest film he has.I know it is impossible to criticize a film that all critics consider a master piece. This is just a modern example of the emperors new clothes.Technique is there to tell a compelling story, without that it's pretty much useless. Hitchcock did a film with the same style, The Rope, for me, this is one of his worst films.Birdman is considered a comedy, but Alejandro González Iñárritu isn't a funny man. I didn't laugh once throughout the film. I am a big fan of his work but have always hated listening to him. He wants to demonstrate how intellectually superior he is every time he speaks about his movies using the most complex language possible. Alejandro we get it, you are talented. Now stop being such a douche. Take a page from Woody Allen's book (not the having sex with your adopted Asian daughter part, but the part were you try to be more humble).Also this might not be a popular opinion, but, Michael Keaton is a terrible actor. This is a role he was 'born' to play, and he is as stale as watching a sock puppet perform. This was similar to Mickey Rourke on the Wrestler, the difference is Rourke was always fantastic and that role really fitted him, Keaton always sucked.The Oscars have never really meant much since we've never known why they are given (sometimes they really deserved it, sometimes they owed it to them and sometimes it's just mere politics). I really think Foxcatcher was a superior film in every way possible and was robed by this over-hyped garbage.",1,4,9,17 March 2015
The Conjuring," No charm
","The first half of the movie has great directing technique, half way through the film it doesn't even have that. A horror piece can't simply rely on really cheap scares like frightening you with loud sounds.The story is nothing impressive and it's filled with plot holes.The funniest part of the film is when they cannot perform an exorcism because they need proof to show in order for the catholic church to allow it. The Vatican has ALWAYS relied on the scientific method to demonstrate that what they say is not utterly bullshit.I think this film becomes comical at some point. A great deal of the audience members were laughing at the ridiculous violence portrayed.I truly believe that the good reviews are done by critics that the production was able to please by inviting them to premieres, etc. I'm a real horror fan and this is a very dull movie. I believe if they wanted to do a film like this, they should have done something with an extreme level of violence. No one dies in the film! Lastly I ask you two questions: Why the hell is this set during the 70s? This just adds to the level of cheesiness (if there is such a term) that this movie achieves. And, should there be allowed a disclaimer at the beginning of fiction pieces that says that the story portrayed is based on true events? Sorry to say this guys but there are no demons, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, etc. This kind of claim makes ignorant people believe that this crap is actually out there. Look at the wars in the world, kidnap, executions, etc. We should only be afraid of our fellow men; that, and crappy horror films like this one.",3,9,18,21 July 2013
