Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Surpasses the hype (amazingly enough)
","If this is the week following the movie's release, you're probably as sick of Borat publicity as anyone. Borat on The Today Show, Borat on The Daily Show, Borat in front of the White House, BORAT EVERYWHERE! I was almost ready to write the movie off before I saw it, but my friends were into it and, if nothing else, it was a good time with my buddies.Dang. I guess I'm not too cool for Borat after all.Borat delivers the goods. Even after we thought it was played out on Da Ali G Show. Even after we thought we saw half the movie in commercials and trailers - it turned out that those hilarious bits were LESS FUNNY than the rest of the movie! Usually, I can't stand movies that are a bunch of stunts and funny scenes strung together, but because the movie dives into the angle that Borat is filming a documentary for Kazakhstan and never surfaces, it's forgivable.See this movie.
