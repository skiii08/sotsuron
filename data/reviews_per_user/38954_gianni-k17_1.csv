The Perks of Being a Wallflower," true,honest, touching
","Welcome to the land of misfit toys! This is not a movie about teens, it is a movie about people. About people who live among us but why never look at or care about, but be sure there are here. Because behind every wall there is a wallflower!'The perks of being a wallflower' is a drama witch is not depressing. Is a romantic movie not full of silly teen love confessions. In fact it may be one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen. Love, drugs and social discrimination all coexist in this fabulous movie without exaggerations. In addition to all that the main actors accomplish their difficult goal and give us great performances. Especially Ezra Miller and Ema Watson make us believe that they are going to have promising careers. Watch and you will definitely feel that you 'could be heroes just for one day'.",10,1,2,17 January 2013
