Alien 3," Watch the 'Directors Cut/Extended Version'!
","I watched this again recently for the first time in fifteen years. Like many, I was so infuriated by the killing off of Newt and Hicks that I refused really to acknowledge what was happening in this film. However, I was always aware of how good it looked, its atmosphere and general tone and when I realised it was David Fincher that directed it I thought perhaps that maybe I should give this another try.Mellowed with age (!) I decided to give the film a second chance, and knowing of the controversies with the script and editing etc etc I finally gave it another go, but this time the newer extended version. While still not exactly Fincher's 'Directors Cut' (he wasn't allowed to film things he wanted to do I gather) this is for all intents and purposes his version and the one that should have been released. I watched it on a rainy Saturday afternoon and was frankly stunned. It was absolutely superb, not just standing up to the previous two classics but perhaps even having the edge on them in terms of style and content. Once you grasp the main moral theme of the story it really does grab you. Apart from the fact that it is so terribly and genuinely sad, it offers some interesting metaphysical points (sorry...big word, didn't want to sound that pretentious...really) about the Alien being in a way 'Death' and how mankind can defeat it by accepting it (death that is not the monster). Someone else on IMDb described the film as like a fine wine that matures with age. I agree, and I can't recommend this version enough (simply don't bother with the theatrical release...it's OK don't get me wrong but it's not a classic like this one)especially if like me you're one of these people that was so angered by it after seeing Aliens. Actually when you realise that it was one of the original scripts that killed off Hicks and Newt I can even more forgive Mr Fincher. Also, and I'm sure proper film fans won't be, the effects are stilted at times especially with the alien. This is because the original idea had the alien coming out of an ox and therefore was supposed to be fairly large when in the theatrical release it came out of a dog. Link this with the aliens 'growth', editing and adding effects later in the day partially explains why the alien doesn't seem quite right at times. Either way - you MUST see this version, easily a nine out of ten to the original releases 5.",9,3,6,24 June 2007
28 Weeks Later," Good horror - very poor sequel.
","Like many people who were 'umming and ahhring' when they heard this sequel was planned I along with many was worried. I'm left feeling that yet again, a very good film (along with Highlander/Matrix) will have its aura destroyed by ever more dodgy sequels. I gather the filming was a little rushed in Canary Wharf, and that didn't bode well for me, though in fairness the film looks very good and is at times very well directed but, the plot, while not exactly 'holes' and are to some extent explained, are nonetheless very annoying as they are frankly so bloody stupid! I mean...the children getting out of the security zone and getting as far as they did; daft. Robert Carlisle being able to get to his wife (I know, I know, he had a 'pass') but do me a favour; irritating. The fact that some soldier, suddenly gets a moral compass with no previous character building; a bit smelly, the fact that after napalming London a lone helicopter somehow is able to fly across the channel with out the pilot ever radioing in for hours, and being able to avoid radar is astonishing; i.e. read poor plot device for a nice looking ending but...another sequel. Also, why napalm when they use chemical weapons anyhow? Surely they'd want to keep the buildings? And since when have Volvos been air tight? I mean, I know the Swede's make a nice motor...but chemical warfare proof!? Clever buggers those vikings...Oh yeah, and the virus was not supposed to be passed cross species...so how comes humans got it from chimps then? Grrrrrrrr!!!! And why were all the civilians locked in a dark underground room!? What rotters these Yanks are to do that to us! Why didn't they put us all at the top of a building with lots of soldiers with guns on the stairs or something. And since when has an infected been calm enough to use a swipe card!?!?And two children, walking along the underground from Westminster to Wembley!!! In the dark with no maps!? Boo! Poor!!! 3 out of 10, must do better!!Alright...If you want crass horror, then OK its your bag, from helicopters slicing people up to scary stuff with night vision goggles and eyes being gouged out...but this really could have been so much better. It started very well, and had lots of potential, but why should I yet again be made to feel like a snob just because I expect a bit of intelligence? Especially as the reason the first was so popular was because it was exactly the right mixture of horror, effects, good directing and an intelligent plot?Oh well, as they say 'Whatever'. 28 months later anyone?",3,5,12,12 May 2007
I Am Legend," Terrible...and is it me or is some of the morality of this a bit off?
","I was really, really looking forward to this. Huge fan of the book, out for Christmas, big-budget etc etc and find myself watching one of the worst films I have seen in years! I'm still in shock, if you haven't read the book, do so, you can do it in a couple of hours and like me you'll think, 'If they film this, they just can't mess it up, it's brilliant! It's scary! It's got everything, it's just asking to be filmed, they just can't go wrong.' Oh...but they can...oh yes they can! Actually, there are many good points about the awfulness of this film already made by others so I won't go on, read them, but firstly, the voting...I'm no longer convinced by it on this site anymore, I've seen far too many poor films get high votes that I'm simply left incredulous by. I really don't won't to be left with the notion that people are that thick, and I know they're not so all I can say is don't trust the voting system with modern blockbusters.But, if it is true then I've noticed that most high votes are by 'children' under 18 so I can forgive them their ignorance and lack of life experience, not that reading a short novella really takes any time or anything kids...Secondly, why CGI? Surely the studio knew it looked awful (and it really does look dire), why on earth didn't they use actors? Surely 28 Days Later set a benchmark, and that was one of ours! (Sorry Brit here, used to low budgets you know, you have to like, improvise...) Of the million and one ways you could make a vampire/zombie type thing look scary and you totally and utterly fail on every count. Or was it deliberate? To maybe add to the unbelievability of the story? Or was this deliberate sabotage? I'm serious, they looked that awful I'm left wondering if there isn't more to it...Then there's the third and more serious point I want to make. This is a classic science fiction novel, about the 'science' of vampires. There's an awful lot to digest, and it's fairly light stuff really, let alone the heartbreaking stuff with the heroes (or antihero depends how you look at it)wife returning from the dead.How dare someone then, turn this into a dodgy polemic on racism! Or at the very least in an extremely banal way on 'bad' people. Is it me, or did all the infected look like members of the Neo-Nazis? Even then, what's with the religious spin? What's going on with a 'colony' of uninfected in Vermont...land of the chosen few? Puritans!?!? The first settlers!? I noticed a lot of very dissatisfied grunts in Greenwich cinema, admittedly a more educated audience than most, but it really didn't sit well at all. Most I'd guess are expecting science-fiction, not some seriously messed up and confused comment on current US morality. Fourthly was simply how much was missing. Will there be a fuller cut in the future perhaps? Was it cut to shreds for some reason? There's an awful lot unexplained and when it is it's done poorly. In fact when Anna and Ethan arrive I genuinely thought the film was going to return to the book and have them as more 'evolved' vampires or something. But, oh no, they came all the way up from Brazil, all sweet and sound, totally safely and saved Will's life when he was having a bit of a turn. I mean, for crying out loud!! We went through this with 28 Week's Later - will studio types stop insulting our intelligence!!Oh yeah, and what was it with the leader Nazi/infected headbanger? He some former 'bad' man or something? Maybe political? Gee, maybe like, he was supposed to be George Bush Jnr, and like Will was the righteous man fighting for truth, you know like, keeping it real, right to the end. Actually the sad thing is, Will Smith is really quite good in this, his performance simply cannot deny what a truly awful film this is. I'm a little disappointed to see however the film get rave reviews simply because he is in it, that's a shame, but credit where it's due. If the film was half decent they'd be talking about him in this in years to come. They won't now. Still, I'm left feeling that I want to cry now.One day someone will make a really good film of 'I am Legend'. They Will, really. (OK, terrible pun...)",3,20,39,26 December 2007
