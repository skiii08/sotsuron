The Rock," this rocks
","If you like action, see this movie.  It's as simple as that.  Don't keep away from this movie just because Nicolas Cage can't act.  This role doesn't require him to act, so he's actually not bad in it.  Sean Connery looks a worn out in every seen of the movie, but I think that's an intentional joke. Michael Biehn is the best in this movie.  (He should've had a bigger role. Seriously.)  SEE THIS MOVIE, ACTION FANS!  10/10",8,2,2,12 November 2003
A Bridge Too Far," highly recommended
","When I rented this movie I didn't have the highest expectationssince it only has a 6.9 on this site.  However, I was pleasantlysurprised by the movie and it is one of my favorites.  RichardAttenborough put together a fine cast and crew.The ups: Most of the cast (that is, Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine,Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, AnthonyHopkins, Hardy Kruger, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford,Maximilian Schell, and Liv Ullman) do a very good job in their roles. I was especially pleased by Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, andSean Connery.  Also good was Robert Redford in a role that wasonly meant to attract a bigger American audience (since heappears two hours into the film).  John Addison's score is verygood; it brought back memories of classic scores like The BridgeOn the River Kwai's and The Great Escape's.  I could go on and onabout the sensational production, but I don't feel like it right now.The downs: Besides Robert Redford's pointless casting, there areother problems with the actors.  Ryan O'Neal just wasn't veryconvincing at all in his role, with some of his lines soundingalmost purposely artificial.  Also, James Caan must have gotten aface lift after The Godfather, because his facial expression is prettymuch the same throughout the movie.  His role at first seemspointless, but then the story of the little guy had to have been told. Also, man probably argue that the movie dragged on too long. Since I am interested in WWII history, I realized that OperationMarket-Garden was an epic mission with great importance, but Iwould've been just as happy with the movie if it was about fifteenminutes shorter.In the end, I was very pleased by the movie and I highlyrecommend it.  9/10",9,2,4,29 July 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," really good movie
","One thing that's bad about people is that they expect the sequel to be as good as, if not better than, the original.  That rarely happens.  That has only happened for the first Star Wars made, Star Wars Episode II, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  Then, once the sequel is not as good as the original (the sequel is also one of my favorites), almost everyone has high hopes for the last one.  Unlike most people, I was not expecting this movie to blow the first two away.  I thought it was going to be pretty bad.  (See...I have low expectations of sequels.)Then, when I saw this movie I was like, 'Wow.  This movie saved the franchise.'  Let me explain why I made this comment.  The Matrix is an action movie, correct?  The Matrix Reloaded is an action movie, correct? So, in an action movie, I look to be entertained by action.  I don't really want to think that much.  (That's what I expect when I watch a thriller.) The Matrix Revolutions is another action movie, correct?  Then PAY ATTENTION TO THE ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's the action that makes this movie so good.  I rest my case.",7,0,0,15 December 2003
The Village," good movie
","*******************  SPOILERS HEREIN  *****************I saw this movie with pretty low expectations.  I was, once again,pleasantly surprised.  In other reviews, I constantly sawcomplaints about the story being weak.  i disagree.  I found thestory to be genuinely scary and extremely thought-provoking.  Onequestion that I found Shymalan asking us is if it is right to try to livein an utopian world by means of fear and bribery.  I also sawcomplaints about the monsters looking cheap.  Although I did notfind the monster to be thoroughly convincing, it worked.  Besides,the costume was made by humans who, most likely, had no skillin creating bone-chilling monsters.  I had issues with the 'twistending' since I was expecting something scary instead ofrevealing.  I also had a hard time accepting that the founders of thevillage would make a decision to start again so drastically.  Butthen again, I've never been in the type of situation.  Unlike mostpeople, I had no trouble understanding and accepting thedialogue.  I give the story 7.5/10The acting is what makes the film so good.  Joaquin Phoenix, whoplays the most important character (since he is our hero and isfirst billed), dishes out his usually excellent performance.  Iwouldn't say he was better than he was in Signs, but he was betterthan he was in Gladiator.  Adrien Brody, with a complex role, isalso excellent.  William Hurt deals with the most dialogue in thefilm and talks as if he were meant to talk this way.  SigourneyWeaver was also good, even though I had a tough time acceptingher as a character other than Ripley.  I also had a tough timeaccepting Brendan Gleeson as an American character, but hegave a fine performance nonetheless.  And Judy Greer, as one ofthe Walker daughters, is very good and was, thankfully, able toshow off her acting skills by being something other than comicrelief.  Last, but most definitely not least, is Bryce Howard.  As themain character, she carries the tremendous weight of the moviealmost with ease.  Hers is one of the best performances I've everseen.  None of her lines sound wooden or forced and all of hermovements (which are very important since she plays a blindwoman) are convincing and appear 100% genuine.  As you canguess, I give the acting 10/10.Overall: 9/10",8,0,0,6 August 2004
The Shining," In one word: MAGNIFICENT
","This is the most MAGNIFICENT movie ever made.  I shall tell you why. Besides it being the scariest movie ever made (it is SO scarier than 'Psycho'), it has one of the most MAGNIFICENT casts in movie history.  I congratulate James Laggat.  (There are a few movies with better casting: the 'Lord of the Rings' films, 'The Seven Samurai', the first three 'Star Wars' films, and 'Blade Runner'.)  It has MAGNIFICENT music from Wendy Carlos, Rachel Ellkind, and Bola Bartok.  The cinematography from John Alcott is just MAGNIFICENT.  It has also been directed by the most MAGNIFICENT director (in my opinion).  I want all of you to see this MAGNIFICENT movie. 10/10",10,0,1,16 December 2003

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," an excellent film with this generation's 'Man With No Name'
","This film is a treasure.  Quentin Tarantino has a skill as a director that few have been lucky enough to acquire.  He, just like the Coen Brothers, know exactly how to mix brutal action, suspense, drama, anime and, perhaps most important, comedy in an excellent timeless classic (hopefully), while adding a message about humanity. Of course, Quentin Tarantino can't make an excellent movie without an excellent cast.  I have to admit, I've seen more bad movies with Thurman than good, so I didn't think that she would be any good at all.  Same goes for Vivica and Lucy.  Matter of fact, the only people I knew would be good were Michael and David.  Boy, was I wrong.  There is not a single major character in the movie that I believe is flawed in any way.  Although some were stereotypical, they still showed human aspects that we were not used to seeing in action movies.  Notice how some characters plead for their lives, some embrace death because they deserve it, some are almost sympathetic to their enemy.  Interesting. This movie also has excellent cinematography, top-notch editing, and a score to die for.  Put in these five ingredients together and you not only get some memorable major scenes (the enormous and over-the-top sword-fight in the restaurant) but some minor ones as well (Daryl Hannah whistling 'Twisted Nerve' and goons comparing a waiter to Charlie Brown). 10/10",10,0,1,21 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," a classic and really good film
","In my review for Matrix Revolutions, I told people to pay attention to the action, but I did not back that up.  Since I believe this movie is just as good as its sequel, I will back up my statement.  The first Matrix put brand new ideas (at least to me) into the world as we used to know it.  There were ideas that were so convincingly shown in the first one, you see, like us being used as a battery and also humanity would bring armaggedon.  Now, many people I know were disappointed that the sequels did not put any new ideas into their heads.  They were disappointed that all the answers were not given to them.  My question for them was: 'why?'  Wasn't the original idea enough to delve on in the first place?  And besides, since when did humans ever get the entire idea of something.  Why don't we just 'choose' what we think is behind all these ideas?  After all, our free will gives us 'purpose,' right?  So, my theory is that the Wachowski brothers decided to replace a lot of the philosophical elements with pure and hard-core action (some of the best I've ever seen).  This element works almost perfectly in the sequels.  So, you see, die-hard fans of the Matrix trilogy, just because you aren't given the same amount of philosophy that there was in the first one, there's more than enough that's left-over from the first one. I love this movie.  9/10",8,0,0,28 April 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Polanski's work of art
","I love horror movies.  I love this film.  Maybe you love horror movies. You will love this film.  First off, this isn't 'The Shining', '28 Days Later', 'An American Werewolf in London', or 'The Omen' scary.  The frights are much deeper, but not as good.  But, you won't care.  Because you'll still be scared to death.  This movie is so scary, it's fun.  Watch it, love it. Pure and simple.",10,0,1,12 November 2003
Shrek," Surprising
","Eddie Murphy is notorious for his horrible movies. His base acting, humor, and overall style has smeared the face of movies with shame (see 'Pluto Nash' for an example. However, this movie is surprisingly and refreshingly different from all other movies with Murphy in it. This movie compines plesant animation with a crisp and silly story line with a voice-over cast that is simply perfect for the movie. Even though it is ultimately a child's movie, it gives excitement and pleasure to whomever sees it and is solidly recommended to anyone who asks.",8,1,2,16 December 2003
