The Ring," A great film based on the Suzuki novel
","If you are a fan of the original Suzuki novel, you will enjoy this. The film IS NOT an adaption of the original novel. This however is a positive factor as it allowed the writers to tool with the concept of the cursed videotape, giving Sadada/Samara an interesting, new back story for us to follow.This film could have been like any other modern day horror, knives, blood and mindless violence. This film, however focuses on a more mystery based Thriller, which is good as it doesn't ruin the atmosphere of the original Suzuki novel.The acting is very good, Naimoi Watts does an amazing job at capturing the films horror psychologically. The child actor playing her son is very skilled as well and creates an eerie feel to some of the scenes.The film isn't very graphic and focuses on a more artistic horror. This is a nice break from the amount of mindless slashers like saw and the stupidly on going Jason series. The film only doesn't get a 10 stars because the book had a slightly more gripping back story for Sadada/Samara and explained a bit more about why the cursed videotape exists. Still this film is a classic and will remain in my DVD collection until blue-ray out-dates everything, pff unlikely!",9,1,1,12 June 2009
The Incredibles," A superhero movie that is worth watching!
","Most modern day superhero movies are kind of poor, bland scripts can ruin the overall joy of the superhero genre.The thing Pixar has done with this film is not make an adaption of a massive comic book series, but create an original concept which revolutionises the superhero genre. As an audience we are treated to the 'Glory Days' of superheohood and the presentation is just stunning. Realistic visuals with a massive scape of the city, with fun heroes (Mr Incredible) and villains (Bomb Voyage). All this occurring with a beautiful jazz-orchestral soundtrack which is used in various parts of the film. This is used as an effective method of introducing the characters (including Frozone and Elastagirl).After an unfortunate series of events the one amazing superheros are oppressed by the masses and are forced to behave like normal human beings, superpowers are considered to be disabilities rather than a gift. It becomes apparent that this is more than just a superhero movie as it covers a variety of themes such as an 'opressive government' in the first ten minutes.We are then introduced to the rest of the main characters, 'Violet Power' a frustrated teenager who is shy but still wants to be recognised (ironic as she has the power of invisibility and force fields). Also her younger brother 'Dashel Power' who has the ability of super speed but can not express his enjoyment of running in sports days at risk of revealing his power. We can already see a 'Dysfunctional Family' sub-plot within the film which is presented in a rather amusing dining room argument scene.'Bob Powel' (Previously Mr Incredible' is tired of his boring office worker job and attempts secret assignments under his families noses. This reveals a classic super villain known as 'Syndrome' who was incredibly well character developed by the Pixar team.In conclusion both the Script, Visuals and Music is incredible and beats almost any other superhero movie in this current time. It is also a fresh direction for pixar as it focuses on a more serious plot. It is not as funny as some of the previous work of pixar but it is at the same production value of the other films.",10,0,0,14 March 2010
