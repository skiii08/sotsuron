The Rock," Brainless but solid action movie
","Without a constant CGI explosion overload overshadowing his sense for classic action Bay actually manages to do something solid.Though the thin plot is full of improbabilities and morally more then questionable, the dialog corny at best, with the Bay'esqe lines of humor merely randomly distributed throughout the movie disregarding script and situation and though the fact that Bay doesn't manage to make you shed a single tear for any of these people one is still constantly on the edge of his seat while the kind of entertaining Connery-Cage duo might get you trough the rest.Enjoy with popcorn.6/10",6,4,4,6 July 2011
Alien 3," Very good movie, why all the hate?
","I saw the theatrical version a few times before and never had the feeling that there would have been any problems with it. I always considered the third installment as a dark, thrilling Alien movie, absolutely deserving the Alien logo. Now I'm just trough the assembly cut, it was great too (wouldn't pick one).I read a few reviews and people are tearing the movie apart, usually for no obvious reason so I went researching. Reading all the trivia and the horrible conditions of production, I probably could understand that Fincher nearly bailed out (does not go for the original writers, who are now writing bogus as AVP), still, the end-result never left any obvious signs of the mess.Sigourney Weaver totally owns the movie as doing a seamless performance really showing heart and rock-solid professionalism, congratulations for that. The location is ideal for an Alien movie, a dark and remote labyrinth, what do you want more? The whole thing looks beautiful due to the top notch cinematography, which I'd consider as outstanding for '92. The monster effects are great as ever, but the 'new' special effects are quite gross in certain shots (especially around the final). I think it is rather the blue-screen technology that looks messy, not the basic CGI which is actually okay (concidering '92 it's fine).It is obvious that Alien3 somewhat differs from its predecessors in terms of style. However, I find the new angle a very good and brave choice - Fincher does a dark thriller. An aspect that is usually missing in modern science-fiction/horror flicks.Regarding the characters, the minimal depth of the supporting cast is characteristic for the franchise, I wouldn't go there to mess with that, though I could imagine more interesting fellows then a group of religious space prisoners. Guess that's up to you. Otherwise, I found the character of Clerance very interesting and terrificly played by Charles Dance, actually the whole cast is pretty decent.Now, after the outstanding original - groundbreaking and still unmatched in style - and the epic sequel, I do not break out in euphoria seeing this movie, but it was a very good and fresh one with some great highs and minor lows, just fine for closing the original Alien TRILOGY - as I consider part 4 with genetically engineered superpower Ripley rather as a new generation of the franchise, along with the horrible AVP stuff.",7,6,8,3 September 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Darkest, most intense Marvel movie
","Edward Norton seems unsatisfied. With dialog consisting exclusively of oneliners, you can not define or build any kind of character. Given nothing to work with he's right in acting bored, so is the rest of the otherwise potent cast, each of them trying to coop with the situation in their on manner. Everyone is playing some generic character that they played before, placing this movie into a generic universe inhabited by generic people doing generic stuff. Which is a pity, as otherwise this is a rough, intense action spectacle with a truly incredible, brutal Hulk. The beautiful, mature cinematography is easily the best of any Marvel flick and the CGI is mind blowing, incarnating the Hulk in exactly the form, he deserves to have.2008 was a good year for comic book fans, with Ironman, the best Marvel adaptation so far, and Hulk, a merely adult try on the genre, Marvel seemed illuminated, promising a darker, more mature, more intense, more human direction for their upcoming line of movies. Unfortunately, rather then working more in this direction, Disney seemed to have turned the wheel and as things look now, Hulk is going to stay the darkest and roughest feature that Marvel is willing to put money into. Mothers are not willing to take their five year olds to this kind of stuff, that's bad for the business, I get it.So 'The Incredible Hulk' feels a little bit like the incidentally created monster itself and comic book characters are not yet to enter the adult world like they would deserve.",Null,0,1,15 September 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The traces of amateur filmmaking are hard to ignore
","There is plenty of Star Wars stuff going on here, but so much of everything else borders on amateur filmmaking, that it becomes harder and harder to just endure the talky parts. Or to be totally precise, almost every part where there is any talking going on. I suppose after so much appreciation along the preceding 22 years George Lucas couldn't resist but to take his place in the directors chair again, maybe forgetting, that while he might be a visionary, he did not collect any profound experience as a director since 1977. Liam Neeson and Evan McGregor kind of keep tight, but from the horrible delivery of the blunt lines by the supporting cast, to all the stupid little nuances of the extras, the discoordinated settings, to the messy cinematography and editing, everything is a testimony to Lucas' inability to run a tight ship. Or generally a ship at all. If this wouldn't be a Starwars movie, with tons of expensive, state of the art CGI overshadowing clumsy filmmaking, the movie wouldn't have made it into the B category.",4,2,6,17 July 2012
Minority Report," Not the best Spielberg movie but still well worth watching
","This script doesn't seem as solid as what Spielberg is usually working with. The effort to force the plot into a classic chase movie apparently demanded to ignore some smaller inconsistencies, especially the moral standpoint of the story was never really clear to me. Andertons swift change in motivation seemed odd and Burgess leaves without any clear statement. Appears quite a deal more as lazy scriptwriting then thought provoking.Besides that Minority Report is still good cinema in terms of scope, detail and a decent portion of vision, presented with the outstanding quality Spielberg got us used to. Not to mention the smart action scenes and the general, pleasingly rapid pace of the movie. And though the storytelling might crumble a bit here and there at least there is a story well worth telling.Shouldn't be an excuse, but scriptwriting mistakes like these are merely the minimum in most of the improbably successful, billion dollar productions that Hollywood has given us along the last decade. Re- watching this after movies like X-Men: First Class, Spiderman 3 or Inception makes me generally long for flicks as badly written as this one.",7,0,1,6 July 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino has seen and memorized every movie ever produced from 1914 - 1988
","Tarantino proves that he is a genuine genius as a scriptwriter and director as well with his most refined movie up to date. People who will say that they didn't like this because it's gory will have to rent the next Adam Sandler movie instead. Also, this is a fairytale. I wonder why a lot of people didn't get that. It was just about time someone burned the Nazi leadership after 53 years of us being forced to watch how Hitler is invulnerable to explosions.I love Tarantinos special style of cinematography. Instead of experimenting with angles and tricks he lets the camera serve the story with perfectly composed, sharp images. There is also a certain concept in the colorful sets as everything seems to be put into place perfectly and looks kind of artificial. In a good sense, it's unique.The only problem might have been for me, that along the fantastic conversations the main story may have got a bit short and I probably could have used a bit more stuff with those Basterds. Nothing that a terrific Christoph Waltz doesn't make up for.9/10",9,2,8,4 September 2009
Ted," Okay, but slim
","Ted is an okay movie. Some of the jokes are really hilarious and in a peculiarly intelligent manner. Seth McFarlane's humor is really one of a kind and his easy approach towards movie-making is something that is worth appreciating. He's just consequently himself without all the BS and that's very refreshing. Ted has a few downsides though. Some of it only got clear to me a few hours after seeing the movie and realizing how kind of forgettable the whole thing is. This might be due to the fact that the script is not particularly rich in content. Compressing character development into feature film length might be unfamiliar territory for McFarlane and most of the characters are pretty slim, with the female lead appearing particularly one dimensional. Joel McHale's character and the promising antagonists of the movie fall unfairly short too and the movie really could have used a lot more work on them. This is especially frustrating seeing so much empty space throughout the movie just screaming for ideas to be inserted and one gets the feeling that McFarlane just didn't really try too hard all together, kind of disrespecting his devoted fanbase. Also, the moral standpoint of the movie was a bit unclear to me and could have been worked out more. I'm not saying that it couldn't have done without one, but if you do have a position and you center a whole plot around it, please make it at least a clear one. Also McFarlane is not a professional director. Considering that, he does an OK job, but it's really not Spielberg.All together, Ted is not a bad movie by any means and it's kind of lovely, with a lot of good jokes. It's just a bit slim, especially for it's premise.For the same concept Simon Pegg/Nick Frost vehicle Paul comes to mind as a much more profound movie.5/10",Null,1,2,10 December 2012
Terminator Salvation," Pointless, but good quality
","This film is not as bad as many say. It's biggest strengths are be the pretty solid production quality and the cinematography. Latter really has it's moments. Also, the movie features a surprisingly dark tone which I can usually only dream about regarding other blockbusters. refreshing. Unfortunately this barely saves the movie from the incontinent script, that seemingly no one had found a way to really handle. Instead the director and the actors (very noticeable on Bale who's still playing Batman) just seem to roll along with it, efficiently working towards their paycheck. They are doing an OK job by the way, given the conditions of course. We actually do have professional people here. So things happen, it looks good, it feels alright, let's ignore the plot holes but then towards the finale this whole thing becomes more and more dull and in the end it just declares itself absolutely pointless considering the big picture, pushing the movie into TV spin off terethory, which I found borderline criminal. Was this really the story of how John Connor got a new heart? I seems that there's not too much more juice left in the Terminator lemon. Please, dear producers, have some foresight and invest in some new epic sagas. With platitudinous Star Wars needing to be resurrected for the third time soon, we're running out of so much as a dead horse to beat.",7,0,2,14 January 2010
Spider-Man 3," 'In the web of love'
","Why is this a chick flick? I'm quite positive most people go to a Spiderman movie to see cool action and awesome special effects. Not that a decent amount of emotion could not usefully support character development and give the movie depth... and stuff... but getting constantly bombarded with personal problems of the supporting cast and totally unnecessarily conflicts, with a sad score blaring frequently, what's the point in that? I want spider sense tingling and uppercuts and flying martial arts web action. Does anyone seriously expect me to cry on a Spiderman movie? Hours go by without any kind of action, instead you have to suffer trough this: 'Peter, why do you want to push me away from you?'. I will not even go into the infamous emo-Peter-fever-dance- sequence, to leave room for the part when Eddie Brock kneels down in a church and asks Jesus (I repeat, that's Jesus Christ) to 'KILL PETER PARKER'. At that point I wouldn't have been surprised about Jesus descending from the cross to actuall battle Spiderman. Around the end, we also get a shot of Spiderman posing in front of a giant, waving American flag, that kind of did it for me and several other people in the cinema and it was all laughter from then on, the best part of the whole flick.I was promised a darker and deeper Spiderman and what I got was a 'f*ck- you' and a kick in the nuts. Well f*ck you too Mr. Raimi.2/10",2,6,13,4 May 2007
Underworld Awakening," Undertalented.
","Soon after finding myself excited, only missing a certain finesse ten minutes into the thing, upcoming B-movie stupidity quickly devastated my hopes of this turning out to be a straight forward, crystal clear, quality action flick. Besides delivering a promising kick-off and a thrilling finale (both prolonged action scenes with Kate Backinsale kicking some ass) neither of directors Mans Marlind or Bjorn Stein nor writers Allison Burnett or Kevin Grevioux really manage to deal with anything in this movie, including characters exchanging two lines of consistent dialog or wrapping up the most simple scene. While there is a certain flair (mainly established by the preceding Undeworld movies) present, I'd need to search my mind for a while, to mention three other movies showing off so little talent from side of their directors or writers.",2,3,6,18 May 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Unnecessary
","David Fincher is directing what is merely a marketing stunt here, not a movie on it's own right. This is the optimized version of another movie that barely needed any optimization, not even for the American market. It didn't need any and it didn't really got any, so Fincher is right to appear bored as the whole effort basically is only necessary so people don't get confused by Noomi Rapace, who does look terrifying in the original, which was kind of the point. Now while this is certainly not the worst movie ever, I don't quite see where I could start praising it. Americas version of the not quite ingenious, but nevertheless somehow outstanding Scandinavian original is generally unintense, the performances are mediocre at best, the accents suck ass (if already converting it, why not start by putting it into America??), Trent Reznor Music is off, the Fincher look is unnecessary and the whole movie just appears pointless without it's human edge which was kind of the only real thing to the original. This definitely is Finchers weakest movie up to date.4/10",4,4,6,17 December 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fantastic!
","Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years. Every fight is choreographed and executed in the most awesome ways and the fact that it's not Jet Lee pulling off these moves makes it even more fun to watch. And you get the fights absolutely frequently which is really, really satisfying. The editing is incredibly skillful as probably the most crucial element that makes this work. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. The amount of creativity put into this part is mind- blowing, resulting genuine and most original style. The cast is cool and I don't think anyone should look for academy material here. I liked these kids and they suit the movie.So, all together I found Scott Pilgrim being one of the most original, exciting and fun productions I've seen in my life. As a huge fan of things like fighting games, comics, or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about, it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.Fantastic! 8/10",8,131,225,12 November 2010
Kick-Ass," Almost there
","Thanks to it's unique atmosphere, good pacing, the delightful cast and the almost fantastic fact, that Kick-Ass absolutely has the balls to push the envelope as it is not desperately craving for ratings and family friendliness, like - you could expect from a mainstream movie - This is one of the most charming, enjoyable and entertaining movies I've seen this year.But. Having all this together, the possibilities would have been at least to make one of the the most original movies in this genre ever, an opportunity that Matthew Vaughn decides to miss. The startup is hilarious and keeping up that tendency probably would have got this movie into history, but at a certain point, it takes a different direction where people (let me quote) '...have the expensive s*** that does not exist...' and the 11 year old girl's beating up crowds of ripped crack dealers and professional criminals with ease. Which - after setting up its own rules to not do exatly that - was a major letdown for me. Also Kick-Ass occasionally suffers from some seriously bad dialog. Watching it the second time around, without awaiting a wonder, I liked it more though and by the way, the comic book narrative is really well executed.Bring on the sequel, but please, without prostituting the whole thing to do better at the box office.7/10",7,2,6,10 June 2010
Transformers," Looks incredible and has it's moments
","I am not sure how deep exactly a director is involved in the technical production of a movie of this scope, but whether it's him, whether it's the people working with him, someone on Bay's sets knows how to assure production quality. I usually do not give too much credit for how a movie generally looks and is made, as stuff for this can be learned and bought. But in this special case production value is so incredibly high that it emerges from its original place and becomes a separate art form. One might take stuff like this for granted, but just freeze the movie for a moment and try to sum up how many people have been working for countless hour on that frame to make it look like it does now, meaning not just the action parts but even the most simple scenes. Fortunately, all this reaches it's climax when it comes to the robots as the CGI applied here is just staggering. I recommend the biggest screen available to you, as the level of detail is mind blowing and has to be presented in the highest resolution possible for you to be able to get just a part of what is happening all together. Also, this provides the movie with a pretty high re-watch value, the scenes featuring the Transformers can be rewinded several times to discover new things happening on the screen every time.Now while the rest is pretty forgettable I must admit, it kind of works for most of the time. Shia LeBoef might not be academy material, but the way he seems to be on drugs for the majority of the movie is kind of entertaining. Ms.Fox doesn't need to do anything for me, I'd give her any award she likes. The Bay-specific humor deliberately smashed in to make this family friendly borders at slapstick at times but I admit actually having fun with it now and then. Also it's full of plot holes and banal script writing mistakes but then again it has Megan Fox's ass.Now Undoubtedly this is a Michael Bay vehicle and all this by itself could still be unwatchable, but the thing is, there are some unexpectedly good scenes and moments. I wouldn't have dared to hope for anything as dark and thrilling as the first scene with the decepticon attacking the military base, which was a genuine cinema moment for me, something I thought would have been extinguished by know. And though the movie never goes there again, with a few other moments and the transformation effects and Megan Fox's legs I am willing to forgive a lot of crap here. Even some of the stupid things that are severely effecting the movies quality which could have been easily avoided.So the movie is called Transformers and this is exactly what you get and technically produced in the most awesome way imaginable. The rest, while banal at times is actually entertaining, so you know... whatever... for what it is: 9/10",9,3,4,19 June 2011
The Dark Knight," The dawn of a new era of pseudo-intellectualism in mainstream cinema
","After Spielberg's introduction of humor to serious thriller with Jaws in 1974, his derivatives quickly changed cinema forever. Distilling his easy and life-like approach towards storytelling to the technique now known as 'comic relief' violent, serious or simply unappealing movies could now be made digestible for a broader audience by inserting random bits of comedy after stressful scenes. One of the big advantages of this method was also that it seemed to work even without putting much thought into it. You don't need a genius to do it. A stupid oneliner here, some odd physical comedy there and you can get even the most sensitive viewer trough a movie that can still be marketed towards an action oriented audience. What this has resulted in of course was, that making high- budget movies without elements of comedy now became a bad business decision and it became more and more rare that you could sit trough a piece of high caliber cinema without having to endure idiotic jokes and tasteless characters, often ruining crucial parts of an otherwise promising flick. One can not go about writing about this without mentioning infamous entities like the Jar-Jar Bings character from Star Wars: Episode One, Rob Schneider in Judge Dredd or Michael Bay's over the top ideas, often crossbreeding vicious melodrama with borderline cases of slapstick.Cinema is about what the audience wants and the audiences kept supporting this so comic relief kept ruining cinema for the last few decades. But you can only go so far (though this was somewhat more then far) and at some point stuff had to change. Sequels repeatedly promising a 'darker' more 'character centered' tone while dishing out the same topsy-turvy bullsh*t again and again kept loosing credibility and someone finally had to deliver. One year after Spider-man 3 and it's infamous emo-Peter-fever-dance-scene Nolan Presented the first 'serious' blockbuster for nearly a decade and brought about a revolution in mainstream cinema. Sounds cool? Just give me a few more minutes.The concept of Nolan's Batman is to switch bat-nipples to army gadgets, pull back on stupid comedy, give the main character something that can be called a background story, motivation, introduce a 'philosophical' aspect and basically place Batman into the real world as compared to la-la-lala-land where Sam Raimy's Spider-man lives together with Michael Bay on the back of a purple dinosaur.And all of this is really cool but wait a second, what about the box office? Wouldn't that mean that people need to THINK to grasp all this? How would this complex approach not frustrate the average moviegoer? How would Bruce Wayne's inability to express love, the Joker's hedonistic psychopathy not startle young mothers who go to the movies for fun and delight and like to enjoy movies together with the whole family? Nolan's got the key.Movies can be serious. They just has to be dumb as sh*t.It was a misunderstanding all along and Nolan (accidentally?)figured it out. It's not about the stress (in fact people love stress, isn't this the whole point of drama?). It's about the intellectual challenge. People want smart movies and they want serious movies, but not smart and serious like smart and serious. Smart and serious compared to their own abilities. That means on the average the intellectual abilities of what used to be a 13 year old way back when.So present all the deepness, complicatedness, motivations and this on the lowest, dumbest, most childish level that is possible so every idiot can understand and then put trillions of dollars into making it look like something big and then start viscerally overstimulating the viewers by having a severe score blare all the f*cking time and the tons and tons of dumb, shallow bullsh*t will sound like Dostojewsky because there was the really heavy music and they said it with this deep voice and they were sitting in this incredibly expensive setting, it has to be profound. Hell, they might even feel a bit profound themselves now, after all there is profound written all over this movie and it's dark, serious looking posters and you have to be a profound guy to enjoy a profound movie. They won't care, that it's pretentious, that it's shallow and infantile, they don't even know what those words mean.So this movie is on kindergarten level. It's not that there is nothing good about it, some of it is high quality stuff but it's a stupid, childish, shallow, phoney melodrama, it's overly long, extremely self- important and the production value is exactly the trick that makes it to be taken serious and therefore so harmful. It works because audiences are stupid and fall for everything flashy and loud and expensive looking, cause they are mainly teenagers and mainly Americans and because people love marketing and movies are only about marketing now.But the problem is not that Nolan made a phoney movie, it's that he brought about a new revolution in mainstream cinema, as now it is the bad business decision not to have low-level, pseudo-philosophical bullsh*t in high-budget movies and flicks like X- Men: First Class, the god awful Spider-Man reboot, Prometheus and many others already adopted his mind bogglingly boring, anti-intellectual approach centered around infantile conversation and now make more money then ever. Nolan ruined mainstream sci-fi and superhero movies at least for the next decade and the thing in which his misdeed is truly severe as compared to Spielberg's case above mentioned is, that he has shown people how to do the tasteless version right away, rather then just having invented something cool which the capitalist world then abused for it's own merit. He did the sh*tty thing right away, god forbid those studios have to figure it out for themselves.Thank you Mr. Nolan. 4/10",4,3,7,14 January 2010
Taken," He absolutely will take their lives
","What do you expect from a movie claiming 'They took his DAUGHTER. He'll take THEIR LIVES'?Now weather you accept Liam Neeson as the harbinger of death is up to you. For me, he seems out of place, but I also need to say that he gives a particular touch to the movie which probably isn't too bad.Otherwise Taken is an entertaining vengeance flick with a more realistic approach to martial arts (krav maga as far as I'm concerned) and some slightly unconventional features (Liam Neeson shooting an innocent woman in the kneecap would be a profound example) resulting a more original product then we're used to.A good subject for renting I'd say. 5/10",5,0,0,25 February 2011
Avatar," Disney
","Avatar is a 3D benchmark program married to an early script of Pochahontas. It's a Walt Disney movie and the way it is colorful and fun only underlines the fact how lucrative it is designed to be. The story is about war and extinction, stuff like that is not colorful and fun. Yes, it is a wonder of computer technology, but technological wonders happen every day, just look at your 50 gigs pendrive smaller then your thumbnail, since when do we credit that as art? I do not find avatar a particularly bad movie, but as a general piece of filmmaking it is not worth more praise than a worse Disney vehicle and the way it now forces cinema to convert to a 3D entertainment park is not something I regard as a benefit to the world.",6,2,4,2 September 2010
Invictus," Peaceful and inspiring
","Nothing all too intense going on here and that's nice for a change. To my understanding, the story is not exactly historically accurate, but fortunately not because Clint Eastwood felt the need to artificially generate personal conflict and tension, a moving back story just so we can worry, if Johnnys foot will heal in time before the big game. Instead he lets the central message dominate above the little problems of separate characters, pretty irrelevant they would be compared to a whole country in fear.So just let the positive vibes in.

Limitless," Unimaginative waste of an interesting premise
","Despite the great premise director Neil Burger does next to nothing with the opportunities Alan Glynn's interesting novel proposes, while Leslie Dixon puts forward one of the laziest screenplays in recent film- history. As if advancing the plot trough an insane amount of narration wasn't enough, most of the dialog is still used up for exposition giving you the feeling that you are listening to a dumbed-down audio book. The rest of the dialog is just plain uninteresting. The great central idea of a perfectly functioning brain that is supposed to be the main point of interest in this movie is wasted in the most unimaginative way, almost exclusively on short montages repeatedly utilizing the same visual effect, providing what is merely a video background while the lead is reading the story to you.If you want to get this certain experience and don't like to read, I'd honestly recommend the audio book if there is one.

Once it starts, it does not stop. What comes, is a thrill-ride, so refined and totally claustrophobic, you simply could not push the tension any further. The movie keeps you under permanent stress, gradually increasing the intensity as the expanding frustration and desperateness takes over. The fact that they are scaring you to death like every 1-2 minutes helps too. Thank god, no one really cared about 'giving the audience a break now'.

","Anthony Hopkins' weird performance is just off and even gives an impression of mockery towards a childish script. And if so he is right. Stuffed with badly delivered, meaningless dialog and unfunny crap and with a general lack of any kind of intensity Thor is not to save. Not like the TV cast, logopedic case Chris Hemsworth or action-unknown director Kenneth Branagh ever had a fair chance of doing so. Thor is an alibi for a movie, existing only to set up a supporting character for another flick, not a lead one. It's not even an investment, it's just a supporting part of a business model. It was never meant to fully satisfy and so it does not. Just ask the accounting at Disney for further explanation.",Null,2,5,15 September 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Finally Bay has lost it
","I really liked the first movie and actually gave it a 9 star rating. Undoubtedly it was a Michael Bay vehicle too, but there he kind of had his s*it together, so the whole thing was bearable while you actually had some time to take in the effects. Now this is the same stuff but with Bay directing it on a pound of cocaine while having an epileptic seizure, it's a catastrophe.The plot is a logic paradox, the cinematography is confusing, everything is constantly spinning and/or exploding. The audio is deafening and the whole thing just keeps going and going, there is no escape from this pandemonium. The stupid, banal, bull*/it comedy element meant to take the edge of this noise and give you a break from time to time is just bashed in randomly EVERYWHERE and misses the mark completely. Not even the effects keep this above sea level as you simply are too busy with dealing with your motion sickness and cleaning the blood out of your ears to make out what is actually happening. There was some eye candy but to be totally honest I simply don't remember any of it. I praised the incredible production value of the first one which hasn't changed here, but the whole thing is just so raging with mindless content, it is not enjoyable anymore. The only thing I was longing for throughout the whole movie was to see a transformer just sit down for a damn second and silently sip a f/ckin diet coke.This is a showcase of everything Bay is so infamous for, I have no idea how a mess like this is able to happen at all at this scope. And note, this is the most expensive movie produced so far. Behold capitalism.3/10",3,2,7,20 June 2011
The Holiday," 'You look like my Barby'
","Superficial, manipulative Hollywood junk written by the same computer program most of these are only with the 'dialogue lines length parameter' set to double of normal as characters are basically thinking and occasionally even reading out loud, which is just an incredibly stupid thing to do. The characters can be entirely described by their professions - script writer, producer, film composer and so on - making me wonder if Nancy Meyers ever took a step out of Beverly Hills. Starring seduced Jude Law, castrated Jack Black, Cameron Diaz on ecstasy and die-trying Kate Winslet, all just frustratingly overplaying their roles which still don't feature any real human characteristics and thereby look like cut-outs from an Elle magazine. Basically everyone is acting as inflatable romantic-robots, always barbarically bashing out the perfect line that 'every woman would want to hear' at that point. I wonder if the generation growing up on these things will reflect some of it in their private lives.If you want real feelings, turn to Wes Anderson or Sam Mendes.",2,0,2,21 April 2010

","Tom Cruise's dysfunctional performance along the first 30 minutes and a lot of exposition dialog throughout the whole thing certainly do not benefit this movie. But at some point Cruise gets the chance to play a scared fu*/up which I found he does pretty well for some reason and between all the dull dialog there are enough authentic performances and an outrageously talented Dacota Fanning to make this movie not appear cheaply written.The rest I found just pretty fu/*ing awesome, meaning not just the action.

Whiplash," Mildly entertaining with mind-blowing musical scenes.
","Now despite of what I'm going to say, I want to make it clear, that I don't think this is a bad movie at all. As usual, it's just the script, that fails to live up to it's premise and indie movie or not, Whiplash is being harshly overrated in my opinion.First of all, while J.K. Simmons' performance is highly enjoyable his character development is being entirely neglected throughout the movie, leaving me unable to comprehend his implied ambiguity at all. This is a major drawback, considering his motifs are a big part of the movie. Apparently I'm not the only one who noticed this, writer (and director) Damien Chazelle takes the cheap way out nevertheless and instead of giving Simmons some actual scenes to develop trough he just blatantly bashes in a monologue at the end trying to clarify the characters motifs. Chazelle instead puts all the focus on the character of Andrew Neyman and his rather trivial coming-of-age problems which are appropriate for an upper-middle class boy his age but nothing even in the ballpark of justifying a whole movie. He's studying music at an elite school and has to prioritize. His family doesn't quite get him. So what?The other thing being totally neglected is the chemistry between the two main characters. This might be understandable in context of the plot but in order for me to be able to connect with a relationship there first needs to be one. This unfortunately means Whiplash falls short on it's premise exactly where it matters, trying to be an underdog movie without a real underdog or a real mentor or real stakes making it impossible for the movie to live up to it's potential.These are just bad writing choices easily explained by simply not neglecting that Chazelle was the writer behind 'masterpieces' like Grand Piano and The Last Exorcism Part II as well.Now while I feel the movie is being praised rather for what it could have been then for what it actually turned out to be I would still recommend it for most viewers. Teens and casuals probably won't be bothered by the shortcomings of the script and everyone is set to enjoy the musical scenes that are nothing short of amazing and fortunately receive major attention. The rest is kept together neatly by solid craftsmanship from everyone involved.All in all, Whiplash is mildly entertaining without any real lows and some amazing highs every time Andrew picks up those sticks.6/10",6,2,5,17 February 2015
Inception," Perception
","You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like 'for dummies', rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so 'in your face'. For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

Centurion," Scope's to big for Mr. Marshall
","You might already know that what you can expect regarding Neil Marshall is blood and guts flying around, which he of course does quite well. But in this certain case, this is really not enough and the movie doesn't have much more to show up either.So, while visually impressing and with a potent production value Centurion gradually drifts into an alibi for repeated scenes of people cutting each others throats. Problem is that the over the top splish- splash gutting and cutting just seems slightly out of place here considering, the movie tries to be rather serious. Now attempts of giving the movie meaning are the other thing that seems out of place, so where does this leave us...?Now not that Neil Marshal would be a useless director, I just think he was the wrong guy to give this movie to. Or if this was his attempt to emerge as a 'serious' movie maker maybe he should have refrained from the gore and give attention to the characters I guess.I'd wish he'd go back to movies with smaller scope, I want more of The Decent, where his abilities where sufficient and more then welcome. I just don't see any potential in him directing something of luminous range, if for nothing else, then for the fact that he can't get over himself with the gore. Well, on the other hand I guess this is what is expected from him.Unfortunately Centurion however turned out being rather forgettable.5/10",5,0,3,25 February 2011
Prometheus," A catastrophe
","The internet has done a fine job dissecting all the nonsense in this movie, so I'm not going to go into much detail. If you want a list of what's wrong with Prometheus I'd recommend the 'Red Letter Media asks questions from Prometheus' video or the 'Prometheus Honest Trailer' from Screen Junkies.So humanity faces its most important mission, yet the HR department of Weyland industries, the single most powerful company of the planet, assembles earths dumbest, most incompetent specialists to go on it. These people bitch, moan, misbehave and generally mess everything up, nearly bringing about the eradication of mankind. Writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof unintentionally create a huge parody of todays intellectual decline. If this is our future, I have no questions why the 'Architects' want to eradicate us. Ridley Scott has shown us an authentic spaceship crew in 1979, yet he is willing to roll with retarded teenagers 33 years later. The other huge downer is the onslaught of plot holes. Don't you get fooled. Prometheus is a mystery exactly in the same way Michael Bay movies are. It just doesn't give a crap about logic. The anti-intellectual pseudo-philosophy dealing with faith randomly scattered throughout the movie doesn't help either. Honestly, I have no problems calling this one of the worst scripts that have made it into mainstream cinema - ever. How Ridley Scott of all people agreed to this is simply beyond me.Nevertheless - as usual - he does a perfect job with the execution and the CGI is truly the best the present-day industry has to offer, so oddly all this is fantastic to look at. Nevertheless, as a movie Prometheus is simply insufferable.2/10",3,4,6,20 September 2012
X-Men: First Class," Uncool.
","X-Men: First Class pushes the envelope by further developing the present form of mainstream crap. The 'phylosophical themes' featured by this talky little movie consist exclusively of stupid commonplace and the banal scenes illustrating the concept of separation and such run on kindergarten level. As a wise man once said: 'If you have nothing to say then just shut the f+*k up'. And yet again, not shown to you, like, visually, but talked about and explained verbally. Similar to Venezuelan soap opera. Let me just hand out a big f/ckyou here.Characters are superficial and underdeveloped. Except of somewhat competent James McAvoy actors seem uninspired. Dialog matches daytime drama standards and worse. Superpowers are just not cool and the visual execution seriously lacks fantasy. The fact that almost everything you see here has already been done in the previous x-men movies and in much cooler ways lets me reshape into a question mark. Visual design also lacks fantasy, some of it is horrible. The work of the department responsible for the make-up effects is atrocious, Beast and Mystique look like muppets. Here goes the other f*ckyou.Despite a Wolverine cameo logical connections to the former trilogy are missing completely. I didn't know this was a reboot but however, the question emerges, why rebooting something that has been decently executed before (let's forget about X3 for a minute here). Why destroying the former movies and make something even more remote to the comics? Surely it has to do with money, so let's bow before the gods of marketing.People in the cinema seemed to like it, I guess they found it awesome and intelligent. I have no doubt that anti-intellectual sh-*/t like this will continue setting standards and increasingly shape upcoming movies in it's own image as box office numbers show it is well matched to the demands of it's audience.2/10Whatever talented, passionate people might have accomplished throughout movie-making history, most successful production will always be the WWF.",2,8,17,10 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Lazy, joyless, unimaginative - Nolan.
","I'm sorry people of the world, but apparently my finger is so not on your collective pulse. When it comes to anything besides making something look expensive, Nolan fails utterly and this movie is his coup de grâce on the importance of intelligent scriptwriting. Overtaking the god-awful Inception and the frustratingly dumb Prometheus, the worst written script of all time that received a 9 digit funding is now this mindlessly bashed together piece of what would be used as toilet paper for a week obligatorily worldwide in any universe which I am the ruler of. After I wrote a stupid essay on the previous installment - that now appears like art-house to me - blaming the movie for the rising popularity of pseudo-intellectualism in mainstream cinema, I have to stand in awe as where Nolan was at least just a pretentious, talentless prick with rich friends he now is a lazy pretentious, talentless prick with rich friends. My god, he was a horrible, infantile scriptwriter so far, but now he just doesn't seem to even give a rat's ass about it anymore. Was it lack of inspiration? A creative dilemma? Did he watch his former movies? I don't know. Nolan's basic lack of ability to efficiently pace the happenings of his movies, progress his stories trough anything but his South-American soap-opera style, exposition-only dialog, his disregard that his protagonist is a pathetic, mumbling, repulsive, shallow dick with nothing to go for, who looks like sh*t in his stupid costume and fights worse then I do, his psychopathic addiction to mindless, melodramatic bullsh*t sum up to one of the lowest quality, most embarrassing blockbusters I have seen in my whole life. I've spent the last 15 years ranting about action movies ruined by stupid comic relief and stereotypical crap, but not even the writers of Independence Day allowed themselves the thoughtless disregard of everything that is the art of movie-making at the degree Christopher Nolan dares putting forward. If there is a labour union responsible for QA in modern cinema, I demand Nolan be shot to the moon or deported back to filmschool with an F- before he can do more damage then he already has done.This movie deserves a 0/10.",1,9,17,27 December 2012
Flight," Very well done movie and then there's also god
","As far as the script, the acting and generally the whole execution of the movie goes I have nothing to complain about. Robert Zemeckis is one of the few directors who still do the stuff that we once knew and loved Hollywood for and Flight reminds one of the good sides of American filmmaking. And then for some reason there is also a lot of god going on, an aspect of the movie that I can barely see any point to. Denzel Washington's character study is so sharp and authentic, at no point did I need any kind of religious input to make this movie more profound. So this part of the movie, from my point of view, is extremely obsolete and I felt kind of annoyed that it distracts from the movies essence. Now I can't really decide, but if this was supposed to be some sophisticated shot at Christian apologetics, nice try, but no thanks. While I would be able to see a message here that goes something like 'the lord works in complex ways', the argument made by this story is still not valid from any logical point of view. Whatever happened here, you can see and do so in much detail, how it is pushed forward by the personal skills and decisions of the protagonist. At no point is the insertion of a god necessary or logically coherent. Washington's character does make a moral choice, but moral choices are not a copyrighted divine exclusives. I'm sorry Christians, I'm not impressed. However, while there's a lot of this going on, in the end it really doesn't do too much and fortunately doesn't overshadow an emotionally compelling, refined movie. I give this an 8/10.",8,2,13,23 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Good enough.
","Though the story is forcing the movie to further diverge from its essence and it tends to go really cheap on most of the sub-plots (I don't see how 10 more minutes on the supporting cast would have ruined the sales) I must honestly admit, that this is a fairly good solution to solve the impossibility of wrapping this monster up. Most of the decisions are justifiable if considering length, box office sales, rating and all the usual s/*t and when it comes to epicness, The Deadly Harlows 2 will not let you down. I don't think, that there ever was a realistic possibility of this movie being any better then what it has become in the end while there was a huge chance of producers ruining it.But I think, the question never was, whether it's going to be good or not, as the work has already been done along the last decade. The question was: is it going to be GOOD ENOUGH. It is good enough.With this, the Harry Potter saga is found its way into eternity and is now officially a legend, comparable, but in many ways surpassing Star Wars. And most of it didn't even suck.This actually was one of the historical cinema moments of this generation and I am kind of proud, of having witnessed it.",8,1,1,4 August 2011
Godzilla," Very little Godzilla for a movie called Godzilla.
","It's clear why Gareth Edwards was brought on board and his efforts are appreciated. Godzilla wants to be a serious movie but unfortunately the script just doesn't cut it. Dialog is thin, the characters have little to do besides worrying and being startled. Brian Cranston's mini-role is a trap, Godzillas screen time doesn't even match that of the malevolent creatures, making him become a supporting character in his own show, the action movie this promises to be never really happens and the enigmatic shots of tailtips and monster hips are really pointless and annoying 40 minutes after having exposed the creatures in their entirety. I do see a tendency of slow betterment in American cinema, but Hollywood really needs to hire better scriptwriters at this point.",5,2,5,17 August 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Total insanity
","Whatever Bay might have done along the last decade, this mind numbing clusterf*ck of two second shots and oneliners bashed together senselessly into a 180 minute montage of video clips and TV commercials and then vomited heartlessly on screen is what comes closest to being a portfolio of his insanity. I think he just literally lost his f*/king mind somewhere along his controversial career of utter financial success and total intellectual failure. The hecticness, the fundamental noise, the never ending music, screaming and explosions, the constant flashing and movement of every single object on screen, all the senseless, childish melodrama, the bulls*/t dialog with two sentences following each other barely ever connecting, all the soulless characters with some appearing and disappearing from one moment to the other never to be seen again, or just the mere ignorance radiating from this movie literally make this feel like an acid trip trough a lunatic persons mind. The whole thing is just out of control, never stopping for a second in 180 minutes and then suddenly this unwatchable crap ends in mid-sentence blowing 200 million dollars of budget trough your brain into f*/king deepspace, without any of what you have seen ever having mattered for one single second. Just... f*/king insane. 1/10",1,2,7,26 September 2011
The Social Network," Incredibly skillful and unique masterpiece
","I can really only talk in superlatives about what this crew of fine people managed to accomplish here. The key is not even in the sophistication of the separate parts, it's how everything comes together into coherence. Aaron Sorkin truly outdid himself with this script. I tend to dislike 'Snappy dialog' but 'snappy' here emerges from 'meaningless junk that can be applied to any crap to make it somewhat watchable', creating a standalone art form. The absolutely genuine characters - each of them truly interesting and entertaining - are merely played to perfection by around everyone of the absolutely felicitous cast. Finchers unique and familiar skills place this movie on Fight Club territory equaling the artistic values of the classic but support the movie in a more subtle and refined way underlined by Trent Reznors discreet musical universe and the famous, dark cinematographic style of Jeff Cronenweth (7even, FC) which is so welcome considering other directors might have approached the theme as some sunshiny college movie. I'm not a big facebook user, but the fact that it's about one of the surprisingly most relevant and trendy mediums these days, something that touches most peoples lives in one or the other way, the fact that you can like REALLY, personally relate to the whole thing gives a very unique touch, something I never experienced to this degree in a movie before. I guess the timing for picking the subject was just about perfect but who would have thought that someone can pull a serious, artful movie out of a story about the founder of a website so to say. I have absolutely nothing bad to say here, all the fantastic artwork coming together makes The Social Network a high quality, genuine masterpiece that is really hard to forget. Must see for about everyone.",10,1,2,8 November 2010
Jurassic Park," American cinema at its very best.
","The visualization is practically perfect, even 20 years later. It's because the CGI here is used in a discreet, moderate fashion and to give credibility to a fantasy, not to show you bullettime shots of the dinosaurs pores. Beyond doubt, it's visually fascinating, but Mr. Spielberg wisely remembers to use characters and performances to get you trough the plot, one that is based on ideas, research and fantasy. Thank you too Mr. Criton. Also perfection and imagination in detail seems natural for the director. A merely flawless piece.But Jurassic Park is not just good because the applied technology was revolutionary at the time, it's good because it serves an otherwise superbly crafted movie full of technical finesse. Spileberg shows, how to be not just ahead, but beyond your time. Not that technology did not advanced in the last two decades, but it's users generally degenerated and stupefy technological advancement to circus level and regarding the correct use of cgi in cinema Jurassic Park has yet to be matched.",Null,3,5,25 June 2011
