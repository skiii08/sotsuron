Black Swan," Plays like Tchaikovsky by way of David Lynch and Douglas Sirk
","Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is reckless, glorious fever-dream of a movie. It is striking, intoxicating, blackly humorous, melodramatic, and beautiful. In short, it is unlike anything else the movies have to offer.It is set in the cutthroat, isolated world of professional ballet. It chronicles the struggles of young ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). She is in her mid-twenties, young by any sane standards, but, ballet standards are far from sane. She is vying for the lead role in a new production of the classic Swan Lake. The role requires her to play the virginal, innocent White Swan and the seductive Black Swan. Nina obsessively perfects her form, but her director (Vincent Cassel) doubts that Nina can convey the alluring nature of the Black Swan. The film details Nina's obsessive drive to achieve total perfection, in the face of mental and emotional breakdown, and physical metamorphosis. Aesthetically, this film is a stunner. Aronofsky employs hand-held cameras that place us in Nina's shoes throughout the film. We are there for the incessant drilling and rehearsal that ballet requires. The camera swoops and pirouettes to dizzying effect. Aronofsky also succeeds in portraying the intensely competitive world of professional ballet. We hear bones crunch, toes break, and feet crack. He uses fractured editing rhythms and a soundtrack cobbled together from classical and experimental music to create Nina's intense and horrifying world.However, for all its success, Black Swan is not without its failings. At times, the film risks coherence for the sake of messing with the heads of the audience members. The film also introduces the frame story of Swan Lake in a very clumsy way: a monologue recited by Vincent Cassel. Aronofsky also relies too heavily on the visual contrast of white and black as a visual motif. Yet, audiences won't leave the theater considering these flaws. Black Swan is a wholly visceral cinematic experience that will spellbind those who are willing to seek it out. It is an uneasy, but fascinating watch that doesn't completely make sense until the end credits. Yet, the film has an impact well past the end credits. It is a movie to provoke discussion, a dark, seductive fairy tale to haunt your dreams. In a year of pale retreads and creative bankruptcy, it is a breath of fresh air.",10,2,6,14 December 2010
United 93," 'An affecting and fitting tribute to the unlikely heroes who lost their lives'
","Are we as Americans ready to see the events of 9/11 re-enacted up on the screens of our local theaters? It's a touchy subject and the makers of 'United 93' are aware of this fact. They walk a delicate tightrope between offending or paying homage to those who lost their lives that fateful day.With Paul Greengrass at the helm, United 93 manages to become the best film it can be despite, as I said, touchy subject matter. With the guide of Greengrass' steady hand we are thrusted into the date: September 11, 2001. The film proceeds in real time.The first half is set in different air traffic control towers across the U.S. They frantically try to stabilize the situation at hand(the hijacking of multiple planes). We know nothing about the people talking except the few details that are mentioned the very day of the hijackings. Greengrass' screenplay never resorts to 'Airport' stereotypes. I am extremely happy to report that no one in this film is slapped and ordered to get a hold of themselves.The second is just as affecting and sustains the same narrative and technical structure of the first half. Now, we are moved on to United Flight 93. Again, we know very little about the passengers. We hear bits of conversations. It feels as if we are waiting in the airport terminal with these people who are essentially complete strangers. Luckily, Greengrass makes sure no passenger on the plane is pilot who no longer flies yet somehow must face his fears and (dramatic pause) FLY THE PLANE!!! The franticness with which the passengers band together has a rather vivid feel to it.The conclusion is fairly obvious from the word 'go'. However, Greengrass presents such a compelling portrait we are lost and are near the edge of our seats to view the climax. That brings us to the climax, which is an oddity. It is simultaneously uplifting and sobering.Uplifting and Sobering.Much like the film.The #3 film of 2006.",10,2,4,27 January 2007
In Bruges," Twisted, Hilarious... and They're Filmin' Midgets
","In Bruges {dir. Martin McDonagh} (****/****) Profane, twisted, at points a beautiful travelogue at other times a Boschian nightmare, this film is the best written of the year and probably the most surprising. These reviews tend to lend themselves toward absolute statement so I'll just say it: the funniest film of the year. As with the other fine comedies of the year, the humor comes from the characters and their situations. McDonagh's wit is unmatched and his past as a playwright allow him to craft such ugly, racist and profane ideas into tightly coiled bundles of hilarious dialog. It is completely un-PC, but endlessly watchable and quotable.",10,3,7,12 April 2009
Gravity," Gripping tension and visual splendor. A true movie event.
","Gravity (Cuaron, 2013, A) To my mind, those who knock the script are mostly failing to see the forest for the trees. Problems are there to be sure, but to avoid seeing this would be a regrettable miscalculation. For me, the script worked in a terse, elemental sort of way as it pokes toward transcendent themes that are better evoked through the visual and aural landscape than the dialog. But I think the story elements stand solely because Bullock lifts them on up on her shoulders and ultimately her performance not only deeply impressed me, but moved me. I believe most writers (and I fall squarely within this camp) lack the necessary vocabulary to express the wonder of these visuals. Thankfully, they speak for themselves. Yet, perhaps I am most pleased to find a film, so rare in the current American mega-production model, that is precisely as long as it must be. I can't speculate how this one will age (even four years have not been kind to AVATAR) but for now it is miraculous.Final thought: For a much more eloquent assessment, I suggest you consult MZS's review at RogerEbert.com (www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gravity-2013) or AO Scott at the New York Times.",9,4,7,8 October 2013
Citizen Kane," A Great American Work of Art
","Citizen Kane {dir Orson Welles, 1941}****/****Orson Welles's Citizen Kane has been heralded far and wide as the greatest film ever made. It tops lists released by such reputable establishments as Sight and Sound Magazine and the American Film Institute. Are these showers of praise justified? Who is to say really. The power of Kane lies not with it stature as 'best' anything. It is simply a great American work of art, a cornerstone of popular culture and cinematic craft, a landmark and a classic film. Do not allow those highfalutin descriptions in anyway discourage you from seeing the film. Contrary to what some believe, the film is more than an exercise of style over substance. It is a groundbreaking technical exercise and a sparkling entertainment. That delicate balance between art can best be attributed to producer/writer/director/star Orson Welles, who in his first film uses every visual trick he and cinematographer Gregg Toland can muster (at one point Welles even resorts to making shadow puppets). All the craftsmanship in the world would never be able to take the place of an intriguing story. Welles and his co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz constructed a doozy, a fascinating portrait of a man of almost mythical power. This is the rare film to explore the personality of a tycoon like Kane. Both the performance and the character are wonderfully fleshed out. Charles Foster Kane is charming, tyrannical, lovable, loathsome, yet always distant and enigmatic. That last trait, Kane as an enigma, is a stroke of genius on the film's part. For all the details the film gives us regarding Kane's life, it never supposes that we can draw any final conclusions about the man and his motives. In his portrait of an American dream gone wrong, Welles leaves us with a startling fact: No one man's life can be reduced and crystallized into two hours worth of celluloid. Welles is at once seems to capture a wide breadth of human experience, while also acknowledging that the scenes before as a merely a small part of the whole. But what a joy these small parts are. We are treated to watching Kane's rise and fall beginning as a dashing young turk signing his well-intentioned Declaration of Principles, to a megalomaniacal recluse, living alone in his castle full of useless treasures. Kane's descent is brilliantly visualized. He is consistently shot from a low angle, yet this seemingly dominating stature is increasingly put into a more ironic context. We watch his power wither into desperation.Yet, even in the end, the film never loses Welles's winking sense of humor. With the final reveal of the origin of the term 'Rosebud' (the film's central MacGuffin, as Hitchcock would call it) one can imagine Welles (the consummate magician) exclaiming 'Taa-daa!' with a grand theatrical gesture of the hand. For with this film, Welles establishes himself as the masterful magician of light and shadow. Yet despite all of the light Welles brings, Kane remains a figure of mystery, and a fascinating character. It is that central element of fascination that keeps so many film goers returning to Citizen Kane again and again. That may not be 'best', but its not far off.",10,1,2,1 March 2010
Coraline," A Wonderous Visual Feat!
","Coraline- ****/**** It is ironic that I found a more satisfying experience in terms of pure storytelling craft in a (supposed) children's film, than I do in most films released these days. Henry Selick's Coraline is a dark, stop motion fantasia. The film's roots can be traced back to the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm and the works of Lewis Carroll (as a reconstruction of the fairy tale it recalls the wonderful Pan's Labyrinth), fine company indeed. By essentially reworking Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the film begins with a predictable premise, but creates two separate worlds that are presented in enchanting 3-D.Coraline Jones is a young girl who has recently moved to the Pink Palace, an apartment house inhabited by wild characters. However, Coraline is a bitter little girl, who is constantly feeling ignored by her workaholic parents. While exploring her new house, Coraline encounters a mysterious door leading to an alternate world, where everyone Coraline knows is changed to fit Coraline's image of what they should be. However this quasi- Utopia is revealed to be a much more sinister place than Coraline first thought. Make no mistake, this film belongs to director Henry Selick, who has wrought not one, but two fascinatingly designed worlds, and as the film drives forward Selick continually ups the visual ante, making even the most tired clichés breathe with vibrant, rich life. This is a film with visual wonders to nourish the eye, visuals that follow the story all the way with its darkest implications.Some have taken the film's script to task. Indeed, Coraline may have benefited from the touch of a writer strong enough to match Selick's visual artistry, but as it stands Coraline is competently written, or at least written well enough to render the script a non-issue.When it comes down to it, this is a visual film, as most animated features are. In its own plucky way Coraline is as great an achievement as Pixar's Wall-E. Some have complained that the film could lose ten to fifteen minutes, but I disagree. This is a film that I wish was lengthened, allowing this world to be presented without the machinations of plot. I want to be immersed in these worlds, even as the darkness inches closer.",9,1,3,16 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," It's the best damn setup money can buy!
","'Dead Man's Chest' is one of the years best and most exhilarating blockbusters. A bustling entertainment, pure and simple. The plot is, in the most simplistic terms, not the point. Like a Dashiell Hammett novel it's all about the aura and dialogue. Not to mention characters, trust me the film has MANY of those.But, I'll attempt a brief plot summary. Jack Sparrow owes a debt to the ultra- heavy of the sea, Davy Jones... the payment... his soul, well that or 100 other souls. To slight Davy Jones Jack gets assistance from Will Turner. Little does Jack know Will and his fiancé Elizabeth are being hunted for helping Sparrow, a known pirate escape a grizzly fate. The only way of achieving freedom is retrieving Jack's compass for the evil Lord Beckett. Will gets involved for more than he bargained for and has to battle against Jones at Sparrow's side.Acting wise 'Chest' has nearly no rough patches. Depp brings undeniable comedic energy to Sparrow and though un-recognizable physically, Nighy's Jones is a wonderful villain. Plus, Bloom has seemingly improved since the first outing.The effects are dazzling but that goes without saying. As to the detractors who complain the entire film is setup for number three, I tell you this: It's the best damn setup money can buy!",8,3,8,16 July 2006
Public Enemies," Mann the Director Outclasses Mann the Writer
","Public Enemies {dir. Michael Mann, 2009} ***/****In telling the story of John Dillinger, it would seem that director Michael Mann had found the perfect fit for his personal aesthetic. Dillinger was a man of copious charm, and a taste for fine clothes,yet he was suitably cold blooded and violent when the situation called for it. Mann as a director who has always explored the lives of violent men, from Thief to Collateral, and his films have always looked impeccable However,in the end his new film Public Enemies is not the film it could have been. It ends up a middling Mann film, lacking the urgency of The Insider and the power of Heat (Mann's two best films.) The picture opens auspiciously in 1933, with a thrilling jailbreak by Dillinger, who is introduced in glorious close up, and Johnny Depp playing Dillinger holds that shot like few other actors working. Mann utilizes the closeup to great effect throughout the movie. He and cinematographer Dante Spinotti make great use of the HD technology at their disposal, and they have much of the film resting on the power supplied by those closeups, fortunately Johnny Depp provides an alluring, menacing attractive quality. Later, we meet Dillinger's flame, Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard, very good in what is a poorly developed role) along with the two men in charge of capturing Dillinger, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup in a very solid, multi-faceted performance) and Melvin Purvis (Christan Bale, in another one of the film's underwritten roles.) However, the most intriguing of the G-Men is Stphen Lang's Charles Winstead, the man who would eventually be the one to shoot Dillinger. Mann also name drops Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd, yet none of the peripheral characters are really given enough time or work to be more than quick walk-ons.While this is a film with a number of startling and powerful scenes, it doesn't hang together as a cohesive whole. The audience observes, admires and moves on. I can't think of a film with so many great scenes that left me feeling so cold. But, this is ultimately a good film. It contains strong work by the actors and Cotillard and Depp have add a sexual chemistry to their relationship. I would add the look to the list of things that work in the film. Obviously the costumes were quite excellent and the sets looked wonderful, but the cinematography was stunning. I was entertained by the film, at times enamored purely by the keen visual style on display. Mann seems to bring a new, almost documentarian, approach to the period piece. I only wish he and his fellow writers took those leaps with the script.Although it features a fantastic lead performance from Johnny Depp and stunning HD photography (both of which are the best so far this year), the script needed some serious work. Some characters seem undefined and others (like Christan Bale's Melvin Purvis) are bland clichés. Mann and his fellow screenwriters don't even seem to know what they want to say about Dillinger the man. As a result the film is a vaguely satisfying, at times intoxicating. However, in the end it provides only a sketch of a man who deserves a full, fleshed out portrait.",8,18,37,1 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Popcorn Required
","From the outset of the 'Pirates' franchise, it was obvious that the Walt Disney Company was traveling down a well known path. Not only was the film based on one of Disney's most beloved attractions, it told a reasonably old fashioned Swashbuckle picture. Of course, special effects and insurmountable amounts of eye shadow were thrown in as flavor.The second was high entertainment with more effects and more eye shadow, yet it had lost some of it's wacky charm. The third has returned to form with flying colors. Never has Jack Sparrow been more comically reliable. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner has become a much more believable character. Dead Man's Chest (the second film) left us hanging, on the edge of our seats, craving more. At World's end delivers more and then some. The film details the search to bring Capt. Jack Sparrow (the incomparable Johnny Depp)back from the land of the dead. This requires the assistance of wiley Capt. Barabossa (Geoffery Rush). The film leads to the climactic battle of the Pirate Lords (including Chow Yun Fat as Sao Feng) against the Eas India Trading Company led by malevolent Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who know controls the Flying Dutchman by way of Davy Jones'(Bill Nighy) heart.Follow me? Well, it is irrelevant anyways. The plot of the three films just seems to be some far fetched fantasy to hang sea battles and sword fights on. There is nothing wrong with that. There is so much double crossing and even triple crossing in this film that it could be mistaken for a Pulp rag of the 1950's, were it not for the ships and pirates. The proceedings are, as always, heightened by the glorious talents of Depp and Rush, who play so well together that one wonders what would come of a different film starring both actors where they had the same sort of relationship.At World's End is 168 minutes of non stop visual splendor, not once did I check the clock in boredom. That's something I couldn't say about Dead Man's Chest, which is 18 minutes shorter.However, I think the biggest and most deserved praise I could give this film is that it most certainly makes the popcorn taste better.",8,1,2,19 July 2007
Milk," Perhaps the finest cinematic biography...
","Milk {dir. Gus Van Sant} (****/****) I cannot organize my thought into a concise form to fully express how moving this movie is. Suffice to say it ranks with Million Dollar Baby and Lost in Translation as one of the most moving films of the decade. Really just a revelation. Masterful direction, strong writing combine with perhaps the best work of Sean Penn's career. However, the film is far from a one man show, containing fine performances from James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch, and especially Alison Pill as Milk's campaign manager. Transcends mere biopic-ery. More than the 'gay politician' film, but a chronicle of a movement.",10,0,2,12 April 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," 'Gothic Fantasy and Horror at it's Finest'
","'Pan's Labyrinth', the newest film from Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro, is the most beautiful and moving films of the year. This film will leave you with a memory that will probably last the rest of your life. In the landscape of current film there are so many films that seem to vanish from your mind as the end credits roll. 'Pan' is certainly NOT one of those films. It's a welcome breath of fresh air and a marvel to behold.The film tells the story of young Ofelia, whose father has recently died in the Spanish Civil War. Her pregnant mother, Caremen, has married again. Her suitor is the incredibly vicious and despicable Captain Vidal.To escape the harsh realities of her life, Ofelia falls deep into a world of fantasy. Here she meets a faun who tells her the story of a young princess who's soul was taken from the fantasy world and put into the real world. It's the faun's belief that her soul rests in Ofelia. To prove her worthiness, Ofelia must complete three tasks. One of these tasks envolves facing The Pale Man. Those who have seen this creature will most certainly never forget him.Back in the real world, a housekeeper and personal doctor who work for the captain, are sneaking supplies to the nearest rebels. This could cost them their lives at the cruel hands of Captain Vidal.'Pan's Labyrinth' is a film so richly textured and beautifully made that it holds a huge requirement for repeat viewings. The film presents a world so vivid you loose your sense of place and are engulfed inside a world of alternating fantasy and reality. For two hours, this is the only world you know. You are transported. Every detail and nuance is nailed by the people behind the scenes.Though the film has many noteworthy performances, I will single out Sergi Lopez, whose portrayal of Captain Vidal has many critics drawing comparisons to Ralph Finnes in 'Schindler's List'. That comparison is extremely apt. Lopez is fittingly calm in his brutality. This film has many critics raving and slapping the term 'Masterpeice!' on to their reviews. It is, in this case, one of the few terms that can justifiably describe the vivid beauty that is 'Pan's Labyrinth'!The #2 Film of 2006.",10,2,4,27 January 2007
The Polar Express," An Enthralling Holiday Experience
","THE POLAR EXPRESS tells the story of a boy who's lost all faith in Santa, but, is thrusted into a magical world where 'seeing is believing.' Though it may take a few viewings, this film is some very good material. It took me a grand total of 3 times to truly absorb it all. It's not confusing... it's all just so... curious. A ghost bum on a train, show stopping musical numbers and possibly creepy animation ; how does all of this fit into the picture book narrative of Chris Van Allsburg's picture book? Don't ask me but in the hands of Zemeckis and Hanks it all seems to gel into an enthralling holiday experience.",9,1,4,12 December 2004
Closer," A Well Acted, well made Cynical Romance
","It has been 41 years since Mike Nichols made his highly acclaimed relationship drama 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' At the time of its release, that film was considered scandalous for it use of foul language. Today, it still retains all of its power yet seems relatively tame.This is not to say that Nichols has lost his touch for drama or conflicts within relationships. His newest film, 'Closer' is one of his best films to date (fairly impressive considering he made 'The Graduate') It tells the story of four singles living in London.Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer who is recently divorced. Roberts gives a very strong performance, however it is hard to handle hearing America's sweetheart (A.K.A. 'Our Pretty Woman') speak so freely about certain sexual activities. She is hired to take Dan's (Jude Law) photograph for a book jacket. Dan is a journalist by trade (He writes obituaries.) the photo however is for his book that has a chance at being published. The book was inspired by Dan's current flame Alice (Natalie Portman) a gal who never lets you get too close to the person inside. Dan is attracted to Anna, but is met with a flat rejection.Posing as Anna in an online sex chatroom (good thing the little kids cannot read) Dan unknowingly sets up Anna with Dr. Larry (Clive Owen). The foursome form some sort of weird spiral whereby they are constantly changing their partners.The cast is excellent without exception. Oddly enough, the best pair of performances do not belong to the two megastars in the cast (Roberts & Law), Portman strikes every note perfectly. We are not sure that we know enough about Alice and Portman performance suggests we never will. As for Clive Owen, he is absolutely merciless, as Larry we somehow come to fear him. He has a looming presence without even standing up. He holds your attention, it's a violent performance. Not in the physical sense, Larry uses words, sharp words, to get what he wants. Owen was without a doubt Oscar worthy, to bad they threw Morgan Freeman his well deserved bone.The writing is pitch perfect ammunition for the cast to unload on the audience. The screenplay was written by Patrick Marber based on his play and it is some of the best writing for film in the last 10 years.Nichols still has the chops and audacity to stay current and this film was as unsettling to me as 'Virginia Woolf' or 'Carnal Knoweledge' must have been back in the 60's and early 70's. Nichols can still bring the heat.",8,1,1,28 June 2007
American Hustle," Slapdash, but fiercely entertaining
","American Hustle (O. Russell, 2013, B) Here's an endlessly likable, shaggy, fizzy cartoon of a picture. The acting is so good here that it makes up for the lumpiness of the screenplay. It's lifeless for the first 20 minutes or so, working at an energy level that doesn't really grab the audience. Then, once thing starts cooking, it zigs and zags into various moments of suspense and lunacy to varying degrees of success. I'm convinced this is the best Cooper has ever been; his scenes with Louis CK are all direct hits. Lawrence is purposefully obnoxious (although the inter-cutting of her crooning 'Live and Let Die' with Bale's situation feels forced and falls flat). Bale is strong as usual. The most revealing aspect of his performance is that he still has a sense of humor, thank God. Perhaps the finest here, though, is Adams who takes a manic character and steers it toward the believable. As an expression of her range and ability, it's a total star turn.I dunno if I can say this is a very good film, though. There's something in the script's messiness that's at once too apparent in the film, but also crucially missing in the aesthetic. It's slapdash, but not in any meaningful way. Still it's fiercely entertaining and the first O. Russell film I've really enjoyed since THREE KINGS. That's worth something.",5,0,3,11 January 2014
Watchmen," A Top Notch Picture
","Watchmen {dir. Zack Snyder, 2009} (****/****) Although it loses some luster upon second viewing, Watchmen remains a top-notch movie. It is strictly loyal to the source, and actually improves upon the ending. (Sorry squid-lovers!) Yes, the sex scene is gratuitous, but I'll give Snyder room to take one false move when the rest of the film is this good. Beautiful to look at and interestingly plotted, Watchmen resembles Kubrick in the way it seems game to go against every rule of the comic book genre. Needless to say, we are a long way away from the mindless antics of Daredevil or Ghost Rider. This blockbuster has a brain to match its brawn.",8,5,11,5 April 2009
The Village," 'M. Night Shymalan sells his film soul for the twistless twist'
","What can one say about M. Night Shymalan? Perhaps, 'Wow I never saw that coming!' or 'Jeez! That was completely OBVIOUS!'. He basically had no grey shades. You love him or hate him... I was a lot closer to hate from the beginning.If what I say is true and I do hate him than why to I continuously give his films a chance? Perhaps it's the pedigree of his actors (Mel Gibson. Sam Jackson, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, recently Paul Giamatti.) But I'm thinking it's his uncanny ability of creating an interesting premise... unfortunately his talent goes limp from there. The story of 'The Village' centers around just that: A village. Run by a council known as the elders, the town is constrained to a wooded boundary, outside of which there lie 'Those Who Shall Not Be Spoken Of' who run around in red robes.Soon, the plucky blind girl of the town must venture past the woods to another town. WHY? Her lover is sick and she's going to get better medicines. First, however, she must have something revealed about not only the town, but also about what lies beyond the village. This is a film where every performance is lackluster and every word is less believable than the next. It's one of the worst films in recent memory.",1,12,25,9 December 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Half of a masterpiece
","There is a pervading sense of doom in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I. A dark pall is cast over the entire production; even the opening Warner Brother's logo begins to crackle and rust. Harry and his chums encounter their most trying hardships and are forced to face numerous deaths. For a children's fantasy, the first leg of the final chapter shaped up to be fairly dark, and that's hardly a fault. This is the path that all of the other Potter films have led up to, lending the doom a sense of importance. The doom must be there to make the ultimate ending worthwhile. Yet for all the death and destruction, Deathly Hallows never shies away from moments of touching levity. The film allows the major players moments of tender interaction and light comedy. The fact that these bits actually succeed is a testament to the greatly improved abilities of the three principle actors. Director David Yates has broken from the typical Potter tradition of stately, big budget directorial technique and has thrown in splashes of a more kinetic style with a few well-placed, subtle moments of hand-held photography that make Deathly Hallows seem fresher than a few of its predecessors. Another first: a completely animated sequence. It is an audacious move and it pays dividends. The sequence (detailing the story of the titular Deathly Hallows) is among the finest moments the series has to offer. It is a frightening and beautiful mixture of shadow-play and stop-motion. One of the film's major assets is its rouge's gallery of uniformly detestable villains. I can think of few characters or actors that can generate the vitriolic response I have when seeing Imelda Staunton in the role of Dolores Umbridge. Joining her are the usual suspects: Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius and Draco Malfoy. These baddies add a real sense of purpose to the proceedings; evil seems to emanate from their very cores. Yet, to the film's key strength is its acknowledgment of the previous chapters. I felt twinges of melancholy while watching Harry look at his old bedroom below the stairs of the house on Privet Drive, and that speaks to the series' successful attempts at fleshing out the inner lives of these characters and this world. For a major blockbuster, this is a fairly emotional ride.Deathly Hollows, however, is not without imperfections. The tail end of the second act is a bit saggy, and some of the character behaviors seem contrived. I'm looking at you, Ron Weasley. Also, the film seems to be in a state of perpetual build up to part two. As such, I cannot adequately comment on where I'd place it in relation to the other films. But, as it stands, Deathly Hallows is poised to become the crowning jewel of an already distinguished series of films.",10,1,2,21 November 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," 'An Uplifting Family Film With Wonderful Bite'
","I'm sure by now you've all heard about 'Little Miss Sunshine', about its hilarious band of misfits otherwise known as the Hoover family, and of course about the plucky charm of 10 year old Abigail Breslin as would be beauty pageant queen Olive Hoover. The film has been praised by many critics as the best comedy in years. I'd say that's a fairly accurate judgment. This may not be the funniest film of the year (Borat!) or the most affecting (United 93) it's one of the most enjoyable films perhaps ever.The story centers around the Hoover family: Richard (Motivational Speaker/Father) Sheryl ('Pro Honesty' Mother) Grandpa (A heroin addict who's been kicked out of his retirement home) Dwayne (He has taken a vow of silence until he becomes a pilot.. and because of Nietzsche) and Uncle Frank (A suicidal gay Proust scholar who's lost his job and lover). And, of course Olive. Together this rag tag band embarks on a trip for California in a beat up VW bus. The group goal: Get Olive to the 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty contest. Along the way the family encounters many mishaps while receiving many of Grandpa's pearls of wisdom ('Fuck a lot a' women kid. Not just one woman... a lot a' women). The humor however never seemed forced or random. All the behavior somehow seem appropriate inside the confines of each character and their personalities.The entire cast is superb, without exception. Newcomer Abigail Bresin is quite the find as young Olive. Her performance deserves to be mentioned along with Tatum O'Neal and Anna Paquin as young Oscar hopefuls. However, the film isn't just stolen by, it is OWNED by Alan Arkin as the radical old Grandpa. It's a well written part especially for an 'actor's actor' like Arkin. As an audience we enjoy seeing him as the self described 'voice of experience'.With a sharp script and capable actors 'Little Miss Sunshine' arrives as one of this year's best and brightest films. It is also a film that will be able to survive multiple viewings due to comedic pacing and all around charm. Without a doubt, one of the year's best!",8,1,3,27 January 2007
American Beauty," look closer
","A beautiful piece of work by first time director Sam Mendes. Easily one of the most accomplished film debuts in the history of cinema. The story centers around a man named Lester Burnham (the wonderful Oscar winning Kevin Spacey) a man who has lost passion in his life. His wife Caroline (Annette Benning in an equally stunning performance) is a workaholic real estate agent. Both are frustrated with their marriage which is basically just for show. Sexually frustrated Lest lusts for one of his daughter's (Thora Birch) girlfriends,Anglea (Menna Suvari). This lust begins Lester's search for happiness in life, so he quits his job and begins to flip burgers just like when he was a kid.

Spirited Away," A Film of Rich, Breathtaking Vitality.
","Spirited Away {dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 2002} ****/**** This is the first Miyazaki I've seen, and suffice to say the man made one hell of a first impression! The story is equal parts Wonderland and Oz, also incorporating numerous tropes of classic fantasy. Yet the story and the entire film feel unusual in their completeness, in their immersive quality and breathtaking majesty. Visually, this is one of the finest films of the decade. A great move rich with characters, ideas and most importantly life. Each frame of this picture jumps off the screen and inhabits the viewer's subconscious, imprinting images that will last for a lifetime. It contains rich characters, an enchanting and slightly off center world, along with a thankful lack of moralizing. Like the best childhood parables, Spirited Away has the capacity to frighten, enchant, and most importantly entertain audiences from any culture in any language.",10,0,0,18 June 2009
Bridesmaids," Ticks like a clock
","Movie critics are supposed to be the ultimate arbiters of cinematic taste. The stereotypical image of critic is one of a dead-eyed, cynical intellectual, looking down his nose at the mere trifles before him. This is the image I have to live up to: high-minded, snooty, and highfalutin. So, what can I do with something like Bridesmaids, a film so decidedly low class, brimming with fart jokes, innuendo, and other aberrations? Well, if the experience of seeing it proves anything, all I can do is laugh breathlessly and wonder when the barrage of laughter will stop. In the case of Bridesmaids, it never stops. Here is a movie you watch twice â€“ first because it's good, and then again to hear all the lines you missed because you were laughing breathlessly at the previous exchange. The film begins with Annie (Kristen Wiig), a failed baker who is drifting aimlessly through her life. She's continuously late with her rent; she habitually hooks up with a man who treats her like an appliance, and (to make matters even worse) her best friend is about to get married. Bride-to-be Lillian (Maya Rudolph) enlists Annie as her maid of honor. The inevitable hi-jinks ensue as we meet the rest of the bridesmaids: repressed Rita, innocent Becca, perfectionist Helen, and the sturdy Megan. Take this rag-tag group, a churrascaria, and a posh bridal salon, and you'll get one of the most revolting, hysterical scenes in any comedy. At its base, Bridesmaids is a comedy of embarrassment, rooted in the steady decline of Annie as she descends into jealousy. The script (written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo) is incredibly knowledgeable about the dynamics of female relationships, culling out every possible chuckle and guffaw. The film is Kristen Wiig's bed for comedy stardom, and she succeeds without reservation, effortlessly toggling between the comedic and dramatic notes. Yet to say the film belongs solely to Wiig does the rest of the cast and crew a major disservice. The ensemble is flawless, and the direction unobtrusive. Timing is everything in comedy, and Bridesmaids ticks like a clock. I'll be shocked if there's a better mainstream comedy released this year. Is Bridesmaids derivative of The Hangover? Yes. But on a character to character level it surpasses that film, presenting likable, three- dimensional characters played by outstanding actresses. What makes Bridesmaids so refreshing is the fact that every one of its gross-out gags is rooted in the truth of central friendship between the main characters. High or low brow, that's worth celebrating.",10,2,6,26 May 2011
Gone Girl," A twisting and twisted popular entertainment
","Full disclosure: I've read the book and think this is more than a cracking adaptation-- It's a near total improvement across the board. That said, I became so caught up with the shape of the adaptation that a second viewing will better clarify the meanings at work.What GONE GIRL is about more than mystery, misogyny, money, or any other m-word: If you think you have 'truth' on your side, you're clueless. I spent so much of it grinning from ear to ear. The humor is as pitch black as you've heard, with one punchline near the end that's way too easy (you'll know it when you hear it). But still, Fincher's in fine form; he and editor Kirk Baxter massage the 2.5 hour runtime into a steadily compelling thriller. Affleck and Pike are both excellent, each walking the emotional razor's edge that Fincher and writer Flynn have established for them. The script is a marvelous adaptation in the sense that it keeps so much of Flynn's original text and improving on it in more than a few cases. Still, if there's a reason GONE GIRL can occasionally strike its points a little too explicitly it can be linked to the script. These instances are few and far between, however. The lasting impression of GONE GIRL is that it's a twisting and twisted popular entertainment likely to see few equals on American cineplex screens this year.",10,1,12,6 October 2014
Across the Universe," Slow Acting Poison
","Across the Universe {dir. Julie Taymor, 2007} (*/****)I've never been one to bury the lead, so let me tell you straight away, I hated this movie with a passion. The more I think about it the more I'm enraged, even offended, by this film. It is an attempt to weave the songbook of the immortal rock band The Beatles into a grand, romantic, cinematic spectacle. Its production design and narrative conceit are at times engaging but only in the smallest of fits. Suffice to say the bad outweighs the good; the treacle drowns the sublime. It contains good songs, well sung by capable actors (all of whom are given types not characters) but its soul is so hollow that it can only rely on its naive intentions. The simplistic attempts at establishing time and place are ham fisted and cloying. The 1960's were a complex time; the decade brought about social upheaval along with revolutionary ideas regarding music art and cinema, yet if one were to judge the period by this film they would come out with a completely positive and simple message: peace and love conquered all. That is simply not the case; the hippies goals were ultimately unrealized, that is the sad truth. As for incorporation of songs, Taymor's methods are flimsy (a character named Prudence is there specifically for the song 'Dear Prudence' to appear)and its entertainment value low. The more I consider this film, the more it enrages me and its been a few weeks since I've seen it. Get back, JoJo!",4,2,4,30 January 2009
Gran Torino," Shockingly Sloppy film from an Un-Characteristically Lazy Eastwood
","Gran Torino {dir. Clint Eastwood, 2008}*1/2/****Let me preface my comments by saying, I am not here to rally against this film nor am I someone who detests the work of Clint Eastwood (I count both Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven as two masterpieces of cinema). I was expecting to love Gran Torino, due to its impressive rating here on IMDb and its fairly positive critical notices, however, I found this film quite clumsy in its execution. Most of this is a direct result of an shoddy, inept script. This is not a situation of bad dialog (to the contrary, Eastwood gets the occasional stinging one- liner) but rather, of senseless construction and little care in story arcs and plotting. The film seems unsure if it wants to be a coming of age drama, wherein the crusty, set in his ways Eastwood learns a life changing lesson or if it wants to be Dirty Harry 6. In the end, the film is neither and is instead a jumble of both, and while there are some interesting moments within the two stories, every time the audience settles into the film's rhythm, the focus shifts top the other story. The film eschews character motivation in favor of crass sentimentality, and suffers from split personality in the closing moments. At his directorial best, Eastwood can bring subtle and delicate nuance to rather stereotypical situations, here his work seems shoddy and just plain lazy. Revelations are rendered unrevealing and due to the lack of care taken in characterization, the ending has little cumulative impact. Were it not for Eastwood's sheer magnetism as an actor, the entire thing would be a disaster. As it stands, this film is a wholly minor work in Eastwood's filmography and a completely unsatisfying experience.",4,16,26,6 January 2010
Moulin Rouge!," Baz Luhrmann: 3 Parts Busby Berkeley, 7 Parts P.T. Barnum
","Moulin Rouge! {Dir. Baz Luhrmann, 2001}****/****While he may not be the next Kubrick, it hard to deny that director Baz Luhrmann is an exceedingly capable showman. He throws as many striking images on the screen as an audience can handle; sometimes at expense of story and character. Here, Luhrmann achieves what some may have thought impossible: constant cinematic exhilaration. While he has many weaknesses as a director, (namely his penchant toward melodrama and bombast) all of his cinematic traits meld together here to form a masterpiece that is essentially a glorious mish-mash of all aspects of 20-th century culture. Here you have the elements of classical opera, early stage melodrama, swooning love songs and the incessantly moving camera that seems to guide the MTV-generation through life put into a blender. While every inclination I have would regard this premise with hesitation, the result is positively intoxicating. A miracle of a movie!",10,0,2,2 November 2009
Jurassic World," Little life finds its way into this lousy sequel
","Remember the scene in the original Jurassic Park where the lawyer gets eaten while cowering on the toilet? Of course you do. It's a fun little moment. But it's also an easy joke and a sour, callous moment in a film that otherwise is pretty respectful of the life and death stakes at play in its scenario. Well, the makers of Jurassic World, mad little scientists of cinema that they are, take all the narrative DNA of the original film they can get their mitts on and pump in a whole lot of the toilet scene DNA to fill gaps in the chain and beef it up to modern standards. The resulting film is occasionally enjoyable on the lowest level of sensation, but mostly an onerous exercise in empty spectacle devoid of wit or humanity.Despite the lip service this pays to Spielberg's comparably towering original, this new dino epic inverts nearly every element that made the first entry work so well and endure to this day. Chief among this is the original film's absolute love of science. Yes, the ultimate message is the danger of science overstepping its boundaries, but our main characters were two paleontologists and a mathematician. Here we must settle for Chris Pratt's ex-Navy man (I never thought a film could put me in the position of finding Chris Pratt unlikeable, but here we are) and a host of faceless paramilitary jug-heads. The strain of militarism runs deeply in the film (despite its pretensions otherwise) and combined with a general lack of humanity forcing me to the point of outright rooting for every human to be gobbled up whole and never heard from again.Colin Trevorrow, likely in a misguided attempt to apologize for not being Spielberg, throws limp dick semi-satire all around the periphery to no real avail. It's telling that this film cues up John Williams iconic theme with shots of a theme park thoroughfare dotted with corporate logos. Hey, Starbucks. 'Sup, Brookstone. Hiya, Samsung. Hang loose, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville. For all its hip po-mo posturing, this is an oppressively imagination-free affair, a sponsored dinosaur of a film, Comcast/NBC/Universal Pictures Presents Nostalgia Tinged Blockbuster 2015.In his 1993 review of Jurassic Park, Ebert lamented that film's lack of awe and wonder. Perhaps he was right, but there was genuine terror and at least a cursory streak of humanity. The only such sensations dredged up by Jurassic World are a blood-thirsty cackle here and there. The problem isn't that the film appeals to our most base instincts, it's that it fails to satisfy them fully.",4,5,13,17 June 2015
The Hangover Part II," Has its moments, but lacks the chemistry of the original
","The anticipation surrounding the release of The Hangover Part Two has been palpable. Benefitting from the surprise blockbuster success of its predecessor and a recent legal kerfuffle, Part Two is poised as one of the year's biggest films. The midnight crowd was abuzz with excitement, they didn't just come to see the movie, they came to love the movie.This is perhaps why I felt such disconnect while watching the film. I'm someone who enjoyed the original Hangover, yet I took issue with the sometimes detestable characters and their dirty deeds. It seemed that some of the events were structured as random, easy laughs as opposed to being the result of the film's comedic momentum. I laughed, I actually laughed quite frequently. Yet, I could not quite join the chorus of celebration.Nevertheless, there I was surrounded by people laughing themselves into a stupor. Couldn't they see what was happening? They were watching the same movie that they had quoted endlessly since 2009. This is a sequel that commits the cardinal sin of all sequels; it repeats the story of the original film.This is the paragraph where I'd usually launch into some basic summary, but honestly, if you're interested enough in this movie to read this article, then you've seen the first film. If you seen the first film, congratulations! You know every basic plot point of The Hangover Part Two. Zack Galifinakis once again steals the film as the destructive man- child Alan. Like everything else in this film, Alan's boorishness is cranked up to eleven. I'd assume all this hullabaloo constitutes the filmmakers' attempts to disguise the completely derivative storyline. In all fairness, I did laugh more during 'The Hangover Part Two' than I would at an average raunch-fest. However, the chemistry too often feels stale, as if the cast is still exhausted from making the first film. Occasionally they manages to recapture the spark that made the original so popular. Yet, when viewed in context of its predecessor this Hangover is easy to shake.",4,5,12,26 May 2011

","The Dark Knight {dir. Christopher Nolan} (****/****) A big, loud and surprisingly thoughtful blockbuster...as the best film of the year? I know a Batman film is truly the year's best. It is more than a financial success, it is a reconstruction of a tired genre featuring an already iconic performance from a dearly departed actor. This film deserves praise for elevating the superhero picture to a realm of academic dissection and moral and thematic discussion. Seeing The Dark Knight on opening day was an experience to remember.

Agent. Neeson daughter is kidnapped whilst vacationing with a friend in France and it falls to Neeson to get her back. The film's best scene comes early with Neeson addressing the kidnappers over the phone, and warning them that they are unaware of with whom they are messing. He, of course, phrases it differently and speaks with a steely reserve that is quite effective.

","Up {dir. Pete Docter, 2009} ****/**** Pixar's Up is the best film of the year so far, by far. In telling a simple adventure story, they cover ground that they had yet to cover before. Both the humor and heartbreak of the film seem completely more mature than any of Pixar's previous works. The film is perfectly paced and structured in a very careful way to allow each moment to have a satisfying and slightly surprising. Pixar continues to amaze not only with their technical bravado, but with their thematic courage. Up is definitely in the uppermost echelon of their work, a hilarious, and in turns heartbreaking, work of great magnitude and power. Visually the film is rich and thrilling and emotionally it is satisfying. I cannot wait to see it again!",10,2,4,8 June 2009
Love & Mercy," One of the absolute treasures of 2015
","Let's start with some honesty, shall we? I came into this wanting it to be amazing. I think Brian Wilson is one of the few true American musical geniuses, a pop pioneer with an ageless sensibility. I wanted it to be amazing, but had my doubts. Dano and Cusack are odd casting to say the least and the biopic genre has all sorts of pitfalls baked right into its very formulas. Therefore, all the excitement leading into Love & Mercy was tempered by an equal if not greater dose of apprehension (this sort of confused cocktail will be even worse once The End of the Tour drops). Now, the film has been playing for well over a month and here I am just getting around to it.Two hours later and any doubts or apprehension I had has been wiped away. Love & Mercy is the best possible screen version of Wilson's life story that I can imagine, even more than I had hoped for. But, more importantly, it's a remarkably well-made film-- lively, smart, and thoughtful. This is director Pohlad's first major film after making a career bankrolling films for the likes of Terrence Malick and Robert Altman. He distinguishes himself with his directorial work here, offering a series of perfectly judged scenes coalescing into an immensely satisfying portrait.Nearly every gambit pays off. The hopscotch structure of Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner's delicately observed script energizes the film and lend it a harmonic musicality, complete with counterpoint and occasional dissonance.John Cusack does his best work in a long time and Dano does his best work ever put to film. 1980s Wilson is both a quintessential Cusack hero-- a quirky romantic out of place in the world-- but with added layers, a softness and hesitance previously seldom used in his arsenal. What he lacks in immediate resemblance Cusack makes up for with physicality, creating a character by modulating his entire body. You can trace Wilson's arch by only paying attention to Cusack's eyes in each of his scenes. Back in the 1960s, Dano embodies Wilson's overflowing sonic imagination as well as his deep internal demons. I've felt Dano to be out of place in every other movie he's been in, but like Cusack he disappears here, falling into Brian's passionate drive. Together the two create a performance of absolute humanity.Banks is given her meatiest role in a while and Giamatti returns to the screen with typical vigor. Both giving performances that provide complex and unexpected shading to characters whose outlines are familiar, but whose particulars ring true. The same goes for Bill Camp who gives Murray Wilson, the domineering father and erstwhile manager of The Beach Boys, rich psychological dimension with a bare minimum of screen time. His malignant presence lingers over the film just as it did over Brian's life.Yet the sound is the real star here. Whether its the actual music of Wilson and the Beach Boys or the adapted and interweaved score-- AO Scott more accurately termed it a series of sonic collages-- by Atticus Ross, this film uses sound as well as anything this year.The true achievement of Love & Mercy is the way it continually finds cinematic counterparts to the experience of listening to Wilson's best work. In that sense, it is as much a tribute to the act of listening to the artist's music as it is to the creation of that music. Indeed, this is one of the few films to ever make the act of hearing so vividly and gloriously cinematic, particularly when that act consists of a woman hearing a lonely, sad, frightened man's plaintive cries for help and responds with compassion.",10,2,4,3 July 2015
Titanic," Only to be Idolized by Starry Eyed Tweens
","Titanic {dir. James Cameron, 1997} (*½/****)Somewhere on its way to becoming the all time box office champion and biggest Oscar winner of all time, James Cameron's Titanic etched out a place in my mind as the one film that can most easily send me into a frenzied rant against the dangers of big- budget, epic film making. Sure, I might not have put it that way when I first saw it (I was seven) but, upon first viewing I knew that this film was nothing special. Four years later, I was able to identify it as simply money thrown onto the screen with little room left for intelligence, emotion or character. Yet even as I professed the evils of this production and its vapid screenplay (penned by director Cameron), there were those who maintained that Titanic was an achievement. Among those people are esteemed film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , both of whom included it on their top ten lists of 1997. Those celebratory citations led me to revisit Titanic again recently, for the first time on DVD, a disc which preserves the film's original aspect ratio and presents the clearest available picture and sound. The Verdict: As the old truism goes, 'You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.'The film isn't all bad; the cast is solid (considering the material..but more on that later), the score is rich, the cinematography is evocative and the production design and visual effects are impeccable. Yet as it turns out, all these elements do not a great film make. Titanic's greatest weakness lies at its very core: the screenplay. It reaches a level so wretched that I will be blunt in my metaphoric criticism. Cameron's script isn't just a turd, it is a floater; it refuses to just be flushed away to haunt us no longer. It insists on having an epic length and employing a framing device that may very well be the cause of a sudden onset of narcolepsy. I'm sorry to resort to such infantile comparison, but I believe that is best to convey the utter insult that is Cameron's screenplay. I consider myself a romantic, yet the so-called romance of this film left me cold, with nothing to do except roll my eyes. The film lacks any new vision or originality, and that can never be commended. I'm fed up at this point; three viewing, each one revealing an un-plundered area of Cameron's incompetence. This film remains an interminable, and wildly popular, mash of tired formula only be idolized by starry eyed tweens.",5,7,13,25 July 2007
The Departed," 'A Director going back to the bloody basics'
","'The Departed', the newest Martin Scorsese picture, is his best since 'Goodfellas'. It's the classic Marty fusion of character, music and lots and lots of blood. It's possibly the year's most engaging and entertaining film.Billy Costigan is a new Boston police cadet. Once passing training he goes undercover to infiltrate the operations of Mob kingpin, Frank Costello. Costigan utilizes his past familial connections through his crook of an uncle.Collin Sullivan is also a rising cop. He had a rough childhood, until Frank Costello buys the family some groceries. This brings him into a world much like the one of the young Henry Hill in 'Goodfellas'. When the boss finds that the Sullivan kid's in with the cops, he knows where to get his information and get it regularly. When each group finds that the other has a mole in on their operation, they all try to decipher who's the rat. It's the highest order of the game of Cat and Mouse.The performances are stellar all around, with Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmgia and Mark Whalberg giving able support to the three principals: DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson. Baldwin and Whalberg provide many laughs with the latter giving his best performance. Nicholson, in his scenery chewing glory, shouldn't be forgotten come Oscar night. DiCaprio creates a fully developed character with great success. Damon is at his best and Vera Farmiga is a wonderful as Damon's lover and DiCaprio's therapist.The Direction is crisp and hopefully will capture Martin Scorsese his (long) overdue Oscar. Nothing I can say can do service to the wonder that is 'The Departed', possibly the year's best film!",9,1,3,9 December 2006
Psycho," Dares You to Look Away
","Although his filmography is studded with gems, no other Hitchcock film has lodged itself in the popular consciousness as firmly as Psycho. It provides chills as a ripped-from-the- headlines slasher flick, but its macabre surfaces conceal its deeper mordant cultural resonances. In Psycho, many of Hitchcock's major tactics fall under the wide umbrella of postmodernism. Although made within the confines of the last vestiges of the classic Hollywood studio system, Psycho distinguishes itself as a subversive postmodern cinematic text. Hitchcock's is the dominating presence in the film. From the beginning we are privy to dastardly deeds done by less-than-savory people. Yet, even as the brutality is ratcheted up (culminating in Marion's death), the audience remains engaged and more specifically entertained. The traditionally positive and pure elements of society when viewed through Hitchcock's lens are rendered resoundingly impure. Caroline, Marion's pestering co-worker, needed tranquilizers to survive her own wedding; Tom Cassidy heartily recommends the practice of 'buying off unhappiness' to turn it into something approaching happiness; police and detectives fail to provide satisfactory protection; and in the Bates family one certainly begins to doubt that mother knows best. This is contrasted to the immoralities within the film. Sam and Marion's affair, Marion's theft, and Norman's killings are, without exception, attractively presented. The affair titillates, turning Marion into an erotic symbol. By the time of the theft, Marion has won the allegiance of the audience. Even the film's most legendary element, the shower scene, can today be viewed as more giddy than gory. It plays more as symphony than tragedy. It is a feat of timing and rhythm with precise and effective choreography. Traditional horror films dare the audience to look at the screen; Psycho dares us to look away and we simply cannot. The film itself defies convention and flaunts expectations at every turn. At the end of the first act, it abruptly transfers the mantle of protagonist from Marion Crane to Norman Bates. The transfer makes sense. After all, these are the only two characters in the film that truly matter. In the words of critic David Thomson, 'they are the only two players in the film whom Hitchcock liked or was interested in'. As a mainstream Hollywood director, Hitchcock's interest in these two people, one a thief, the other a psychologically fractured killer is in and of itself subversive of audience expectations. Psycho was released in mid-1960 still very much in the shadow of the outwardly wholesome, domesticated Eisenhower era. To have a film focused on such behavior in the era of Leave it to Beaver was not only bold, it was unprecedented in mainstream American cinema. Psycho's low-rent aesthetic of highway towns and motel rooms is unique in the typically more elaborate and glamorous Hitchcock oeuvre. In an era when films were bought and sold based on star power, Hitchcock bumps off poor Janet Leigh (herself only a moderate star at the time) by the close of the first act. Audiences thought they knew what they could expect from the movies, especially the ones made by 'Master of Suspense' Alfred Hitchcock; but the moment that shower curtain opens to the ascending strings of Bernard Herrmann's score, all bets are off. No one and nothing is safe, not even the lifestyles of the rich and famous.Apart from its more coy and wily elements, Psycho is also a film preoccupied with surfaces and appearances. By virtue of the funhouse construction of the film, Hitchcock cannot be bothered with traditional character development. The four major characters of the piece— Norman, Marion, Sam, and Lila— act as doubles for one another. In Lila, we find traces of Marion. Both are traditionally attractive blondes, yet the sexual vivacity of Marion that her screen time so effectively showcases is dulled and diluted within Lila, who can seem pestering and frumpy in comparison. These parallels perhaps could be written off due to the sister relationship between the two, except that the more interesting parallels between Sam and Norman undermine any sort of quick fix. Norman and Sam share a similar facial structure and hair color. Clearly, Sam is meant to represent the more stereotypically strapping male suitor, whereas Norman is best characterized as meek and uncertain. Yet, throughout the film our impressions of the two men are colored in surprising ways. Norman, despite his compulsions, comes off as a caring and compassionate young man, shy but capable of deep and true understanding. Hitchcock, in a move of swift and delicious irony, makes Norman into the most sensitive and kind person the picture has to offer. Norman's final conversation with Marion before her death is the film's most intimate scene. Although the two start the scene as total strangers, it is clear that they have had a deep effect on one another by the scene's close. In contrast, Sam seems increasingly boorish and bullying as the picture unspools. He's certainly less interesting than Norman. Indeed, we learn precious little regarding Sam in the movie's first half. Despite her claims of love, Marion spends relatively little time considering Sam's views of her actions. His hypothetical thoughts never enter her mind on the run from Phoenix. Her deepest emotional connection in the film is with Norman, and Sam seems to share a more matrimonial relationship with Lila than he does with Marion. Yet, in their momentary connection, Marion and Norman shared something more lively and meaningful than Sam seems to be capable of imagining. This lively connection, of course, must end in death in Hitchcock's world. Hitchcock, ever the ironist.Psycho's endurance as a piece of popular art is quite a feat. In fact, the very existence of the film is worth championing. It is a film where commercial aims exist in equal balance to artistic ambitions, where those goals are allowed to be complimentary. It holds a mirror to a polluted world in order to reveal the cracks in the surface, an impure subject made enthralling through pure cinema.",10,0,0,21 April 2012
Vanilla Sky," Crowe's Stylistic Apex
","It begins with sweeping overhead shots of a New York City slowly succumbing to the chill of late fall. As the camera moves closer, it seems to blink and on the soundtrack we hear the first dialog of the film. 'Open your eyes' followed by the foreboding tones of Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place.The opening of Vanilla Sky immediately begins to separate itself from every film in Cameron Crowe's cannon. This is a film of delicate construction and careful planning.The setup is simple enough: young playboy David Aames (Tom Cruise) is on top of the world. He has inherited control of all three of his father's magazines, and all the other 'keys to the kingdom'. David can have any woman he wants, including his personal friend with 'benefits' Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), however he is caught off guard when he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz). They spark an immediate bond and spend the night having a deep conversation like only Crowe can write. (Of course this is set to the tune of Solsbury Hill.) This sparks jealousy in Julie, who in a single action sends the film through the looking glass and into a world of murder, dreams and psychedelia.Vanilla Sky was initially released in 2001, a very good year for the certain type of film that requires numerous viewings to unwrap and dissect the riddles they present. In a single year we had Nolan's Memento, Kelly's Donnie Darko and this film. The former two films have gained a substantial cult following (#28 and #124 on IMDb's Top 250 respectively) however, Vanilla Sky remains the best and most undervalued film of that trio.The film is Crowe's first true directorial triumph, not his best film but his most stylistically advanced and intoxicating. In Vanilla Sky Crowe brings a mash of pop culture as signposts within the film. Keep an eye out for tiny details such as programs on T.V. or ringtones of a phone. He designs shots to subconsciously resemble classic images. However, this visual growth doesn't undercut the reliables in Crowe's bag of tricks. Vanilla Sky includes every Crowe staple: dialog that seems to immediately enter the lexicon, carefully drawn characters, subtle character driven humor and of course the achingly perfect soundtrack. Yet, I view as completely reliant on Crowe's previous film, Almost Famous. With that film Crowe sharpened his production values only to unleash them at their apex here. In Famous Crowe mastered the art of clear storytelling, allowing him to play with the structure of the medium with Vanilla Sky.The performances are also of a higher level. Cruise sheds all of his Maguire-tics to create a character that begins with all the answers and by the end has none of them left. Diaz brings a fierce believability to her role. And perhaps most surprisingly, Kurt Russell (as David's shrink) brings his uniquely human charm to a role that will be perceived in new ways by the end credits.Although only seven years old, Vanilla Sky has emerged in my mind as a great film of many layers. I've seen it countless times, yet with each viewing it continues to reveal further depths. I fear it may forever remain a mystery; however I am confident that it will stay an intricate and confounding masterwork.",10,1,3,29 November 2008
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Although the script is weak, this is a very funny film.
","Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs {dir. Carlos Saldanha} ***/**** A major improvement over the last installment, this might be the best film of the series and it is certainly the funniest. Visually the film is well done, although (per usual with Ice Age films) the script could use some fine tuning. Some of the one-liners fall very flat and the characters seem to become boring. However, the film's two biggest virtues make up for its numerous flaws. The best part of the first two films was certainly that curious mix of squirrel and rat fittingly named Scrat. This film features Scrat at his funniest, with more extended scenes and hilarious situations than ever. Also, the addition of a new character, a one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced brilliantly by Simon Pegg), provides a new pace, rhythm and humor to the tired plot-line.",6,0,1,18 July 2009
Beowulf," I AM (slightly let down by) BEOWULF!!!
","It seems we have a new cinematic fad coming into fashion... the genre of mythological action. It began with '300' (a film I really enjoyed), and the first that stands to benefit from 300's success is Beowulf. Beowulf is the newest film from Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis implements many of the same visual themes of his last project, the heart warming Polar Express, with varied success.Beowulf tells the story of the kingdom of King Hrothgar (a delightfully campy Anthony Hopkins)which is currently being terrorized by a monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover). Help comes in the form of mighty Beowulf (Ray Winstone), who arrives with an army of 14 men and his right hand man, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson). It his his job to slay the monster. However, he must also deal with Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie). Beowulf is opposed by Unferth (John Malkovich), and has also been paying close attention to the king's wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).Perhaps the most surprising element of the film is its sly, wink and a nod, sense of humor. This can be viewed two ways. The first view is one of enjoyment and laughter. However, it is hard to comply when we are asked to feel or identify with these characters after so many scenes presenting them as mere caricatures.As expected, Beowulf is visually stunning. I'd argue it is the one category where this film bests 'Polar Express'. The 3-D photography is shockingly good. It is a film I wouldn't want to imagine in the traditional two dimension format. I strongly advise anyone who is going to see this to view the film in 3-D. Without it, the film would be borderline un enjoyable. The highlight is by far the final battle scene,which just begs you to forget the film's past misdeeds. Close, but no dice.",6,119,202,14 November 2007
Heat," A Work of Pure Craftsmanship
","' A guy told me one time, 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.'' Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) from Heat I've always been of the opinion that it is incredibly difficult to make a great crime picture. The genre has been explored so many times from so many angles. I can say with a degree of certainty that 99% of crime films being made today fall in to the 'Forgettably Entertaining' category. Michael Mann's Heat is a film that falls in the final 1%.Heat (apropriatley subtitled 'A Los Angeles Crime Saga') is at its core a character study of archetypal cops and robbers. The two sides of a coin: homicide detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and ace thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro). Their stories are fairly typical: Pacino is always on the job, must to the chagrin of his third wife, Justine (Diane Venora). This is a Pacino performance of the first rank. He's manic and riveting. Though he represents the 'right' side of the law, Hanna is not Elliot Ness reborn. He loves the role of the hunter and craves it, Pacino, always an incredibly intelligent actor, knows this and bases his performance in this characteristic.DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a career thief who is the best in his profession. He's never had anything to weigh him down, so he's always been at the top. DeNiro bring a realistic cynicism to the role. In the hands of a lesser actor the role could have seemed to maudlin, but DeNiro pulls it off due to the attention and fascination her garners on screen.Yet, when it comes down to it, this is truly a Michael Mann film. It is an epic of surprising scope, and thankfully Mann is a director of considerable range. Mann stages what is arguably the most impressive shootout of the past twenty odd years. He doesn't just throw it on the screen, it is carefully edited, and maintains a naturalistic flow. However, by praising his direction I do not mean to discount his taut scripting. The film is filled with endless fascination, down to the characters and their daily routines, details are abundant in this film.All these elements are a certain greatness on their own , but when combined into a saga like 'Heat',they take on a special brilliance. When the credits roll it dawned on me, the film is so masterfully made, it is not only a masterpiece of the genre, but of the medium.",10,4,8,26 June 2008
The Social Network," Fincher and Sorkin in complete harmony
","Prior to its release, if one peg could be attached to David Fincher's The Social Network, it would be 'The Facebook Movie'. However, now that the finished product has seen the light of day, the only peg that applies is 'work of art'. That evolution from opportunism to genuinely fascinating artistic expression is a major part of what makes The Social Network work so well.So how did this happen? Turns out, good, old-fashioned movie-making can take you as far as you're willing to go. Beginning at a script level, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has devised a narrative that touches eternal themes of friendship, betrayal, and class. It is also expertly put together by Fincher, who avoids his usual visual trickery-as in the adrenaline fueled, punch drunk photography in his Fight Club- in favor of a more sedate and clinical approach to the material.The film begins on a chilly late fall evening in a college town dive bar. Wild noise crowds the soundtrack as the audience joins two voices (one male, the other female) in mid-conversation. The scene is a verbal high-wire act between Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Erica Albright (Rooney Mara), who will break up with Mark by the scene's end. The two fire back witty exchanges of dialogue that force the audience to adjust to a much faster pace than they are accustomed to.That is the method of this movie: moving at high intellectual speeds and expecting the audience to keep up. Sorkin's screenplay forgoes the tiresome process of explain how a website is created and instead focuses on strict character development. It doesn't matter if the audience doesn't know a single line of computer code because it is always so obvious that the main characters know what they're talking about. It is important to know how smart these character are and how passionate they are about what they're doing.The Social Network is essentially a movie with a revolving point of view, shifting from Zuckerberg to Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and the Winkevoss twins (both played, in a feat of stunning special effects, by Armie Hammer). All claim to have a large share in the creation of Facebook, and their legal depositions provide the movie's flashback structure. The Social Network forces the audience to sit up and actively engage in what is happening on screen. This is a movie where allegiance will shift from character to character, and the truth always seems tenuous and uncertain.Some have claimed that the vague nature of 'truth' offered by Fincher and Sorkin discredits the entire picture. Nothing is further from the truth. A movie, even one based on a true story, can do what it wishes with the facts, so long as it remains compelling. Other articles have termed the film a hack-job against Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg. I would completely disagree with that notion. Both Fincher and Sorkin are notorious perfectionists in their given fields, and their empathy for Zuckerberg is what lingers with audience well after the closing credits. We may never like Zuckerberg, but Sorkin and Fincher let us in on trying to understand him. That is the true story of the movie. It's not 'The Facebook Movie', it's a character study of the highest order.",10,0,1,28 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," Fine Fluff, but a thoroughly unremarkable adaptation
","The Great Gatsby (Luhrmann, 2013, C+) There is enough good here to make the miscalculations (and a few of them are colossal miscalculations) even more apparent. However, the film has a few virtues. One is DiCaprio, who gives a usual sturdy performance, even if it only ranks near the middle of the best work. Also, the film's back half is much stronger than it's opening. It's the best screen Gatsby to yet be made, but it's still only a little better than half way there. Here's the real issue, though: Luhrmann labors under the delusion that GATSBY is a love story between a man and a woman and not a love story between a man and a dream. He takes a source rich with symbol and metaphor and creates a distressingly literal adaptation. His camera wings gleefully through party after party, luxuriating in the decadence of these mansions. He is in love with the excesses of the roaring twenties. He makes the exact film that Gatsby the character would want made about himself and in doing so bypasses richer thematic avenues. To borrow a phrase from both the novel and film versions, Luhrmann is far too occupied with his count of enchanted objects.",5,0,2,8 October 2013
