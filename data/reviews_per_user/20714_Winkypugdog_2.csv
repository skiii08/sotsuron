Alien 3," You've been in my life so long I can't remember anything else!
",Ripley has done it again. The first time the alien was alone the next time she faced hundreds. Both times with the aid of weapons. During the showdown Ripley sucked the alien out into space. At least thats what it seemed like. The second time the alien queen laid an egg on Ripley's spaceship before she attacked Bishop. This time its different the deed of killing the alien won't be that easy. The egg hatched and a facehugger attached itself to a dog. Also Ripley has crashed onto a prison planet with no weapons allowed. The closest things they have to weapons are fire axes and knives. When Ripley awakens she finds out that Newt and Hicks are dead. At the funeral the dog dies and we are introduced to a new breed of alien. An alien that walks on all fours! Strange things are happening. Ripley works with Clemens to find out what has happened to some of the dead prisoners. One of the prisoners who has seen a killing is Golic. After seeing his fellow prisoners brutally slaughtered by the alien he goes crazy.While this is happening Ripley asks Bishop if there was an alien on board the ship and Bishop replies Yes. In one part when Ripley and Clemens are operating on Golic Ripley sees Golic panicking and turns around just in time to see Clemens get decapitated. Ripley leaves to find everybody else and warn them and just as she arrives Andrews says GET THIS FOOLISH WOMAN BACK TO THE INFIRMARY! He was standing underneath an air duct as he said this. Then some hands come down drag him up to the ceiling. Everybody hears Andrews scream and look around then they all start panicking. In the very end Ripley kills herself to save the galaxy from the alien menace. Right as she falls into a molten pit a chestburster erupts from within her. This is a great movie.Now go watch this and decide for yourself if you like this movie as much as I did.,10,11,17,14 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Two is tops!
","This movie is the best movie in the Star Wars series. The best part is when Luke Skywalker fights everybody's favorite the one and only... Darth Vader. But before I go into that I must tell you my review. This movie is the best in the series because it reveals the most secrets (Next to Episode III) and it is packed to the gills with action. This like all of the other ones has a lot of killing (BUT PARENTS LET YOUR KIDS SEE THIS MOVIE!)but the peoples faces are hidden beneath masks so there is little agony on peoples faces when they are shot with laser blasters. By this I am referring to Stormtroopers. In the beginning we are introduced to the new Rebel Base on Hoth an icy planet. Darth Vader is sending probe droids to find the Rebles and find Luke. Hmmm I wonder why... Luke investigates is attacked by a snow beast uses the force escapes leaves and almost freezes to death. Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan and is told to go to the Degobah system. Han goes out to look for Luke and eventually finds him. Han and Luke are forced spend a cold night on Hoth in the morning a search party finds Luke and takes them back to the Rebel base and puts Luke in a Bacta tank. Then the Rebeles find some Imperial walkers ready to destroy Echo Base. There is a battle and Han and Leia escape on the Mellenium Falcon. The Imperials are looking for Han and Leia. Then Darth Vader calls in 6 bounty hunters IG-88, Dengar, Zukuss and 4-LOM, Bossk and Boba Fett. Han and Leia are forced to flee to Cloud City on the planet Bespin during their visit they will meet up with an old 'Friend' Lando Callrisean . Right as they leave we see a ship resting on an asteroid... Meanwhile Luke and R2 leave Hoth to find Yoda. They find a little creature who turns out to be Yoda. Yoda teaches Luke the ways of the force. Luke feels in the force that Han and Leia are in serious trouble so he leaves Degobah to go and save his friends. Han is put into torture to be put into Carbon Freeze. If he survives then the Empire will use the Carbon Freezeing Chamber on Luke to turn him to the dark side. It turns out that Boba Fett has also made it to Cloud City. Han survives carbon freeze then is taken with Boba Fett to visit Jabba the Hutt. Luke arrives in cloud city to find Darth Vader in his trap. Luke and Vader have a lightsaber battle while Leia Lando Chewbacca R2 and C3-P0 escape. In the end of the battle Luke gets his hand chopped off along with his fathers lightsaber. Vader says the lines ' I am your father.' Luke is hanging on a platform over an abyss then lets go to escape the dark side. Luke almost dies because he is hanging on a pole after being sucked into an exhaust vent. Then his friends Leia and Lando save him from death. I loved this movie so much that I used to freeze my Han Solo toy and pretend that he was in Carbon Freeze. Now watch the movie and see if you liked it as much as I did. If you want it real bad buy it on DVD with the bonus disk. May the force be with you!",10,0,1,20 March 2006
