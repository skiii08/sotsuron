"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Hilarious!
","This movie cracked me up the first time I saw it. The second time it was just as funny as the first! It's a real feel good movie where everything turns out good in the end. I saw this movie for the first time on the fourth of July when I happened to be in a horrible mood. 10 minutes into the movie my bad mood was replace with a good one.The Scene with the ping pong balls in one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. The whole movie is Great and the cast is wonderful. Hugo Weaving, Tarence Stamp, and Guy Pearce are all funnier then heck.When I saw Guy Pearce in Ravenous I said to myself 'Wow, He's hot!' When I saw him in this I just thought he was extremely funny. I know this isn't supposed to be a review about Guy Pearce but every time I see him in a movie I am just amazed. Blown away. He is one of those rare actors where when he's on screen your eyes stay glued to him, try as you might to tear them away. He's definitely a scene stealer. It drives me crazy  that I can't find half of the movies he's been in at the video store I go to.Anyway If you haven't seen this movie see it if you have seen it go out and watch it again. I plan to.",Null,1,2,25 July 2001
Memento," A movie that keep you thinking long after you've left the theater
",Great movie! This movie keeps you thinking about it long after it is over. You lie down in bed but you can't fall to sleep because you can't stop running the movie through your head working up different possibilities as to what really happened. Definitely a movie to see over and over again. You can't wait to discuss the ending or beginning (whatever) with the other people that have seen it. Guy Pearce was great as always. When is he going to get the darn appreciation that he deserves? Joe Pantoliano was equally as great. Carrie Anne Moss was pretty good also. I can't wait until Christopher Nolan's next movie comes out. I think it's called Insomnia. I know Al Pacino is in it. Anyway this movie will certainly stick in your mind after seeing it and it's Definitely worth the money to see it more then once. An Easy 10 out of 10,10,0,1,6 August 2001
