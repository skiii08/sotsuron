The Legend of Bagger Vance," Movie excellent, acting superb, didn't over play, just let it flow
","Very good.  I wasn't sure what to expect going into this movie.  It was a different type of genre and subject matter than I usually see.  As the credits began to fade in, I felt it was an excellent two hours spent, though it didn't seem like two hours, and I wanted it to keep going.  Casting was beautiful, as well as the camera shots.  Not one frame couldn't have been taken and made into a magnificant photograph.  Will Smith play the part superbly, as well as Matt Damon and Charlize Theron.  They were perfectly fitting, didn't try to over play it, just let it flow.  The little kid is going to be a star.  All in all, a great movie.",10,0,1,21 April 2001
