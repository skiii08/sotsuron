10 Cloverfield Lane," Suspenseful and Interesting
","I almost feel like with the first Cloverfield movie, they didn't plan very well afterwards. I read somewhere that those two movies aren't related but, come on. Any ways, the suspense was great. The movie was interesting. It's a unique way to follow up from the first one. Still a lot of plot holes connecting the two in my opinion. But as a stand alone movie, I thought it was decent. John Goodman did a good job.",7,0,0,16 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," As A Star Wars Fan, I LOVED It!!! I was very impressed!
","The directors listened - and I love it! Man, scenes were beautiful, intense, emotional. The action scenes were on point! You have to give them some credit - it's very difficult finishing something legendary like Star Wars. They have a huge challenge in front of them. I think this was, by far, the best of the 3! I love what they did with the characters and the plot twists. I have to say that I have a new favorite Star Wars character after watching this ;-). Well done! Whatever doubts I had about a good finale, were all settled! Very impressive!!! A must see!!!",9,4,14,21 December 2019
Aladdin," So Much Fun!
","All these negative reviews and complaints about Will Smith - please! He did excellent! The dancing and music was great, and I loved Will as the genie! This was very well made. I'm not sure how I feel about Jafar. I just feel like his deep, sinister voice in the animated film made him the creep he is. But this guy was sinister in different ways I guess. I loved this movie! Definitely worth the watch!",8,0,2,27 May 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Loved It
","I think people who have rated this movie so horribly have no idea what BDSM is.I enjoyed it. I was expecting it to be way more violent considering all of the horrible reviews. I thought the on screen interaction was great. Even though Jamie Dornan may have lacked on the intensity level, I still think he did a great job. I thought he and Dakota had great on screen chemistry. Not sure what all the fuss is about that? I have done my own research and interacted with people in the BDSM community before, so I knew a little bit going in. Just like in any relationship, there has to be boundaries. There has to be trust. No abuse should be tolerated, ever.That being said, the movie did a very good job at showing her being hesitant to join the lifestyle. She didn't rush in like a bull. There was a contract in place. She was never forced into the lifestyle. It also did a great job showing her emotions when he crossed the line. That being said, I think this movie is meant for a very specific audience.Was there tons of sex? Yes. Was the nudity ridiculous? Yes. Then again, what did you expect? I mean, really. People that are going to see this movie and are leaving absolutely disgusted -- you knew this movie was controversial. Did you not do research to see what it was about? I don't think that this movie encourages abuse. It's not degrading of women. Just like the BDSM lifestyle, this movie is not for everyone. Many will not like it.The damage, however, that I think this movie does is spur curiosity. While some may think that's a good thing, I don't think it is. There are A LOT of predators out there that use BDSM to abuse others. You have to tread EXTREMELY carefully if you ever want to get involved in the lifestyle. I think this is going to cause a lot of young people to want to explore things, and be to trusty of strangers. There are people out there that respectfully do BDSM the right way and are respectful of their partners, and it is completely consensual and pleasurable both ways. The fakes that try to use BDSM to abuse others are the ones that you have to watch out for.Anyway, I loved the movie. I thought it was great. I cried through a lot of it. It really did a great job stirring emotions and creating an attachment between you and the characters. I'm really looking forward to the sequel :-).",9,11,14,6 June 2015
