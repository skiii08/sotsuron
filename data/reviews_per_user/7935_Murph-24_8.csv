Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It'll make a lot of money, but so does the mafia
","Okay, so Lucas was under intense self-inflicted pressure to make the latest episode of his sci-fi epic transcend the previous offerings, but it is my opinion that he went about it in the wrong way relied too heavily on special FX. Added to that, he once again left gaping plot flaws and inconsistencies in what turned out to be a disappointing script. Unbalanced and flawed.One of the joys of watching a film is not knowing what is going to happen, and even if you are pretty sure of what will happen through inductive reasoning. Though we may have all been fairly confident that Luke would play a pretty major role in the destruction of the first death star, we didn't actually know. With some level of disbelief-suspension we are able to let go and enjoy the battle that ensues during the mission. Han blasts in, Luke `uses the force' and the audience is happy. I had no doubt at any stage during the race scene in TPM that Anakin was going to win his race with the vessel that he built with his own slave-hands. Good for him, but I found the whole scene a trifle tiring and pointless. If  Qui-Gon Jin can leap into a passing aircraft to evade danger, and can hold his own against Maul for a while, then surely he could have used Jedi mind powers on Anakin's enslaver. No need for mummy to carry on living a life of depravity, or for the young lad to be separated from her. Perhaps, if he had been kept under her wing until he was really ready he wouldn't have become an emotional retard.
I suffered from a distinct lack of ability to believe all of the ridiculous and largely irrelevant situations that were being presented to me in this film. The light sabre is supposedly a pure energy blade with no mass, while the electromagnetically generated arc wave creates a strong gyroscopic effect that is surprisingly difficult to handle. OK. So how come Maul can handle a double-ended one and stave off two apparently talented opponents simultaneously? (I know Obi-Wan was a junior, but he did have some talents) Queen Amidala seemed to change from one magnificent gown to another continually through the film (not at all like the simple pithy garments that her `subjects' wore) applying fresh make-up and moaning about her own ineffectualness. Apparently she was an elected queen. Why did her subjects elect her? Because she had a proven track record for dealing with economy and international relations? Or was it for her superfluous fashionable magnanimity? Beats me. And how is it that technology levels are so much higher in this episode than in Star Wars? Don't give me that `there is a really big war in episode 3' rubbish. It is a known fact that technology levels do not recede as a result of war, but they actually improve somewhat. Especially for the winning side. Oh, and could someone please tell me why Darth Maul was given virtually no speaking parts? Aside from the fight scenes, he was more an extra than a player and I found this deeply disappointing. This film needed a main proponent of the opposition's cause.We could bang on about plot flaws all day, but for now it seems to me that there is a far more important shortcoming in this movie that Star Wars certainly didn't have, and that is likeable characters. A generation of people have grown up wanting to be/dress up as Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, a Storm Trooper, an Imperial Guard, Boba  Fett, one of the Catina musicians or Chewie. We could see them out in force at the opening of TPM in queues around the world. Aside from Queen Amidala and Darth Maul what new costumes will people be wearing in the next set of opening queues? A Battle Droid or Jar Jar? Me thinks not. There were very few things to really like about this set of characters, most particularly their pathetic names. They were not emotionally provoking enough. Computer animation is a far cry from getting a guy to dress up in a really good suite. Animation encourages alienation. Star Wars was so popular because of the great costumes that the Imperial forces got to wear. Computer animation sequences may be great for ease-of use but they do tend to promote a certain kind of distancing from the action at hand, and the blue screen doesn't exactly help actors to act.In all, though I enjoyed the first three I couldn't say that I enjoyed the first three movies a considerable amount more than this one. However, I'm not 10 years old any more (I'm 20). I do feel that it isn't a patch on the previous offerings, and I hated the special effects. They're great, but `eye candy' should only be used to enhance something that is already there, and not to try to create it from thin air. All in all a disappointing affair, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it.",Null,0,1,18 July 1999
The Big Lebowski," The best bowling comedy of 1998
","At a Conservative Party ccktail function sometime last year, after a few drinks the subject naturally got onto best films. The general concensus was that 'Withnail & I' had that title of funniest, and of that there was little genuine argument. However, there was a small contingent of persons present who claimed that the Coen brothers with Lebowski, a then, recent offering, could possibly wrest the title from Robinson's hitherto safe hands. Though I should add that they voiced this opinion in a humble and respectful manner.An investigation ensued, and within a week I had located an establishment that was to play it, and set to my task, viz. a comparison with studious meticulousisity. To take the film as it stands would be the only way to treat it fairly because, to be fair to it, it is completely different to Withnail. It is a totally different kind of humour, and style of filming. Whereas Withnail features a kind of low budget dark, earthy and realistic humour, Lebowski has a certain elaborate feel to it, from the expensive sets and abstract scenes to the wealth of locations and Hollywood feel. But enough of the comparisons, I'm supposed to be writing about Lebowski here, so no more Withnail. But let it be said, they are both titled on names and concentrate on bums (or a bum).Lebowski tends to rely on seemingly obvious jokes and repeated lines and styles,(such as 'shut the F***K UP Donny', 'I'll suck your c**k for a thousand dollars' and 'Am I wrong?') combined with a rewarding subtle blend of character-based humour, (such as Lebowski never finishing his lines, Donny never getting to say anything, Brandt's nervous mannerisms, and numerous self referential statements). Some people from the Dumb and Dumber school of comedy appreciation will 'get' very little of Lebowski, and will not rate it. These are largely the same kind of people who thought that Mallrats was better than Clerks. The introduction to the film and, most importantly, to Lebowski is utterly perfect. The look at this supposed bum, and then at the till girl to put things in perspective, creates good empathy with the inner workings of the protagonist. He took his  choice, others take theirs. Great camera work and combination with Dylan provides the perfect setting to the bowling hall, and hence, the backdrop to the film. This style of filming is the Coen brothers at their very best, and blending of the title sequence into the story is done as well as anyone could do.This film is made of a combination of straightforward camera shots and dialogue with very little action (aside from bowling or driving). This is then juxtaposed with some very abstract scenes such as dream sequences and slow motion footage of (questionably) real situations. This technique often creates a very effective result though sometimes can become tiresome. The main crux of the film is set in the real world and revolves around The Dude attempting to repatriate his living room with a rug. This is largely done in a very ordinary fashion but with a great wealth of humorous conversation. Goodman provides many memorable sayings. Where the film goes at a tangent to this, but with immediate purpose in mind, it works very well. The best examples of this are the introductory bowling scene (as stated), and the introduction of the loveable Jesus. When these scenes are not so welcome is when they actively distract from the flow of the story and serve only to break it up in an undesirable manner. Still, without this experimentation we would have been without some of the film's most impressive moments.As The Dude's main opponent is The Big Lebowski, a disabled veteran with a personal achievement complex. He is acted out brilliantly by Huddleston, has an excellent vocabulary ( including micturate) and is a very aggressive character, especially towards The Dude. Looking after him is his faithful servant Brandt who has some delightful nervous mannerisms and peculiar gaits which work well with his characters speaking parts. The blend of humour is mostly based around slight subtlety on the part of some characters, and outright over-the-top acting on the part of others. Add this to some great visuals, though not over the top, and the result is a finely crafted humorous product. In all, though not as good as the all conquering Withnail, Lebowski does manage to better Fargo, and is certainly one of the funniest films in recent years.",10,0,1,3 August 1999
The Thing," How on earth could it have been improved upon?
","It couldn't.From the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout. The immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic, the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around.Up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes out on top and laughing. Who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. I for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits. This wasn't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick. This film had feeling. Emotion.I truly can't recommend this film highly enough. I have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching, let alone bettering, the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema.",10,1,2,4 July 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Better than the prequel, though not as good
","OK, it doesn't really need to be said, but the first film was better even though it was eclipsed in almost every way by this one.
The stunts were bigger, the dramatics improved upon, the music used to more effect, but it still had the feel of a sequel which can't be good. An original will almost always be better than its sequel.
The special effects and action scenes were greatly improved in content and in execution. The chase scene with the lorry is quite remarkable and is a good way of introducing the main players in the film. Some great scenes in the mental asylum and a good (though repeated) end location really manages to give a good feel to the film. However, special effects aside, we do get the feeling that it is just a makeover of the first film with a bigger budget, though that isn't a particularly bad thing. Though the original terminator never betrayed his mechanical instincts and thorough programming and ruthlessly killed anyone claiming to be Sarah Conner, the return of the terminator sees models that have inconsistent (and less ruthless) characters. T101 compromises tries to learn humanistic character traits, loosely veiled under the guise of fitting in (and encouraged by his young master) which could be excused, but the failure of T1000 to successfully complete his mission could not. Though he killed John's foster parents and dog with extreme prejudice near the beginning of the film, he failed to pull off a similar stunt with Sarah near the end. He seemed to be exhibiting some very bad human traits in wanting to see her suffer. Flaws like this simply weren't present in the original film. The original model showed himself to be so inhuman at the end that he was stripped of all flesh, while the return sees a terminator that is willing to make a joke at the end. Add this to the fact that T1000 had no reason to look like Robert Patrick at the end when his cover had been blown, meaning that he could take on a different and more effective shape (like a long serrated blade with barbed ends), and several more plot flaws are revealed.
Despite this, Patrick does play a far more effective and menacing terminator in practice, and without having to dress up like a thug or have big bulging muscles. As far as playing an artificial human is concerned, he fulfils the role far more convincingly than Arnie. His face changes from being expressionless to conveying some kind of empathy, and back, in a mere moment. He isn't built up, which is probably because the people that he emulates weren't big, but it seems more realistic than Arnie's Herculean body structure. Let's face it; in a post apocalyptic earth Mr. Universes are not going to blend in too well. Something else that was (naturally) missing was the feeling of innocence that was being violated. Here we see a beefed up Sarah and a well keyed up John teaming up with the Terminator as if he was an old friend. Aside from this, the suspense, effects and amusing scenes make this well worth watching even if it isn't as dark and moody as the original. A very enjoyable film that improves upon many elements of the original but suffers from the sequel-plot syndrome.",Null,6,13,6 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Shell-shocking visuals, but we could have done without the cheese
","'Writing an anti war book is like writing an anti glacier book.' -a (sort of) quote from Slaughterhouse 5Commendable for it's use of realistic ground level shaky camera angles in the beginning and end battle scenes, this film really does bring the horrors of war home. The depiction of the unfair randomness of the conflict, and the gruesome results, are truly superb. On a par with certain scenes in Hamburger Hill and Stalingrad in it's ability to discourage volunteering for military service. I defy anyone to leave the theatre after seeing this film and not feel as though someone has really spoken out to them.However, this graphic depiction of war does come with a fair amount of Hollywood baggage. Noteworthy scenes include the ones with the present day Private Ryan, Officers back in America and the bit where Hanks says 'saving-Private-Ryan' which I objected to on general principles. Despite these scenes, this film still has to rank up there with some of the best executed anti war films around. I would personally recommend Stalingrad more strongly if only because it had the same 'shock factor' and came without the cheese.",Null,0,1,20 July 1999
Pi," A chilling story of the way mathematics corrupts
","I had the distinct pleasure of being able to watch this film in the theatre with a bona fide mathematician. His faith in this chosen discipline was flagging however, and he believed that seeing this film would strengthen his resolve. It did at first, as the maths equations and diagrams flowed out accompanied by thumping music to captivating effect. I heard him cry out 'Maths is cool', but I believe that by the end he was nonplussed as his newfound enthusiasm had been stifled.Described by someone, whose name I know not, as being the best maths based Jewish horror film of the year. This puts it into a category of film in which there are no rivals (me thinks), which is absolutely fair. I have never come across a film anything like it before, and its originality it thoroughly refreshing. Certainly one to talk about, and works in the opposite way to Good Will Hunting (both films are about boffins), in that it dissuades the viewer from thinking that it would be good to be so intelligent. Shares similar attributes to Clerks in that it was about the same budget, filmed in black and white and had a great original soundtrack. Though not as good a screenplay as Clerks, the adventurous camera work, a larger cast and more challenging subject matter mean that his film is deserving of a great deal of praise.You all know the story, so I shan't bore you with that, but it has to be said that Max, together with his 'personal notes' makes an intriguing, though largely shallow character. Bearing in mind that the entire film centres around, and is about, him, we are left feeling that we haven't actually discovered so much about him by the end. This could be attributable to the fact that there can't really be that much to know about a maths obsessed loner obsessed with patterns. Perhaps, but it still would have been nice for there to have been something interesting to discover to sustain the film for the duration. It does indeed run out of steam too far from the end as his mind ebbs further away.The other characters in the film, though interesting in their own way, are ultimately too shallow to sustain interest for long. For example Max's tutor-cum-father-figure tells him a few anecdotes about past maths discoveries. This is all very well, but the anecdotes that he tells aren't exactly unknown by us, the general public, so I see little chance that Max would bear to sit through another telling. There are also many questions left unresolved at the end of the film, and we never really discover what Max's ultimate fate was, but I suppose that these are all the same elements that kept interest levels high in this surprisingly fast-paced flick.Basically, if you don't like venturing much from standard Hollywood issue then you certainly wont enjoy this film, but if you are prepared to try something new then you could well enjoy it. Also, fans of art-house films will almost certainly enjoy this, as it is an excellent example of creative low budget independent filming.Incidentally, did anyone else out there that has seen the film manage to catch the Chemical Brothers' UK tour? There is a distinct similarity between the introduction to the film and a certain video that is projected at the concert (I think it was during Hey Boy, Hey Girl).",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," What a shame.
","I was really enjoying this film even though Cloony's fast and stupid mouth was beginning to grate at my nerves. I had settled down for a standard Tarantino affair from the outset and had been pleased by it all. Then the vampires came out of the closet. From then on i found this film plainly offensive. There was no further character development, and the fighting scenes were plainly incongruous nee ridiculous. It was nothing more than i would have expected from some cheap horror flick circa 1980.Did no one else get their senses aroused when the store was trashed at the beginning, or when the poor woman was killed after about 20 minutes? I did. Did you then also feel a lack of empathy for either the vampires or the slayers towards the end of the film? I did, and i felt that it was a blatant waste of a perfectly good build up in a film. Poor and disappointing.",Null,0,0,18 July 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Definitely among the funniest films of all time
","When you sit down to watch a film with someone who hasn't seen it before and you find yourself saying to them 'this is the best bit' at nearly every scene, you have to acknowledge that it fulfills the criterion necessary to be labeled 'a masterpiece'. This film makes that grade and as such joins an elite of less than a dozen films.Everything that could possibly have gone right with this film did, from the ingenious opening to the laughable ending. One set of hilarious sketches after another including jokes about the monarchy, foreign nationals, troy, fabled mythical beasts, the constitution of the knights and God himself. The ending was perfect in my opinion because there never was a story in the first place. It was simply Monty Python at it's very best acting out a set of themed sketches with no real direction. To finish that with a proper 'ending' would be to disrespect the film, themselves and the viewer.Encompasing a wide and varied range of knowledge, from Greek Myth to Arthurian Legend, and from Political Philosophy to botany and zoology, this film displays the vast depth of knowledge of it's creators. It never fails to amuse and is, among a wide section of the British populace, communally quoteable.I wouldn't hasten to recommend this film to anyone, and if you don't like it at least a bit then there surely must be something wrong with you. Not that it is my place to judge.WATCH IT",10,0,0,4 August 1999
