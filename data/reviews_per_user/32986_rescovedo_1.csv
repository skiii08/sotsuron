The Monuments Men," Great point of view from the meanings of art.
","To all who are saying this is a bad movie, I'll just say that you guys didn't watched the movie to fully understand the message of this film, which is, in fact, that we should preserve the history of humanity as well as their greatest arts, paintings and sculptures. If you completely delete the mention of a civilization or culture is as if it never existed.This is a great movie at all. The point of perspective about the war is great. It contains some side humor that makes the movie watchable, and I don't think there's a 'propaganda' at all about cigarettes. It's about WWII, everyone was smoking here and there, it's a fact.",7,1,2,2 May 2014
