Antz," The kids might find it boring but not adults.
","It's less colorful than A Bug's Life. It looks like a film not made especially for kids. Woody Allen has a pest of a voice & he talks too much. But at the end, he has his day! Along the way, he falls in love with the 'Sharon Stone' ant. The general is menacing but of course, I have it for Sly, so the 'Weaver' ant gets my vote! He's big, he's friendly & he's confident enough w/the ladies (female ants) to never be lonely if he doesn't want to be. You can tell it's Sly! Just listen to that voice, too! Anyway, go see it at least once.",Null,0,0,23 August 2000
Over the Top," Sly acts a bit 'un-interested' in some parts of this film.
","Good choice of work for Sly - a trucker. Something 'masculine', on the move. He wrangles with his father-in-law for custody of his son, who thought his dad (Sly) disowned him. To the contrary, grandfather didn't want the boy associating with Sly because he was'nt 'of money' like grandfather was. When Sly's former wife dies of cancer, (Susan Blakely again), Sly sees it as a 'sign' to take his responsibility seriously & raise his son the only way he knows how - take him on the road with him, teach him not to be a spoiled brat all his life, live a little! At first, his son rejects him totally. But later on when he finds out the truth about his dad, he decides he WANTS to be with him. Yes, the veritable 'macho-sport of arm-wrestling' is thrown in as a way to win big money quick & show-off Sly's ever-bulging muscles. But hey! What's a Sly-film without muscles?? See this one for family entertainment. Sly might be a bit 'wooden' with some of his lines, but the action scenes are typically Sly!",Null,19,26,23 November 2000
Driven," DRIVEN drove me...CRAZY!!
","This is a RACING movie, pure & simple. It is NOT a SLY film, which disappointed me. He didn't have enough screen time! It took like 15 minutes or so for him to 'debut' as Joe 'The Hummer' Tanto. You'd think Kip Pardue ('Jimmy Blye') & Til Schewiger ('Beau Brandenburg') were the stars!
Burt Reynolds as owner in a wheelchair also doesn't get enough screen time. He's a veteran actor & deserves it but he doesn't get it. People comment about his toupee. It looks fine! It's his face that's been noticeably altered. If he smiles too broadly, which he's known for, it's gonna crack!Gina Gershon had some of THE BEST lines in this film as Sly's ex-wife. She's gorgeous & resembles a younger Raquel Welsch here. Estella 'the model' Warren does nothing but work those buck teeth & huge lips! OUCH!! And why didn't someone give her a haircut?!?Sly's love interest/writer, Stacey Edwards was a poor choice,too. Her chin is too short & she's just too plain.Christian de la Fuente needed more screen time, too. This guys' in great shape & has alot going for him - looks & accent combined! 'A better, younger Sly'? Hmmmmm....I don't know....Maybe with a 'twist'?The music was bumpin' but there was just too much going on so fast that you could'nt take it all in. There wasn't time to allow the characters to develop so there wasn't enough drama in it. Like I said, this is a RACING movie, pure & simple. See it if you like CART, but I prefer drag racing.",Null,0,0,30 April 2001
Rocky," No other Stallone film can touch the purity of ROCKY!!
","Sly admits it himself. He was hungrier then, he was on the edge, they were making the film on a VERY limited budget. But somehow, it all worked! This is a classic film that will NEVER go out of style. Is it a boxing film? No. Is it a love story? Yes. With a boxer in the lead role. Every ROCKY film is a love story with a boxer in the lead role. WHO DOESN'T know Rocky & Adrian? WHO CAN'T recite at least a couple of famous lines from this movie?  Sly will ALWAYS be remembered for his sensitive, powerful and compelling portrayal of 'ROCKY Balboa, The Italian Stallion!'",Null,1,2,23 August 2000
Platoon," This is Sheen's movie, pure & simple
","I only watched this for the sake of Tom Berenger. (Sgt. Barnes) But the movie really belongs to Sheen. He's an innocent who quits college to go to 'Nam to serve his country. When he gets there, he's racked with stinging ants, murder & chaos & a loss of his own innocence as he kills 'one of his own'. Not until he does this dirty deed does he realize he has just become what he wanted to get rid of. And he got rid of Sgt. Barnes, the scar-faced 'shot 7 times & hasn't died yet' Tom Berenger in an oscar-nominated role.
Johnny Depp was in this, too & should've had more air time. He spoke Vietnamese & was used much as a translator. I don't veer towards war films, especially about 'Nam but like I said, I saw it for the sake of Berenger. He was compellingly 'evil' but it's understandable why. It's also understandable why many who return from war are apt to relive their worst nightmares from over there & end up in prison or just continually violent throughout their lives. 'Where does the war end & real life begin?!?' They can't figure it out. This is what war does to people. I say remain neutral & leave the blood & guts routine to those who don't want a future.",Null,0,1,29 November 2001
