Skyfall," Worst Bond movie ever!!!!!!!
","'this review contains spoilers'Skyfall is the twenty-third movie in the eon official series(quite possibly the worst one)to star Daniel Craig in his third outing as secret agent 007. an outrageous budget estimated to be in the region of 200 million $,totally wasted and misused on a half baked thin plot,full of plot holes.the movie opens up with bond in action in Istanbul on a mission to recuperate a stolen list of secret agents,property of MI6,in the hands of professional network hackers with Silva(the main villain)head of the organization.For the first hour bond is sent in various locations attempting to recuperate the list and find out who is behind it all.Funny enough at one point the list is completely forgotten about as if it never existed as the villains main objective is take his revenge on m.for the reminder of the picture bond has to protect her in case she falls victim to the criminally insane.There nothing else to the plot.Quite elementary to say the least.Craig looks terribly old,tired and out of shape.Time to quit don't you think?He lacks the traditional bond image,of the ones portrayed by Sean Connery and Roger Moore as a true English gentlemen with charm,cool gestures and movements and specified style of communication.The problem with the latest James bond movies that for every single problem a use of gun and muscle is frequently required.Why not use your brain, your intelligence and knowledge?There is much more to the punching and kicking!There are no beautiful bond girls,no gadgets..oh ye just a gun and a transmitter,very nice!the villains reasons are never explained..why does he steal that list?to attract bonds and m's attention?the scene where bond is captured whilst sitting down Silva starts touching his chest and legs..what?Homosexual?As far back i remember in the series there's never been a gay villain before.Nice way to bring innovation to the series.the new kid as q with that know it all attitude and stupid hair just didn't fit the bill,same thing goes to the new moneypenny,awful choice.All in all a very empty movie,there is no feel or memorable action sequences,no cool one-liners,no funny humor,no cool sports cars,just....nothing!!!The movie borrows heavily from other movies,and in no way does it cover new territory.Take a few visuals out,the movie is to be thrown in a nearby dustbin.through out viewing you keep saying to yourself...'AM I WATCHING A BOND FLICK??'I expect to see a secret agent by the name of Bond,James Bond,not someone that comes out of the Bourne identity or mission impossible.I'm not sure when a new installment is planned to be made,but either dramatic changes are made to the production team or we'll witness a tragic downfall to the world's most popular secret agent.Bond is Back??In your dreams..... Its the best in the series? laughable in extreme!!!",1,5,12,27 April 2013
Rocky V," Rocky 5
","'this review may contain spoilers'Rocky 5 is not just a movie its more a lesson of life. When your living one of the greatest moments (of your life),with all the odds against you,managing to defeat a Russian, mountain of muscle, killing machine 'Ivan Drago', to conquer his home crowd with your name chanted out loudly,seen in the eyes of millions of people as a hero....all of sudden to face one of the toughest realities like losing your fortune and not being able to nothing about it,is sad,depressing and disturbing.making you feel a big loser and a failure.Rocky is back from the soviet union.He discovers that all the millions of dollars earned as a legendary boxer have been lost or worse stolen and utilized by his accountant in the stock market.Paulie is considered to be the culprit,as when he receives a letter from the accountant with the request to borrow Rocky's money,Paulie signs it thinking that the letter is a payment for the tax's extensions on the house.NO can do, everything is lost forever.The mansion,cars and all assets are sold,and rocky is forced to retire from his beloved profession after discovering to have suffered severe brain damage. The family go and live back in the old neighborhood.Rocky for a living opens up Micheys old gym,Adrian gets her old job at the pet shop and Robert(Rockys son),has to adapt to a complete different scenery:from the rich world and high class education,to a poor degraded environment comparable in way to a ghetto. A long the way Rocky becomes manager of Tommy'the machine'Gunn,an ungrateful prick who after been tough how to box at the highest level,seeing that Rocky hasn't got the financial muscle to move him up and lamenting that after 22 consecutive wins,no proper money has been made,Tommy decides to turn his back on him by joining the ranks of a bent promoter by the name of George W.Duke. The final sequence of the film sees Rocky and Tommy fighting in the street,thankfully Rocky ends up victorious by showing his ex pupil some manners and who is the best.The whole Rocky series,especially this fifth chapter, is not based on boxing,but it narrates the story of a man who even when he finds himself in most dark and difficult situations in life,he manages to stand up on his two feet and fight until the very end. Especially with Rocky 5,Sly Stallone wanted to point out a clear message,In life even with unfortunate situations such as 'bankruptcy',failiures,disappointments,get put down by other peoples criticisms,judgments and bad words,don't just lay down as a defeated, Get up and always find the strength to react and confront.You gain and posses that strength from the love and careness that you have for your family.Never marginalize your family for someone from the outside,family comes first than power,money,and material.I honestly don't understand why this movie got such a low rating and why its considered to be the weakest and one of the worst.The movie other than being emotional and more based on reality,is Original.To all those IMDb users that gave this picture such a low rating,claiming that it should be burned and its a disgrace are ignorants that don't understand a monkeys toss about cinema.Everyone wanted to witness Rocky climb back in the ring and fight another vicious killing machine like Drago,but it didn't happen.UNLUCKY!!!!to all the haters,a word of advice:do something better with your time instead of reviewing titles that you don't completely understand.!the ending of the film is absolutely perfect,where the scene closes with the Rocky statue ,with its arms high up in the sky,looking over the entire city of Philadelfia as a symbol of victory. All five Rocky films have had an impact on my life.I want to personally thank Mr Slyvester Stallone for delivering not only such superb films but mostly creating such a legendary figure like 'Rocky', that will always be remembered in the long coming, a character that we always can turn to,especially moments we are in need of comfort,strength and a boost.... but most of all, AN IDOL THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF!!!!! Thankyou!!!",8,6,7,13 October 2011
Ocean's Twelve," Soderbergh and co .succeed in daylight robbery!!!
","'this review may contain spoilers'I will never forgive the hole cast and crew and especially director Soderbergh,for providing me with such a ridiculous,boring,and awful movie and most importantly by taking away two hours of my life that i will never ever get back.From the the first minute i sensed that this movie was going to flop,some scenes were shot in a weird manner, the scene where Brad Pitt runs down the stairs, the camera starts shaking and going sideways.STRANGE!!the one scene that really got up my nose was when Julia Roberts has to PRETEND to be Julia Roberts.HOW STUPID CAN YOU GET????please Soderbergh,please help me here.There is no plot what so ever,the characters spend most of the time going back and forth trying to rob something to make money but fail,they also get arrested and put in jail.From what i saw the big actors where just having a good time,not the poor audience who had to sit there,coned all the way and witness this disaster.To bring this review to a conclusion i'm just going to say this to Mr Soderbergh: I do admire your strategy, stealing peoples money by putting together big Hollywood heavyweights even if there is no script!!right???RIGHT??.obviously when a movie is about to be released and u see a cast of this kind of magnitude,one says instantly.WOOWW.i have to see this!!!and that is what happened in this case..people got blown away by the famous faces involved in the film and ended with anger,disappointment and losing the money they paid for the ticket.Oceans eleven was excellent,well told,good acting and original.this failure was not even a pale imitation of the first film.I don't recommend oceans twelve,you will just waste your time...For me this is one of the worst sequels and quite possibly one of the worst movies ever MADE in recent movie history.'THAT SAYS IT ALL.' COMPLETE TRASH FROM START TO FINISH.. Clooney,Pitt and co.seemed a bunch of ordinary clowns. I wont give this movie a 1 out of 10. A -1 out of 10.p.s i wished Andy Garcia had a more central role in the movie.(i'm a great fan of his).He was terribly misused.he was given just a few scenes at the beginning and one at the end.",1,1,3,26 September 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," i watched it only because of Al Pacino!!!
","'this review may contain spoilers'Danny ocean and the rest of the boys are back with a vengeance in this third and hopefully last installment of the oceans series.Soderbergh, well to put it this way,'to say sorry' to all the fans for the weirdness and failure of oceans 12,as a consolation,decided to make oceans 13.all the stars of the previous film are back here except Julia Roberts and Catherine zeta Jones but there's a new addition to the series,the legend 'WHOOAA' Al Pacino. Willy bank played by(Pacino),is about to open a new casino in las Vegas.Reuben a member of Danny oceans crew,is bank's partner.for some reason Willy wants to break up the partnership by giving him a goodbye present of 10.000$.Reuben disappointed and insulted by Willy's behavior,suffers a stroke. So Danny and the rest of the crew decide,to hit back on Bank by figuring out a plan to destroy his multi-million business on the casino's opening night.Oceans 13 is good movie,not as good as 11,but obviously better than 12. the plot is just plain simple nothing special.the problem here is that the movie doesn't cover any new territory,its all been done.even the great Al Pacino cant make the difference, hes practically given nothing to do throughout the movie,totally wasted and there are times where he does seem bored and tired with the role.actually all the main characters seemed tired.no one stands out.their body language seemed more like:'oww lets just pull off this damn job as quickly as possible,go home and forget it'.There is more talking(dribs and drabs) than action and the main problem is the Pace which is to fast not allowing you to catch up with it and understand exactly whats going on.in all honesty iam not a fan of the oceans series.The only reason why i saw this is because of Al Pacino. otherwise i would of skipped itas in 12,Andy Garcia again is given no screen time,a few minutes here and there.What was the point in bringing him in???Clooney and Pitt always kept talking...about what exactly???Matt Damon was all over the place..the rest of the crew,most of the time sitting around,playing cards..boy what a waste a time and talent.obviously most of the 89 million budget was used to pay the actors salary.I suppose for the actors this movie was like a walk in the park.sit around,a few jokes,few drinks,a laugh and end with a nice pay check in their pockets.NO problemo!!its an OK movie.its worth a look.there are some good visuals,and OK scenes.I doubt there will be an Oceans 14,after Clooney stated that 13 would be his last.and from what i gathered from this movie Soderbergh had nothing more to say.But if Soderbergh decides to make another installment in the near future here's a tip.Use Garcia and Pacino in a more satisfactory manner,then bring in Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci as the bad guys.Just an idea.my vote 6/10.",Null,0,0,5 October 2011
Once Upon a Time in America," C'era una volta in America! the new 269 minute version!
","'this review contains spoilers'I wanted to write down a review here long time ago,unfortunately never got round to it,but last night after viewing the newly extended version of once upon a time in America with 26 minutes of additional scenes,the time has now arrived to share my thoughts and feelings on what i describe a marvelous and unforgettable experience!It has to be said..watching it at the cinema is totally different than watching it on DVD.i do own the movie,admired it on numerous occasions,but boy o boy i didn't capture me as much as last night;a good explanation perhaps is sitting in a dark movie theater isolated from everyone and everything,you feel part of that world that is been portrayed on screen.Like never before you manage to taste the profound feeling of friendship,betrayal,love and greed all of which are masterfully told by the maestro Sergio Leone,and most of all you can feel the heart and soul on which the film is founded and constructed on. Its an epic tale of ; Jewish gangsters that make their way through the prohibition era,narrates the rise and fall of David'Noodles' Aaronson,Max,Patsy and Cockeye!A period of time that goes from the early 1900's to the late 1960's which includes many flashbacks and flashfowards about their childhood and adulthood...the characters are loyal and respect each other but towards the end enter a fase that will finish not only in tragedy but also in mystery.this new version includes six to seven new added scenes,bringing it to a running time of 269 minutes,the version that Leone originally intended to establish,but got reduced to 229 minutes(European version).1)When Noodlees goes and visits his friends grave there is a scene while talking with the owner of the cemetery, a car(with covered windows)appears in the background and drives around the block to spy on him.noodles suspects something strange about the car so he writes down the plate number.2)the information about the car leads him to senator Bailey's house,while standing outside the gate that same car he saw at the cemetery is coming out of the mansion and eventually explodes..then this leads to the part when noodles is sitting in fat moe's watching firefighters in TV clearing the fire on a car...3)while noodles is waiting in the street to take Deborah on a date,he has a chat with the driver.4)After getting rid of Joe and his gang noodles drives the car with his friends on board in the water,an added scene shows max patsy and cockeye laughing it off in the water,and max tries to find noodles who disappears.5)Deborah is playing Cleopatra during a play at the theater and noodles is there as a spectator.6)before noodles and max meet in the end,max has a conversation in his studio with the famous politician that gets shot in the leg earlier in the film. other few scenes show how noodles meets Eve. Do these extra scenes add something more to the film??well certainly they help understand the movie even more,they cover up plot holes that were existent in the previous version, maybe a few sequences were not necessary,but it doesn't really matter. these sequences though do not improve the Frank monaldi character,he still remains in complete mystery.this film is a masterpiece no doubt;if Sergio Leone would still be alive,he would be proud of his children,Andrea and Raffaella,who played a big part to finally bring to life the version that their late father had envisioned.A film that left him heartbroken by the lousy editing of the U.S version that flopped big time and that received extremely negative reviews.Flashbacks were all chopped off and the film's events were narrated in chronological order. Its safe to say that justice has been made.Works of art should just be left alone. This film definitely ranks up there as one of greatest gangster movies ever made and it surely worth the watch!!Robert De Niro is exceptional,Woods is fantastic and the rest of the cast delivers on a high note.Noodles turns towards the camera,smiles,credits start to appear and the music starts to play......EPICIT JUST LEAVES YOU IN TEARS!!",9,6,10,21 October 2012
The Godfather: Part III," The Godfather part 3
","'this review may contain spoilers'There is a bit of a story that led to the creation of this third film back in 1990.After the huge success of Godfathers 1 and 2,which both managed to win nine academy awards in total including best picture of 1972 and 1974, Coppola decided to call it a day.For 16 years Paramount pictures approached Coppola on numerous occasions with an offer to make a third chapter,but he always refused as he felt that the first two films had told the complete story of the Corleone family.It was for his delicate financial situation that compelled him to embark on a final trip with the mafioso family.So he accepted the offer.the film is set in 1979 with an aging Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) now in his late 60's,wrecked with guilt for his past deeds,who is trying to legitimize the family.the movie sees Michaels involvement with the Vatican bank which has suffered a big loss of 700 million dollars.He decides to help by investing 600 million and by taking control of the Vaticans 25 percent interest in the Internazionale Immobiliare,the worlds biggest real estate company.Vincent Mancini(Andy Garcia),Michaels nephew and son of the late Santino Corleone,is one of the main characters in the movie.He starts off being his uncles bodyguard,gets slowly involved with the family business and then eventually becomes the new Godfather.There is also a love affair that takes place between Vincent and Michaels daughter Mary(Sophia Coppola).The film didn't do so well at the box office and was considered by many a failure and a massive disappointment.It has to be said it wasn't Coppolas fault on how this film turned out.For a start Coppola and Puzo,wanted six months to write the script,but Paramount refused by giving them only six WEEKS. Now that is not much time to write a proper story for this kind of FILM. Paramount,at every cost, wanted this movie to be released on Christmas day 1990,Coppola was forced to rush in to production without a complete script.. so that explains the immense pressure that He and Puzo had on their shoulders to bring this long-awaited film to the big screen.Godfather part 3 is not a bad film but it is neither a great one, it's just a good film nothing more.One of the main issues that is quite frustrating is the excessive use of the ' black screen' that appears quite often in the first half of the movie. The black screen is a technique used at the end of a long cinematic sequence to notify the viewer that we are moving to a new topic or 'better' material. Here this technique brings away the power of the scene because they already don't last long and then when it starts to generate momentum the screen goes black. This is a result of what you call a rush job. Secondly another main problem is the Editing!! Scenes don't flow naturally together and we often jump from one topic to another far to quickly. The viewer can never properly get engaged with the movie!!! Finally the script., in the first two Godfather movies the plot primarily focused upon the businesses in which the characters were involved in and how they managed to find a way out through violence, set ups, betrayal and convincing smart dialog. But most importantly they were constructed upon the strong atmosphere and well written scenes that made the first two pictures monumental. Here in part 3 the Vatican affairs and corruption world play second fiddle to the main theme which is Michael's seek for Redemption for his past deeds.It's not really a problem but the slow pace and the not so convincing overlooked dealings of Michael with the dons drag the film down a little.Though the movie is flawed it still has some strengths that are worth discussing, the music is very good and and is one of the strong points of the movie,the production design and photography are nice and can't be faulted , Michaels confession with cardinale Lamberto and the Atlantic city wipe out leave an impression, the climatic ending that leads to Michael's scream over his daughter's death a very emotional finale that manages to put a tear in your eye and definitely is worth watching.Does the Godfather part 3 bring the hole story to a satisfactory conclusion? Yes and no. We see what happens to Michael as that is the most important thing because at the end of the day this is a one man's trilogy. It's Michaels story, about his rise and fall. On the other hand though we don't know what happens to all the other characters such as Kay,Conny, Anthony but most importantly to the new boss of the Corleone family don Vincenzo Corleone. What happens after that tragic night, what happens to the family under his guidance? Does he do good or not? Is he the right man for the job? In what kind of activities does he drag the family into? All these points mentioned remain unfortunately in complete mystery and left to the viewers imagination. A fourth movie is necessary because it would bring the story to a conclusion Once and for all.The Godfather part 3 is weak in comparison to its big brothers no doubt, but in its own right it does deliver.the movie should of turned out better with the kind of ambitious script it had and If Coppola had more time It would of been certainly a 'Masterpiece'. (Don't blame Coppola, blame paramount that denied the movie From being a classic)!!!!I definitely recommend it because despite its shortcomings it does feel a godfather movie plus there are periods when It touches moments of brilliance and mostly it's part of the best trilogy ever made in Cinematic history. 'Just when you thought you was out,they pull you back in'.my vote:8/10",8,1,3,27 September 2011
Goodfellas," 'Great maybe',-'Masterpiece'miles away'
","'this review may contain spoilers''As far back as i can remember i've always wanted to be a gangster'.Based on a true story,the film is set in 1955,East New York,Brooklyn',with a young Henry Hill who decides to join the Lucchese crime family in order to become someone in a neighborhood full of nobody's.gradually he gains an important and respected figure amongst the crew and has the opportunity to make contact with individuals such as Jimmy'the Gent'Conway,who loves hijacking trucks and seen by many as a legend and Tommy De Vito,a crazy maniac who kills people even if a wrong word is said towards him..'so you better watch yourself'!!!the film objective is to show everyone how life is in the criminal underworld,in what kind of business henry and co are in and the the sort of living conditions that they can afford with this type of living.. 'Even better than VIPS'.I guess that is one of the most attractive aspects of the Mafia.Have everything you please..wow!!The movie received so much praise and consideration on being maybe the greatest mob movie ever!!now lets not exaggerate here. i take nothing away from this motion picture,its pretty good and has a great cast:Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci,Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all of which gave tremendous performances no doubt....the PLOT!now thats were the problem is!!The first time i saw it,i only managed to watch half of it and i was impressed.When i got round to see it all i was left frustrated.From then on i lost that appetite to watch it again..Let me Explane. The first half starts off well and stylish,Henry's introduction as a kid in the Lucchese crew,or when he meets and marries Karren.. everything up until the whacking of Billy Batts is good..but from then on the story starts losing its magic and going off track.The end seemed a little unclear and rushed!!The second half of the film seemed detached and completely different from the first half.One aspect of the film that i didn't tolerate was the excessive use of the F-word.'Blime me',it was used well 246 times.!!!Half way through you get sick of hearing it.well more than sick 'Tired' is the best word. this is not Scorsese's only movie mind you that the f-word is used on a frequent basis,try the Departed or CASINO where Joe Pesci says 21 F****S less than 2 minutes!!Scorsese specialty i suppose.To call Goodfellas the greatest mob movie ever is over the top.For me there are superior gangster movies out there such as Coppola's Godfathers 1 and 2 or Sergio Leones Once upon a time in America. the movie that I'm reviewing now is good but i don't agree on it being a masterpiece..it falls short by miles!!! I'm most probably in the vast minority here for not admiring it but hey everyone has got their own opinions and thoughts. I'll definitely go back to it in future and re watch it and maybe have a different idea on it,but for the time being this gangster flick cant even be mentioned in the same breath of the GODFATHER and the GODFATHER PART 2!! NOW THATS A FACT!!!",Null,0,1,2 November 2011
