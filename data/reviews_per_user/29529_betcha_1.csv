The New World," Stuuuuuuuuuuuuuupid!
","Worst Movie I've ever seen. If I wanted to see a nature film I would stay home and watch PBS!Honestly, what were they thinking. I laughed all the way through because it was so inaccurate and portrayed the Indians as ballerinas and dancing monkeys. If you've seen the commercial you've seen it all- there really is nothing else to the movie.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!! No dialog, no story, no point at all except to watch geese and water run over rocks. Everyone in the theater left astounded at the lack of substance. That is all those that stayed. Over half the theater left because it was so boring and had no point at all.",1,3,12,28 January 2006
