Requiem for a Dream," dark.
","..if you want to be disturbed by the dark and seedy world that surrounds us, the underbelly of a sick society that we are not usually privy to, watch it. Brilliant characterisation and a very believable plot makes this film enjoyable - it's all about drugs and addiction; how it can corrode your soul and mind. The story is based in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York and we follow a year in the life of a trio of twenty-somethings and the main character, Harry's mother. The story reveals how people can get sucked so easily into a dark and complicated vortex, where there seems to be no escape. Few films show the truth about what can happen with drugs and don't just glamoriser the whole scene, this is an exception, well worth the watch - wish that I'd seen this as a teenager!",10,2,4,15 January 2006
