The Ring," Darkly Beautiful Horror Movie
","Gore Verbinski's 'The Ring',released in 2002, still possesses a distinct eerie quality which continues to effectively creep out audiences 12 years after it's initial release. This is largely due to the wise directorial choices made by 'Pirates of the Caribbean' director Verbinski in shifting the focus away from gore and more on atmosphere.What sets 'The Ring' apart from most horror movies of today and recent years, is the emphasis put on atmosphere, visuals and suspense, much unlike popular films such as the 'Saw' franchise, which rely more on gore and gratuitous torture scenes to shock or scare the audience. Unlike the 'Saw' sequels(or even 'The Human Centipede')which are just excuses to show people being killed in graphic and disturbing ways, 'The Ring' hooks you in with a compelling and interesting story with revelations and discoveries made one after the other. Technically, the film unfolds like a mystery, with reporter Rachel Keller(played sturdily by Naomi Watts) investigating the curse of a strange videotape and the dark secrets it possesses. No more will be said about the plot, as the fun of watching the film for the first time is discovering the secrets of the tape. A second viewing is where one can be more able to appreciate the enormous amount of craft and effort put in by Verbinski and his production team, which is where much of the beauty of the film lies.'The Ring' is set in Seattle and surrounding Pacific Northwest locales, which gives the film an exceedingly rainy and gloomy look. The filters and colour schemes that Verbinski and cinematographer Bojan Bazelli employ to capture these locations is of a sickly green and blue tint, which makes the look of the whole movie appear somewhat unnatural, or 'off', which is subtle but extremely effective in it's own right.The score, by renowned composer Hans Zimmer, is absolutely brilliant in evoking different moods throughout the film. While there are the somewhat typical loud booms in the soundtrack when something frightening or tense is occurring on screen, it is the quieter segments of the score that give the film it's unique and beautiful sense of melancholy. Zimmer employs many types of instruments, including effective use of the piano, to give 'The Ring' a haunting quality that echoes with sadness and despair, with sinister violins succeeding in painting an atmosphere of dread, while in contrast pianos and other instruments combine to create the melancholy atmosphere. There are even segments of the score, for example a grim lullaby from one of the film's characters, that actually give the film an almost fairytale like quality. The eight minute track from the score, entitled 'The Well', represents a fantastic overview of most of the musical ideas explored by Zimmer, and is a great listening experience in itself.The core theme at the heart of the film is the negative side of television. For example, the two(rather clichéd) teenage girls at the beginning of the film discuss how the unhealthy waves from watching too much TV can result in brain cell loss. Later in the film, Rachel is out on the balcony looking into the adjacent apartments across the street. The camera pans over several windows, showing people transfixed to the television screen, accompanied by Zimmer's sad and moody score. And finally, the television acts as the bringer of death to a major character. Since television is such a large part of contemporary daily human life and culture, 'The Ring' shows us a glimpse of the negative side of it and portrays the television as a gateway to another, sinister world that could potentially have the power to kill us. By having the story focus on something as universal as television, 'The Ring' has the power to unsettle basically anyone.One amusing thing about the film is how much of a product of it's time it has now become, mostly due to the fact that the main plot device is a VHS tape(Remember those?). Since VHS tapes are now a thing of the past and have since been succeeded by DVDs and Blu-rays, some plot holes in the narrative do come to mind if you think about it for a bit. But never mind. The movie is too beautifully made and creepy to get nitpicky over, complete with a bleak and terrifying non-ending that will get you thinking, 'will it ever stop?'",9,1,1,26 September 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Incredibly generic apart from an inspired final act
","'Thor: The Dark World' basically plays out exactly as one would expect from a Marvel Universe movie. There are many wisecracks, fights, explosions and post credit scenes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just that a good 75 – 80% of the film gives off an aura of 'been there, done that'. Of all the Marvel Universe films that have been released thus far, beginning with the fantastic 'Ironman' in 2008 and most recently at the time of writing with the average 'Guardians of the Galaxy' in 2014, this second film starring the God of Thunder would rank close to the bottom, but although since all but one Marvel Universe film is 'OK' at the least, that's still saying that even the lesser films of this saga are only just entertaining and nothing more.Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston give the only performances of note as the two main characters, with Hemsworth again owning the role and Hiddleston showing Loki's sneaky and cunning side with amusing results (A scene where Loki transforms into different characters, including a certain Captain, is one of the few genuinely imaginative and entertaining parts of the film.) The only problem I have with Loki is that, during the first half especially, he just isn't in the movie enough. For roughly half the running time, Loki is reduced to sitting in a prison cell by himself, which isn't high on the list of the many things I want to watch Loki do. Apart from these two, none of the other actors are particularly memorable, which is a shame since there are great actors like Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins in the film as well. No one in the film gives a bad performance, it's just that the performances are only serviceable and nothing more. For example, take the villain, Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston. Malekith growls and snarls in both English and Dark Elfish in a deep menacing voice, complete with threatening villain features and a plan to destroy the universe (I wonder though, what a boring life that must be if your plan to destroy the universe actually succeeds). Malekith is the definition of a bland, stereotypical villain in an Action/Adventure/Fantasy/Sci-Fi film. He does nothing interesting, his plans are conventional, he possesses no individual or memorable characteristics, his lines are never witty and even his physical appearance is bland and generic. This is a shame since he is played by Christopher Eccleston, an actor I like very much and whom I know can pull off memorable villains. This then begs the question, why hire a good actor like Eccleston only to alter his voice, have him speak gibberish and obscure him in makeup so that he is close to unrecognizable? You might as well hire some random guy off the street of roughly the same height/build to play the character if there's that much makeup and alterations rather than hire a professional. Lots of money could be saved and hardly anyone would notice.The whole film, except for the inspired finale, has a run-of-the-mill feel to it. Other aspects, such as the direction, cinematography, production design and score feel bland and workmanlike. The composer of the film is Brian Tyler, whose work I usually enjoy very much, but he phones it in here, offering standard order action movie music. Usually I find Tyler's work has a distinct personal stamp to it, with him being especially good at subtly emotional cues in the midst of action movies (For example, his work on 'Eagle Eye', 'Battle: Los Angeles' and even 'Thor: The Dark World's cousin, 'Ironman 3') but none of that was evident here. Alan Taylor directs most of the film with no personal style or flair (Much unlike Kenneth Branagh from the first 'Thor' film) until the truly inspired and entertaining finale which is a nice break from watching cities getting obliterated by otherworldly beings in action films nowadays. I won't spoil but I will say that this is where the film truly becomes entertaining and I only wish that the preceding 80 minutes or so had been as fun and creative as the final act. Let's just hope that director Alan Taylor's next film, 'Terminator: Genisys', is more in the vein of the final 20 minutes of 'Thor: The Dark World' and not the other 80 minutes of boring, generic action and exposition.Finally, one problem I have with not just this film, but the entire Marvel Universe, is that in each new standalone adventure, the stakes are always low, which doesn't exactly make for edge-of-your-seat viewing. Because whatever happens to Thor, Ironman, Captain America or anybody major, you know they'll survive because A: The film will extensively tease what's to come, B: The next film will most likely already be in production, C: Even if a character does die then they usually find a way to revive and D: Marvel has already planned out their films until at least the end of the decade. Combine the knowledge of all these factors while watching a Marvel film such as this one and the result is incredibly uninvolving. There may be lots of action, but it is rarely exciting, since you know that these characters will defeat the enemy and be all ready for the next adventure. In the end, 'Thor: The Dark World' feels less like a movie and more like a product, only here as filler to advertise and build up to what's to come, while unfortunately forgetting to create a unique identity or personality all its own.",4,2,3,27 December 2014
Fast Five," Fun action film (may contain spoilers)
","If you like your action movies realistic, I wouldn't recommend Fast Five to you. Although if you enjoy watching one preposterous action scene and stunt after another and don't care that the characters appear to be some kind of superhumans that evade machine gun fire effortlessly and are able to fall off massive cliffs and not sustain any injury then you will find yourself extremely well rewarded.Fast Five is an expertly made and shot action film. I said expertly shot because unlike most action movies these days the cinematography is not shaky and you get a real sense of the fight choreography and stunt driving. Also, some recent action films are cut so quickly that it all just looks like an incomprehensible mess. Thankfully, Fast Five isn't like that either.Fast Five is most unlike a Fast and Furious film. Previous films in the series were about street racing and infiltrating the criminal underworld whereas this one is more of a heist movie on the lines of the Oceans Eleven films. I haven't seen the the first three 'F and F' films all the way through but I've seen enough of them on TV to get a feel for what they're like. The fourth film 'Fast and Furious' was OK but didn't leave a huge impression on me. Fast Five, however, is five times better in almost every way (well, the acting is still pretty basic with the actors doing what they're required to do and nothing more). I gotta admit though, the arrival of Dwayne Johnson into this franchise as tough agent Hobbs has also been a noticeable improvement.The best dialogue scenes in the movie are between Hobbs and Dom Toretto(Vin Diesel). The two also have a crazy smackdown together which, after the final vault chase, is the movies best scene. Now I'll go as far as to say that the vault chase is probably one of the best chase sequences I've ever seen. I don't want to give too much away because I want to encourage you to watch this film and see why most critics and fans are giving this positive reviews.However, like I said at the beginning of the review if you like realistic action films like the Jason Bourne films you probably won't enjoy this as much. Although, if you don't care that the main characters would probably be dead by the 20 minute mark in the film in real life then you will be extremely well rewarded.Fast Five dosen't try to be realistic. It knows its absurd and dosen't take itself too seriously. For the people with broader imaginations for preposterous stunts you will have a fun time. Who cares if everything in this movie is impossible? its only a movie",7,2,3,5 July 2012
The Martian," Good but nothing mind blowing
","The Martian was an entertaining movie, however don't be fooled by the ridiculously high ratings that this is a classic, intense experience that is on par with Gravity. The film underachieves in far too many categories for this to become even a worthy comparison. The film boasts fantastic visual effects and the Mars atmosphere is rendered beautifully, however the main issues inherent with the film reside mostly in the script and tone the filmmakers choose to employ in order to tell this story.Firstly, the film's mostly light tone cannot compensate for it's sprawling 140 minute length. Throughout the film, astronaut Mark Watney (Likably played by Matt Damon) is relentlessly optimistic about his predicament. So optimistic in fact that, apart from a couple of instances of psychological breakdowns, Mark is portrayed as ultimately a flawless character. This results in the film not being nearly as interesting or engaging as it could be, as the audience rarely gets the sense that Mark's situation could very well end in death. This lack of character depth transcends to the countless other characters on Earth. There are many great actors here, but because of the limitations of the script, none of them ever really rise above the stereotypes or caricatures in their respective characters.The overall light tone of the film gives off the sense that not much is at stake, therefore resulting in a much less compelling film had it been made as a more serious drama. Despite being released around Oscar season, the film gives off the impression that it would have been more at home during the summer blockbuster season, as the frequent wisecracks, retro soundtrack and jokey tone are far more reminiscent of the Marvel movies than films like Gravity or Interstellar. This means that the film begins to grow slightly tedious in it's latter half, as the 140 minute film begins to drag because of the lack of intensity and urgency.A curious thing, however, is that despite this length, director Ridley Scott chooses to rush through many defining moments of the film. For example, literally within the first few minutes Mark is left behind on Mars by his crew. While this does make for a fairly riveting and exciting opening, the cost of character development and the chance to really get invested in Mark's relationship with his crewmates is too great. Scott also rushes through Mark's rescue sequence at the end of the film, which is a shame since it's a key moment in the film and what is there is quite enthralling. It's just that the main problem with this scene is that it's a glimmer of what The Martian could have been, intense, life threatening situations dramatically conveyed with atmospheric space visuals.Overall, The Martian is a disappointment. It is a film that failed to deliver on it's potential. I have not read the book the movie was based on so I can't comment on how faithful to the source material it is, but overall, I was let down by The Martian. The character development was lacking and the choice to tell this story with a light tone just didn't completely work for a 140 minute film, as it rarely feels that nothing is at stake, which resulted in a predictable movie. While it seems that most audiences are embracing the lighter and jokier vibe this film has, it unfortunately becomes the film's undoing, as the comedy robs the story of dramatic tension.",6,8,17,5 November 2015
