Skyfall," The Return of Bond!
","This is my first review of 2012 and its the new Bond film 'Skyfall'. After the disappointing 'Quantum of Solace' Bond's mission this time is to keep a computer drive that has a list of British agents from being used against them. He chases the man who has it and they have a brawl on top of a train.Eve,(who is actually 'Moneypenny')posing as an agent sent to assist Bond has them in her cross hairs but hesitates to take the shot because she might hit Bond but M orders her to take it. She does, and hits Bond who falls into the river and is believed to be dead. A few months later, the British government is upset with MI6 for losing the list; specifically with M. She is told that she'll be allowed to retire but she refuses to leave till the matter is resolved. So she returns to HQ to work on it but as she arrives, there's an explosion. See the movie to find out what happens!This time Sam Mendes takes the helm and I must say this is the best Daniel Craig Bond movie yet! The film goes back to the original Bond elements missed in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace such as music, gadgets, characters, cars and girls. Again the classic gun barrel returns but at the end of film, the film loses a star for that. The locations, big budget sets and stunts are photographed and filmed near to perfection! What made my day was the return of Bond's classic DB5 in the third act of the film. Still with the mods that were installed in Goldfinger, along with the classic Bond theme, you have one hell of the third act. Saying that however the film has some sadness with one of main characters getting killed and the DB5 getting blown up and destroyed by Bond's enemy Silva played by Javier Bardem in the last 10 minutes.With the return of the original Bond elements, Great direction, acting, editing and writing this is very well in the top 5 of best Bond films. 9 out of 10!",9,1,8,6 December 2012
Pearl Harbor," This could have been bigger then Titanic!!
","Pearl Harbor could have been bigger then Titanic, so what happened??? There was a number of things that caused this movie to flop it the way it did. 1. The story about best friends falling for that same girl. 2. The films running time of 187 minutes. 3. Using some cheap CGI shots. 4. The attack on Pearl Harbor doesn't happen till 93 minutes into the film. 5. The love and passion. 6. The music. 7. The uneven filming and pace.I'm blaming Michael Bay for the films box office flop! It looks like he tried to copy Titanic's method of a love story, it just doesn't belong in a movie like this. Even though that the love story didn't go with the film. The film had great special effects, the attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the best ever filmed! But you can tell sometimes that they ran out of money because some of the effects are cheap CGI shots. (Notice this in the Battle of Britian dogfight).Maybe if this film had a better writer, if Michael Bay was thinking right not to have a crappy love story and if the movie was cut down to an easy 2 hours, (and there was a lot of stuff that he could have cut from the film). This could have been one of the biggest blockbusters in film history. I'll give the movie a 4 out of 10.",4,0,1,21 May 2006
Quantum of Solace," Not As Good As Casino Royale
","Quantum of Solace is the 22nd Bond movie in the series. Quantum of Solace continues the high octane adventures of James Bond from Casino Royale. Picking up literally hours after the previous film left off, after being betrayed by Vesper. 007 fights to make his latest mission personal and bloody. Pretty much the same style film the Casino Royale was but not as good in story and pace. The film does have some good stunt work with very little CGI used. But its missing Bond elements like Casino Royale did, there's no 'MoneyPenny', 'Q', Gadgets, and there's very little Bond music used in the film, except the end credits where the play the Bond theme. The classic gun barrel scene does return but you don't see it till the end of the film before the end credits role. This latest installment for James Bond is good I recommend people go see it because its James Bond but it does share the same passion for what Casino Royale did.",5,3,6,20 November 2008
Driven," Harlin and Stallone Rejoin!
","After the success of 'Cliffhanger' Sylvester Stallone and director Renny Harlin join forces again to make another great movie called 'Driven'. Released in 2001 along side 'The Fast And The Furious' both movies were in the cinema at the same week and they battle together at the box office. The story about a world champion F1 driver named Beau Brandenberg faces a new threat when a new rookie driver named Jimmy Bly joins the opposite side. But with media and female distractions affecting his performance. Former hotshot driver Joe Tanto joins to support and watch Jimmy to stay on track.Written by Sylvester Stallone in a matter of days and rewritten by another writers in the months that went on, Stallone did the final screenplay for the film. Director Renny Harlin was brought on board to direct putting his another film he was filming at the time 'Mindhunters' aside to direct this film for his friend Stallone. Renny Harlin did an excellent job at directing this film and he knows how to keep the film in a fast pace and the film goes really quick.Along from the great directing and pace, the film has got some of the best special effects and crash sequences even filmed for a film. Renny Harlin put the major crashes in slow mo just to show you how a driver reacts when he crashes. Another thing great about this movie is the great sound and sound effects. If you watch it in DTS sound with a sub woofer, make sure that you strap it down to the floor because it will move across the floor. Even though it went head to head against 'The Fast And The Furious' at the box office this movie had better special effects and story line. This movie will be enjoyed by the whole family it contains very little violence and swearing unlike 'The Fast And The Furious'. More people around the world today are interested more in normal performance cars instead of F1 cars. but this movie shows an illegal F1 street race in the main street in Chicago. If ripping up the road at 400kp/h is your thing then you will like his movie, I did. 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,12 October 2006
The Dark Knight," Not Perfect But Still A Great Film.
","People said that 'The Dark Knight' surpasses 'Batman Begins'. In a way it does. The action is a lot better, the story is better and darker and Batman is more cooler then ever. Christian Bale is great as Batman, even topping his performance from 'Batman Begins', Michael Caine returns as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Aaron Eckhart all played their roles perfectly and really makes the story work but the most outstanding performance role in the movie goes to Heath Ledger who played The Joker.Having saying that however the movie did have some disappointments. First: The films running time is a bit long and the movie does lag in some parts. Second: Two-Face didn't have enough screen time he only had about 40 mins and only fights Batman once which ends up him falling off a building and falling to his death. Third: The Joker doesn't die which leaves the viewer wondering about his fate. The movie loses stars for this.Christoper Nolan does deserve credit for this film. He wrote the story, not only was he the main director of the film, he also directed the first and second unit to make sure the film was perfect. I loved the film very very much but it just missed a few things and some things could have been better. But overall It's a great film that tops up there with 'Spiderman', 'Superman', 'X-Men' and 'Ironman'.",8,1,2,23 July 2008
Halloween," Excellent Film!
","In 1978 John Carpenter and Debra Hill joined forces again to create on the best horror films to date. With a tight budget and deadlines they create a basic story that could happen to you in your neck of the woods. A silent unstoppable babysitter killer on the lose. The story is about Micheal Myers an unstoppable killer that escapes from his metal hospital up state. Being in there since he was 6 for murdering his older sister while she was having sex with her boyfriend on one cold Halloween night. Now 21 Micheal heads to back to the town to cause more trouble. He hunts down and stalks young high school students. He's chasing one particularly his baby sister Laurie Strode.After finishing school Laurie and her friends plan to have a Halloween party after they finish babysitting kids and trick or treating. Micheal Myers (or the shape) as they call him in this one watches their every move, even stealing a car to drive past the pack walking home from school. But Micheal's doctor Sam Loomis is on his tail trying to bring Micheal down before he gets to Laurie.He slowly walks around the town with his white faceless mask and his knife and starts killing Laurie's friend one by one. And the showdown between Laurie and Micheal is well filmed and very scary. Even though the movie has very little blood and gore, its very scary and with John Carpanter's music score makes it even scarier! Don't watch this movie alone if you haven't seen it before because it will scare you with Micheal's acts of hiding in the dark. 10 out of 10",10,4,5,5 March 2007
Back to the Future Part II," The Darkest One Of The Trilogy!
","Back To The Future 2 is the darkest one of the classic trilogy. The story continues on where the first one left off with the Delorean taking off into the sky. This part of the trilogy takes Doc and Marty to the year 2015. Where Doc founds out some shocking news about Marty's future family, Marty fixes the problem but on the way he buys a Sports Armamic that contain information about winning teams of major sports dated between 1950 to 2000.After Doc finds out about this, he throws the Aramaic in the bin. But the old Biff finds the Aramaic and overhears Doc about the Delorean's secret propose. When Marty and Doc go down to Hilldale to rescue Marty's girlfriend Jennifer. The old Biff steals the Delorean and takes it back to the year 1955 when Biff was still 17 and gives to the book to him. (Watch the movie if you want to know what happens) The DVD presentation of the film is great. I watched it the other night on a High Definition TV and DVD Player and its the best presentation of the movie yet, the picture was breath taking, sharp with no grain. The sound is outstanding and blows you out of the room with you choosing either 5.1 Dolby Digtal or 5.1 DTS it doesn't matter they sound the same but DTS is a lot louder and sometimes come move the sub-woofer across the floor. 9 out of 10 Also which it for the flying Delorean!",9,1,3,26 June 2006
Casino Royale," A Very Different Bond Film.
","What came I say about the new Bond film. Its a very different film altogether. The movie starts off without the famous 'gun barrel' scene. Instead the movies starts in black and white, (These are flashbacks or something). The gun barrel does appear buts it in color and the main theme starts after that. Casino Royale is more like a prequel then a continue on into the series. Daniel Craig plays a darker Bond then Pierce Brosnan but I'm going to say that I sadly missed Pierce Brosnan's Bond, he played one of the best since Sean Connery.Martin Campbell who directed 'Goldeneye' which is still one of the best Bond films to date returns to the helm. The action is great and stunts are out of this world. The special effects are excellent in this film, and very little CGI is shown unlike 'Die Another Day' which was full of it, which made in a little too much for a Bond film. The editing to great, the story is great and the Bond girl Eva Green is hot, sexy and perfect for the role. Judi Dench returns to the role of 'M' and lets just say that you wouldn't want to miss with her in this film, she's straight down to the point and swears a lot.But the film also has a few down flaws and looses stars because of it. The first thing is the 'Gun Barrel' scene at the start it doesn't feel like a Bond film without it. Second there's very little Bond music in this film the only Bond music is at the end with the ending credits. Third its missing Bond gadgets, a Bond film must have gadgets but this film has none at all. Fourth its missing many Bond elements, There's no 'Q', 'Moneypenny'. But the film does return Felix Leiter since he was last seen in Licence To Kill. The Overall result is a little disappointing but its a still a great film. But it doesn't feel like its a part of the series, its feels like 'Never Say Never Again' Bond movie.",6,0,0,8 December 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," The Best One Since The Original
","Wow! I was surprised when I saw this movie from the first time on DVD. I wasn't expecting anything in this movie, just another big budget Hollywood film with no story line and few gun fights but this movie was a lot more then that.Live Free or Die Hard (Die Hard 4.0 as its called in Australia) is really good and sometimes surpasses the original film in stunts and action. Even though they toned down the swearing it's still violent and the stunts blow you out of the water. Bruce Willis returns as the aging John McClane, Timothy Olyphant plays the ruthless internet con artist Thomas Gabriel, Justin Long plays the computer geek Matt Farrell and becomes McClane's sidekick in the film.We welcome Len Wiseman to the Die Hard director list along side with John McTiernan and Renny Harlin. Len Wiseman should stick to action blockbusters more then Vampire Movies (Underworld 1 and 2) which were good films but he makes action films so much better. His directing in this film is his best to date. The special effects are great with very little CGI used, the stunts are great, the original Die Hard music themes are used, its action packed and the climax is the best since Die Hard 2 (I since reckon that Die Hard 2 had the best climax in the series) There's also an unrated version of the film out that contains more swearing and the violence is toned up in small amounts. John McClane says the F word about 30 times in this version, even saying his most famous line 'Yippee Ki Yay Motherf--ker' at the end of film. But overall this film was a great way to finish off the Die Hard Series, even though that Bruce Willis is in talks to make a 5th film with Len Wiseman, but time will tell. Highly Recommanded",9,1,3,24 December 2007
Fast Five," Solid Sequel
","My first review of 2011 is 'Fast Five' and once its non stop action. After my major disappointment with the fourth installment my first thought walking into the cinema was pretty much the same reaction after walking out of the fourth movie. Sure the movies now are much focused on action instead of cars however the car scenes in this film surpass the ones from the fourth movie. Justin Lin must of taken pointers after the fourth movie to cut down on the CGI and use more real life cars and stuntman, this has paid off.The overall result isn't perfect but its sure a hell lot better. The cars in this film mainly are American Muscle V8's with the odd Japanese import every now and then. The writing of the film is a lot better and there actually a story and character development that was missing from the fourth movie. It was great to finally have most of the characters from the all the movies into one for one big adventure.The only cons about this movie is running time of 130 minutes, to date its the longest 'Furious' movie in the series and should have been cut down. Another con is lack of races. Sure there where cars but not enough racing to pleasure the hardcore 'Furious' fan. However there is a few show stoppers that will please these included the fight between Vin Diesel and The Rock, the million dollar quarter mile race which includes the four main characters in Dodge Chargers and the climax which includes a giant safe, two bad ass Chargers, a bridge and a lot of smashed police cars.Younger viewers will be turned off this movie due to the lack of racing and the films length, I counted at least 15 young people walking out after 30 minutes into the film. The first major races doesn't happen until a hour into the film. Recommended",9,5,10,21 April 2011
Pineapple Express," Average
","If your thinking that 'Pineapple Express' is like 'Superbad or 'Knocked Up' think again!. Even thought that the movie had some funny moments it doesn't live up to Seth Rogen's previous work. The script is poor and it sometimes it looks like it was rushed. Even the directing is poor and the editing looks like it was done on a laptop.The characters are also poor, Seth Rogan should had cast himself for a different part instead of the main role. James Franco was average but not his best and Gary Cole should be shot for accepting a role like this. You get confused very quickly and not sure who's who.The movie has got a lot of drug use and swearing it also has some very violent scenes with lots of blood. The movie loses stars for poor script, poor acting, poor directing and poor editing. It gets 5 stars for some of the funny moments in the film. Go and see this movie for yourself and make your own mind up about it. I thought the movie was very poor and only average. It doesn't share the same passion of Superbad or Knocked Up.",5,5,11,12 August 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Disappointing!
","I was very disappointed about the Simpson's Movie, I'd prefer watching the TV show instead of the movie. The story is very simple and it feels like you watching a over long episode.They should have taken the Simpson's to new limits in the movie, Like what Trey Parker and Matt Stone did with the South Park Movie. But the director and the producers just left it the same and even sometimes toned down the contact such as swearing, violence, nudity and adult themes, sometimes shown a normal episode of the Simpson's. OK you see Bart's penis and Otto smoking from a bong. But remember in a early episode you see Homer smoking pot in his bedroom to make himself better.The Animation of the movie is different too, its got 3D back rounds with normal 2D characters in center but overall the Animation is great. Even the normal characters have changed for the movie, Homer is is a selfish pig that doesn't care for his family, Bart turns to Ned Flanders as a father figure, Lisa falls in love with a Irish boy, Marge overreacts, Ralph turns gay are just of the some that change for the movie.I'm not totally giving this movie the flop but it should have been more then the TV show and something different but it seems the produces and director run out of idea's very quick, even the movie's running time is short only running for 85 minutes. It seems they waited too long for a movie since they show has aired for more then 16 years. They should had made this 10 years ago when they still had idea's. Still go and see this movie but don't expect anything different.",7,2,5,28 July 2007
