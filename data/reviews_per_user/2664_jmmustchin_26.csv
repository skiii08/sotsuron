The Sound of Music," Never thought I would say this
","When I first saw The Sound of Music as a kid, I loved it. Then I watched a documentary about Marie Von Trapp's real life, and realised that the movie was nothing like reality. My opinion of the film dropped considerably. Then, a month or two ago, I sat down and watched the movie without prejudice, without comparing it to real life, just considering it purely as a movie.I love it! It may not be close to real life, but it's quite enjoyable. Julie Andrews - a year after her breakthrough it Mary Poppins - stars as Marie, a nun who doesn't fit in at the convent, and who is assigned as a governess for 7 children - who don't want a governess. The children and Marie bond, and romance blossoms between Marie and the children's hard father, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). However, the Nazis are on the rise.It's quite fun to watch, with lots of fun songs, and a nice story. I now quite enjoy it.",9,2,2,29 November 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of my favourite movies!
","Frankly one of the best movies ever made! The plot, the excitement, the acting - it's all brilliant! Definitely the best Lucas film ever made, and definitely one of Spielberg's best. It leaves the viewer feeling quite exhilarated and exhausted - in a good way.
Indiana Jones - in his first (chronologically second) movie adventure - must jump into action to save the Ark of the Covenant from being found and taken by the Nazis, who want to use it for world domination.
The film is not historically accurate, but quite fun nonetheless.",10,2,2,15 April 2018
Zootopia," Fun comedy thriller
","Zootopia is both a comedy and a thriller - and a children's animated film. For a children's film, it deals with surprisingly serious topics, as it doubles as a social parody (and NO, it ISN'T left-wing - THANKFULLY). Judy Hopps is a cute bunny (who'll get annoyed if you call her that) who manages to secure her dream job of becoming a police officer in the city of Zootopia - although she faces the challenge of a boss who holds old prejudices and simply isn't interested in a bunny as a cop. However, Judy soon finds herself on a missing mammal case with a very reluctant (and just a shade on the wrong side of the law) fox which has huge implications.The animation in this film is terrific - among the best I've ever seen (alongside Finding Dory). The voice acting is good. Ginnifer Goodwin is literally PERFECT as the voice of Judy. No-one else could have done it half as good. Jason Bateman is similarly perfect as the fox, Nick Wilde. I was unsure initially about the voices of a couple less important (but still important) characters, but now I can't imagine them with another voice. The movie is both exciting and funny and mysterious. In short, great!",10,3,4,5 December 2018
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Possibly the greatest fantasy movie every made!
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an adaption of C.S. Lewis' novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The film is set in World War II. During the German raids of London, four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Luce Pevensie) are sent into the countryside to Professor Kirke, to be taken care of during the Blitz.
While there, they discover a magical wardrobe that transports them into another world - the world of Narnia! It is an enchanted word with fauns, dwarfs, talking beasts, and the like. However, it is held under the evil spell of Queen Jadis, otherwise known as the White Witch, who as put Narnia under an eternal winter - with no Christmas!
The four children must team up with the great lion Aslan to defeat the Witch and restore peace to Narnia.
The film is brilliantly executed with a good plot that flows smoothly and excellent actors - and voice actors. Liam Neeson provides a fantastic voice for Aslan, while Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch equally well. The actors for the four children - and all the other characters - do their jobs very well. 
The films special effects are brilliant and add quite a bit to the movie. The film is quite enjoyable to watch, and easily beats most - if not all - other fantasy movies I have seen. One of my favourite movies.",10,0,0,21 May 2018
Finding Nemo," Pretty good
","I used to find this movie boring as a kid - but as I said in my review of Toy Story, that's because as a kid I had an unusually low bar for boredom.Nemo is a young clownfish who lost his mother at a young age - and as a result his father, Marlin, is overprotective. Nemo feels rebellious, and tries to disobey and defy his father. The result: he's caught by a Sydney dentist! Marlin - who's afraid of the ocean - must try to find and save his son. On the way, he meets a forgetful blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who helps him and becomes a major character (and got her own sequel).Good story, great animation, and good voice cast. A winner.",8,0,0,9 November 2018
The Jungle Book," Funny Disney musical
","The Jungle Book is loosely based - I should say INSPIRED - by Rudyard Kipling's book, which I read as a kid. It tells the (fictitious) story of Mowgli, a 'mancub' who is raised in the jungle. When the ferocious and feared tiger Shere Khan threatens Mowgli's life, the wolf pack that raised Mowgli send him away to the man village. Of course, Mowgli doesn't want to return to his own kind.The movie is quite funny. Plenty of great laughs. I don't mind the storyline or the animation. And I quite enjoy the movie's songs. A great kids movie - that adults should enjoy.",10,1,1,14 November 2018
Armageddon," A fun adventure
","In 65 million BC, an asteroid is hurtling towards earth, making a devastating impact. Charlton Heston narrates: 'This is the earth at the time the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet. A piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that. It struck with the force of 10,000 nuclear weapons. A million tons of dirt and rock hurtles into the atmosphere, creating a suffocating blanket of ash and dust the sun was powerless to penetrate for 1000 years. It happened before. It will happen again. It's only a matter of when.'In the present, the shuttle Atlantis is destroyed in space by a meteor shower. Not knowing what's heading their way, the US upgrades to DEFCON 3. The meteors bombard the north Atlantic, with massive destruction shown in New York. At the same time, an amateur astronomer spots a mysterious anomaly in space.NASA Director Dan Truman, on speaking with the amateur, moves the Hubble Telescope, and spots a Texas-sized asteroid on a direct collision course with earth. It'll hit in 18 days. 'It doesn't matter where it hits. Nothing will survive - not even bacteria.'Thus begins 1998's most successful film, ARMAGEDDON. As you can guess from it's opening, it's a highly fun action-disaster film. True, it's science fiction, and it's not scientifically accurate - but who cares? It's highly fun to watch. There are some awkward scenes in the first half of the film - but the second half more than makes up for it. The action is awesome, the premise is scary (especially when one considers that in real life, WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT), and the special effects are AWESOME!An awesome movie.",8,1,1,19 December 2018
Die Hard 2," It's fun
","Die Hard 2 is not as good as the original Die Hard (to be expected), but it's exciting & loads of fun. The first time I watched it, I liked it, but was slightly mixed. Then I watched it a second time, and found I was fully on board, loving every single second of it (well, except for one unnecessarily violent moment in the latter half of the movie, but it certainly does NOT affect the movie's quality). A year after the first film, John McClane must leap into action AGAIN to deal with terrorists trying to prevent a South American drug lord. As mentioned, it's heaps of fun. There's lots of great action, as well as a great sense of humour. There are several humorous references to McClane going through a similar experience yet AGAIN, second Christmas in a row. And the story is pretty good - and kinda scary, like the original.And like the first, it's quite violent (and full of swearing - albeit not as much as the first), and isn't suitable for children. With the exception of a throat-slitting scene, I wasn't bothered by it.A fun & thoroughly entertaining joy ride.",10,1,1,9 February 2019
Independence Day," Awesome disaster-action movie
","Independence Day is (in my opinion) one of the two greatest disaster movies ever made, alongside Deep Impact. The movie begins on July 2nd, when an enormous alien space craft is seen passing by the moon. The US military soon detect the anomaly. A series of city-sized craft are released from the mothership, and take up position over many of the world's major cities. Electronics expert David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) decodes an alien signal indicating they are going to attack. He manages to warn President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and flee Washington - just barely escaping the city's destruction. The heat rays in the alien craft obliterate all of the major cities that had craft parked over them - and almost all of their inhabitants. They then begin moving from city to city, intending to exterminate humanity. The survivors must regroup, band together and fight back against the alien invaders.The movie is very exciting, with brilliant tension (especially in the half hour before the cities' destruction - man, is that a breath-holder!). The acting is splendid - especially from Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. The movie is also brilliantly plotted. It has a considerable air of mystery about it, which adds to the delightful experience that watching it is.But the special effects in this movie are INCREDIBLE. Quite honestly, this movie contains among the best - and certainly most real-looking - effects I've ever seen (the only movies I've seen with more real-looking effects being the first two Jurassic Parks). They're so real, they're almost scary.And, by the way, I highly recommend viewing the Extended Version. It's better - and makes more sense.",10,1,2,18 November 2018
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Light entertainment
","I watched this the day after the first Jurassic Park (which I consider one of the greatest films ever made). I found the film rather disappointing. It simply doesn't live up to the original.Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and other characters travel to an island nearby to Nublar, where the cloned dinosaurs were raised. They are on a mission for John Hammond, whose nephew wants to recreate Jurassic Park - in San Diego! The nephew has also sent a team to the island - to hunt a T-Rex for the park.Despite what that may have sounded like, the plot is actually rather thin. Much of the movie is the people being chased on the island - and eaten. More than halfway through the movie, I was still waiting for it to entertain me.This film is very violent - much more so than the original. It's also scarier. The movie isn't nearly as good as the original.That said, it isn't a total loss. I liked the twin climaxes - which were terrifyingly good (literally), and redeemed the film a little. But the biggest point in the film's favour is the special effects - which are AT LEAST as good as the original! The dinos - particularly the T-Rexes - are frighteningly real.If you're looking for a good scare, this is it.",8,5,9,27 October 2018
Back to the Future Part III," My fav
","I know the conventional wisdom is that Back to the Future Part III is the weakest film in the trilogy. And while it's certainly the least original - it's a Western remake of the original Back to the Future - but it's my personal favourite. Beginning exactly where Back to the Future Part II left off (you need to watch these movies in chronological order or you WON'T get them). Marty (with the 1955 Doc Brown's help) heads back to 1885 to save Doc, who is about to be murdered by Biff Tannen's great-grandfather, Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. But once he arrives in 1885, the DeLorean was damaged by an Indian arrow - leaking all the fuel (irreplaceable) and rendering the car out of service for the next several decades. Doc and Marty must try and find a way to get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour - while at the same time staying out of Tannen's hair. But things are further complicated when Doc falls in love with a teacher.Again, the movie's a remake of the original. But it's a fun remake, but all the charm, humour, and climatic almost-doesn't-make-it tension that fans have come to expect. What effects are used are quite good. It also provides a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy (and yes, it's a definite conclusion). A great movie.",10,1,1,9 January 2019
A Bug's Life," Fun Pixar comedy
","A Bug's Life was Pixar's second film, and while it was a commercial and critical success, it's one of their lesser-known films. A pity - because it's pretty darn good! It's about a colony of ants, who send one of their hated members (an inventor who ALWAYS messed up WITHOUT FAIL) on a dope mission to find warrior bugs to protect them from the grasshoppers who were their de facto overlords. He finds what he thinks are warrior bugs - but which are actually circus bugs - and brings them back to the nest.The animation probably doesn't look much compared to, say, Inside Out, but it's still pretty good. The story's excellent - an oppressed people rising up against their oppressors. But, it's also a character story, with great character development all round.It's good.",10,2,2,11 January 2019
Toy Story," Pixar's first hit
","This was Pixar's first feature film, and the first feature-length film to be made in CGI. It was an enormous hit - and for good reason. It's a pretty good movie, with a good storyline, believable characters, great cast, and great animation. Enjoy it.",10,0,0,3 November 2018
Toy Story 2," A good sequel
","Many view Toy Story 2 as better than the original. I'm honestly not sure which is better, but regardless, both are quite good (as is the 3rd one). In this one, Woody is kidnapped by a toy dealer, who wants to sell him. The toys must go to Woody's rescue.As usual, it's quite funny. There's some interesting (and humorous) Star Wars allusions. The animation is quite good, and the voice cast adequate.",10,3,4,4 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Delightful magical adventure
","The first instalment in the Harry Potter series is fun, charming, and magical. The plot moves along smoothly with a few genuinely surprising twists and turns. The actors are generally quite good. The special effects, while occasionally showing their age, are fantastic. The thing that immediately drew me in, though, was the music score. John Williams really outdid himself here - it gives a mysterious, magical, and charming feel to it. I also really liked the care and attention to detail that went into this movie - the costumes, all the details about Hogwarts, etc. A truly fantastic fantasy film.",10,0,0,12 September 2019
Die Hard," Thrilling action ride
","Despite being released 30 and a half years ago, I never saw Die Hard until last night. I have zero regrets whatsoever about watching it, and got quite a kick observing how movies like White House Down and Skyscraper borrow from it. I WON'T touch on the stupid argument over whether or not Die Hard is a Christmas movie.It's Christmas Eve. NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) arrives in LA to see his estranged wife and kids. As he waits for the Christmas party at his wife's workplace to finish, a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) quickly take over the building and take the guests as hostages. McClane, however, manages to evade the crims without them realising he exists. The crooks are after the business owner's bonds - worth quite a lot of money - and murder him after he refuses to give them the codes to the vault. McClane must try and alert the authorities and at the same time stay one step ahead of the crooks - and kill/defeat them.It's a highly fun and exciting action movie. Be warned that it's rather violent with a LOT of swearing (especially the F word) & is NOT suitable for (pre-teen) children. Some might consider the early parts of the movie scary. I love the tension and even the occasional humour in the movie. As mentioned, it was highly amusing spotting where Roland Emmerich and Rawson Marshal Thurber mimicked Die Hard.",10,0,0,7 January 2019
The Lion King," My favourite Disney animation
","This is my favourite of Disney's 2D animated movies (with 101 Dalmatians and Treasure Planet coming up a close second). It concerns a young lion prince Simba, whose father Mufasa is the King of Pride Rock. Mufasa's younger brother Scar - who had been the heir, before Simba's birth - is jealous of his nephew. Scar - who is in a secret alliance with the hyenas - arranges for Mufasa's death, which he fools Simba into thinking is his fault. Simba - on Scar's urging - runs away. He meets a meerkat named Timon and his wart hog buddy Pumba, who teach him to put his past behind him. But when he is confronted about the harsh life under Scar, can he face his past and claim his rightful throne?The movie is brilliantly (and beautifully) scripted and beautifully drawn. I also quite like the songs (with Scar's song being my all-time favourite movie song). Scar is also one of the best villains to ever hit the screen - pure evil, pure hateable, and very entertaining to watch. The only part I didn't like was the slight religious element (although that played quite well into the movie at times - in fact, one or two moments with it are quite beautiful). It is a true masterpiece of a movie.",10,0,0,12 November 2018
Finding Dory," A good sequel
","Finding Dory is an excellent followup to Finding Nemo. In the film, some of Dory's childhood memories start to resurface, and she decides to try and find her parents. Although this proves more difficult than she thought.The movie is first and foremost a comedy, and as such is actually quite funny. But it is also a drama, and contains a surprising amount of emotion (I had trouble not crying at some scenes). The voice cast is great as usual.It also contains the best CGI I have ever seen in a CGI movie. (And for those concerned: there's no lesbian couple.)",9,0,1,10 November 2018
Back to the Future Part II," How can the weakest film in the series be SO DAMN PERFECT?!
","As the title suggests, Back to the Future Part II is the second installment in the Back to the Future trilogy. It picks up immediately where the original Back to the Future left off - Marty, Doc and Jennifer going into the future (2015 - our past LOL) to 'fix' Marty and Jennifer's kids futures. However, the old Bill Tannen quietly nabs the DeLorean and drastically alters the past, making the present dystopian. Doc and Marty (Jennifer is passed out) must try to work out where Biff altered the timeline, and prevent the altering.This film is the darkest of the trilogy, and the weakest. But it's the most original of the BTTF sequels, and everything in it - even the scenes I used to dislike - fits and works perfectly. It's the most complex movie in the series. A perfectly done movie.",10,0,1,3 January 2019
Toy Story 3," The best one yet
","The first two Toy Story movies were pretty good (even if I thought them boring as a kid - but that's because I had a very low bar for boredom at the time). But the 3rd one is even better! It's also darker and more dystopian, but that's part of what I like.The movie is set a number of years after the first two. Andy is a teenager, about to go to college. He hasn't played with his toys in years - and they're depressed. Andy packs away all his toys to be put in the attic (apart from Woody, whom he intends to take to college). However, the bag he puts them in just happens to be a trash bag - which he puts down for a few minutes to help his sister. Their mother comes along, assumes it's trash, and puts it on the curb - just as the rubbish truck is approaching!Well, the toys get out (just!), but are convinced that Andy deliberately threw them out. They stow away in the Mum's car with the toys she's donating to Sunnyside Daycare. Woody tries to talk them out of it - unsuccessfully. And since he doesn't get out of the boot in time, he winds up going to Sunnyside as well.(When they arrive there, there's a crude political joke in which Rex says it must be nice because there's a rainbow on the door. Thankfully, this is too subtle for most kids.)Well, everything seems nice and rosy, and it's run (well, when the humans aren't around) by Lots-O-Huggin' Bear (Lotso), who seems quite nice. Most of them stay, although Woody tries to leave (and winds up getting picked up by a little girl named Bonnie). The other toys quickly discover that life in Sunnyside isn't what it initially seems.The movie is brilliantly plotted, with great animation and the usual great cast. Again, it's darker than the others, and dystopian. But if you're not too bothered by that (my mother doesn't like darker films - but she likes this one), you'll thoroughly enjoy it. It's the best movie in the trilogy (or quadrilogy, as it's soon to be).",10,0,2,6 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," You can't help but love it!
","I've only seen the first half of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (or Star Wars as it was originally called, which my Mum still calls it), as the second half wasn't on YouTube at the time (drat!). But what I saw was more than enough to thrill and entertain me! It's a fun-to-watch sci-fi/fantasy movie. The special effects are incredible. In short, I was thoroughly enthralled!However, I do have one bone to pick with the movie: the New Age themes. Particularly when Obi-Wan Kenobi uses mind control (which I staunchly oppose - it's unjustifiable). Still, it's overall a fun and enjoyable science fiction adventure.",10,4,5,26 November 2018
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A good sequel
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is set two years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, and three years after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Indie (Harrison Ford) and his father, Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery), find themselves in a globe-trotting adventure to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis can get their hands on it.
The film is quite exciting and very funny. It had a much lighter tone and lower violence than the previous films. It's also funnier than the others.
The actors do a good job, especially Sean Connery. He provides such humour to both his role and the film. Many people criticise the Indie-Henry relationship in the film. I think it's the best damn relationship/interaction in the whole series!
The Last Crusade is in my opinion the equal of Raiders.",10,3,5,7 May 2018

Back to the Future," Awesome classic
","I originally saw Back to the Future on TV when I was young. Several years later, my brother bought the 30th Anniversary Trilogy box set. What a trip down Memory Lane!Back to the Future is a brilliant movie. Teenager Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) accidentally travels back in time in a car his friend Doc Brown had invented - shortly after Brown is murdered by Libyan terrorists. He meets the younger Doc and convinces him that he is a genuine time traveler. But while they figure out a way to send Marty back to the future, they realise that Marty accidentally interfered with his parents' first meeting - endangering his own existence. They must not only work on returning Marty back to 1985 (he went back to 1955), but they must get Marty's parents to fall in love.The movie's brilliantly scripted. It's very funny. The acting is good. And the effects (when used) are quite good. To quote one critic's praise, 'It wastes very little in the way of dialogue'. EVERYTHING that's said is put in there on purpose. Pay close attention throughout the film. It's hugely fun to watch. A true masterpiece.",10,1,1,22 December 2018
Jurassic Park," Epic adventure!
","I used to think that those who called Jurassic Park one of the greatest movies of all time were just being over the top. Now that I've actually seen it, I wholeheartedly agree with them! It's not 'the' greatest film (well, I don't think so yet, anyway), but it's certainly 'one' of them (alongside the likes of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark').In the movie, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park of cloned dinosaurs on the island of Nublar. Hammond brings in paleontologist Dr Allan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr Sattler (a female), Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer (first name Donald) to inspect it and approve it. After a tour (with very few dinosaurs showing up), they are very skeptical. (Except for Donald, of course, who's thinking about his check.) However, one of the island employees (first name Dennis) had been hired by a rival company to steal dino embryos. That night - as a hurricane's moving in - he shuts down the power and security systems (including the electric fences that kept the dinos in their enclosures), but notably leaves the extra security for the Raptors' pen on. The power was shut off just as the inspecting visitors were in front of the T-Rex pen in automated electric cars. The T-Rex and several other dinosaurs break loose, and the night (and next day) quickly turn into a fight for survival.The movie is quite exciting and actually kinda fun to watch. I enjoyed both the plot and the anti-cloning themes. The action is awesome, as is the acting. But one of the movie's most prominent features is the special effects, which are frighteningly real-looking (literally). I didn't find the movie very scary (apart from the opening scene - and how real (and scary) the T-Rex looks).Overall, a very good watch.",10,1,1,23 October 2018
The Martian," Epic sci-fi survival adventure
","My Grandma sent this movie up for Christmas 2 or 3 years ago. She had seen it, and said it was quite good. (I had seen it in the cinema fliers when it first came out, but hadn't thought it interesting.) After Grandma's recommendation, I was expecting it to be good.I was blown away! I had expected it to be good. But it was really, REALLY good! Greatly exceeded my expectations.The story is this: in 2035 (the year isn't mentioned in the movie - only the bonus features, and apparently the novel (which I haven't read)), during a manned mission to Mars, a massive and powerful sand storm forces the crew to evacuate the planet. Unfortunately, one of the astronauts, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) suffers an accident in the storm, and is (justifiably) presumed dead. They are forced to leave without him.However, Mark is not dead. He manages to make his way to the Hab that the crew had been staying in, where he fixed his wound (the only hard-to-watch scene in the movie). He must try and survive on a desert planet - and try and make contact with NASA. Meanwhile, by viewing satellite images of the Hab (showing equipment moved since the crew of the ship - the Ares - evacuated), realise he is still alive. They begin planning an attempt to save Watney, AND try to make contact with him.The movie's plot is brilliantly constructed and executed. Many condemned the film's light tone, but I actually quite enjoyed it. It's a refreshingly uplifting movie. If you want a horror movie, go watch 'Alien' or something.The acting in the film is great, as is the sense of humour. It's surprisingly genuinely funny. But the special effects are breathtaking. They're truly GREAT.Overall, The Martian is an extremely enjoyable and entertaining science fiction tale of survival that is VERY scientifically accurate (much more so than your average sci-fi). It's highly recommended.",10,0,1,8 October 2018
