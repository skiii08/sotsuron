First Man," Be prepared
","I watched the movie in IMAX which helped make the presentation very intense. This is the kind of movie that can feel suffocating and doesn't let up until the credits. Even though you knew how the movie would end, it still was very nerve wracking to see all the stuff these astronauts had to go through to accomplish the mission.The moon scenes in IMAX were spectacular and emotional because of how intense the build up to it was. At the very least all school children should be shown all the trials it took to get to the moon to inspire them to continue to push the space program farther.",8,1,2,14 October 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Great story, average execution
","The acting was inconsistent, almost corny. I'm not sure if that was intentional, but it didn't feel right considering the tone of the subject matter. Still worth watching.",6,2,5,14 May 2019
