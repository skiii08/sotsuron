First Man," A story of survival
","In First Man, Damien Chazelle creates yet another visual masterpiece. With breathtaking shots and sequences, and flawless musical and sound delivery, this picture is meticulously orchestrated to shake and amaze viewers.The movie narrates the story of the decade which changed Neil Armstrong's life, and led him to become the first man to walk on the moon.The narrative comes short of substance, with a clear lack of dedication to building a story, but that is a story we all already know and the movie manages to remain believable. Similarly relationships among characters clearly did not focus creative efforts, but the movie remains highly emotional with a striking psychological impact on the viewer.This is not a story about mankind's outstanding achievement. It is the story of the survival of a man haunted by loss, a survival that could only exist through the pursuit of the improbable, allowing him to reject pain and grief.This movie is not perfect, it is flawed, but in that mimes the imperfections of life and man. And that is a strong accomplishment.",8,0,1,21 October 2018
